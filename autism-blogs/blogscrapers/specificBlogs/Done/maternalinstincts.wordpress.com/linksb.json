I didn\u2019t really want to blog about this tonight; I was going to send an email to one person in particular but thought that it was unfair to put that burden on her shoulders.  I know she would willingly carry it, but it didn\u2019t seem fair to ask that of any one.  And maybe I really just need some Mama-lovin\u2019 from all my blogging buddies\u2026 Long story short, Nik hit his head pretty badly at school today and had a cluster of \u201cmild\u201d seizures pretty close together.  The seizure activity isn\u2019t that unusual \u2014he does have \u201cabsence\u201d seizures which are moderately well controlled by meds.  But the frequency and characteristics of the seizures this morning were different; usually he just stares and zones out.  A few times this morning, he went rigid and trembled a moment or two then zoned out for a bit.  I think it really upset one of the para\u2019s; she totally adores Nik and hats to see him go through this.  Me, too. We saw Nik\u2019s pediatrician this afternoon.  There\u2019s no sign of any fracture, thank God!  She told us to watch Nik closely over the weekend in case there are any changes in seizures or his behavior.  If so, it\u2019s the long trek to the hospital (an hour) for CT scans or whatever else they decide he may need.  I don\u2019t think it will come to that, but I am not going to say I am not worried. But you know, I am so sick and tired of worrying about my child every time I turn around; it\u2019s depressing and exhausting.  Frankly, it sucks.  Yeah, I know, \u201cGet over it, Niksmom; it comes with the territory.\u201d   Well, I wanna move sometimes, really!   (She whines, stamping her foot for emphasis!) I suppose the bright side to this is that school is looking much more closely at that one-on-one situation.  Maybe now we can get support from the staff and put some pressure on the administration to come through?  God that sounds so Pollyanna-ish but I really do need to stay focused on the positive or else I will just get sucked into this swirling vortex of bleakness and despair which hovers so closely over my heart on some days. So, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no cute Nik story to share tonight\u2026just Niksmom having her own personal anxiety-fest.  It\u2019s BYOB or whatever else you want.  Misery loves company sometimes.

I don\u2019t know what it is but  Nik  seems to go through these cycles of both genital (self)  stim  and playing with his  BM\u2019s . It is so bad that the poor kid couldn\u2019t fall asleep last night because we had him in a one-piece outfit and he couldn\u2019t get his hand down his diaper! He  had  already had a BM, so I finally changed him into two-piece  jammies  at 10p. He fell asleep within minutes\u2026hand inside his pants. NO KIDDING! Hey, I\u2019m all for the kid having a way of soothing himself to get to sleep. However, this starts out innocently enough then escalates to reports from the preschool teacher, \u201cMrs.  Niksmom ,  Nik  was doing his Chippendale\u2019s routine at nap time again today. Had his pants and diaper off and, well, was playing with himself. Gave the girls quite an education, if you know what I mean.\u201d Nope, NOT making that up\u2026that\u2019s almost a verbatim quote from the SAME TIME LAST YEAR! Now, with the  BM\u2019s , it\u2019s to the point that someone has to watch him like a hawk if he hasn\u2019t pooped before nap time;  Nik  is not terribly discriminating about where he is when he \u201cpaints.\u201d Home, school, doctor\u2019s office\u2026he doesn\u2019t care. I suppose the good thing (??) is that he usually keeps it to himself (all over his hands and tummy\u2026and sometimes his face. UGH!). Anyone had to deal with this? Were you able to successfully curtail the habit? Please, God, someone tell me how to make him stop!?

{"date": "June 13, 2007 ", "body": "\u2026to be a pain in the neck, a thorn in the side, a nudge, a pushy mama. Nik\u2019s back in summer school now and I\u2019ve been spending each morning this week right there with him to make sure he\u2019s getting the gross motor activity and sensory input he needs before meals. This is not a new concept; I\u2019ve been saying this to the teacher, to the para\u2019s, to the case manager, the PT, the SLP, the OT for months. MONTHS. Hell, even the janitor is tired of hearing it! Hello, people, did you think I was talkin\u2019 \u2018cause I like the sound of my own voice?? (Well, ok, sometimes I DO \u2014but that\u2019s beside the point entirely!) Well, amen! Hallelujah! Someone FINALLY AGREES! Let me back up a step here and put my excitement (and cynicism) in context for you. Nik has never been a real \u201ceater.\u201d He spent so many months with a feeding tube down his throat or up his nose, followed by the g-tube stuck into his tummy when he was one year old. Nik has gone through cycles of eating and making great progress then not eating at all \u2014for months at a time. We\u2019ve had just about every conceivable kind of evaluation, intervention \u2014 you name it. NO ONE has been able to de-bug this one. A year ago, when he started preschool, Nik ate nearly everything we offered him \u2014all pureed baby foods with little to no texture variation. We\u2019re talking roughly 70% of his total nutrition; we were gearing up for getting rid of the tube. When Nik started school, we told the staff what works to get him to eat \u2014we had done great with it. The attitude at the time was, \u201cLet\u2019s try it our way and see how he does.\u201d Well, here we are a year later and Nik is no longer eating. Nada. Zip. Zilch. We\u2019ve been working with a fabulous behavioral therapist, Dr. S., who\u2019s finally decided it is time to tell the school to either \u201cget on the bus or get run over \u2018cause we\u2019re moving on!\u201d She\u2019s going to prescribe each and every step of the program so we can get Nik back on track. We\u2019ve known for months that the problem has nothing to do with Nik\u2019s desire or hunger. The poor guy clearly communicates his desire to eat but when we sit down to do it \u2014he falls apart. Nik cannot focus long enough to take more than a few bites, tastes really, before he is just overwhelmed. Even the things that used to work no longer work. Not only have we known this but we\u2019ve shared it with everyone at school until we\u2019re blue in the face. My theory is that Nik ate well a year ago because he was getting the appropriate sensory and motor input for where he was at the time. Then, he didn\u2019t walk and hadn\u2019t discovered the joys of the mobile prone stander or climbing and cruising \u2014let alone sliding or swinging. He didn\u2019t need as much intensive input. Today, Nik is a kid in constant motion, in spite of not walking independently. Niksdad and I have noticed for along time that Nik does much better when he has lots of gross motor activity and deep sensory input \u2014and especially strong oral stimulation \u2014immediately prior to each meal. He also does better with minimal distractions; school is pretty much the antithesis to this! Unfortunately, Nik is also a child who requires perhaps much more consistency and structure than the \u201caverage\u201d or NT child. Why is it that we, the parents of such children, completely get it \u2014and it\u2019s no big deal to work with, yet the \u201ctrained professionals\u201d never seem to catch on until it slaps them in the face? So, back to summer school we go \u2014 The para we really liked, Ms. M., didn\u2019t get placed in the preschool for the summer (and boy is SHE bummed!) and there is a new (translation: totally green/inexperienced) para working with the preschoolers over the summer. That means that Nik\u2019s teacher, Ms. J. \u2014who is one of the few that really gets Nik, is working directly with him especially for meals. My husband always says, \u201cFor those who are ready to learn, Nik is a great teacher.\u201d GOD BLESS MS. J., SHE IS FINALLY READY TO LEARN! After putting up with this nudgy mother all morning yesterday, listening to my thoughts and suggestions (but having no way to implement them at the time), Ms. J. got on board the Nik-train with us! Woo Hoo! Today, as I sat and watched her working with Nik at breakfast, she acknowledged to me that yes, Nik does need far more input than he is getting. She told me she spent time yesterday with the OT to find some solutions to help Nik and is also going to be looking at how to restructure parts of his day so he focus better. (Mommy does her happy dance here!) This morning, I ran into Ms. D, the OT. She told me she was going to be recommending a brushing program and some specific sensory exercises and activities for Nik to do daily. She also told me she shares my opinion and frustration about the lack of a structured, formal oral motor program for Nik. Ms. D. also showed me a couple of things that she\u2019s tried with Nik that seem to be working. Yay!! Meanwhile, we have scheduled an independent feeding evaluation in two weeks. Yeah, another eval. This time, our focus is going to be on specific oral motor activities and exercises to be implemented at school. No more of each person trying \u201ca little bit of this, a little bit of that!\u201d No more assuming \u201che\u2019ll learn as he goes.\u201d Ain\u2019t happening here folks. Dr. S\u2019s not-so-secret objective in making Nik\u2019s feeding program so incredibly specific and regimented (not to mention far-reaching if Ms. J is looking at restructuring Nik\u2019s day!) is to show the school how much Nik clearly needs 1:1 support. I think the fact that Ms. J. is the one doing the 1:1 support right now will only bolster the argument further come IEP time. Like I said, God bless Ms. J.! Today I feel like we finally won a battle \u2014which never should have been fought in the first place. But we still have many more skirmishes to go.

{"date": "June 16, 2007 ", "body": "Yesterday, we took Nik to the beach. Our wedding anniversary is today and Niksdad has to work, so we made a special day of it. We slept in (hey, 6:45 IS SLEEPING IN in our house, trust me!!), had a leisurely breakfast then packed up the fifty million and one things we need every time we travel with Nik, and off we went. It didn\u2019t matter to us that it was cloudy and overcast or that it wouldn\u2019t be great swimming weather. Our plan was to take Nik to the beach for the second time in his life. The first, in 2005 when he was 18 months old and didn\u2019t even sit up, was not a rousing success. Nik hated the feel of the sand, the roar of the ocean, the glare of the sun on the beach. In fact, the pictures we have of that occasion \u2014the one and only vacation we\u2019ve ever taken with my family \u2014are funny in a sad little way. Nik making faces as Niksdad holds him \u2014feet flailing wildly, tears running down his soft cheeks. We decided it was time to try again; Nik\u2019s considerably older and has had so much greater exposure to the world at large now. He\u2019s made tremendous progress in overcoming some of his sensory aversions, too. He is still hesitant to touch grass though he likes to walk on it as long as he\u2019s wearing shoes \u2014but even that is improving. We thought, perhaps, this time the beach might enthrall him. Let me rephrase that; I HOPED the beach would enthrall him. I hoped it would touch some primeval part of him as it does me. I love the beach at any time of day, any time of year. The sounds of the ocean and the endlessness of the horizon call to me like few other things on this earth do. I longed to share that connection with my son. The outing began very well; we wandered the boardwalk with Nik in the stroller for a while as his pump delivered an early lunch. Nik was intensely interested in the sights and sounds around us and was content with our wanderings. After \u201cdining,\u201d we took Nik out of the stroller and he walked his little legs off as he held Daddy\u2019s hand. The looks of passers-by warmed my heart nearly as much as the sight of my very tall husband holding the hand of my very small son; in height they are like Laurel and Hardy \u2014so vastly different from one another yet so in sync at the same time. Clinging to Daddy\u2019s hand, Nik became my intrepid explorer. He tried tastes \u2014licks, really \u2014of a hot pretzel with mustard (too much salt and not enough mustard for his taste, apparently!) and of soft serve ice cream (which got only slightly better reviews). He sat on the boardwalk and examined the rough texture of the boards worn with the steps of the thousands of vacationers each summer. He even let us wander into the Funland arcade! Niksdad and I were ready to leave the moment Nik showed any signs of distress. Nope, not my fearless boy. As we stood watching the carousel, Niksdad and I debating the merits of trying it with Nik, Nik decided he\u2019d had quite enough of the noise and lights, thank you very much. But instead of throwing himself on the floor and having a hysterical breakdown, Nik simply turned and dragged Daddy away from the offending environment. Just toddled right on out to the sun drenched boardwalk humming and babbling the whole while. Niksdad and I looked at each other \u2014eyebrows raised, trying not to laugh out loud \u2014and smiled in silent communication, \u201cDid what I think just happened happen?\u201d Yup. Our little non-verbal wunderkind made himself crystal clear and without a fuss. Wow, I could have gone home then and called it a great day! The time finally came to see how Nik would do on the beach. We took off his orthotics and replaced his shoes with his neon blue and yellow \u201creef runners.\u201d Before I could say a word or sneak a kiss, Nik propelled his dad forward onto the sandy dune trail. So much for sharing the moment. I watched, camera at the ready, with a lump in my throat. Was it possible that my little miracle boy was ready to embrace the beach and all its glories? He cried and fussed when Niksdad made him turn around and walk back to me. Surely that was a good sign, right? An indication that he wanted more? Since the beach was so crowded and we couldn\u2019t take Nik\u2019s large stroller on the sand, we piled in the car and headed slightly north to the state park. We knew we could park right by the beach walk and would be able to leave a lot of stuff in the car. So off we went with eager anticipation. Perhaps it was the advancing hour of the afternoon, the fact that Nik hadn\u2019t napped and, possibly, needed to have a BM. Whatever the cause, Nik was not thrilled with our plans. He had his own agenda which, clearly, did not involve any more time on uneven sandy surfaces that had nothing for him to hold onto to cruise. We finally got Nik onto the beach and set up the portable play yard \u2014in case Nik really couldn\u2019t handle the sand. Niksdad and I kicked off our shoes and made ready for our grand adventure to the water\u2019s edge with Nik. Picture, if you will, my fierce, fearless child trying to walk on the sand without actually letting his feet touch the surface. Niksdad carried him to the firmer, slightly wet sand closer to the water; Nik did ok there. Maybe it was the unevenness of the drier sand which upset him? So there we were, a glorious \u201cNik sandwich\u201d connected by hands, standing just beyond the reach of the foamy waves crashing on the shore. Nik was doing well standing on the wet sand.  I got all misty eyed and envisioned Nik frolicking in the ocean one day, just like  Charlie . Had my child connected with the beach as I had hoped he would? A split second later, a wave washed up on the shore submerging our feet under its icy foam. As I felt the back-current shifting the sand beneath our feet, Nik let out a howl of distress. \u201cMamamamamamama!\u201d He turned and flung himself against my legs and tried to climb up by standing on my feet as he pulled himself up on my shorts. I looked down at my son\u2019s panic-stricken face as I scooped him up and held him tight. My heart ached. I felt my elation crumble and my rose-colored glasses slip off the bridge of my nose to reveal glaring expectations I hadn\u2019t even known I harbored. I couldn\u2019t fathom that my boy would not love the sand, the surf, the cry of the gulls every bit as much as I have for my entire life. As we left the beach, I felt deflated. My enjoyment at what had been a pretty wonderful day evaporated quicker than the tears I had not let myself shed. Niksdad, bless his heart, didn\u2019t say a word as we drove. After a while, he said very quietly, \u201cIt really WAS a good day overall.\u201d I knew he was right and I let the tears come as I struggled to explain to him my realization about the unbidden expectations. He just listened and said, \u201cI know, honey. I know.\u201d So, we came home and had a quiet evening; Nik was sound asleep by 6:00 p.m. \u2014worn out by all the salt air and sunshine. As we sat on the sofa with our after dinner coffee, Niksdad and I talked about the day; it really helped me remember that the glass is half full NOT half empty! \n \n More and more, Nik is walking with less support and maintaining his balance much better. \n He\u2019s beginning to communicate his needs and desires more clearly by leading us to where he wants to go or what he wants to play with.  \n He\u2019s getting better about cooperating with specific routines such as diaper/clothing changes and getting in his chair for meals. He\u2019s even indicated hunger by taking my hand and walking me over to his chair a good 30 minutes before I was planning to offer him dinner!  \n He\u2019s exploring new textures lately. This weekend, Nik actually walked on the sand w/Daddy as he wore his wave-runner shoes, and today he SAT on the grass and touched it. (A week ago he would have freaked out!)  \n He\u2019s learning to handle some of his sensory overload better every once in a while. (Like the arcade at the beach!)  \n Nik\u2019s learning to suck and is finally able to drink from his sippy cup with the valve IN.  \n He\u2019s responding well to the sensory input around meal times and has begun eating more. Not a lot, but more.  \n He\u2019s making clear choices now when offered two toys to play with. He follows simple instructions and understands things like \u201cTurn the toy OFF.\u201d \n Nik wants to play with mommy & Daddy every once in a while. \n \n So, in the scheme of things, will I die if my son never likes the beach? No. Well, maybe just a little\u2026but I\u2019ll get over it.

{"date": "June 24, 2007 ", "body": "Around the corner I have a friend, In this great city that has no end; Yet days go by, and weeks rush on, And before I know it a year is gone, And I never see my old friend\u2019s face, For life is a swift and terrible race. He knows I like him just as well As in the days when I rang his bell And he rang mine. We were younger then, And now we are busy, tired men: Tired with playing a foolish game, Tired with trying to make a name. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d I say, \u201cI will call on Jim, Just to show I am thinking of him.\u201d But tomorrow comes \u2013 and tomorrow goes, And the distance between us grows and grows. Around the corner! \u2013 yet miles away . . \u201cHere\u2019s the telegram, Sir. . . \u2018Jim died today\u2019.\u201d And that\u2019s what we get, and deserve in the end: Around the corner, a vanished friend. \u2013 by Charles Hanson Towne I am brought to mind of a recent  post  by Her Bad Mother about the loss of a friendship . While I have not lost friends because of my blogging (hell, most don\u2019t even know I do it!), I have allowed our relationships to wither and evaporate , caught up in the frenzy of this \u201cswift and terrible race.\u201d I am incredibly grateful then to have some friends who don\u2019t write me off if they haven\u2019t heard from me in a year (or more, I am embarrassed to confess). One in particular is on my mind today \u2014my dear, dear friend Calvin (not her real name). Our lives have diverged, like those paths in Robert Frost\u2019s snowy woods. Not out of choice exactly \u2014though one could certainly argue that the choices one makes inevitably lead to one\u2019s circumstance. Rather, in an odd way, because of our respect for one another\u2019s circumstances. I know, it sounds silly, right? But hear me out. How wonderful is the friend who, knowing you are going through your own struggles \u2014mine being the raising of a medically fragile child with significant developmental challenges and all that it encompasses \u2014chooses not to burden her friend with her own brand of hell \u2014which, being mindful of respecting her privacy, I can only say is no less awful just very, very different from mine. Our paths have diverged so greatly that we neither have anything to offer the other in the way of meaningful or constructive support. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t share a rich history and a deep and abiding love for one another. We do. Our history is long and complex, filled with often turbulent times (both individually and jointly), and being there for one another when the chips were down. Why then, one might ask, does it not bother me that she didn\u2019t call me with her struggles and lean on me? Perhaps for fear I would bend then break under the combined weight of our woes? Maybe. I like to think, though \u2014because Calvin has always been very savvy \u2014that she realizes that one cannot be all things to all people and that you don\u2019t have to share everything to be a friend. That, sometimes, when the history is as full and varied as ours is \u2014we met shortly out of college, lived together in two cities, have encouraged each other in our professional and artistic endeavors, have literally nursed one another through times of extreme illness, depression, anxiety and more, and have been participants in each other\u2019s life for a couple of decades \u2014much like a marriage, the trust and love is there and you let it carry you through.   Though we don\u2019t see each other or talk as often as we once did, the connection is still there, still solid.  Last night I received an email from another old friend, P. We recently reconnected with one another after I moved back to my hometown \u2014having left nearly 25 years ago. We have both changed a great deal but felt the tug of our grade school friendship. I didn\u2019t have too many connections here and was grateful for rekindling that connection. P has gone through some tough times, including the loss of her mother in recent years, and has turned to her religion for strength and guidance. My relationship with P could be characterized as acquaintances rather than friends. We run into one another on occasion and we email back and forth. I\u2019ve told her all about my beautiful little boy and the road we are traveling. I\u2019ve been looking forward to the time I could take Nik to meet \u201cMiss P.\u201d Not anymore. Last night, I received the rudest, most offensive email I could have possibly gotten in my life. P likes to forward all sorts of inspirational stories and cute jokes.

{"date": "March 4, 2009 ", "body": "\n GPS Constellation \n I\u2019d like to be able to report that things have miraculously turned around and that Nik is sleeping through the night. Alas, I made a promise to myself not to stretch the truth that far. Sleeping through the night seems to have become a distant memory for Nik and me; each night he drifts off to sleep fairly peacefully and each night  he wakes   screaming in pain  or distress in the early morning hours. Sometimes it happens more than once a night; sometimes he is awake for just a few minutes and others he is awake for hours. The only commonality we can find, so far, is that there seems to be a  pain  trigger. We still don\u2019t know if the pain is the result of Nik\u2019s very different intestinal anatomy \u2014the combination of his congenital malrotation and it\u2019s surgical repair \u2014in the sense of the layout altering the functioning of his bowels, or if the functioning of his bowels is being affected by external forces such as diet, stress, infection, disease, etc. The net result is the same: Nik\u2019s bowels have stopped functioning normally and now need assistance to keep moving. If that were the only issue, I think we could deal with that. However, whatever is at work causes him such discomfort that he now wakes screaming. The pain seems to trigger an adrenaline response \u2014you know,  \u201cfight or flight\u201d\u2014  which, in turn, actually slows the intestines further. When the body is in that state of arousal, blood flow is diverted to more critical functions than digestion. I can\u2019t prove it but I wonder if Nik\u2019s constant state of \u201cfight\u201d over the past few years has contributed to the development of the  paralytic ileus  which recently landed him  in the hospital . Which leads me to another pondering: Is there a reason why Nik produces so much adrenaline? Is there an  endocrine dysfunction  (that is one area that\u2019s never been checked out)? Could  allergies  be causing this response? No matter what the cause is, Niksdad and I need to find some way to help Nik get it under control. If we don\u2019t, the potential exists that he could do more serious harm to himself when he\u2019s in the midst of these \u201cpanic\u201d episodes. Since we came home from the hospital, Nik\u2019s ability to cope with the  slightest  of changes has been practically nonexistent. His knee-jerk response to anything frustrating, painful, unexpected, or upsetting is to revert to  punching himself in the face as hard as he can  or kicking himself in the shins. You\u2019d be amazed at the marks he\u2019s left on himself. I won\u2019t post pictures because that would be disrespectful of Nik. But I can tell you that the bruises and marks are so bad that both my husband and I have  serious  fears that someone will see us out in public with Nik and call the police because they think we are abusing him. I have to tell myself that this is a temporary situation. That Nik\u2019s reserves were so badly depleted by the physical toll of his hospitalization and by the energy it took for him to stay present during that entire ordeal. And he really did stay present. I witnessed some serious behavioral regressions during the week in the hospital \u2014not jus the SIB\u2019s but the need to bite and mouth things in ways he hasn\u2019t in a long time, the need for specific toys or a specific video to play over and over. He even reverted to chewing on my watch for comfort and now refuses his chewy tube \u2014until recently his favored chewing item. Nik got himself so worked up in the hospital that he could not fall asleep unless I was actually lying in bed with him. Once he fell asleep, I would delicately extract myself and try to catch up on emails or simply walk around a bit to stretch my legs. Inevitably, he would wake in the night and get hysterical unless my body was right next to his. That struck me as the most notable behavioral anomaly; since he came home from the hospital at the age of seven months, Nik has never slept anywhere except in his own room in his own crib. The only time he\u2019s ever slept on or with me was when he was still an infant and would fall asleep after a bottle or a tube feeding. That, to me, was a sign of how stressed Nik was. Since we\u2019ve been home, Nik\u2019s readjusted a bit to his old sleep habits. The first night he needed me to sit with him \u2014one hand on his head, the other on his back since I couldn\u2019t fit in his crib\u2014 while he mouthed my watch until he fell asleep. Then, it was just the hand on the head and the watch. Then, the watch alone. The past two nights, he\u2019s been able to go to sleep fairly easily without my presence and without my watch. He\u2019ll take it at first, mouth it once then he gives it back to me. I know that the more we return to his normal routine the easier his days \u2014and nights, I hope \u2014will become. The transition is just as difficult for us as it is for him. And yet, through all of the behavior regression and the stress, through all the turmoil and disruption to his routine,  Nik has continued to make progress in other areas . While we were in the hospital, Nik learned how to sign  \u201cYes\u201d and understands how to use it. That alone has been a lengthy journey for us. Now, Nik can answer with a sign when I ask  \u201cDo you have an owie in your head/tummy/wherever?\u201d It has opened up a whole new realm of communication for us and may be able to help us learn more about what Nik feels and sees and hears \u2014 literally . I\u2019ll be curious to see if we can use this new communication skill when we see the eye doctor on Thursday; we may actually be able to get a better sense of his visual acuity. And  eating . I guess his forced regimen of no food intake for the first few days in the hospital really made an imprint on Nik. We had already been cautious about what we let him have prior to going to the hospital; we knew something was brewing and didn\u2019t want to muddy the diagnostic waters at all. The result has been nothing short of amazing. Nik has begun to tolerate more textures and to feed himself bits of things like goldfish or graham crackers. He\u2019s mastered the art of eating with a fork or spoon almost by osmosis. And he now sits at the dining room table with us and demands exactly what we have on our plates \u2014on his own plate! Yesterday, for the first time ever, Nik even took a tentative bite out of a soft cookie during snack time at play group! I know this because I felt his teeth brushing against my fingertips as I held the cookie. I guess you could say that some things are pretty much  status quo  and others are barreling ahead. Is it any wonder then that I am constantly feeling that the foundation beneath my feet is unsteady? It seems, lately, I\u2019m not quite certain what to expect and the changeability is tiring. And yet, oddly enough, I remain highly optimistic that there  are  answers to be found, ground to be regained, and new frontiers to forge. I just wish I could remember where I put my map. ********************************************** For information about Geocaching, click  here.

Nik\u2019s been learning a couple of  new signs and some animal sounds  with much greater ease and speed. He\u2019s been working on dressing himself \u2014to a certain extent anyway; he\u2019s much better at the  undressing  part these days! He\u2019s making progress in allowing greater quantities and thicknesses of food to enter his mouth; I daresay he\u2019s actually doing it quite willingly. \n Communication in general is on the rise. Where Nik still won\u2019t actually point to the thing he wants \u2014and I tend to wonder how much of that is related to his cerebral palsy and to his ability to control the muscles of his hands in so fine a way just yet \u2014 he has begun to make very clear choices when they are offered. We\u2019ve progressed from Nik simply patting his chest to indicate  yes  or  please  if he\u2019s asked  \u201cWould you like Mary Poppins/Signing Time/Cracker/Apple\u201d  one at a time, Nik will now wait until he\u2019s been shown the two choices. Then he will indicate  please  while looking at the preferred choice. Lately, he\u2019s actually begun to reach for the preferred thing. He\u2019s also getting quite good at indicating  no  by gently pushing something away. \n He\u2019s getting much better at following simple instructions \u2014as good as any small child with a strong will can possibly be, anyway. He\u2019s especially grasping the concept of  gentle hands  and is greatly improving upon his ability to regulate his strength or pressure with his hands. I discovered this in the most delightful way just a few days ago. \n We were waiting to see the pediatrician on Tuesday; Nik was sitting on the exam table and I was standing in front of him. I leaned down on my elbows and Nik began to look into my eyes very intently. I was quite surprised; I don\u2019t recall him doing that since he was about a two years old! As he gazed into my eyes, he reached out with his fingertips and began touching my eyelashes, my cheeks, my hair. I only had to tell him  \u201cgentle hands\u201d  a couple of times as he explored. It was an intimate moment I\u2019m not likely to forget; I was nearly in tears when the doctor walked in! \n With each new decrease in his Lamictal \u2014once his body adjusts to the new sensations and signals \u2014Nik really seems to make new cognitive leaps. He\u2019s finally making headway recognizing colors and sorting things. He\u2019s much more conscious of who\u2019s around him when we are out and about; he\u2019s willing to try new physical activities such as playing with balls and swinging \u2014both things he really didn\u2019t care for in the past. He\u2019s also developing a bit of separation anxiety and is learning how to use his emotions and behaviors to manipulate people! \n Since  my trip to New York  a couple of weeks ago, Nik has been extremely adamant that I be the one to carry him up to bed or to put him in his crib; if Niksdad has carried him upstairs, Nik will dive toward me, wrapping his arms around my neck. As soon as he\u2019s in his crib, Nik\u2019s hands desperately reach for mine; he clings to me like a lifeline. Sometimes he will wrap his arms around my hand so it is pinned between his head and the mattress; on those nights I have little choice but to wait the few minutes it takes for him to pass out from sheer exhaustion. \n If I commit the egregious sin of removing my hand too soon Nik twitches and whines and begins to cry. I\u2019m such a sucker \u2014though I much prefer the term  soft touch  \u2014that I usually let him have his way. I know, I know. But we never got those early bonding experiences where he could nurse and drift to sleep in my arms; technology came between us for so long that I can\u2019t help but feel selfish.  \n When Nik wakes in the middle of the night \u2014thankfully, a waning occurrence with the exception of this latest ear infection and the first night or two after a decrease in his Lamictal \u2014it is pretty much the same routine as at bedtime; I have actually fallen asleep with my head on the side of the crib on a many occasions to avoid the histrionics which ensue if I don\u2019t. Yes, it would be simpler/better to let him cry it out. The challenge is that Nik is big enough and strong enough that he can not only hurt himself thrashing around in the crib \u2014and has \u2014 but he can also  break the slats if he kicks and pushes hard enough. With his latest ear infection, Nik has been  highly defensive  of his right ear. If I so much as wad up a tissue and come near him \u2014merely to blot the gunk running from his ear \u2014Nik falls apart completely. Ear drops? Forget it; it takes both Niksdad and me to hold Nik down to do the deed. The result is a sobbing, kicking, screaming, flailing child \u2014an utter joy to behold, yes \u2014who then collapses against me with his little chest heaving and the lower lip quivering. Did I mention this now happens when I approach him to wipe his nose or to change his diaper? Yes, he is  that  paranoid about his ear. So I decided to try an experiment yesterday. I simply  promised  Nik I wouldn\u2019t touch his ear and then I kept my promise. Every time I had to approach him to wipe his nose or wash his hands or face, I simply repeated the phrase  \u201cNo ear, I promise. Mommy won\u2019t touch your ear. I promise.\u201d  And I didn\u2019t touch his ear. By bedtime, he was less gun shy around tissues and baby wipes. A very good thing since those are my stock in trade around here! I promise.  Knock wood, I think it\u2019s actually working! It\u2019s a simple phrase to utter; people do it all the time \u2014then often don\u2019t honor it with their kids. I am making certain that Nik understands that I mean what I say. I have no clue at what age other kids catch on to the concept of promises but I can tell you this \u2014Nik gets it.  Completely. How do I know this? , you might ask. Well, in a stroke of genius \u2014inspired by exhausted desperation \u2014I simply tried it last night. Nik had woken just after midnight with a painful bout of cramps from his latest antibiotics. Once I helped him through it and was certain he was ready to drift back to sleep, I got up to leave his room. Major upset ensued; I had visions of another night waking up to find the imprint of his crib tent pressed into my cheek and a crick in my neck. As Nik started to wind up for the full-blown tantrum, I said very sternly  \u201cNo. STOP. It\u2019s bed time and you need to lie down and sleep.\u201d  Yeah, that worked about the way you might expect.  As Nik ratcheted up his fussing, I laid my hand gently on his cheek; that usually settles him instantly. Then, quietly, I said,  \u201cI promise I will be here when you wake. Mommy will be here in the morning. I promise, baby. I PROMISE.\u201d  Nik snuffled against my hand but didn\u2019t fuss when I removed it. I didn\u2019t hear from him again until morning. \n I give you my word.

Ten to twelve hours. \n \n Straight. \n Through. \n The.

(It turned out to be nothing they could identify and he\u2019s completely fine now.) I\u2019m trying so hard to wrap my brain around the words to convey the magnitude and scope of these changes; the words and changes are swirling so fast, I simply cannot make them make sense yet. \n I can tell you this; there is not a  single  area of development that has not been positively impacted by the discontinuation of  Nik\u2019s  seizure  meds . Motor skills are blossoming, his appetite is returning and his resistance to certain food textures is diminishing. Communication is increasing as he tries to couple simple sounds and gestures in meaningful combinations. His four year old attitude when he doesn\u2019t want to cooperate is crystal clear \u2014yet he complies anyway. Problem solving skills are increasing at an  alarming  rate; I see new hazards in my home each day that I didn\u2019t think he even noticed or could figure out how to reach. \n Nik\u2019s  therapists and I have marveled at how hard he pushes himself; how he challenges himself to not only master a skill but to push through his fears or his sensory issues. The things he could not tolerate at all in the past two years he now attempts consistently; each time he pushes just a little farther in spite of his own resistance. What used to cause him excruciating cognitive dissonance now merely seems to challenge him to try harder. \n My heart aches with the stretching it has done to accommodate my maternal pride, my hope, my ever increasing sense of ease; I can feel it oozing out all over people around me, too, as I comment on blogs or talk to friends and family. The love, the hope, the profound respect for my child and appreciation of his intellect and drive; it\u2019s all so much larger than I have allowed myself to embrace these past couple of years. \n I feel like we\u2019ve landed in Oz and everything has become technicolor.

{"date": "November 2, 2008 ", "body": "You\u2019ve probably been reading or hearing a bit about  NaBloPoMo  and  NaNoWriMo  and thought,  \u201cYeah, they sound really interesting but I\u2019m not really into writing all that much,\u201d  or \u201c I don\u2019t have it in me to write something every single day.\u201d  Well, that may or may not be true \u2014only you know yourself for sure.  \n However, these two campaigns have an element in common that even  non-writers  can benefit from. Both challenge the individual to dig down a little deeper and stretch a little farther than they think they are capable of stretching; the chosen method of challenge in these cases just so happens to be writing. If you\u2019re a writer that\u2019s a great thing; for the non-writers among us, fear not, there\u2019s  NaChYoMo  \u2014 National Challenge Yourself Month!  (Hey, it\u2019s  my  blog! I can make up whatever I want!)\n What if we each picked  one  thing that we struggle with or procrastinate about; something we simply don\u2019t make a high enough priority to do? What if we each made the commitment to  rise to the challenge ? What if we pushed our boundaries or stepped just outside our comfort zones? Think of the  changes  we could affect in our lives, the  accomplishments  we could boast of, or the  chores  that would finally get done and crossed off that to-do list! \n So, readers, I challenge you to join me in  NaChYoMo . Here\u2019s how it works: \n Choose  one  thing \u2014something difficult, something you\u2019ve been avoiding or ignoring \u2014that you want to accomplish this month and  make a public commitment  to do something each and every day in furtherance of that goal. It doesn\u2019t matter what the challenge is. For some of us it might be an onerous task; for others it might be making time to pamper yourself.  There are no rules except the ones you set for yourself.   \n Sounds easy, right? Betcha it\u2019s not.\n Are you up for it? Leave your goal in the comment section of this post \u2014or post a link to your own blog \u2014and tell us about what you want to accomplish and why it\u2019s a challenge. If you need any specific support to make it happen, let us know that too. Then, go for it! \n The rest is up to you to follow through or not. No one\u2019s going to ask you to write about it every day (unless you want to, then, well you might want to consider participating in NaBloPoMo, too!). No one\u2019s even going to check up on you unless you ask for that. But, I hope at the end of the month you\u2019ll check back and let us know how you did so we can applaud your efforts! ******************************************* \n The personal challenge I am going to tackle is to do something every single day in furtherance of  truly  cleaning and decluttering my house.  Truly . We\u2019ve lived here just over three and a half years and are still tripping over unpacked boxes and miscellaneous piles of crap in our loft. Our filing system consists of stacks of papers and items strategically placed in the dining room, the living room, our bedroom. Ironically, Nik\u2019s room is about the most organized in the house. If I\u2019m  brutally  honest, our house has become a manifestation of our collective exhaustion and mild depression. The chaos is slowly eating away at us both.\n We have had lots of excuses for not dealing with it once and for all. First, it was the fact that Nik was so sick for a while. Then, the not sleeping through the night for nearly two years. And let\u2019s not forget Niksdad\u2019s nursing school, or Nik\u2019s many appointments for feeding, speech, PT, OT. Certainly, those things take a lot of time and energy; so does living in a chaotic environment. And the chaos, besides being mentally and emotionally draining, does not support our longer term goals of a nice home, home schooling our son, entertaining friends, and generally \u201chaving a life.\u201d\n Not anymore. This month, I am going to tackle one room at a time and finally get my house back. In the process, I\u2019m willing to bet that I\u2019ll get a whole lot more. I may or may not write about it here on the blog but I\u2019ll share my progress with a few people; I tend to need the accountability to keep me motivated until the habit becomes ingrained. \n I hope you\u2019ll join me in my own version of the Na-blah-blah-Mo phenomenon.

I\u2019m  nearly  recovered from my sister\u2019s beautiful wedding; it was a very special time full of surprises like the arrival of cousins we haven\u2019t seen in more than ten years, and making new connections with family we thought was completely cut off from us. (It\u2019s a long story involving divorces and family conflicts which go back to a prior generation.)\n \n Anyway, things are moving along at quite a rapid clip in our daily life. Nik is doing  phenomenally  well and I promise to write about it soon. Niksdad is also doing well; he just got another \u201cA\u201d in his classes. I\u2019m quite proud of him; I truly think he may be up for  valedictorian  of his class at graduation in May 2009! \n Me? I\u2019m still recovering from the wedding. More accurately, from all the food and drink that have totally thrown my body into a state of distress. To make a long story short, I\u2019m not diabetic but I have some insulin resistance stemming from polycystic ovaries (PCOS). Every once in a while I con myself into thinking that I don\u2019t need to be careful about what I eat and drink. HA! \n I\u2019m trying to rid myself of the  evil sugar/refined carbs monster  which has taken over my brain and body and left me in a stupor. I suppose it doesn\u2019t help that Nik is teething now, getting molars, and has been waking at night in pain. Once the Advil kicks in and the pain is gone, he is wide awake and wants to play until all hours. Last night was 10:45 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. His sleep cycle is out of whack, mine is too and it just seems so hard to cobble together enough coherent thought just to make it through the day let alone try to write a blog post. I\u2019m getting back to my normal self bit by bit and resuming my workouts with my sister. That should all help\u2026I hope! \n Meanwhile, I leave you with this belated Wordless Wednesday image.

Doubly so when combined with the need to clean up after a sick kitty. \n My husband was smart enough to buy extra creamer and store it on the shelf in the garage. \n Swiss Miss and coffee (with creamer) can help turn the morning around. \n My son is remarkably resilient; after having a few bouts of screaming, face-punching pain in the middle of the night (sinus??), he\u2019s been in pretty good spirits all day.

{"date": "October 21, 2008 ", "body": "  Image courtesy of  SavoirFaireCookbook.com As the weather turns colder \u2014and the economic outlook declines along with those temps \u2014my thoughts turn to warm, hearty, nourishing food that I can make with ease and frugality. In a moment of inspiration the other day, I looked around my kitchen to see what ingredients I had on hand and came up with this recipe. It\u2019s super simple to make, doesn\u2019t take terribly long and can be adapted in any number of ways. Best of all, Nik loves it! So much that he actually grabbed a spoon and tried to feed it to himself the other night at dinner. And it\u2019s so easy to make I can make a big batch and freeze it in single serving containers for him! Ingredients: 1 small pie pumpkin (or any fleshy winter squash like Butternut) 4 sweet potatoes 1 1/2 cans (total 3 C) chicken  OR  vegetable broth (I used Swanson\u2019s low fat/low sodium) 1/2 C sour cream or plain yogurt 2 Tbs savory Ginger to taste \u2013 can be fresh, candied, or ground (I used candied ginger to give it just a tiny hint of sweetness, too) Salt/Pepper to taste 4-6 slices of bacon \u2014cooked and crumbled (approx. 1/2 total bits) Prepare the pumpkin by splitting in half, scoop out seeds and membrane. Peel and quarter sweet potatoes. Put both pumpkin & potatoes in slow cooker \u2014pumpkin halves face down. Add chicken broth, savory & ginger. Cook in slow cooker on HIGH for 2-3 hours until pumpkin and potatoes are soft enough to pierce or slightly mash with a fork. Remove pumpkin and scoop out flesh. Replace flesh in slow cooker. Puree mixture using either a hand blender, food processor, or immersion blender. Add sour cream; mix until thoroughly blended. Add bacon. Salt/Pepper to taste Cook for another 30 minutes on HIGH. This will allow flavors to infuse and some of the extra liquid to reduce. You may cook it longer if you want it to thicken some more or you can transfer it to a casserole dish and bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 350F. If you prefer your sweet potatoes thicker or slightly chunkier, use a bit less liquid (or thicken with potato flakes!) and mash instead of puree. ************************************************** The more I play around with it, the more I really like the versatility of this dish. It goes great as-is with chicken or pork as a side dish. As-is, it\u2019s very low-fat, low-sugar. However,you can play around with different seasoning combinations and it can become anything. Substitute dried cranberries for the bacon, or swap curry for the savory and you have a great compliment to lamb! You can change it up and sweeten things by adding brown sugar, cinnamon, and cranberries (or nuts, or marshmallows\u2026). You can spice it up with a southwest flair by adding chipotle in place of the savory and some green onion instead of bacon. You can thin it out with more broth and serve it as a creamy soup in sourdough bread bowls, too. ENJOY!

{"date": "October 20, 2008 ", "body": "Well, I\u2019m  finally  starting to catch up on some housekeeping items both IRL (in-real-life) and here on my blog. That post about Nik\u2019s continuing awesomeness is in the works and should be up soon. Meanwhile, here are some lovely awards I\u2019ve been given recently that I\u2019d like to pass along. ** First off, I am embarrassed to admit that  pixiemama  gave me  this thoughtful award ** a while back; I bookmarked it and then forgot to follow up. (Oops\u2026does that negate my qualification for the award??) Before anyone has a chance to speak up and tell me that it  does in fact disqualify me , I\u2019d like to pass it along to some other special and thoughtful women. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve received it or not; if they have, well, they doubly deserve it then! Joymama over at  Elvis Sightings  always manages to touch my heart in some way; She also, I think, shares some of my  glass half full  attitude about parenting and the world of special needs. Her daughters are a delight and I often find myself wishing they lived near enough to get to know in person. My dear cyber friends  Kyra  and  DramaMama  both share amazing insights in beautiful ways; they also find so many ways to express their love for friends and family and fearlessly share their passion for living life to the richest and fullest \u2014no matter how it might look in any given moment. Gretchen  is one of those bloggers who kind of flies under the radar but I always find myself either thinking or feeling deeply after reading her posts. She\u2019s another one of those women I wish lived closer so I could get to know her better. Pam , Rhett\u2019s mom, shares the ups and downs of life with her family and parenting children with and without special needs. They\u2019ve had a rough time over the past year or so but she nearly always manages to bring the focus back to the gifts and joys that her family brings. That always puts my heart back in the right place! The  second award  was recently given by the awesome Autistic Bitch From Hell, affectionately known as abfh. I was thrilled she thought of me because, well, I love her blog! She writes funny, snarky, always insightful posts about civil rights, neurodiversity, and life over at  Whose Planet Is It Anyway? I\u2019m supposed to pass it along to seven other blogs that I love but there are so many of \u2019em; it\u2019s too hard to choose! Let\u2019s see, there are some of my tried and true faves such as  Mom-NOS ,  Kristen ,  Jennifer ,  Vicki , and  Joeymom  (ooh, she already got this one, darn!). Then there are some blogs that I\u2019ve recently discovered or who don\u2019t necessarily shine their light out from under that ol\u2019 bushel\u2026 Christine  writes about life with her family which includes two adorable sons \u2014one with autism and one without. She\u2019s another homeschooling mama like me and I learn so much every time I read her posts. I love reading  Marla\u2019s blog  too. She writes about everything from life with her daughter, Maizie, and it\u2019s inherent challenges to birthday parties for hamsters (or are the guinea pigs, Marla??). In addition to the gorgeous pictures she takes and shares, Marla writes with such clarity and depth that I always go back to re-read things to make sure I haven\u2019t missed a smidge! So there you have seven to check out if you don\u2019t already know them! And, of course, for many, many more than seven fabulous blogs, pop on over to the  Autism Hub . You\u2019ll be glad you did. ** [This lovely award is created by Crystal @  Memoirs of a Mommy  in honor of Noah and the donor of his sweet little heart who ENCOURAGES us to SHARE THE LOVE ! Thanks Crystal! (Click on  Memoirs of a Mommy  to learn and read this special love story!) The rules for this award are to pass it along to some people whose blogs you love. They make you laugh, smile, leave encouraging comments on your blog. You would like to share some love with them because they have uplifted, inspired, encouraged or prayed for you. Please include this paragraph with the link to  Memoirs of a Mommy  so that everyone will know where this award originated.]  ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SPyzlwWh4JI/AAAAAAAAA6U/35hUdmrFuLw/s1600-h/Sharing_the_love.jpg", "http://imapixiemama.blogspot.com/", "http://imapixiemama.blogspot.com/2008/08/sharing-is-caring.html", "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/", "http://likeashark.blogspot.com/", "http://gretsblog.blogspot.com/", "http://rhettsjourney.blogspot.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SP0wQFQK3gI/AAAAAAAAA6c/wfzfw1dv4_Y/s1600-h/blog_love.jpg", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/10/spreading-some-love-around.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/", "http://kristenspina.wordpress.com/", "http://jennifergrafgroneberg.wordpress.com/", "http://www.vickiforman.com/", "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/", "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/", "http://www.marlabaltes.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://www.memoirsofamommyblog.com/2008/05/new-award-to-give-away.html", "http://www.memoirsofamommyblog.com/2008/05/new-award-to-give-away.html", "http://www.memoirsofamommyblog.com/2008/05/new-award-to-give-away.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/10/20/love-makes-the-world-go-round/", "title": "Love makes the world go\u00a0\u2019round"},

{"date": "October 21, 2008 ", "body": "\n \n \n \u201cEducation is only a ladder to gather fruit from the tree of knowledge, not the fruit itself\u201d ~ Anonymous \n \n \n For months, I\u2019ve agonized over finding the  right materials , setting up the  right environment , planning the  right curriculum  to home school Nik \u2014to help him  \u201cget ready for school.\u201d  (\u2026as if that were really an option right now?) It has been so overwhelming that I have dragged my heels and gotten stuck in  analysis-paralysis  to the point that I have had anxiety attacks (well, moments anyway) about whether we made the right decision in pulling Nik from school all those many months ago. I mean, sometimes I\u2019m just not sure I have what it takes to home school Nik and meet his needs.\n This morning, as I sat in the loft checking email, reading blogs and doing a bit of research, I started to really listen to Nik as he played down in the family room. His laughter and songs bubbled up over the balcony; I could  see  his smiling face with my ears. His each and every little sound is so richly nuanced that I cannot begin to imagine how much this child of mine has to tell the world. I listen to him admonish the pillows on the sofa or his scooter for not cooperating with his grand plans \u2014whatever they may be. I listen to his enthusiastic singing of his favorite parts of the ABC song from  Signing Time ; it\u2019s always a fair indicator of his mood since he  looooves  that song. \n Feeling incredibly guilty that I haven\u2019t yet struck upon the  perfect combination  of curriculum or methodology, but bolstered by yesterday\u2019s foray into the local  \u00fcber-discount  store where I found some preschool oriented materials cheap, I decided to simply go play with my son. \n As Nik climbed all over me and we laughed and bounced, as we tickled and giggled and he asked for  \u201cmore, more, more\u201d  with his flying hands and laughing eyes, it occurred to me that we were in the middle of a  learning experience . When we play together, when I prompt him to use his language and communication skills, when he looks me in the eyes laughing and smiling, he is learning how to interact with others, how to express feelings, how to engage another person\u2019s interest, how to ask for what he wants. \n When I tell him  \u201cNo more, Mommy\u2019s all done,\u201d  he is learning about boundaries and limits and how to respect them; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn\u2019t, but he\u2019s  learning . \n When I introduce a new toy \u2014a small red foam ball and brightly colored bowling pins \u2014he is learning the skills of observation, exploration, and discovery. Of course he does not do what I expect him to do \u2014in spite of my showing him a few times. Instead, he laughs and throws the ball and chases it around the room; he tries to mouth the pins or stack them or link them like beads. \n Watching him trying to sit on the six inch round foam ball time and again \u2014as he does with his yellow playground ball which is three times the size of the foam ball, I laugh and shake my head thinking he\u2019s just being silly. Then it strikes me that he is learning through experience about big versus little, soft versus hard. As he tries to bounce the red ball and it doesn\u2019t go very far, he is learning about how different physical properties act. He rolls or kicks the ball on the floor and he is learning fine and gross motor coordination, visual tracking, and how to aim at another object. \n It finally occurs to me that  so much learning  takes place in our household every minute of every day if I but step back to see it. If I allow myself to let go of the expectations, imprinted on my consciousness by so many years of traditional school room learning, and the goals I think are important, I can watch and learn from Nik where he needs to go next. I can follow  his lead  and use the skills he already possesses to build a strong foundation for him to continue his  own journey  of exploration, self discovery and learning. And I can incorporate his journey into mine. \n \n When the student is ready, the master appears. ~Buddhist Proverb \n \n \n \n \n \n   ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SP39um9DeBI/AAAAAAAAA60/IQuykaJmXJg/s1600-h/tree+of+knowledge.jpg", "http://www.signingtime.com/"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/climbing-the-tree/", "title": "Climbing the tree"},

And I may have also mentioned a time or twenty that his appetite \u2014rather his  willingness  to taste things \u2014is increasing at an amazingly fast rate  which, if unchecked could impoverish a small country , no? \n Nik  long ago learned the sign for  cracker  which is made by flexing your left arm at the elbow and tapping the elbow with the closed right fist.

They are the right size for his hands and he can carry one around nearly everywhere he goes while he plays. Quite convenient, that. Unless you have an aversion to sweeping, vacuuming,  and  mopping the floor at least once daily? But I digress. \n Since there doesn\u2019t seem to be a universal sign in ASL for  pretzel , we\u2019ve been using the same sign for  cracker  and then saying the word  pretzel  for  Nik .

{"date": "October 24, 2008 ", "body": " Talk about a lesson in trusting yourself. In the  five weeks  since Nikolas took his  last dose of seizure medication , we have witnessed the following:\n \n \n He\u2019s begun showing a  voracious interest  in food again after  two years of not eating ; he wants  everything  from our plates and wants to feed himself. He\u2019s not actually biting and chewing yet but he is making tremendous progress with pureed and thickened foods. And he\u2019s tolerating all kinds of new textures such as meat (!!), breads and bagels, tortilla chips, slightly chunky mashed potatoes, mashed broccoli, cookies\u2026all kinds of things he never showed any interest in before.\n He no longer wants to sit in his  Kimba  chair to get a full tube feeding by pump unless he is either in the kitchen while I am making dinner \u2014and getting to share it with me while I cook \u2014or sitting at the dinner table with us. Breakfast and lunch are now broken up into two rather large bolus feeds as Nik sits in his little Elmo easy chair. He even follows directions to pick up Elmo and  \u201cbring it over here\u201d  (usually near the sofa so I can sit and feed him) then makes a big production out of sitting down and patting his tummy to indicate he\u2019s hungry. Yeah, he\u2019s turning into a first rate ham. \n He comes to the gate to tell me he is hungry by signing  eat ; if I ask him does he want  apple  or  cracker  (pretzels) he will indicate his preference by signing the right one, followed by  please . He now signs  please  anytime he wants something. Then, I ask him to  show me  what he wants. In the last five weeks, Nik has learned the signs for  book ,  ball , and  watch . Well, technically, he\u2019s learned the sign for  time  \u2014as in  Signing Time  \u2014but he likes to chew on my sport watch so I\u2019ve taught him how to ask for it with  nice words . I still have to prompt him some on that specific one but he\u2019s really catching on fast. \n He can also sign  all done ,  open, shoes,  and  diaper  now. And, very often, he will sign \u201c ball, please\u201d  or  \u201cbook please\u201d  completely unprompted when he wants a toy. This week, Nik actually stood in front of the armoire, patting his chest for  please  and said  \u201c gah, gah .\u201d  You\u2019d better believe he got that book right away! \n He\u2019s begun putting on his own shirt, helping to pull up his pants \u2014and zipping them!\u2014and he can pull up his socks, put on his orthotics, and shoes; I help him with most of those things but he does a pretty good job without me, too. He can brush his hair, feed himself with a fork and spoon, and consistently asks for  more  when he wants it. \n My child \u2014the one who is visually impaired, didn\u2019t walk until 15 months ago, and has cerebral palsy \u2014has  nearly mastered  climbing the stairs \u2014all by himself while holding a toy in one hand \u2014 opening regular door knobs, flipping light switches, and can get the lid back on his bottle and screw it shut  7 out of 10  times. He\u2019s figured out how to climb slanted rock walls, small ladders, slide down slides in every possible position, and is learning to not only steer his little bike by its handle bars but is beginning to figure out the concept of pedaling \u2014again, with minimal assistance from us. His motor planning abilities continue to amaze us as does his keen awareness of nearly everything going on around him. \n We used to have to encourage him to stand up to walk to the car because he was always so focused on the ground right in front of his feet. Now we have to cajole him to continue walking because he is so busy picking flowers, picking up leaves, chasing squirrels, ringing the doorbell, running to the end of the driveway. It\u2019s pretty cool;  annoying  sometimes but cool none the less. \n Did I mention the daily kisses and giggle-fests with  both  Mommy and Daddy? The way he takes my hand to walk to the car and signs  please  to tell me he wants me to come to the park with him and his Daddy? Or the way he rides his bike from the family room to the front door because he heard us say the word  park ? Or the way he warbles in his beautiful little vibrato to ask me to sing opera for him? And when Miss Rachel is singing on  Signing Time , he now grabs my arm and makes me stay to sing along. His current favorite is the \u201cABC\u201d song (aka  \u201cA is for Alex\u2026\u201d ). He always sings that when he is  happy, happy, happy . And when I sing the last part that goes  \u201cX is for x-ray and Y is for yesterday; Z is for zipper and now we are doooone! Hooray!\u201d  He collapses in a fit of the giggles and claps wildly for more. \n And when he\u2019s sitting alone in his chair and watching  Signing Time  without me (a rare occurrence I can tell you), I peek around the corner from the kitchen to watch as he flexes his fingers and waves his hands along with Miss Rachel. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s signing but he\u2019s  definitely  trying to sign more words. \n Tonight, as we were killing time waiting for Daddy to hurry home so we could put Nik to bed, I discovered that Nik recognizes  NINE letters  of the alphabet \u2014A, B, E, M, N, X, Y, and Z. He can correctly identify them by pointing! We haven\u2019t even begun to work on letter recognition so I know it\u2019s all from the videos and singing.  Well, and the fact that my kid is a freaking genius!  I was blown away! \n So when some doctor tells you  \u201cYour child won\u2019t\u2026\u201d  or  \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d  don\u2019t you  dare  sell your child out and buy into that  crap  defeatist attitude. Sometimes all it takes is a  belief  that it can happen, the  determination  to create the possibilities \u2014the right environment, the right people\u2014 and the ability to  love your child more than you fear their labels and limitations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cThere are two lasting bequests we can give our children:  \n One is roots, the other is wings.\u201d  \n \n \n ~ Hodding Carter \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SQJ6_ETW7bI/AAAAAAAAA70/VLetvGSnGpM/s1600-h/Fun+things+to+do+when+Mommy+is+hung+over.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/09/d-o-n-e.html", "http://www.ottobockus.com/products/pediatric_mobility/kimba_spider.asp", "http://www.signingtime.com/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/09/gah.html", "http://www.signingtime.com/", "http://www.signingtime.com/"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/10/24/taking-root-taking-wing/", "title": "Taking Root, Taking\u00a0Wing"},

{"date": "November 18, 2008 ", "body": "It seems we\u2019ve entered into a new phase of life in our household; Nik has, apparently, gone from  not interested  to  ravenous as a pack of teenage boys  in a matter of days. It feels like my day \u2014which used to revolve solely around shuttling Nik to his various therapy appointments, playing with and teaching Nik things like how to put on his shirt \u2014now revolves  constantly  around food. If I\u2019m not  preparing  the next meal for Nik \u2014a fairly labor intensive process thus far, requiring grinding of foods and mashing and mixing of flavors to appeal to his indiscriminate palate but which will also provide balanced nutrition \u2014then I am shopping , cooking, thinking, planning, researching,  and  feeding  the child. Toss in doing mostly the same for my husband (though he\u2019s quite capable of feeding himself, thank goodness), then you can begin to understand why I feel like a junior restaurateur. Oddly enough, I did a stint as a restaurant manager in my long ago twenties but that\u2019s a story for another day \u2014or not. Still, I can only post so many images of my child stuffing his face or so many twitter posts about how much Nik eats in a given meal. It gets old after a while.  Fortunately, we have not yet reached that point!  Soon; I promise. But for now, allow me to revel in the glory that is my son\u2019s ever-increasing appetite and advancing oral motor skills. It\u2019s only been a week since Nik started eating again. Sure, he\u2019s been enthusiastically licking and slurping tastes from a spoon and sipping from his sippy cup for a while, but we\u2019ve graduated to the level of  actual consumption . Nik is now averaging roughly  twenty  to  twenty-five  percent of his daily nutrition by mouth! Today alone, he consumed nearly seven ounces of food by mouth at lunch. Not only have we achieved a consumption of notable quantities, we\u2019ve begun the next phase which is acceptance of the spoon when presented in a \u201ctypical\u201d fashion. Yes, we still have to turn the utensil so Nik can take the occasional lick but he is cooperating more and more with accepting the spoon and with actually  closing his lips  around the spoon to clear it. Some of you may wonder why that is such a big deal or why it\u2019s taken so long to reach this milestone. If you haven\u2019t experienced it, it\u2019s difficult to explain in an adequate fashion but I\u2019ll try: Imagine if you spent a very large portion of your earliest days of life in  this  get-up. No opportunities to learn to suck or swallow, no way to actually close your mouth completely \u2014to even feel your lips touching together\u2014 and no way to move your tongue in any manner save for rubbing the very back of it on the tube stuck in your tiny throat. Then, once you\u2019ve graduated from all that awful stuff on your face and in your mouth, and you\u2019re just learning to use your mouth for good stuff \u2014like eating, someone starts to give you daily medications that make you feel funny and not very hungry. This lasts for  two years . Nik was just beginning to learn new oral motor skills when he was put on the seizure medications which \u2014while they did prevent seizure activity, a highly important thing for his overall health and well-being\u2014 dulled his senses to the point that he lost  all  interest in food and  all  ability to recall the slight bit of oral-motor muscle memory he was beginning to develop. In the sixty-two days Nik has been free of those medications, Nik has made such phenomenal progress \u2014much of which I\u2019ve talked about in other places \u2014and he continues to push himself. It\u2019s as if he is consciously trying to catch up on things he\u2019s missed out on. So, please pardon me for boasting and boring you with the minutiae of Nik\u2019s daily eating habits. It\u2019s been such a hard-fought battle \u2014one I can\u2019t even say is won yet. Someone asked me recently if this means Nik will lose the feeding tube soon; I honestly cannot say. I do know that he needs to make significantly more progress \u2014including learning to actually bite, chew and swallow all of his food \u2014before that discussion is even on the table. In the meantime, I\u2019m trying really hard to use each meal as a learning opportunity. When Nik was in the NICU, I was unable to express enough milk to feed him. My doctor told me not to worry about it; he said lots of woman whose children are born so prematurely have this difficulty. What he couldn\u2019t tell me though, was how to deal with the grief I felt over not being able to bond with my child in this most primal way; the knowledge that I would never feel my precious baby suckling while cradled in my arms. It was a bitter pill to swallow then and one on which I still choke in moments of sleep-deprived frustration. It can be mentally and emotionally exhausting for me \u2014this struggle to let go of the guilt I feel around my inability to provide the one thing for my child that seems to be a natural and inherent part of motherhood \u2014nurturing and nourishing one\u2019s child with food. Whenever Nik fights me about eating, my knee-jerk reaction is to take it personally or to get angry and I wonder what I am doing wrong or why it\u2019s so damned hard. I have to stop and remind myself of, well, so much. That it is  Nik\u2019s  process and that  he  is actually the teacher. That he has made such rapid and tremendous progress in spite of the constant barrage of sensory input he has to process with each and every bite. If I change a food, does he know what flavor to expect on his tongue? Is the consistency too thick or too lumpy? Is there too much fiber in his meal which will cause him distress later in the day or night? Does he do better when he\u2019s holding his own spoon and trying to feed himself while alternating bites from my spoon? How much effort does that coordination take him; how hard is he concentrating and how tenuous is his concentration at any given meal? It is such a deeply intricate dance of give and take, watch and follow. That seems to be our norm in nearly everything these days and it takes a lot out of me. And yet, given the choice? I would feast upon this challenge like a glutton. The progress is too sweet to pass up.

{"date": "November 20, 2008 ", "body": "It\u2019s all too easy to wrap myself up in my cocoon of life with my little family and my warm-fuzzy relationships with my blogging and other friends. So easy to revel in the progress my child is making as he learns to eat, to walk, run, play, communicate \u2014and to love and be nurtured in a supportive environment. Every once in a while, I am slapped back into the harsh, cruel reality of what life can be like for so many people with autism and other neurological or developmental delays and disabilities. The truth is that people with  any  sort of developmental disabilities have their rights denied or violated in countless ways; access to fighting for their legal rights is often far more restricted than the general public realizes. Those that are unable to speak for themselves or who have no one to speak up on their behalf often find themselves in horrifically unspeakable circumstances. I can fool myself with thinking that  \u201cthis would never happen to Nik or [insert name of your adorable child here]\u201d  but If something were to happen to Niksdad and I tomorrow, Nik could well find himself placed in an untenable situation. In fact, if something were to happen to Nikolas,he could be removed from our custody and placed into a situation like that of Frankie Macias. \n Frankie Macias has been institutionalized at the New Lisbon Developmental Center since 1994. He was sent there by New Jersey\u2019s Division of Developmental Disabilities on a temporary, \u201cemergency\u201d basis to wait until funding for an appropriate community placement became available. He is still waiting.  In his 14 years at New Lisbon, Frankie has experienced numerous physical assaults, sexual assaults, and, for quite some time, the near daily use of 4-point mechanical and chemical restraints. He was denied his right to vote. When his sister asked him to walk her down the aisle at her wedding, he was not permitted to attend. This year, his request to spend Thanksgiving with his family was denied.  In 1998, Frankie reported that staff were placing residents of his cottage in mechanical restraints and leaving them unattended with another resident, who would then beat them up. Fearing for his own safety, Frankie asked the CEO to install hidden cameras. Three years later, in 2001, a resident was found dead in this same cottage. He had been strangled. Earlier that year, another New Lisbon resident was found, beaten and bloody, under his bed. He never regained consciousness. Frankie said to his mother, \u201cMom, if I die, please don\u2019t let them bury me at New Lisbon.\u201d  In the mildest of terms, New Lisbon is not a nice place to live. In 2001, the federal government agreed, and New Lisbon was decertified following an inspection by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. The facility was re-certified in 2002, however, that same year, the U.S. Department of Justice investigated allegations of violence and substandard conditions at New Lisbon and, as a result of its findings, sued the State of NJ for violations of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act.  This is the place DDD sent Frankie to wait.  Now, a wonderful organization has offered to provide Frankie with a home of his own and the community-based services DDD promised him over a decade ago. After 14 years of waiting, Frankie could be home for the holidays\u2026  If only DDD would let him go.  Instead, the Division of Developmental Disabilities continues to demand revision after revision of the service plan submitted for Frankie. Meanwhile, back at New Lisbon, his condition continues to deteriorate.  We are asking Governor Corzine to put an end to DDD\u2019s 14-year emergency and Free Frankie NOW! Please take consider Frankie\u2019s story \u2014it is far from being an exception \u2014and  sign the petition . I hope you will pass this along to everyone you know who cares anything at all about basic human rights, decency, and compassion. As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday next week, I hope you will give thanks for your freedoms and your ability to advocate for yourself or for your loved ones.

{"date": "December 19, 2008 ", "body": "\n If you take a moment to read  this post , you\u2019ll have some idea of what we\u2019ve been going through the last few days and nights around here. For some reason, Nik\u2019s system decided that it didn\u2019t need to be, um,  regular  and that\u2019s been causing quite a bit of discomfort for him.  \n \n Things reached critical mass this morning when even a suppository wouldn\u2019t accomplish the job. Oh, well, that and Nik waking with a fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit. After calling the doctor, we suspected we might be looking at abdominal x-rays after our office visit. Nik\u2019s anatomy is not exactly the \u201cstandard issue\u201d courtesy of his intestinal malrotation which gives him a greatly shortened tract. \n Where most people\u2019s intestines and bowels look just like you might see in an anatomy book (or  like this ), Nik\u2019s doesn\u2019t have as many twists and turns. Well, actually, it had  more  twists \u2014some of which nearly did him in just shy of his first birthday \u2014including a  sneakily hidden   appendix  diagonally opposite where it should have been (his was up under his stomach). Thanks to a fabulous surgeon in Oakland (yep, Nik\u2019s a Californian,  du-ude !), Nik made it through but now has more of a short hairpin turn in his large intestine than the nice long U-which wraps around the perimeter. \n \n All this is to say that Nik\u2019s been having some troubles and a lot of pain. And, that we can\u2019t take a  wait-and-see  approach all the time because we don\u2019t know what sort of scar tissue is there and what sort of nerve damage may or may not have occurred during his surgery. \n   \n True to form, we went in expecting  Thing A  and came out with  Thing B  instead; that\u2019s kind of par for the course with Nik.\n \n Thing B , as it turns out is  another   raging ear infection . When  Doctor Mary  exclaimed  \u201cOh my goodness, Nikolas, no wonder you\u2019re in pain!\u201d  we knew it wasn\u2019t pretty. In spite of what all the ENT (ear-nose-throat) doctors say, it certainly  is  possible for a child with myringotomy tubes to have an infection without fluids draining out of the ear. We suspect that Nik\u2019s got some dried fluid or wax in front of the actual tube (closer to the outer ear) which is blocking the drainage route. Kind of like a beaver dam in a river; it doesn\u2019t necessarily block the entire flow but it restricts it enough to change the normal or expected course. \n \n So, hear we are, a mere nineteen days into the month and Nik has had a stomach bug,  followed by strep , and now another ear infection. Poor guy.\n \n None the less, with the addition of yet another antibiotic (his second in as many weeks), some multidopholus powder to his formula, and the help of our dear, dear friend,  Addie Ville , we\u2019re forging ahead with our plans to visit Santa tomorrow on the  Santa Clause Express  train. We went last year and had a wonderful time. If Nik\u2019s feeling better tomorrow, I expect it will be even better than last year!\n \n Fingers crossed. \n   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SUx-GYPzhUI/AAAAAAAABVo/xtG7w1wwC0Y/s1600-h/Clap+Hands+Santa.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/05/nocturne.html", "http://www.doereport.com/generateexhibit.php?ID=1696", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/images/ency/fullsize/7028.jpg", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/07/grounded.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/03/end-of-ear.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-doctor.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/suddenly-things-change.html", "http://www.wwrr.com/holiday.asp"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/all-i-want-for-christmas/", "title": "All I want for Christmas\u2026"},

These past few weeks have been so hectic between just plain old daily living and the preparations for Thanksgiving and Nik\u2019s birthday; I haven\u2019t really taken more than a few moments each morning to try to ground myself. Today, though, I feel solid; on firm footing. Perhaps it is the inspiring workout I had with a new trainer yesterday. The belief that I have finally found someone to mentor and partner me through a major life and lifestyle change I both need and want. Perhaps it is the new Twitter name I\u2019ve chosen for myself \u2014one which is an affirmation of myself as a woman instead of simply Niksmom. Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong, I am incredibly happy to be Niksmom. Still, there comes a point in life when one must stop living entirely for others and begin living for oneself. I feel like I have reached that juncture in my life and am ready to embrace me in all my glory and with all my faults. Perhaps my feeling so solid this morning is because I have a wonderful husband who is working so hard to make a new new life for us and to blaze a new career path for himself. He works hard and it is paying off in small increments thus far. I love him deeply and am so proud of who he is and what he does. Perhaps it is having family close by that I am looking forward to spending some time with today. Or my friends near and far, those met and those still unknown to me \u201cin real life.\u201d Perhaps it is the soft, happy sounds of my beautiful son greeting the day in his own way as he wakes this morning. The soft singing and clapping, the boisterous giggles and laughter are hard to resist. Perhaps it is the knowledge that I have opportunities to affect change, to bring joy, hope, and inspiration to others. Perhaps it is the knowledge that I am free to feel and experience deep sorrows and ecstatic joys, to dress for myself, to do as I mostly please. I have a roof over my head, food on my table, clothing for my family and so much more. Today, I give thanks for all of those things. And also for the good fortune to live in a land of privilege and opportunity; may I never forget that. Whether or not you are an American and whether or not you actually celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday, I hope you will take pause in your day \u2014wherever you are\u2014 to reflect on what you have to be thankful for.

{"date": "December 20, 2008 ", "body": "Just a quick update to  yesterday\u2019s post \u2026 Since  Addie Ville  came to stay last night, Nik slept fairly well; he only woke at 4:30 a.m. but that was because we didn\u2019t give him his extra dose at 11:00 p.m. We  couldn\u2019t  \u2014he was out cold and sleeping on his tummy and wouldn\u2019t budge even when I gently tried to turn him over.

We celebrated the  miracle  that had been visited upon our family. Nik\u2019s first Christmas at home  \u2014with all the oxygen tanks and tubing, the feeding pump and medicines. The monitors and alarms. Everything felt so surreal that year. All I could do was watch my fragile little boy sleeping near the Christmas tree and pray to God that the worst of his ordeal was over. Having just spent Thanksgiving and his first birthday in the hospital undergoing life-saving abdominal surgery, we were again relieved; but the glow of the miracle seemed a bit dimmer that year. The next year  \u2014our first Christmas in our new home \u2014back in my hometown of Dover, Delaware. It felt less surreal but still \u201cnot quite right.\u201d Nik had managed to shake off the need for supplemental oxygen mere weeks before we moved but he still was very vulnerable. Though we were able to have a small party to celebrate Nik\u2019s second birthday, we spent most of that first holiday season isolated from all but family and the closest of friends. Nik couldn\u2019t yet sit up and was not yet eating by mouth. It felt like a lonely and uncertain time for all of us. We didn\u2019t know what the future could possibly hold for any of us.  All we knew was that it didn\u2019t look at all the way either of us had imagined. That year, we became acquainted with the local fire company tradition of visiting neighborhoods the week before Christmas. The night they came driving up our sleepy little street \u2014sirens blaring and lights flashing as Santa waved and  \u201cho, ho, ho\u2019d\u201d  from the cherry picker basket on the ladder truck \u2014I wept. It was shortly after dinner time but Nik was already asleep; the endeavors of his vigorous schedule of home therapies exhausted his delicately balanced system back then.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Trying to block out the sounds of merriment outside, I sat looking at the Christmas tree my son did not even acknowledge; the gaily colored lights twinkling in the darkness of the living room did little to cheer me. I was weighted down by my anxiety.\n That year, we didn\u2019t even  bother  wrapping Nik\u2019s gifts \u2014he wouldn\u2019t touch the paper. On Christmas morning, he sat in his exer-saucer playing with a brightly colored bow \u2014still oblivious to the enormous tree directly in front of him. That was the year we began to have serious concerns about his vision and hearing. It was also the year he began to have absence seizures. The miracle we had felt that first Christmas seemed so remote; like it had happened to some other family in some other life. \n *************************** The  Ghost of Christmas Present  darts furtively in the shadows; occasionally, it looks a bit like its predecessor but, every so often, it shimmers in the bright light of day. When it does, it brings with it an aura of hope \u2014 a promise of possibility  \u2014and the inspiration to create  new  traditions,  new  dreams, and the  release  of expectations. \n The second year the fire company came around, Nik was asleep again. This time, I did not cower in my darkened living room; I stepped outside and politely asked the firemen in the advance vehicle if they could maybe  not  blast the siren.  \u201cYou see, sir, I have a little boy with disabilities who is inside sleeping. If you wake him, he will not go back to sleep.\u201d  My request was met with thinly veiled disdain but it  was  honored none the less; it felt like a small victory. \n The next year \u2014last year \u2014the advance driver remembered me.  \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d  I beamed.  \u201cHe\u2019s awake and we\u2019d love to see Santa! \u201d Niksdad came to join me at the end of the driveway; Nik sat astride his daddy\u2019s shoulders bundled in his jammies and winter coat. When the fire engine came down the street \u2014horns blaring, sirens wailing\u2014 Nik went wild with excitement. The cold made my eyes water and my throat tighten just a bit. \n This year, we raced to the end of the driveway \u2014all three of us running and smiling. Nik remembered the trucks if not Santa. As Niksdad hoisted Nik onto his shoulders, Nik became a  frenzy  of squeals, clapping hands and kicking legs. He was so excited I worried he\u2019d actually hurt his daddy. He practically jumped down by himself as he and Niksdad approached the truck to see Santa.  As Nik squealed and bounced, the cold night air made my eyes burn and my throat constrict. When the fire trucks drove off into the darkness Nik was distraught.  I smiled. \n \n Our trip to ride the  Santa Clause Express  this year held little expectation of more than a pleasant ride through the Red Clay Valley and the promise of a chocolate lollipop. Though Nik was excited to see Santa last year \u2014mostly to clap hands with him as he did with anyone he met\u2014 his response this year was  tepid  at best. I think the families around us were surprised at Nik\u2019s subdued response; even Santa seemed a little puzzled until I explained that Nik has some delays and doesn\u2019t always react the way other kids do. Santa seemed to understand and was willing to take some extra time with Nik so we could, possibly, get a good picture. Sort of silly, isn\u2019t it? I mean, those pictures are really for us parents.\n (I\u2019ll write more about the trip in a separate post and include some of the awesome pictures I took.) Overall, it feels more and more as if the  Ghost of Christmases Past  is disappearing into the mists with each passing day. On his back he carries a sack weighted down with the burden of useless expectations. \n *************************** As for the  Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come , I suspect I won\u2019t know him until after he\u2019s been around for a while. He may look  exactly  like the  Ghost of Christmas Present . Then again, perhaps the day  will  come when Nik understands about Santa Clause and Christmas trees. Perhaps he\u2019ll even appreciate the joy of giving to others and of helping those less fortunate \u2014be it at Christmas or any time.\n The day might come \u2014or it might not.  None of that really matters, does it?  After all, Christmas isn\u2019t about Santa, or trees, or \u2014gasp! \u2014even trains. It\u2019s about celebrating the goodness of humanity, the promise of hope and the wonder of miracles\u2014the very things Nik embodies always. \n So fill your heart with love and joy And through the eyes of girls and boys Share their wonder, live through their joy It\u2019s easy to do, just open your heart The spirit will come to you \n Oh and God bless us everyone The good and the bad The happy; the sad Oh and God bless us everyone Here\u2019s to family and friends It\u2019s good to be here again \n ( The Magic of Christmas Day by Celine Dion ) \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SU7ChParmJI/AAAAAAAABV8/PTY7h_ilakw/s1600-h/Nik+and+St.+Nick.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SU7C3HdJAKI/AAAAAAAABWE/JvWZlFg0-eo/s1600-h/Copy+of+PC200053.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SU7DmeCqRuI/AAAAAAAABWM/A8zzyQr9UO0/s1600-h/PC250087.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SU7Eym4hlZI/AAAAAAAABWU/_sSe7cg1G_I/s1600-h/Santa+2006_crop.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SU7FwK7M8_I/AAAAAAAABWc/pWyLLOwvgNk/s1600-h/DSC02051.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SU7IudXpFJI/AAAAAAAABWk/jiasG2YOikE/s1600-h/Santa+Nite_2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SU7Iuo3z1XI/AAAAAAAABWs/eZ5y-e-62hA/s1600-h/Santa+Nite_3.jpg", "http://www.wwrr.com/holiday.asp", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYJDUt8hhE"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/ghosts-of-the-season/", "title": "Ghosts of the\u00a0Season"},

{"date": "December 27, 2008 ", "body": "The  \u201cChristmas that almost wasn\u2019t\u201d  turned into a Christmas of delight and wonder. It was touch and go right up until Christmas morning as to whether or not we were all healthy enough to host a small Christmas dinner for my parents. Nik\u2019s not sleeping well again; he seems to be suffering from that recurring  \u201cpain of indeterminate origin\u201d  which many want to dismiss as merely behavior. (Granted, it has diminished  significantly  since we  stopped the Lamictal  but there are some elements which remain.) My sister and her new husband were out of town on a short honeymoon, my nieces were scattered hither and yon, and with our current finances, well, it just didn\u2019t feel like much of a celebration. I longed for the big Christmases of my youth.  Damned ghosts  sometimes just don\u2019t know when to quit, do they? Yet, in spite of my  malaise , Christmas went marching on and the presents kept coming. Here are the highlights: The look on Nik\u2019s face as Niksdad carried him downstairs on Christmas morning and he saw his new dump truck loaded with Mega Blocks and his Alphabet Train Station. Priceless. Nik was still sleepy and snuggly against Daddy\u2019s shoulder until he saw the toys; he lifted his head from Daddy\u2019s shoulder and his eyes went wide with delight. As soon as we put him down, he made a beeline for the dump truck. As I predicted the night before, it turned out to be his favorite item of the day. \n \n \n \n \n * * * * * \n  After spending an entire day out and about with his Daddy, Nik was patient enough to wait in line for  ninety  minutes on Christmas Eve with his Daddy to see Santa \u2014 just for Mama ! It was late, it was nearly his dinner time and he was on the verge of sensory overload. The photo isn\u2019t the greatest but the experience was wonderful, according to Niksdad; he can\u2019t stop bragging about how great Nik did.  \u201cSanta was blown away when Nik signed \u2018Thank you\u2019 to him!\u201d \u201cAnd Nik\u2019s tolerance was just incredible; he didn\u2019t fuss or fight at all!\u201d  \n * * * * * \n \n Standing in the kitchen with my mother as Nik approaches the gate and starts to reach over for his \u201cletter machine\u201d (Fridge Phonics). I hand it to him and take some letters off the refrigerator door; Nik brightly chirps  \u201cBuh! Guh!\u201d  My mother\u2019s jaw drops as she looks at my hand and sees\u2026 the letters B and G. Nik recognized them and knew their sounds without any musical prompts. He now recognizes and can tell me the sounds of E, M, H, and P as well.  \n \n \n * * * * * \n \n Nik  noticed  the Christmas tree this year \u2014enough to walk up and touch it in all its faux pine glory! I thought, perhaps, the twinkly lights would entice him to do more but he was sufficiently unimpressed with the texture and hasn\u2019t given it so much as a backward glance as he races past it each morning en route to his beloved new dump truck! I now know he\u2019s fully aware of its presence \u2014just as he is aware of the cats; he just doesn\u2019t have any compelling interest in interacting with it.  \n \n * * * * *  \n Nik responding completely appropriately as he opened his gift from his Nanny and Granddaddy \u2014all by himself. Paper shreds flying as he sang and chirped. He opened the giant picture book and actually looked at a few pages and pointed to a couple of things I asked him to find. Then he signed  \u201cThank you\u201d  to his grandparents as they beamed with pride. They, too, remember the years he wouldn\u2019t touch the paper or would only play with the bows. \n * * * * *  \n Being able to share Christmas dinner in my home. We\u2019ve all been ill and, on Christmas Eve, had actually  canceled  the plans to share dinner with my parents on Christmas Day. Since my sisters and their families weren\u2019t with us this year, it felt sad and lonely. The \u201cplague\u201d lifted enough to assure my parents that it would be alright and we had a lovely, lovely time together. Mom brought the roast lamb and homemade gravy and I made everything else. It was a delightful meal in which  Nik fed himself  some mashed up baked potato and sour cream, some stuffing with Nanny\u2019s gravy (mostly gravy with a little stuffing) and made a terrible mess everywhere. But he was happy,  he was included , and no one thought twice about whether his behavior was \u201cappropriate\u201d in any manner. Oh, and he even verbalized something that sounded kind of like  \u201cmoh-moh\u201d  as he made the same for  more \u2026 asking for more of Nanny\u2019s yummy gravy, of course! \n * * * * * \n \n \n \n My father has, in the past, been somewhat dubious about Niksdad and my belief that Nik takes in everything and knows and understands far more than he is currently able to communicate to us. So, on Christmas, when I heard him say,  \u201cNik really does seem to understand pretty much everything you say to him, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d  in a voice tinged with pride and awe, I knew that he finally understands what we\u2019ve been saying all along; autistic and nonverbal do not mean that Nik is disconnected from the world or that he is retarded. It felt like an important acknowledgment from my father.  \n \n * * * * *  \n \n Niksdad has been home on semester break so he\u2019s been taking Nik out and about a lot. (Have I mentioned before how much I appreciate my husband?) The weather has been nice enough that they\u2019ve gone to the park a couple of times. The reports usually go something like this:  \u201cHe did great. He climbed a lot, he rode his bike, he played in the sand a little bit and we walked a lot.\u201d  This week the reports have been full of new and exciting things Nik has started to do. Things which require balance, visual attending, and greater depth perception (something Nik\u2019s not exhibited any great strength in thus far).  \n \n * * * * *  \n \n Even Nik\u2019s building with his Mega Blocks has taken on a new dimension \u2014quite literally. Where he\u2019s usually content to simply stack and build tall, thin towers, Nik has started to build out into more than one plane. It\u2019s been fascinating to watch as he experiments and discovers different ways to use the blocks. His analytical ability often astounds me.\n Then again, so many things he does astound me.   \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/05/solace.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/09/leaving-lamictal.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/ghosts-of-season.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SVZ7EJ_q-sI/AAAAAAAABXk/1f8TII0eZGw/s1600-h/DSC05089.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SVaDCNp371I/AAAAAAAABYI/4cMhJbkS6f0/s1600-h/DSC05106.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SVaBz0HAaqI/AAAAAAAABX8/_ngiJnzMqeQ/s1600-h/20081224_Nik+and+Santa.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SVZ7ReyQErI/AAAAAAAABXs/jpgxJ2Mz4Lc/s1600-h/DSC05089.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SVaHC6c4k8I/AAAAAAAABYQ/RXg6KfYyedA/s1600-h/Opening+gift_3.jpg"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/12/27/christmas-presence/", "title": "Christmas Presence"},

{"date": "September 26, 2008 ", "body": "Some toys are not meant for general thrashing and throwing or being ridden over by Nik\u2019s Little Tykes tricycle. Those toys reside in a large white basket which sits on top of the battered white armoire in the family room; the name really is so much more glamorous than the furniture ever was. Still, it has served us well in housing, first, office supplies in the days before Nik was born, then Nik\u2019s myriad small medical supplies through the years. It now does double duty \u2014triple, I suppose \u2014holding a smattering of medical supplies, some kitchen items in the bottom drawer, and the basket perched on top.\n \n It won\u2019t be long before Nik can reach the basket and hook his slender fingers into the openings and topple it, sending books and small toys raining down upon his head. I watch his daily attempts to do just that and know it won\u2019t be long before he no longer needs to ask for my assistance. Today, however, he gleefully grabs my hand and drags me to the armoire. \n Patting his chest in a fervent request for something currently out of his ever-lengthening reach, Nik smiles and waits. I\u2019m not sure what he wants so I ask him to  \u201cuse your words\u201d  and  \u201cshow Mommy what you want;\u201d  it is of no avail. I run through a mental inventory of what items usually reside in the basket. His current favorite is not there; I wonder if that\u2019s what he wants \u2014in spite of his having just tossed it over the gate into the kitchen. \n I offer him the insert for the item; he smiles and pats his chest with greater urgency. We are playing a non-verbal game of  \u201chot or cold\u201d  and my only clues are his face and his hand gestures. After an interminably long minute of this game, Nik suddenly changes his tack. He looks at me pleadingly, puts his palms together and then fans his hands open away from his body; this is how he signs  open . Many of his signs have multiple meanings so I assume that he is, in fact, asking for his book. \n I ask him with both words and signs,  \u201cDo you want your blue book?\u201d  Nik grins and pats his chest in the affirmative.  I lean across the gate to retrieve the book.  Nik squeals in delight and then tries to put the insert into the base.  \n Praising him for his good communication and helping skills, I reiterate in words and signs that Nik now has his blue book.  \u201cBook. Book,\u201d  I intone for him, slightly emphasizing the \u201ck\u201d sound so he doesn\u2019t confuse it with another word such as \u201cboot.\u201d \n Without missing a beat, Nik looks at me.  \u201cGah. Gah,\u201d  he says with the identical inflection that I have just used. With a smile, he takes his beloved book and settles onto the sofa to read and play. I\u2019m fairly certain we\u2019ve just experienced our first  intentional verbal communication  which doesn\u2019t involve tears or hysteria.  I could get used to this!

{"date": "September 30, 2008 ", "body": "In spite of an inauspicious beginning to the day, my  45th  birthday ended up being full of so many small and unexpected delights that I was  giddy  by the time I collapsed into bed around midnight. Might have something to do with that mojito at dinner, but I don\u2019t think so. First there was my husband\u2019s beautiful card; it was so deeply moving that I wept. He is not a man of many words or effusive emotions; his actions speak volumes more than his words ever can or will. Yet each time he gives me a card, it says all those deeply heart felt things a girl could ever wish for.  And I know he means every word of it. Next, came a fabulous session of feeding therapy. It was fabulous for so many reasons but the true standout event was that  Nik fed himself yogurt.  Voluntarily. With a spoon. Many times. He even placed the spoon in his mouth in the \u201ccorrect\u201d horizontal position that most of the rest of us use; it was only once but it\u2019s a start! Miss Michelle and I just sat there grinning at each other like we had just won the lottery.  Best birthday present ever. Until lunchtime. My mother took us to lunch at a nice little downtown caf\u00e9. Nik was, again, a superstar. He kept asking Nanny  \u201cplease\u201d  for a bit of her soup (no go, it was hot and had crab in it; I didn\u2019t want to find out the hard way that he has the same shellfish allergy I have). He delightedly sucked on a lemon wedge \u2014he is his father\u2019s son, for sure \u2014and even signed  \u201capple\u201d  when he wanted more. It took me a minute to realize he was calling it an apple because of the same wedge shape. Pretty clever that kid!\n \n \n \n \n He \u201cate\u201d flatbread crackers, potato chips, tasted my chicken panini sandwich \u2014 I finally gave him a bit of the bread which he licked to death. He even tried my dill pickle. When dessert came \u2014yummy cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e cheesecake with caramel sauce, raspberry coulis, and whipped cream garnish\u2014 Nik went wild. I offered him some bites from my fork but he wanted no part of it.  Instead, he reached across the table (when did his arms get so long??), grabbed the extra fork the waitress had left, and simply dug in!\n He was an absolute sticky mess and I loved it. I thought my mother was going to cry. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that I, um,  perhaps, leaked a tad from the corners of my eyes. The photo quality isn\u2019t great (cell phone) but it\u2019s tangible proof! \n \n Nik had an awesome afternoon at OT with Miss Debbie. He\u2019s gotten very fast and accurate with sorting colors and objects and almost ready for slightly more difficult tasks. Nik even used some very intentional communication with Miss Debbie about an item he wanted from one of the cabinets. She was so excited by it that she had him do it again just to make certain she wasn\u2019t imagining it; she wasn\u2019t.\n Niksdad, Nik, and I went out for a celebratory dinner. Ostensibly, it was a celebration of my birthday; it was also a celebration of Niksdad acing his test (as in a  full 100% ) yesterday morning and of  Nik\u2019s   amazing   progress  in the  eleven days  since we  stopped his Lamictal  cold-turkey. \n Nik was a voracious \u201ceating\u201d machine! He wanted some of  everything  that his daddy had. I wish I had thought to video the moments when Nik, pretzel or tortilla chip in hand, would watch with longing as his daddy would take a bite of a something. From the expression on his face, it was as if Nik were thinking \u201c Hey! I wanted that one!\u201d  Priceless. \n In all, my  non-eating  son tasted or ate all small quantities of more food in one day than he has in more than two years.  \n He enjoyed the following foods: Yogurt Peanut Butter Pretzel Lemon Flat bread cracker Potato chip Dill pickle Panini Cheesecake Fried green beans (a yummy appetizer at TGI Friday\u2019s) Horseradish dip Sweet potato fries Mashed potato Gravy Tortilla chips Salsa Lime Strawberry \n By the time we got home from dinner, Nik was pleasantly tired and went right to sleep. His final gift to me? Eleven hours straight through the night! \n So, while I might not have had a wild surprise party or been showered with lavish, expensive gifts, I can honestly say that my cup runneth over.  It almost makes me look forward to forty six.  \n \n Almost.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LdaehL2LQ", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SOI_DWaMdpI/AAAAAAAAA4w/rX0Wl4Y3eJY/s1600-h/0929081333.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SOI_PA2BpuI/AAAAAAAAA44/y7mLBPOw6DI/s1600-h/0929081334.jpg", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/09/rainbows-and-unicorns.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/09/accomplishment-du-jour.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/09/gah.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/09/d-o-n-e.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SOJFwDxeBVI/AAAAAAAAA5A/ZY7LJkSti_0/s1600-h/Daddy+Share.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/09/30/little-big-stuff/", "title": "Little big stuff"},
{"date": "September 30, 2008 ", "body": "It\u2019s been a very slow process for me to get around to reviewing the newest  Baby Signing Time  offerings,  Volume 3: A New Day  and  Volume 4: Let\u2019s Be Friends .  It\u2019s not because I didn\u2019t want to; it\u2019s because every time I put the DVD into the player and started to watch it with Nik he would get very upset.  Nik, as many of my regular readers know, is a huge fan of  Signing Time .  He is not, however, a huge fan of anything which remotely smacks of change from the expected routine.  It\u2019s one of his non-negotiable autistic traits and we just sort of roll with it as best we can. Some days it\u2019s smooth sailing and others, well\u2026(shrugs shoulders). As it was Nik had a difficult transition to the \u201cnew\u201d  Signing Time  opening and the \u201cnew\u201d format with Hopkins when we bought the first set of videos.  We\u2019d been checking them out of our local library; that was a feat since our state library system only has  one  copy of four different videos in their collection.  Yes, that\u2019s right; one copy of each and there\u2019s a very long waiting list. So, I finally was able to make the time to sit at my computer and watch  Baby Signing Time  all by myself.  Okay, right there is a ringing endorsement, folks!  The videos are so good that I was perfectly willing to watch them alone.  Of course, I also enjoy watching some of the Disney Channel offerings so maybe that\u2019s not such a ringing endorsement after all.  You decide. I must disclose up front that I watched these videos with a definite bias.  I tend to filter many things through the lens of my son\u2019s various learning challenges which include difficulty with fine motor control and difficulty processing a lot of busy or complex visual information. He is very much an auditory and tactile learner, preferring to learn by doing.  His first attempts at communication were actually humming the tunes of very specific songs I used to sing to him to do things such as changing his diaper or brushing his teeth.  The musical element of the  Signing Time  videos is sometimes  critical  to Nik\u2019s ability to learn and recall the signs he has learned.  If I hum a snippet of the song relating to the sign he wants to recall he is able to do so. On the whole, I loved the  Baby Signing Time  videos.  They are very different in tone and feel from the  Signing Time  series with which we are now so familiar in our house.  I will say up front that I won\u2019t buy them for use with my son simply because the transition would too traumatic at this point.  However, if I were just starting out with signing and Nik were a bit younger? I\u2019d own them all. Overall, I think the videos are well structured and geared toward the pre-preschool age group.  The overall look of the  Baby Signing Time  videos is simpler, less active or visually cluttered and the emphasis is on building concepts as well as vocabulary.  In the songs, I think Rachel\u2019s signing is more focused on the specific signs being taught.  My experience of the songs in the Signing Time series is that they are richer in signing additional vocabulary; they can be a nice way to pick up some new signs as you go.  In  Baby Signing Time , the simplicity serves a good purpose in keeping it uncluttered or visually uncomplicated for small children who have shorter attention spans and who may not be able to follow along quite as quickly as an older child. The repetitive vocalization and signing, combined with both real life and cartoon representations, and layered with music, can reach a multitude of learning styles \u2014auditory (both spoken and sung), tactile, visual (both literal and representational images).  The introduction of the cartoons interspersed with real life examples can actually help children make the cognitive leap to symbolic representation.  This is a very critical step for many non-verbal children as so many early communication systems \u2014especially in schools \u2014rely on some form of picture exchange system. In  Volume 3: A New Day , I think some of the words and concepts may not be as meaningful or motivational to small children.  That said it does give parents a way of introducing and layering language to describe a child\u2019s environment.  I don\u2019t know that I would expect a small child to tell me about the sun or rain \u2014I know many preschoolers who struggle with some of those concepts; my son can no more tell me what the weather is like outside but he can tell me he wants his book.  None the less, I suppose it\u2019s sort of like advanced vocabulary words; nice to aspire to and enough of a stretch to keep advanced learners interested. I really like how Rachel plays dress up in the different segments.  At first, I thought it a bit hokey, but after thinking about it I can see that for many children it can encourage creative play.  Also, I think many young children will think it\u2019s silly or funny and that, too, can be a huge reinforcer.  Let\u2019s face it; some people remember jokes better than straight facts!  I\u2019m not sure which I liked best \u2014Rachel in her giant sunglasses kicking back in the Adirondack chair or Rachel with the bug antennae and being all squirmy and squiggly!  It\u2019s very cute. I found the content of  Volume 4: Let\u2019s Be Friends  more applicable on a day to day basis at a younger age.  I think there were more of the words most commonly used in a daily routine \u2014names of some common foods, how to start to express yourself, opposites, and feelings.  I almost wish the two volumes had been reversed.  Many children are learning about feelings, foods, and toys before they are going out into the world and learning (or expressing things) about the weather.  Really, it\u2019s a minor complaint in the scheme of things as I think all of the material presented in the videos is wonderful and engaging. Another complaint \u2014and it may have simply slipped past me, though I tend to notice these things more since Nik was born \u2014is that it seemed to me there was significantly less use of overtly disabled children in the  Baby Signing Time  videos than in the  Signing Time  videos.  I don\u2019t know if this was an intentional choice or if it\u2019s simply the way they were edited.  I saw lots of children with Down syndrome but I did not see any children with things like braces or wheelchairs or even any obvious motor impairment.  I think it\u2019s important to expose young children \u2014and their parents \u2014to children with disabilities as just part of the normal course of daily living.  I know that this is equally important to the folks at  Two Little Hands Productions  so I was a bit surprised at the omission. Finally, I do have to say that I have a real  love-hate  relationship with some of the songs Rachel uses at the end of the videos.  I love them because they are wonderful songs rich with meaning.  I hate them because they are loaded with meaning for me as a parent of a child with multiple special needs.  I cannot listen to  \u201cShow Me a Sign\u201d  without crying a river.  The words remind me of all the things my child is not yet able to express in spite of his obvious intellect and desire to do so.  Also, I think knowing a bit of the history behind songs such as  \u201cTiny Hands\u201d  makes them more poignant. The third offering on the DVD I was sent,  Elizabeth Barrett Can Read  is an inspiring account of a little girl with remarkable communication skills who began reading at the age of thirteen months.  It should be noted that her mother, Katy Barrett, is a speech pathologist and that she was not actively teaching Elizabeth to read.  Katy acknowledges that communication comes easily for Elizabeth; she states  \u201cObviously, she\u2019s got some special abilities to be able to do this.\u201d   Katy also says she believes the visual nature of signing helped Elizabeth connect the symbols (signs) to the letters she saw on screen and to the meaning of the words.  I can\u2019t help but wonder, though, if Elizabeth is possibly hyperlexic.  Clearly, Elizabeth is a very strong visual learner with an ability to recognize letters and patterns of words and language.  While I think Elizabeth Barrett is absolutely  not  your typical young learner, I think there can be little doubt as to the power of layering language in so many ways.  As Katy says, there are so many children who don\u2019t have communication tools and sign language can be a bridge for them. The nice thing is that  it\u2019s never too late to start.

{"date": "January 12, 2009 ", "body": "Ok, so the day started with one  teensy  hiccup: the fact that Nik didn\u2019t quite sleep straight through the night.  But he woke fairly early in the night and was soothed back to sleep pretty quickly so it  felt  like I got a good night\u2019s sleep.  Around here, that\u2019s about as good as it gets most days! But the rest of the day, if I do say so, turned out to be Nik\u2019s BEST.DAY.EVER.  If it wasn\u2019t, then I don\u2019t think I can remember a better day\u2014 except, possibly, the day he was born.  But that\u2019s all kind of hazy and went down hill so fast afterward that, well, you know\u2026 We\u2019ve been seeing some great leaps forward again; little bits here and there.  Today, it all just seemed to come together in a perfect storm of delightful progress that my face hurts from smiling and laughing all day.  If I tried to weave it all into a narrative it would take me all night.  Forgive me for the less than elegant turns of phrase which follow.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree that the sentiment makes up for the lack of graceful prose, no? Nik  ate  nearly  THIRTY PERCENT  of his intake by mouth today.  It would have been more if I weren\u2019t anxious about overwhelming his GI system with too much solid food at one time.  He\u2019s gotten so acclimated to the formula that we do have to ease him into the whole oral feeding gig. Nik fed himself crumbs on a spoon .  Yeah, I know, to anyone who\u2019s never experienced the joys of trying to teach a five year old to tolerate new textures, it sounds silly.  I\u2019m not sure, but I think I saw Miss M (our awesome SLP) wipe a little tear away as she watched.  He also ate everything I brought for him this morning; we\u2019ve been working on increasing quantities and following his lead on trying new textures.  A new milestone reached and a new goal created! For the language development aspect of Nik\u2019s speech therapy, we\u2019re going to start working on some simple visual sequencing for eating (that gets his undivided attention!).  Yep, another new goal. He\u2019s taught himself more letters using one of the toys he got for Christmas. Honestly.  I thought the toy might be too advanced for him but I was mistaken! So now, the repertoire of letters he can identify on request includes (drum roll please):  B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y, and Z .  Granted, he\u2019s not totally consistent but I\u2019d say his accuracy is up around eighty percent. We had a slight break at home in which Nik played by himself \u2014building, building, building\u2014 and then ate like a champ at lunch.  Baba Ganoush, peanut butter, and celery.  No, he didn\u2019t actually eat the celery but it makes for great oral motor work as he has to use his upper lip to clear food from the groove in the stalk.  (Crafty Mommy, eh?) The afternoon at PT and OT was amazing.  From the moment we walked in the door, Nik followed directions and cooperated.  He waited his turn \u2014something that doesn\u2019t get reinforced a lot since he\u2019s an only child; we\u2019re working on getting him around other kids \u2014 starting with a new playgroup tomorrow morning!   But I digress\u2026 During the first part of PT, Nik and Miss T had a slight battle of wills; Nik acquitted himself magnificently!  First, he dragged Miss H, the delightful new aid, over to the cabinet to ask her to open it PLEASE and get his weighted vest.  He actively asked with his signs and excited squeals and all.  I was so proud of him.  He fell apart over a toy a few minutes later.  But he did it in such a way that *he* was able to pull himself back; we allowed him some time to tantrum on the mat (for safety) and it was very short-lived.  He sat up, did what Miss T asked of him and the incident was forgotten.  Milestone: The  First.Time.Ever  that he has been able to pull himself out of the downward spiral. The rest of the PT session was spent marveling at Nik\u2019s willingness to do things he\u2019s always balked at before; swinging, riding on a stool both seated and on his tummy as Miss T wheeled him around the room.  Nik\u2019s always had tremendous resistance to having his feet off the ground with no other clearly defined, firm foundation under him.  He smiled and laughed and played with a toy \u2014all while keeping his green chewy tube firmly clenched in his mouth instead of mouthing every toy he touched! Did I mention he\u2019s teaching himself numbers too, apparently?  I mean, I present them\u2014 I count things and sing songs about numbers and such \u2014but we aren\u2019t actively working on them right now.  Another of his toys is all about numbers and the boy is learning.  We\u2019re still in the very beginning stages but he was able to sort stacks of cards with numbers on them today in OT.  When Nik pays visual attention \u2014he doesn\u2019t scan and track well \u2014he is tremendously accurate.  The challenge is getting him to focus and look.  A new milestone and new learning goal added today in OT, for sure! Nik was a (mostly) willing and charming participant in all the activities Miss D had for him; he\u2019s becoming a master at sorting colors in an ever expanding array.  Now, we\u2019re working on sorting functional items such as spoons and forks, stringing beads, and learning self-help skills. At the end of the session, I watched Nik take Miss H by the hand again and lead her over to the cabinets.  He tugged at the vest, signed open please, and waited patiently while she unfastened the vest.  He took it off and put it in her hand as he pushed her hand upward toward the open cabinet.  After Miss H put the vest on the shelf, Nik reached up and closed the cabinet all by himself!  When did his arms get so long??   Then, he asked Miss H to open the cabinet next to it; I guess he was just curious because he closed it and walked away. The rest of the day preceded in much the same fashion.  Joyful, and cooperative, wildly exuberant playtime at the park with Daddy, dinner as a member of the \u201cclean plate\u201d club (his choice!) and sound asleep within minutes of going to bed at seven-thirty. Lord, I\u2019d like a  few  more of these to string together, please?

{"date": "January 17, 2009 ", "body": "I have so much on my mind \u2014therefore on my endless list of things to write about, think about, research, or otherwise obsess about \u2014it\u2019s hard to know where to start and seemingly impossible to form elegant prose lately.  (Well, that presumes that I  ever  had that specific ability!) So, today I give you a simple brain dump.  In no particular order\u2026 Health follow-up:  Nik\u2019s still having some milder bouts of the  persistent and weird pains  that  seem  to be headaches but we really aren\u2019t sure. We\u2019ve gotten some articles from  the neurologist  about  Red Ear Syndrome  which can occur with migraines \u2014but not always. So, we still have more reading and research, more data collecting and serious thinking to do before we take any steps toward medications.  You already know my feelings about going down  that  road. Eating:  Like a pig. Seriously, three months ago the child was barely taking tastes of things and now he is voraciously grabbing at nearly anything. He\u2019s taking in at least twenty-five percent overall by mouth on a daily basis. The percentage was a bit higher but we\u2019ve had to increase his caloric intake significantly; when we weighed Nik yesterday morning, he\u2019d  lost  weight \u2014again. Essentially, Nik\u2019s down nearly a pound from where he was in August.  And it shows . You can\u2019t see it in pictures \u2014mostly because I am not going to post photos of my unclothed child on the internet \u2014but when he takes his shirt off, I can actually count his  individual  ribs from across the room  and without my glasses!  Seriously. His weight (and his height) now places him in the  third percentile  for his age group. His body mass index has dropped from the  seventy-fifth percentile  to  twenty-third percentile . It seems no matter what we do we cannot keep weight on this boy. We see the nutritionist again in about four weeks. Meanwhile, we\u2019re supplementing in simple ways by adding butter or olive oil for extra fats and calories. Home schooling:  It\u2019s time to begin in earnest now that Nik has reached \u201cofficial school age.\u201d We are going to join a local home school umbrella group which will handle any attendance and record-keeping items with the school district so we don\u2019t have to worry about any truancy visits! The task now is trying to find a curriculum that will challenge Nik without frustrating him \u2014or me \u2014into consistent meltdowns. I\u2019m just beginning to evaluate some that have been recommended to me by various people. Nik is showing signs that he is clearly  learning and understanding  so much more than he is able to communicate. I need to really assess where I think he is and what tools I need to help him develop in order to be ready for more advanced learning than he currently is doing.  For example, Nik has  pretty much mastered the alphabet  in terms of being able to identify the letters on request.    Apparently, it\u2019s happening pretty fast with numbers, too! Just yesterday, I conducted a little test with one of his toys, asking him to identify numbers in a random sequence. It was slow and painstaking but it was  one hundred percent accurate! As I see it now, my biggest challenge \u2014 Nik\u2019s most important goal at this point  \u2014is to find a way for Nik to communicate his intelligence with other people. I thought I had an idea of the path we might take to get there but now I am not so certain. Nik responds with some sign language when he is prompted to  \u201cuse your words.\u201d  But he won\u2019t use signs to  initiate  a request \u2014we still get crying or physical prompting. I don\u2019t think  PECS  is the right tool for him just yet.  His visual scanning, tracking and attending skills are  very poor .  As a result, the cards become great toys or teething/mouthing objects with no real meaning to him.  Similarly,  the button devices we worked so hard to get for him still  don\u2019t have any concrete meaning for him  and  I cannot leave such things alone with him or they will be destroyed in a short time. I think it\u2019s time for another visit to the  fabulous AAC guru we saw a year ago . The next big challenge is to find ways to engage Nik that will help him develop a greater attention span. As I mentioned, he doesn\u2019t scan and track well; this hampers his ability to stay focused \u2014quite literally \u2014on a task at hand. Because he cannot communicate yet in a way we can understand, we have no idea if it\u2019s too overwhelming, too distracting, too painful, or that he can\u2019t see things clearly. I think it\u2019s time for another visit from the itinerant teacher for the visually impaired; maybe she has some exercises we can try to help him improve in this area. Social Development:  Nik has been giving very clear signals lately that he wants to play with us whenever we are around; he does not like to be alone anymore. This is both a blessing and a curse; it means I can no longer leave him playing happily in the family room while I tend to some other things elsewhere in the house. I still get small \u2014 very small  \u2014windows of opportunity here and there but it\u2019s not enough. The upside though is that he is clearly becoming interested in interactive play. Not that you could have proved it from this week\u2019s foray into a new play group. Still, it\u2019s emerging. The new play group is interesting; it\u2019s led by the same therapists he sees for PT and OT, Miss T and Miss D, but it is very small. There are only four children \u2014all boys \u2014 including another one named Nick; as  Mom-NOS  would say,  I think he\u2019s French, too . The format is the same as his old play group \u2014you know,  the one we had to leave suddenly  due to his scaring all the children with his searing, screaming, head-banging pains. Uh huh, that one. Each week has a theme supported by stories, songs, some simple sign language (only two signs), and a variety of activities to engage all the senses. This week, Nik seemed to be in his own little world as he wandered around the room with a musical toy in his hand. But there was a  subtle  difference this time; he was actually taking the time to explore things \u2014touching the \u201csnow\u201d cotton balls or touching the stuffed snowmen. He also didn\u2019t run into or over anyone on his way toward a toy or activity. A year ago he just plowed right through as if there wasn\u2019t another body in his path! He even stepped around one of the other boy\u2019s baby sister who joined us. He showed a much greater physical awareness of his environment than he has in the past. I had to work hard to get him engaged in some  specific  activities but he did, ultimately, participate. For the first time, ever, Nik  actually touched   glue  and helped decorate his own little snowman picture.  Very big doin\u2019s for my little guy!  He even sat, mostly calmly, in the story circle at the end of the session; he wasn\u2019t so much interested in the cute story about the old lady who swallowed some snow as much as he was in eating the vanilla ice cream cup snack! I fed him as he sat next to me like a baby bird \u2014opening his mouth for each big bite. It\u2019s been a  super cold  week here \u2014as it has nearly everywhere \u2014with record temps and a small boy who likes to be unclothed.  We\u2019ve discovered that the play room is nearly ten degrees colder than the rest of the house; there\u2019s not too much we can do about it \u2014 it\u2019s a design flaw in the construction of this old townhouse and we can\u2019t put a space heater in the room beacuse Nik doesn\u2019t understand the boundaries of safety or the concept of getting burned \u2014a concept I\u2019d prefer remain theoretical for a very long time!  We\u2019re working on insulating places we can, caulking around gaps in the hearth, etcetera.  Meanwhile, duct tape has become our daytime friend as well.  Nik\u2019s been a pretty good sport about it, too. With Niksdad\u2019s return to school \u2014his  last  semester of his R.N. program \u2014the responsibility for Nik\u2019s every need returns pretty much to my shoulders.  I forgot what an adjustment that is; I got spoiled by Niksdad\u2019s month-long winter break.  The transition has been a bit difficult for Nik, too.  He misses his Daddy and knows he\u2019s not getting the same attention he has gotten for the last several weeks.  Consequently, it\u2019s not all been a bed of roses this week; like everyone, we\u2019ve had our moments where we weren\u2019t sure we would survive the next ten minutes or if we would sleep through the night. We  did  survive; we did  not  sleep through the night.  There were moments of utter delight and sheer hell all woven together into a lush tapestry with hues so subtle that only the weaver would know they were there. Yep, I know you know what I mean.

{"date": "January 20, 2009 ", "body": "\n Have you read  this post , yet? No? Go ahead; I\u2019ll wait for you. (cue HOLD music). \n Oh, hi! You\u2019re back. Great.  \n ************************* \n You know, I\u2019ve been sniffling and tearing up for the past 24-plus hours as I\u2019ve been thinking about the momentous watershed event which will take place in just a little more than an hour from now. Yep, no matter what your personal political views, you cannot deny that this is a pivotal moment in this country\u2019s history, in the psyche of its people.  It is a re-birth of HOPE. \n As I was watching the early morning coverage on  Good Morning America  (what?? I like the warm fuzzies of Robin, Diane and the whole team), I wondered if there would ever come a time when we could or would put a person in to the White House who had ever struggled with any sort of developmental disabilities as a child. Not that I was necessarily thinking about my own son \u2014though  Michael\u2019s story  certainly goes to show that one never knows what changes the tincture of time and a large measure of hope can bring to bear on a person. \n When I read  Jess\u2019s post today , all of a sudden, my thinking didn\u2019t seem so far fetched \u2014 even in the context of my son\u2019s future.

{"date": "March 13, 2009 ", "body": "It\u2019s been a seriously rough patch over here at Nik\u2019s house \u2014 a very, very,  very  rough time here.  \u00a0 I don\u2019t think that is understating things at all. \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019ve been battling against the  mysterious pains  for so long now that they are starting to feel like a part of the family \u2014kind of like bad in-laws that came to visit and ended up moving in. \u00a0  Then we had the  detour to the hospital  for Nik\u2019s  ileus . \u00a0  Now we\u2019re trying to figure out whether his new found  obsession with  love of eating is  compounding  things with the possible advent of food allergies and maybe even celiac disease. \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019ve gone from sleeping peacefully on most nights to not sleeping at all  many   most  every night. \u00a0  The bruises on Nik\u2019s poor little face and legs (he kicks himself in the right shin with his left heel) are so bad that it makes me cry and makes my husband feel ill. \u00a0  Just when one set starts to develop the soft blend of yellows, greens and purples, Nik gives himself some new ones to overlap in angry shades of blackish-purple. \u00a0  They are all very distinct in size and shape; I can pretty much map out which knuckles hit where from the patterns on his face. \u00a0 \u00a0 Nik\u2019s suddenly decided that going  anywhere  with his Daddy is only okay as long as I am there, too. \u00a0  The mere idea of getting into the car without me sends rivers of tears coursing down Nik\u2019s cheeks and he begins a plaintive chorus of  \u201cMa-ma-ma-ma!\u201d  \u2014complete with outstretched arms and clutching at my shirt when I lean in to kiss him goodbye.\u00a0 My radar is pinging frantically as I try to figure out a possible cause for this new behavior. \u00a0  His father and I know it is a communication but we are unable to figure out the underlying message so we simply muddle through. \u00a0 It seems that just as things settle a bit and we feel a little easier \u2014 Bam!  \u2014the other shoe drops and we\u2019re back in the fray. \u00a0  I hesitate to write much these days because things change so quickly that I can\u2019t keep up; I feel like I am writing fiction when I\u2019m trying relate  \u00a0 all the good things that have just happened and Nik is in the midst of blackening his own eye as I write or we\u2019ve had seven consecutive nights of no sleep. \u00a0  I guess you could say I am experiencing a bit of cognitive dissonance in the process. \u00a0 ************************* \u00a0 Somehow, even in the midst of the worst days, there are tiny glimmers of  hope  shining through. \u00a0 Nik\u2019s desire and ability to eat have absolutely skyrocketed! \u00a0  We were finally able to get his blood allergy testing done last Saturday and began giving Nik Allegra to help minimize any symptoms. \u00a0  [side note: It\u2019s not having any apparent impact on the accompanying symptoms.] \u00a0  Since then, we\u2019ve pretty much let Nik eat  whatever he wants ; within the span of one week, Nik\u2019s gone from eating a mere five percent by mouth to  inhaling  consuming more than fifty percent of his daily nutrition orally.  FIFTY PERCENT!  \u00a0 It\u2019s not just the increase in quantity either; that alone would make us very happy. \u00a0  No, Nik has simply decided: it\u2019s time and he knows how to eat. \u00a0  With a fork and spoon. \u00a0  Finger foods. \u00a0  Textures. \u00a0  He\u2019s teaching and challenging himself as he goes; we have not tried some of these things with him before and yet he has mastered them. \u00a0  It still boggles my mind. \u00a0 One of the nice things about Niksdad losing his job recently is that he is now home on weekends and we have opportunities for some wonderful family time. \u00a0  We had brunch at my parent\u2019s house on Sunday. \u00a0  Nik decided that would be a great day to show off his eating prowess for his grandparents. \u00a0  ************************* \u00a0 As I was setting up his booster seat \u2014 and apparently taking too long to suit him \u2014Nik launched himself head first into one of the cushy arm chairs at the table (we were dining on my parents closed-in porch with their generously proportioned patio furniture). \u00a0\u00a0 Rather than try to wrangle him while I was fixing his booster, I simply handed him one of his cooked pancakes. \u00a0  Really, I just assumed he would lick it and tear it into pieces that would end up either on the floor or the table to be cleaned up by the cat after we had gone. \u00a0  You can imagine my surprise and utter delight when he tore off a piece and stuffed it directly into his mouth! \u00a0  \u00a0 I still get kind of choked up thinking about it;  it\u2019s been a long, hard journey to get here. \u00a0 \u00a0 I thought the \u201cpancake incident\u201d was the  pinnacle ; it was just the beginning. \u00a0  During the course of the past few days \u2014in spite of his horrible nocturnal (and now occasional day time) episodes of pain \u2014Nik has surprised us by feeding himself without any assistance on more than one occasion. \u00a0  It\u2019s not perfect \u2014and it\u2019s certainly not neat \u2014but the confidence he exhibits and the gusto with which he eats is nothing short of amazing. \u00a0  And his palate seems to be limited only by the textures of the food; he\u2019s actually managed to bite into a piece of dry cereal without prompting \u2014or freaking out! \u00a0 ************************* Believe me when I say this odd juxtaposition of tremendous breakthroughs coupled with the debilitating pain is keeping us all more than a little off balance. \u00a0  Just when I think I can\u2019t take anymore, something happens to slow the pace a bit. Or, as was the case last weekend, something so wonderful happens that it helps restore some perspective and provides a boost of energy needed to keep going. \u00a0 My wonderful friends \u2014and I do consider them friends though we\u2019ve not (yet) met face to face \u2014sent me the most perfectly timed and thoughtful gift. \u00a0  I still cry when I re-read the note. \u00a0  With this amazing gift I have started to allow myself to think about doing things or having things I wouldn\u2019t otherwise allow myself to.; I\u2019ve gotten so good at sacrificing my needs for my family\u2019s needs. \u00a0  I don\u2019t mean that in a martyred, feel-sorry-for me sort of way. \u00a0  It\u2019s just what happens when you are the full time caregiver for a child with as many challenges as Nik has had in his short life. \u00a0  My friends, you totally get it and I love you for that. \u00a0  I am so grateful for the words of love and support and for the desire you had to reach out and remind me that we\u2019re all in this together. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000260.htm"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/give-and-take/", "title": "Give and Take"},

We saw Nik\u2019s beloved  Doctor Mary  this afternoon.\u00a0 It\u2019s true, she is beloved; she is the only doctor Nik will ever fully \u2014 and joyfully \u2014 cooperate with no matter how awful he may be feeling.\u00a0 He adores her and makes her laugh; it\u2019s a win-win social skills situation all the way around.\u00a0 But I digress. The results from the lab cultures will not be ready for a few more days; apparently the specific cultures Doctor Mary requested can take up to five days.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t think Nik has an infection, really; the severity of symptoms ebbs and flows \u2014from severe to nearly nonexistent\u2014 in the course of any given day.\u00a0 There is, thus far, always a slight lull after Nik\u2019s had a couple of really awful days full of explosive diarrhea.\u00a0 (What?? TMI?\u00a0 Try living with him for a while!) The abdominal x-ray \u2014which I must say Nik was an absolute champ for\u2014 showed no structural concerns but did show a significant amount of stool in the large bowel.\u00a0 At first blush, it appears that he is developing a bad case of\u00a0 constipation \u2014bordering on a partial obstruction. I won\u2019t go into graphic detail about what leads Doctor Mary to this conclusion.\u00a0 Imagine your kitchen drain being partially clogged; it still works, just a little slower.\u00a0 When it gets really bad, you have to, erm, help it along.\u00a0 Same thing with Nik.\u00a0 Of course, this doesn\u2019t address the underlying cause of the situation; one thing at a time. So, if I disappear over the next couple of days, though I hope not to, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s simply because things have gotten \u2014as the good doctor put it\u2014 \u201cworse before getting better.\u201d\u00a0 If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, we\u2019ll revisit the issue with Doctor Mary at the end of the week.\u00a0 She may want another x-ray to see just how bad things look.

{"date": "March 27, 2009 ", "body": "When a newborn baby comes home from the hospital, one bit of sage advice that is always given and seldom followed is this: \u201cSleep when the baby sleeps.\u201d I\u2019ve fought it for years, I confess.\u00a0 No more.\u00a0 The ongoing sleep deprivation campaign seems to be ramping up a notch or two this week.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s begun waking more and having more distinct cycles of pain and wakefulness. In fact, if I am able to stay calm and focused on his body\u2019s subtle cues, I can actually tell when a wave of pain is about to begin. So, I\u2019ve been going to bed earlier \u2014working my way down toward my goal time of 8:00 p.m.\u00a0 I\u2019m not naive enough to think I might actually catch up on sleep.\u00a0 No, this is merely an effort to stem the tide of utter exhaustion which threatens to become an actual danger.\u00a0 Lately, I find myself driving to or from an appointment with Nik and not really remembering how we got there.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t happen a lot \u2014only once or twice so far \u2014but even once is too many for my peace of mind. The allergy testing has not provided any insights; Nik\u2019s intestinal biopsy and blood tests don\u2019t show any clear signs of allergies.\u00a0 Skin scratch tests with actual foods (instead of the serum distillations) proved fruitless (sorry, couldn\u2019t resist!).\u00a0 This morning, we will find out if there\u2019s any skin reaction to prolonged contact exposure.\u00a0 Yes, poor Nik has been a trooper to put up with the large grid of food smears that has been taped to his back since Wednesday morning.\u00a0 That particular insult came on the heels of the scratch-test injury.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had to duct tape him into his clothing to keep him from reaching around to pull at the patch on his back. We managed to make it through the  maze of condescension of screening nurses who demanded a dozen different explanations of why Nik needed to be seen by the demi gods they serve and actually have an appointment with one of the senior endocrinologists on staff at the pediatric hospital we frequent.\u00a0 In all fairness to the doctor,\u00a0 the screening nurses do not work in his department and\u00a0 I have heard nothing but marvelous things about him; paramount of all I\u2019ve read and heard is that \u201che has a great bedside manner and he takes as much time as each patient needs.\u201d\u00a0 I hope to be able to report a positive encounter next week. More importantly, I hope the endocrinology line of inquiry yields some answers to help our family.\u00a0 If the doctor turns out to be a complete and utter  schmuck  but can help us \u2014I could live with that. I\u2019ve spent the past couple of days finally diving into the mountains of paperwork that are necessary to re-authorize nik\u2019s Medicaid each year.\u00a0 It is tedious, time consuming and, I confess, more than a tad depressing.\u00a0 Why is it that we put up with a system which requires painting one\u2019s child in such a depressing light just to qualify for services? Really.\u00a0 My child\u2019s diagnoses alone should qualify him for continued coverage under the same system which has covered him since birth.\u00a0 Is it really necessary to enumerate each and every little facet of the impact they have on his daily functioning?\u00a0 There is no dignity accorded to the disabled by our social services system. This week has been a busy one for Niksdad, too; his school schedule has been crazy \u2014including one full day of classes which rolled right into nighttime clinicals which kept him out of the house from seven in the morning until after eleven at night.\u00a0 We\u2019re both tired and hanging on. Only six more weeks until graduation. Whew. Meanwhile, Nik continues to be a superstar.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure he knows any other way to be, really.\u00a0\u00a0 Honestly, I don\u2019t know how he can function onas little sleep as he gets and yet \u2014he thrives.\u00a0 He\u2019s eating more varied foods and larger quantities \u2014though not really chewing still.\u00a0 He\u2019s vocalizing more sounds and testing the waters with attempts to say a couple of words like  cracker  or  more  with greater consistency.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s trying to string together multiple word requests with greater confidence and less prompting on many occasions. Nik is organizing his world into patterns and pairs and collections.\u00a0 He\u2019s even beginning to take note of other children inour weekly play groups.\u00a0 This week, with a lot of guidance, he actually cooperated with another child to complete a puzzle.\u00a0 He\u2019s obsessed with letters and numbers and looks for patterns everywhere.\u00a0 He is becoming a greater participant in his environment where he once was, at best, a nonchalant bystander \u2014not even an observer, really. When we\u2019re not eating meals together or on the road for Nik\u2019s numerous appointments, Nik will climb onto my lap with his Diego Rescue Pack in hand and a huge grin on his face.\u00a0 That\u2019s his way of asking me to play bouncy, silly games with him.\u00a0 He asks with such unabashed charm\u00a0 that I cannot resist, no matter how exhausted I may be. Similarly, Nik brings me his \u201cbroken\u201d toys \u2014the ones with the slurred, incoherent voices desperately in need of new batteries, the toys with the hidden switches still in the  off  position \u2014and signs  help  as he looks imploringly at me.\u00a0 His utter confidence that Mama can fix anything is both delightful and daunting. If only I could fix it all so easily. *sigh* The roller coaster ride continues.\u00a0 Keep your hands and feet inside, folks.

But I can\u2019t.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t.\u00a0 Sure, there are moments of breathtaking brilliance and dazzling progress\u2014 even a spot or two of calm.\u00a0 But there are chunks of days \u2014large portions of the week\u2014I feel like I\u2019m living in a two-part episode of  HOUSE. \u00a0 Except,\u00a0 the  second  episode \u2014the one where House and his fabulous but troubled team figure things out in the eleventh hour and the patient has a miraculous recovery \u2014either hasn\u2019t been written or produced.\u00a0 Or maybe it\u2019s the season finale \u2014the nail-biter, the\u00a0cliff-hanger.\u00a0 What we\u2019re left with is the  unrelenting  symptoms, the questions with no answers or the answers which beget more questions in  different  directions.\u00a0 Unfortunately, television shows seldom, if ever, show the unremitting reality of the lives of the patients\u2019 families.\u00a0 The daily tasks that have to be pushed aside  ad nauseum , the trips to the gym that are sacrificed, the laundry and house cleaning which piles up, or the sleep which is forever lost. They damn sure don\u2019t show the cracks\u00a0and strains on the relationships. \u00a0 The angry words uttered out of sheer exhaustion and frustration over a situation you neither asked for nor can control.\u00a0 The fear-driven anxiety which creates an atmosphere of such intensity that even sleep \u2014when it comes\u2014 is no longer refreshing.\u00a0 The utter despair\u2014 born of watching your innocent child suffer\u2014 that makes each partner feel lonely and isolated and creates doubt in a once solid foundation. The foundation is still solid because  we eliminated quitting on each other as an option all those years ago.\u00a0 No, truly, we consciously and deliberately did.\u00a0 Some days it is the  only  thing that carries us through.\u00a0 That and our vow to never go to bed angry or leave the house without a kiss and  \u201cI love you.\u201d \u00a0 To accomplish those things takes a shitload of time and energy and willingness to suck it up and compromise when all you want to do is rant and wail.\u00a0 But it\u2019s exactly that commitment which allows us to find our center again in the quiet moments.\u00a0  Thank God for that. But today? Today hasn\u2019t been pretty. Triggered by unholy frustration and anxiety over Nik\u2019s ever increasing pains, tensions have been running high.\u00a0 Last night was,  unquestionably , the absolute worst it\u2019s ever been for Nik and it trickled over to the morning.\u00a0\u00a0 The bright light of day reveals more bruises on Nik\u2019s sweet face and a few more to the collective spirit of his mama and daddy. The good news?\u00a0  There are no apparent food allergies. \u00a0 The bad news?\u00a0  There are no apparent food allergies. The good news?  Nik\u2019s  ileus  seems to be resolved and his gastric issues settling down.  The bad news?\u00a0  Same. The good news?  \u00a0Nik\u2019s eating like a champion lately! \u00a0 The bad news?\u00a0  The more he eats, the worse the episodes of face-pummeling, head-slamming pain seem to become \u2014both in frequency and intensity.\u00a0  Apparently not gastric in nature and apparently not allergy-driven either.\u00a0 Yet, it seems that there is some obscure connection that no one can suss out just yet.\u00a0 It just feels like the more we get information the farther we are from answers.\u00a0 And the more we may simply have to accept that there might not be a  knowable answer.\u00a0 That latter bit doesn\u2019t sit well with either Niksdad or me so we soldier on \u2014each on our own front and sometimes together, always\u00a0trying our best to maintain some semblance of  normal. *sigh* Now we have  more avenues  to explore and options to consider.\u00a0 Metabolic? Mechanical?\u00a0 Neurological? Neurological avenues include medications to prevent migraines.\u00a0 Those medications have significant side effects and potential long-term effects on the tremendous gains Nik has made.\u00a0 We want to keep that as a last resort but it feels like it is closing in on us faster and faster.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know how much longer we can let Nik go on like this while we search for answers. Metabolic causes?\u00a0 Possibly.\u00a0 If the episodes are driven by food \u201cintolerance\u201d then it becomes an issue of whether or not he has an enzyme issue which may contribute.\u00a0 There are definitely signs of autonomic nervous system \u201coverdrive\u201d when these episodes happen.\u00a0 Could there be some hormonal or other imbalance?\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 I think it\u2019s definitely time to schedule an appointment with an endocrinologist. Mechanical issues?\u00a0 Signs of sinus and congestion issues that don\u2019t seem to be virus, bacterial, or allergy-driven lead us to wonder if Nik may be somehow refluxing micro particles of food or if there\u2019s something aberrant in his swallowing mechanics.\u00a0 Previous swallow studies looked okay but they were all done long before Nik developed any real intentional, focused tongue movement.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already talked about this with Nik\u2019s wonderful speech therapist, Miss M, and she is looking into scheduling a swallow study.

He settled much quicker than he usually does. \u00a0  The pain seemed just as intense but more fleeting. \u00a0 I need to back up a bit and tell you about our visit to Nik\u2019s  beloved Doctor Mary  yesterday afternoon. \u00a0  Ostensibly, the visit was mostly for a weight check to see how he\u2019s doing on putting back the weight he lost while fighting with his  recent ileus . \u00a0  He\u2019s regained about ten ounces out of  three and a half pounds  lost. \u00a0  Not bad considering it\u2019s just as unhealthy for him to regain it too quickly. \u00a0  Doctor Mary was pleased with that.\u00a0 Still, he doesn\u2019t have any reserves to withstand more losses. \u00a0 Doctor Mary was  not pleased  with the way Nik looks overall, though. \u00a0  She\u2019s right; he looks better than he did ten days ago but he still doesn\u2019t look like my robust, healthy, rambunctious little guy that she\u2019s grown to love. \u00a0  We discussed our thoughts and observations about the changing nature of Nik\u2019s  nocturnal waking  and his possible food allergies. \u00a0  So much hinges on the results of those  blood allergy tests ; we hope to have results within the week. \u00a0 Nik has made such great progress in his ability to communicate about his pain; he can now sign  \u201cyes\u201d  if I ask if there\u2019s a pain in his head or belly and he can also place my hand on the source of his pain. \u00a0  Lately, in the middle of the night, he indicates the pain is in his head; he usually takes both of my hands and wraps them around his temples and forehead and squeezes tightly to indicate a desire for deep pressure. \u00a0  Often, these episodes are then followed by painful and difficult gas. \u00a0  Occasionally, during the day, they seem to be preceded by eating. \u00a0 Doctor Mary voiced a concern about  abdominal migraines  which may or may not be allergy driven. \u00a0  Until we have the test results it\u2019s difficult to isolate a potential cause. \u00a0  However, the nature and timing of the episodes do seem to indicate some sort of migraine activity. \u00a0  It stands to reason that Nik is more subject to migraines as they run in families and both my mother and I get terrible migraines. \u00a0 Once we know the results of the allergy tests, we will pursue that avenue with our neurologist, the wonderful Doctor G (not  that one ,  this one ). \u00a0  I suspect it will be a bit before we hit on the right answers but it certainly feels like we are moving in the right direction now. \u00a0 Meanwhile, Nik continues to flat out  stupefy  us with some of his remarkable gains in eating. \u00a0  He is now consistently eating  at least fifty percent  of his daily nutrition by mouth and is learning the mechanics of chewing. \u00a0  Right now he\u2019s in the  \u201cmunching\u201d  stage \u2014where the jaw simply goes up and down and mashes the food as much as possible. \u00a0  His desire for greater variety and textures in foods is difficult to keep up with as I try to balance safety from choking with his desire to stuff his cheeks like a little chipmunk and work things through for himself. \u00a0 Last night\u2019s dinner tipped the balance. \u00a0  Nik had already eaten his dinner and was sitting at the table with us as we ate our salads and steak. \u00a0  Nik always likes a taste of whatever is on our plates so I wasn\u2019t surprised when he signed  \u201cmore, please\u201d  as he looked longingly at the juicy sirloin on my plate. \u00a0  Grudgingly, I sliced off a thick piece \u2014about the size of my index finger\u2014 and sacrificed it to  the eating machine  Nik. \u00a0 Much like  the pancake incident , I expected Nik to simply lick and make feeble attempts to bite the piece of meat and then drop it on the floor for our two greedy cats to fight over. \u00a0  Apparently \u2014 AGAIN \u2014 I was wrong; Nik stuffed the strip of steak into his mouth and closed his teeth around it.\u00a0 He proceeded to bite off a large hunk of meat which he then spent a good ten to fifteen minutes munching and trying to figure out how to break it down to swallow. \u00a0  Optimist that he is, Nik even asked for  \u201cmore\u201d  while he sat chewing. \u00a0 He never did quite figure out the actual chewing but he managed to create a nice mashed, pulpy mass which Niksdad had to extract before we let him down from the table. \u00a0  Nik expressed his displeasure quite vociferously! \u00a0  I think he would have been happy to sit there all night working on that one bit of meat. \u00a0  I suspect it won\u2019t be much longer before he figures it out. \u00a0 In addition to his steak, Nik had quite a bit of mashed potatoes, turkey and carrots \u2014leftovers from our dinner out on Thursday. \u00a0  Most of his evening nutrition was  eaten  instead of pumped \u2014though he did have a small bit of formula and water to make sure he was sufficiently full to make it through the night. \u00a0  I think that made a big difference in his sleeping and in the lesser degree of his pain last night. \u00a0 While we wait for the allergy results and wait to figure out the headache aspect of all of this, we\u2019re trying to keep Nik on a mostly gluten and dairy free diet. \u00a0  We don\u2019t do this because it\u2019s an alleged  \u201dcure\u201d  for autism but simply because it seems to make his overall system more comfortable. \u00a0  I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an actual autism-gut connection (the evidence is inconclusive and motly anecdotal at this point); Nik\u2019s gut issues pre-date his autism diagnosis by  years  as he was born with an  intestinal malrotation  and has a  \u201cshort gut\u201d  resulting from corrective surgery. \u00a0  We simply do what we do because it works for Nik. \u00a0 Overall, I think I am seeing the gradual return of my happy-go-lucky, rascally little boy. \u00a0  Each day is a bit more energetic and holds more laughter and music. \u00a0  There are  moments  that make me worry but those are far fewer than even a week ago. \u00a0  The fact that Nik awoke with songs and laughter today does wonders for my spirits, too. \u00a0 That kid\u2019s sure\u00a0 my   all star !

After much waiting in the ER last night \u2014the hospital is so busy they actually had to reroute ambulances to other hospitals \u2014we finally got into a room around 2:30 in the morning. Then the real fun began. I won\u2019t provide details as it would be entirely too gross. Nik\u2019s intestines stopped moving things through and they need to empty him out, get him restarted and then figure out the reason why it happened. More importantly, they need to help us keep it from happening again. So, right now I\u2019m running on little more than fumes and the\u00a0support of all of you, my dear readers and friends. Nik seems to be doing well; he\u2019s in moderate discomfort but his belly is soft again and things are definitely moving!

The hardest part is keeping Nik\u2019s frustration levels low and boredom at bay. That\u2019s not easy on a normal day but throw in the sleep deprivation and, well, I know you understand. The gastroenterologist told me this morning that Nik may simply be more susceptible to motility issues when he gets stressed or ill; he blames it on the very unusual arrangement of Nik\u2019s intestines and bowels. It looks like we may have to do a few things differently \u2014though we dont\u2019 know what just yet\u2014 and keep a very close eye on on Nik\u2019s bowel habits.

{"date": "September 13, 2008 ", "body": "It\u2019s been a beastly week around here in terms of Nik\u2019s Lamictal withdrawal.  As the dose tapers downward and the cognitive abilities soar upward \u2014well, it\u2019s a  delicate balance  and something\u2019s got to give, right?  Nik\u2019s decided sleep is the thing most easily dispensed with; only trouble is he didn\u2019t ask  my  opinion on the matter.  I am firmly in the camp of those who feel that sleep is non-negotiable.  Unfortunately for me, he\u2019s a master negotiator. I\u2019ve been tired and whiny; my body is out of kilter and my moods have been swinging like Foucault\u2019s Pendulum in a storm of magnetic particles.  Niksdad has been buried in schoolwork, clinicals, and paying work; on his one day off he is ensconced in books and \u2014much as I love him dearly \u2014utterly useless in providing any sort of break for me.  In a desperate attempt to minimize some of the middle-of-the-night energy surges and sensations which have been waking Nik between one and three each morning and lasting for several hours \u2014or which simply result in  starting our day  at those insanely early hours\u2014 we\u2019ve shifted Nik\u2019s med schedule a bit.  Unfortunately, it seems to have a strong impact on  either  the middle of the night or bedtime; a bit of a watered down Sophie\u2019s Choice, if you will. Today, with the shift in the schedule and the subsequent slight (and I mean  ever so slight ) overlap in doses, Nik\u2019s broken out into  THE RASH  again. Good gracious! It\u2019s getting to the point that I\u2019d be just as happy to stop the meds cold turkey and tough it out for a week or so.  At the rate we\u2019re going \u2014given the upsurge of undesirable symptoms which accompany each dose adjustment \u2014this hell could last another twelve weeks.  Unless something seriously changes, this mama isn\u2019t going to make it that far. Of course, the flip side to all of this is the sudden increase in Nik\u2019s appetite, social interactions, blossoming personality, and expressive language.  He\u2019s taken to drinking Danimals yogurt drinks in lieu of a snack via his feeding tube; he\u2019s even allowed me to feed him Greek-style yogurt (which is quite thick, like sour cream) with cherry puree mixed in \u2014and  let the spoon enter his mouth  instead of just licking it.  He\u2019s learning to identify colors and shapes and sort things (some).  He\u2019s requested toys and his shoes completely spontaneously \u2014 and in context ; he\u2019s beginning to master the ability to make choices; he expresses  \u201cNo!\u201d  \u2014perhaps not so articulately as I\u2019d like but  very clearly ; he\u2019s helping to clean up his toys, taking turns, and learning to wait.  It seem as if things are happening so rapidly that it\u2019s hard for me to keep up and remember all the changes! But the greatest gift for me in watching Nik\u2019s rapid development is his sense of humor; he has an apparent love of the absurd.

PETA is misinforming the public about autism and thus joining a long line of unscrupulous groups that have sought to try and spread fear about autism as a means of pushing their particular agendas. Attempts such as these treat individuals with disabilities as pawns in the efforts of other constituencies. By refusing to acknowledge the right of the autistic community to be referred to with respect instead of as the focus of public hysteria, PETA contributes to a state of affairs which marginalizes the disability community. People with disabilities, our families and our supporters deserve better than the exploitation and fear-mongering that comes about when disability is used as a means of scaring the general populace. For millions across the globe, the answer to  PETA\u2019s  \u201cGot Autism?\u201d question is an unequivocal yes. That should not spell the end of our lives or prevent us from being fully included throughout society. By exploiting us, PETA becomes a culprit in the social forces that marginalize people with disabilities and lead to the discrimination and prejudice that truly disable us.

{"date": "October 6, 2008 ", "body": "Lately, I\u2019ve noticed that Nik has some difficulty with specific control over individual fingers; he still does not point and has some difficulty isolating his index finger to poke things with any consistency. Not surprising is that he also has trouble turning his wrists outward. He can roll them in toward each other just fine. I don\u2019t know if this is a permanent feature due to his cerebral palsy or if it\u2019s something that can be helped with OT. Only time and effort will tell for sure.\n Meanwhile, it does make for some interesting sign language. As with most kids who are learning signs for the first time, Nik tends to modify many of the signs to suit his physical ability. Children tend to learn the signs which come in toward their bodies sooner or easier than those which reach away from them. For example,  more \u2014 which is signed by tapping your thumb and fingertips of both hands together \u2014is easier for a child to sign than  play  which is signed by folding the middle three fingers down so the thumb and little finger make a \u201cY\u201d then gently rocking them back and forth. \n But I digress with my rudimentary sign instruction! \n Nik\u2019s picked up lots of signs since we began using the  Signing Time  videos several months ago; rather, I should say he\u2019s picked up lots of  words . The signs, well, many of them look kind of similar. I like to think of them as multipurpose signs. I don\u2019t know if Nik signs this way because it\u2019s physically easier or if it\u2019s mentally easier \u2014he already knows the one sign and \u201cthe other is sorta kinda similar\u2026\u201d but not really. Here are Nik\u2019s  equivalents : \n Please = Yes More = Shoes Book = Open Share = Show Me Bye-Bye = Play \n He also knows how to sign  eat, apple, cat , and  cheese  (gotta love that  Silly Pizza Song !). He understands many more signs such as  sit, stop, no, drink, wait, ready, up, down, outside, want, diaper, toy, car,  and others. \n I\u2019ve been working with him to learn some signs for other toys he has so he can be more specific in his requests; it\u2019s challenging when he stands at the armoire and looks up at that basket and simply signs  please.  So it was with great delight that I watched him express a desire for a different toy this weekend \u2014a ball \u2014one he doesn\u2019t yet have a sign for.  This request was unusual because he doesn\u2019t\u2019 generally care to play with balls, though this  particular  ball holds him in thrall. I started to try to teach him the sign for ball; basically you cup your hands loosely and touch the fingertips together suggesting the shape of a ball.\n Again, Nik had difficulty manipulating his fingers so he improvised. Here\u2019s his newest equivalent:   Ball  is now the same as\u2026 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Cheese! \n That\u2019s a mighty big cheese ball! ( Cheese  is signed by mashing your palms together and slightly twisting them.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Not to be confused with a big cheese of another sort\u2026 \n \n \n \n (Taken 10/03/08 at  this event .) \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.signingtime.com/", "http://www.signingtime.com/signing-time-songs-vol-1-3-music-cd/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SOo-X5VagCI/AAAAAAAAA5k/EjuGyVU3B2k/s1600-h/yellow+ball.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SOo-YDUisKI/AAAAAAAAA5s/3DwaiRJ2BBQ/s1600-h/cheese+ball.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SOpIr8ictoI/AAAAAAAAA50/G21HBlt-l3c/s1600-h/Nik+with+Joe+Biden.jpg", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/10/called-to-duty.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/10/06/big-cheese/", "title": "Big Cheese"},
{"date": "October 8, 2008 ", "body": "Thank you to everyone who  signed the petition  and helped spread the word on the  grossly offensive billboards created by PETA . Due to the overwhelming negative response, the billboard has been removed\u2026by the advertiser! Again, Ari Ne\u2019eman articulates it more clearly so I\u2019ll let him do it for me: ********************************************************** Hello everyone, I am happy to announce that PETA\u2019s recent, \u201cGot Autism?\u201d billboard has been  removed  by the advertising company hosting it. The billboard misinformed the public about the autism spectrum by falsely implying that milk consumption was the cause of autism. Such advertising contributes to a state of public hysteria about the autism spectrum, fueling the fear and resulting prejudice that marginalizes us from society at large. It is unacceptable for autistic people, our families and supporters to be used as instruments in PETA\u2019s political agenda or that of any other unscrupulous interest group. Our community  came together  to communicate the need for a swift withdrawal of this ill-informed piece of advertising, and I\u2019m pleased to say that were able to achieve a swift result. That we were able to accomplish this so quickly and effectively speaks well for the autistic community and the cross-disability rights movement. Thank you all for your support. If you\u2019d still like to indicate to PETA the need to avoid exploiting the autistic community in its future advertising, you can write to them at  info@peta.org  as well as call them at 757-622-7382 and dial 0. You can also sign our  petition  on this topic, further indicating to PETA and the world that it does not pay to try to attack and exploit the autistic and cross-disability communities. Incidents like this show the need for a strong and activist autistic self-advocacy movement, working closely with the broader disability rights community. By uniting on issues like this one, we can work to address the persistent biases that pervades the public discourse about autism in specific and disability in general. As we speak,  the blind community  is uniting against false and offensive depictions of their community in the new movie, \u201cBlindness\u201d. Over the last few months, disability rights activists from all parts of the community came together to fight against  outdated and damaging portrayals of people with intellectual disabilities  in the movie, \u201cTropic Thunder\u201d. Less than a year ago, the disability community  united  behind our  successful effort  to stop the NYU Child Study Center\u2019s \u201cRansom Notes\u201d ad campaign, which portrayed children with disabilities as kidnap victims. Like any other community, we have the right to be treated with respect, in media, in service-delivery and in all aspects of society. While responses to offensive depictions of disability in popular culture are not the only battle in the broader struggle for equity, inclusion, quality of life and opportunity for all people with disabilities, this issue must remain an important priority. Culture helps to shape the reality we live in. By challenging the exploitative and offensive public discourse on disability we find today, we can advance a broader agenda for disability rights. The disability community is on the march and we will not be stopped. Thank you once again for your effective action on this issue. I look forward to working with all of you once again in the future.

{"date": "January 3, 2009 ", "body": "I\u2019d like to be able to report that the ringing in of a new year coincided with the ushering out of many of the  mysterious pains  and  ailments  which seem to have beset Nik in the past couple of years. Alas, it would be but a fantasy. Instead, I  can  tell you that he and I were awake to celebrate the arrival of 2009 in the Eastern, Central, Pacific, and Hawaii time zones.\n Based on Nik\u2019s behavior at some of those times, I can only imagine the fireworks that must have been going off inside his head. Much of the time was spent with attempts to sooth and comfort Nik out of his face-punching, head banging, back-arching behaviors. \n Behaviors.  I am so reluctant to use that word to describe what I know, as sure as I breathe, is a visceral response to pain.  Behaviors  \u2014with a capital B, as denoted by numerous professionals who are unable to see the forest of my child through the trees of his manifestations \u2014don\u2019t wake a child from a sound sleep with a violent, panicked and self-injurious start.  Behaviors  don\u2019t respond to Advil or to homeopathic remedies for nerve irritation. \n No one can really say what\u2019s going on with Nik at this point. Even his  beloved Doctor Mary  is scratching her head in bewilderment. Though she is willing to explore any avenue we think might be helpful, her clinical knowledge base is,  by her own admission,  too broad to be able to hone in on which of the myriad tests to order. Given the difficulty Nik seems to have putting on weight \u2014he\u2019s not gained but a  half pound  in six months \u2014and some other symptoms including manifestation of  Raynaud\u2019s-like  characteristics, we need to rule out any endocrine or metabolic causes (likely autoimmune causes already being ruled out by testing). Our next step is to find an endocrinologist for a consult. \n Our  fabulous neurologist  is also willing to explore any number of possibilities. He\u2019s mentioned some things which seem to fit and make some sense but which also require the use of  systemic  medications which affect the central nervous system. Granted, the medications in question aren\u2019t necessarily as potent as the  seizure medications  Nik was taking but they are  not without risk . It\u2019s immaterial; history has shown us that  Nik does not respond well  to any type of medicine which alters the functioning of his central nervous system. Niksdad and I loathe going down that road  blindly ; we want to explore the metabolic and endocrine possibilities first \u2014as well as any other non-pharmaceutical \u2014or more chemically benign\u2014 options. \n It\u2019s not we are against medications; truly, we\u2019re not. We just know that  Nik\u2019s body doesn\u2019t handle them well ; we want to avoid any scenarios in which we are left wondering \u2014yet again\u2014whether the symptoms are part of the underlying issue or are side effects from the treatment. And, frankly, Nik\u2019s had more medicines pumped through his body in the past five years than most people take in a lifetime. The strain on all his bodily systems has been enormous. \n In the meantime, though, it is a daily watch under  Damocles\u2019 Sword . The watching and wondering if today will be the day that Nik\u2019s pain will  not  respond or if it will last longer than a few minutes at a time. Will he be able to focus on a task or play for more than a few minutes before he is scrunching his eyes and vigorously poking at them? Will it be during the day or in the middle of the night that the searing pain causes him to thrash and howl as he bangs his head with his fists or with a toy? Will today be the day he stumbles blindly to fall, yet again, head first into the hard edge of a piece of furniture. \n Or, will today be a day  free  of the mysterious sensations which cause him to claw at his head to the point of rawness? Will he play with carefree abandon at the park, climbing like a little mountain goat? Will he sing the sounds of letters to me as we play together on the floor, building towers toward the sky? Will he feel well enough to eat me out of house and home? \n I know that no one\u2019s days are ever  fully  predictable; they are, however, by and large, filled with routine which bring comfort or respite. Time in which one is able to take a moment to breathe easily and know their child is safe. Our days used to have a moderately predictable rhythm to them. Now, the only thing I can predict is that  I can no longer predict . \n Nik is showing signs of a  tremendous developmental surge ; he\u2019s  learning more letters by sound  and beginning to identify them on sight. He\u2019s showing marked interest and facility in  eating by mouth . His motor skills are meshing nicely with increased depth perception to allow him to play in ways he hasn\u2019t been able to. He\u2019s showing some slight comprehension of numbers \u2014enough to be able to successfully show me certain ones on request about half the time. His desire to play with me or with Niksdad has increased to the point that it  might  border on obsessive; we have to plot our escape from the room sometimes before he can latch on to one of us. \n While  Christmas presents don\u2019t hold any real significance  for Nik, he\u2019s shown a great interest in unwrapping the gifts and understands that the item inside the paper is as fascinating as the paper can be. He shows eagerness to explore all of his new toys, though  his dump truck  is the hands-down favorite. Nik has even been willing to allow me to push and cajole him into persisting with a game or task until it is completed. Not always  willingly , but to completion. Then we celebrate his success and he is happy and willing once more. \n We continue to make progress in substituting his green chewy tube for toys in his mouth when he is working or playing. He will now actively seek out \u201cchewy\u201d when I ask him to and will use it for several minutes before he reverts to biting on a toy. Small steps, big gains. \n I confess there is a part of me that is very worried about the effect of systemic drugs on Nik\u2019s abilities. His motor abilities will always be in question due to his underlying cerebral palsy; is Nik unstable on his feet some days more than others because that is the nature of his CP or is it from something else? His cognitive abilities have blossomed since we took him off of the seizure medications and have been a source of great delight \u2014to him as well as to us;  Nik recognizes the progress he\u2019s made  and tries to build upon it. I see the improvement in his  ability to retain and retrieve  certain kinds of information without as much scaffolding or as many prompts as he once needed. I worry that the medication would take that away from him and create frustration in place of his sense of self confidence. \n So, yes, it is a new year filled with new hopes and dreams; but, as those  ghosts of the season  do, they carry along with them the baggage \u2014the sticky  ectoplasm \u2014 of all that has come before. I cannot seem to find the promise of the new under the burden of the old. And yet,  I know it exists ; I know it will make itself manifest in due time. That is simply the way of the universe, isn\u2019t it? \n That\u2019s The Way of The World (Maurice White/ Charles Stepney/ Verdine White) \n Hearts of fire creates love desire Take you high and higher to the world you belong Hearts of fire creates love desire High and higher to your place on the throne \n We\u2019ve come together on this special day To sing our message loud and clear Looking back we\u2019ve touched on sorrowful days Future pass, they disappear \n You will find peace of mind If you look way down in your heart and soul Don\u2019t hesitate \u2019cause the world seems cold Stay young at heart cause you\u2019re never (never, never) old at heart \n That\u2019s the way of the world Plant your flower and you grow a pearl A child is born with a heart of gold The way of the world makes his heart grow cold  ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SV9_xTSTQhI/AAAAAAAABYo/5f9SM8kvyZ4/s1600-h/NewYear2009_1.jpg", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/paging-doctor-house.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/05/solace.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-doctor.html", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/raynauds-disease/DS00433/DSECTION=causes", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/12/floating-on-hope.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/09/leaving-lamictal.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/07/free-at-last.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/07/free-at-last.html", "http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/ciceroworkslatin/f/DamoclesSword.htm", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-presence.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-presence.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/11/moveable-feast-of-sort.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/ghosts-of-season.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-presence.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/ghosts-of-season.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/all-i-really-need-to-know-i-learned.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRug8pJL5WI"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/01/03/finding-our-way/", "title": "Finding Our Way"},

Some good, some not so good, and lots of in-between. The words seem to be all jammed up inside of me lately and I can\u2019t quite get them out to tell you about so much that\u2019s happening. Weaning  Nik  from his seizure  meds .  I\u2019m trying to put together a post that captures some important information I hope will be useful to other parents. Not in a \u201cGee, look at our awful experience, please feel sorry for my child\u201d way; more along the lines of \u201cHoly crap, we never knew these things could ever happen and no one ever warns you.

I will say this though \u2014 the side effects from weaning the  meds  are every bit as bad as they were on the upswing.  Sleeping through the night \u2014once the hallmark of  Nik\u2019s  good health and stellar disposition \u2014has basically become a thing of the distant past.  He seems to sleep through the night once roughly every two weeks; just enough to tease me with a small burst of energy and the feeling that \u201cOkay, this isn\u2019t so bad; I can make it through now.\u201d  Then \u201cWHAM!\u201d along comes a spate of really bad nights.

The brief spurts of energy I do have I use to visit other\u2019s blogs, Tweet, or do some  research  online.

We stayed up and partied all night long every night and then clung together like Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio on the  Titanic . Well, truth be told, Nik clung and I just sank.  I\u2019ve never seen him  so sick and miserable  before. \n Folks, we\u2019re talking about a child who spent 209 days in the NICU and has gone through countless surgeries \u2014granted, he had the benefit of some really groovy drugs for those. He would not let me out of his sight. He spent the better part of the past two days laying on top of me. If I had to get up to go to the bathroom or into the kitchen \u2014both of which are within sight of the family room and are only a few feet away (hey, our house is pretty small) \u2014Nik would follow me and cling to my pants.  \n When I gently pushed him out of the way of the gate as it closed, separating us for a mere minute or two, Nik would convulse with shrieks and wails, he\u2019d bang his head on the gate and claw at his already tender ear. It was pathetic and heart-stoppingly frightening at the same time. \n What on earth had become of my happy-go-lucky independent kid who was always content to hang out and play by himself? What could possibly have happened to cause such angst and anxiety in a mere five year old? I still don\u2019t have the answer to that one. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a  temporary  aberration. \n Today, however, after three days of antibiotics, there is a sliver of sunlight shining through. I have been able to leave the room for brief periods. Nik fussed but didn\u2019t melt down. And, despite having been up nearly all night (I think only sleeping from 8 p.m. to 9:30, then again from 10:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. qualifies; I only slept the latter portion of that stint), Nik has been in remarkably good spirits. He has been content to play with his toys again. For the past two days they have all been completely ignored in favor of mama\u2019s lap. Whew. \n The fever seems to have broken but the tongue is still sporting its lovely white coat with pink spots indicative of strep throat \u2014which he may have picked up from his cousin last week, we think. We\u2019ll be partying with our pals Advil and Mucinex for a while longer, I think. \n As for me? Well, I joked about having a party with  my  friends Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir and, possibly, Jose Cuervo. Sorry guys, Mama\u2019s too pooped to party! \n As you were.

The rest is just damned inconvenience.  \n \n Eating, sleeping, and being regular can go a long way toward making one happy. \n Doctors are often wrong.  \n A mother\u2019s intuition should not be dismissed.  \n Adversity can make a couple stronger but it must be a conscious decision.  \n Parenthood doesn\u2019t end when your child leaves home.  \n Mama can still kiss away the hurts after 45 years.  \n The bond between a grandparent and child is like no other. \n It\u2019s never too late for a new start.  \n When you think you can\u2019t go on one more minute, one more step \u2014yes, you can.  \n Sometimes, the simpler the toy, the greater the joy.  \n No toy can compare to time spent with the ones you love.  \n A child\u2019s smile really can lighten a heavy heart. \n Music and love really are universal languages.  \n The world will not always accept me but my child will.  \n Even when I don\u2019t think so, I am somebody\u2019s hero.  \n It\u2019s nice to be depended upon.  \n Pain and sorrow, joy and ecstasy \u2014these things cannot exist one without the other.  \n Fierce advocacy and limitless love can go hand in hand.  \n Life does not have to be an \u201ceither/or\u201d proposition.  \n Children watch, listen, and learn even when you think they aren\u2019t.  \n An old dog can learn new tricks and a leopard can change its spots. \n There is no \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d which will close; each day brings new opportunities for growth and learning \u2014no matter what your age or ability.  \n There is no greater sound than that of your own child\u2019s laughter.  \n There is power in prayer \u2014even if you aren\u2019t religious; the act of intentionality carries great weight in the universe.  \n Miracles do happen; the best ones happen in little ways every day.  \n Life is really, really good if you decide it is. \n \n Happy Birthday to my darling son, Nikolas. You are a gift to be treasured. Mommy & Daddy love you just the way you are.

{"date": "February 1, 2009 ", "body": "\n His cries echo in the darkness; the witching hour has begun again. Each night it\u2019s the same routine; he beckons with his plaintive cries as he bangs his head on the side of the crib. Some nights it\u2019s as simple as soothing him with a touch \u2014a gentle rub on his back, a firm pressure over the right side of his head.  \n \n Usually, he will settle fairly quickly and hover at the edge of sleep, held there by the warmth of my hand. If I move too soon, the spell is broken and he startles, frantically clutching at my arm, imploring me to stay. Knowing how little he asks of me, I settle in like the sentinel I am, keeping the discomfort at bay with the only weapon I have \u2014my unflinching, consuming love for him.\n I enter the room to find Nik sitting, propped up by the side of the crib. His cries sound the same but his rocking \u2014his punching himself as he seesaws back and forth alternately slamming first his forehead then the back of his head against the crib \u2014is different. In the dim glow of the nightlight, I can see the splash of tears on his cheeks, the dark splotches on the sheet where fat, hot, frantic tears have cascaded down in the darkness. \n \u201cMama\u2019s here, baby. Mama\u2019s here. Shhh, it\u2019s ok, lovey. Mommy\u2019s going to make it better.\u201d  My throat constricts as I choke back my own hot tears. He needs my strength right now; there will be time for me to cry later. I quickly unzip the crib tent and lower the side, reaching in to pull his little boy form into my arms. He sits with his back against my chest, the lowered wall of the crib between us. I wrap my arms around him and press my head against his. \n His head continues to rock forward and back as if he\u2019s seeking some sort of release or some sensory input that will change whatever uncomfortable sensations he is having. I feel the heaviness of his skull as it thumps against my chest. I whisper soft words to him, hoping they bring him ease. The rocking begins to slow as I gently start to sway side to side with him. He squeezes his delicate hands together \u2014 \u201cHelp me, Mama,\u201d  they say to me. It\u2019s a gesture we\u2019ve recently begun to use when he asks for help during play as well. I am momentarily stunned at his presence of mind and ability to retrieve this particular gesture just now. \n \u201cShow Mama what hurts, baby. Let me help you,\u201d  I croon softly against his hair. My own fat, hot, anxious tears flow now; I cannot hold them in. He puts my hand on his forehead and presses. Instinctively, I begin to rub back and forth in the same gentle motion I used when he was just a slip of a scrap of a baby in the hospital. I would sit for hours, gently stroking across his forehead \u2014 willing  him to feel the love and strength in my fingertips. Nik sighs and settles against me, his wiry form relaxing in my embrace, head nodding forward \u2014toward the precipice of sleep. \n These are the moments I wish he were a tiny baby again so I could scoop him into my arms and shelter him against my bosom. I\u2019d breathe in the softness of his skin and the gold in his hair. My whole body would drink him in and fill him with healing light and strength. I would rock him into restful ease. Instead, I can only will all those things to flow through my arms and my fingertips, hoping he feels it just the same. \n Nik slumps against my arm. As I gently lay him down, he startles; reflexively, he reaches for my hand.  \u201cShh, I\u2019m right here, angel. Mama\u2019s right here. I won\u2019t leave yet, I promise.\u201d  He curls his long limbs into a tight little ball \u2014one hand tucked between his knees and the other laying upturned next to his cheek. He accepts my hand into his soft, spindly grasp. My thumb rests against his cheek as he snuffles and begins to settle. I can feel the moment when he slips gently over the edge of consciousness. \n His deep, even breaths tell me he is at peace \u2014for now. I gently lift the side of the crib and secure the tent before returning to the warmth of my bed. Settling in next to my slumbering husband, I am unable to go back to sleep right away. One thought keeps echoing in my brain:  \u201cHe asks so little.\u201d   \n \n All he wants is the simple, soothing touch of my hand in the fitful, frightful darkness. I want to give him  more ; I want to make the need go away. I  need  to make the need go away. \n \n I cannot rest until I do. \n *********************************** \n \n Wipe those tears away from your eyes Just take my hand you don\u2019t have to cry it\u2019ll be alright I\u2019ll make it alright Don\u2019t let the world get you down Reach for the love that\u2019s all around It\u2019ll be alright baby we\u2019ll make it alright\n I\u2019ll pick you up when you\u2019re feeling down I\u2019ll put your feet back on solid ground I\u2019ll pick you up and I\u2019ll make you strong I\u2019ll make you feel like you still belong Cause it\u2019s alright, yeah it\u2019s alright let me make it alright, make it alright \n Stay with me tonight, stay with me tonight Sometimes the words well their just not enough Afraid of feeling and in need of love To make it alright, baby, I\u2019ll make it alright Where will you run to where will you hide I know the pain comes from deep down inside but it\u2019ll be alright baby we\u2019ll make it alright Baby Let me make it alright, Make it alright Let me make it alright, Make it alright \n Stay with me tonight, stay with me tonight It\u2019s alright, yeah it\u2019s alright It\u2019s alright, yeah it\u2019s alright It\u2019s alright, Stay with me tonight I\u2019ll pick you up when you\u2019re feeling down I\u2019ll put your feet back on solid ground I\u2019ll pick you up and I\u2019ll make you strong I\u2019ll make you feel like you still belong \n Cause it\u2019s alright, yeah it\u2019s alright let me make it alright, make it alright Stay with me tonight, stay with me tonight \n It\u2019s alright, yeah it\u2019s alright It\u2019s alright, yeah it\u2019s alright It\u2019s alright, Stay with me tonight It\u2019s alright, yeah it\u2019s alright It\u2019s alright, yeah it\u2019s alright It\u2019s alright, Stay with me tonight. \n Alright by Reamonn ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SYXWDCZmo4I/AAAAAAAABcY/4UNUr2lsUus/s1600-h/luna.bmp", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_tyJU5doV0"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/luna/", "title": "Luna"},
{"date": "September 1, 2008 ", "body": "One of the things we\u2019re learning on the fly around here is that drugs which affect the central nervous system do so in myriad and unpredictable ways. Similarly, you would think that if  x dose  going up created  side effect y  that the same would hold true for a decrease, as well. Trust me when I tell you  that thinking will bite you in the ass. I\u2019ve alluded it to it in previous posts; we are in the process of weaning Nik from the  last  of his seizure medications. It is a slow and very painstaking process; it is also highly unpredictable. By that, I mean that Nik\u2019s bodily response is unpredictable and, frequently, very extreme. All of the  mystery pains and most of the non-specific illnesses  which have plagued Nik for more than a year and a half now can,  we are certain , be traced to side effects from his  Lamictal . I cannot possibly begin to express my outrage and frustration over that fact in a single blog. The time and energy Niksdad and I spent taking Nik to doctor after doctor,  waiting for specialists that never bothered to call us back or send a report summarizing our long awaited visit , the revolving door of neurologists consulted who wanted to simply throw more medication at the symptoms without considering that  medication might be the root of the problem ; it all leaves me sick and resentful that my child had to suffer so much. It took Nik\u2019s  rash scare earlier this summer  \u2014and subsequent total cessation of Lamictal as a precaution against  Stevens-Johnson Syndrome  \u2014for Niksdad and I to make the connection between some of Nik\u2019s sporadically irritable or distressed behaviors and the Lamictal. We  got our degrees from Google U  researched as much as we could about Lamictal. We finally had to download the  complete prescribing information from the GSK website ; no one ever provided us with such overwhelmingly, mind-numbingly complete information; but it was exactly what we needed. As we educated ourselves \u2014about such things as  time to peak ,  second peaks , and  half-lives  to name just a few things \u2014we came to realize that the less common and even rarer side effects  exactly described the constellation of symptoms which have been plaguing Nik for so long.  It finally felt like an answer \u2014and some significant relief for Nik and for us \u2014was in sight. It was through the willingness of our current neurologist \u2014 the awesome and highly responsive Dr. G . \u2014to acknowledge that no one really knows the exact mechanism by which Lamictal works \u2014and his immense trust in our knowledge of Nik \u2014that we were able to make a case for weaning him off of it entirely. Knock wood, Nik\u2019s been seizure free since March; were that not the case Dr. G. might not have been so quick to acquiesce to our request. The process is slow; we are weaning  one-half  of one tablet every two weeks. Nik will not be completely off the Lamictal until Thanksgiving; there is something both satisfying and highly appropriate in that timing. The road to the last dose on the last day is rocky and uncertain. With each titration downward, there is a corresponding shift in Nik\u2019s response. Some of it is highly encouraging; we\u2019re seeing shifts in attention span and visual attending to things, increases in social interactions, and new communication skills. However, there is much that is  extremely difficult  to watch and wait through. The ill effects of each change are significantly more marked in the first few days after a decrease. Within a specific time frame after getting the Lamictal we can see the progression of effects on Nik\u2019s body. Though we have no proof \u2014other than our intuitive and  somewhat  educated guesses \u2014it certainly seems as if Lamictal acts primarily on the  Vagus Nerve ; when the  peak  dose hits Nik you can almost trace the route of the nerve by the side effects \u2014beginning with eye discomfort, headache, ear pain and  paresthesia , and ending with  extreme  gastric discomfort. The whole experience leaves Nik highly agitated and distressed until it passes. The times to  peak  and  second peak  in the evenings are the worst. These are the times that usually rouse Nik from a deep sleep and require intervention on my part \u2014be it holding his head or his hands in mine, rubbing his belly, or simply singing quietly to him. The  peak  and  second peak  are usually anywhere from two to four hours apart with the first peak hitting anywhere from 1.5 to 4.8 hours after he gets the medicine. With each new titration downward, the times shift just a bit one way or the other and can be affected by other factors such as was the medication given on a full or empty stomach, how tired is Nik, is he ill, etcetera.  Unpredictable predictability  I call it. As Nik\u2019s body adjusts to the changed dose \u2014usually after a few days \u2014the nights get a little easier. The time I spend with him goes from roughly thirty minutes to about fifteen during the first peak. The second peak can go from about thirty minutes to five minutes \u2014just enough for him to recognize that I am there and to calm down. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t wake for the second peak but simply cries out in his sleep; it\u2019s enough to wake  me  but he is calm and quiet before I even get out of bed. The days don\u2019t seem to affect Nik as badly; I sometimes wonder if his awareness of pain is diminished or overshadowed by other sensory input as he takes in the world around him. Of course, as we continue to decrease the dose, we  have  been seeing a return of the awful head slamming against the floor when he gets frustrated; his threshold for frustration seems to be quite low lately as well. I\u2019ve had the good fortune to be able to correspond with several autistic adults who have shared their experiences with Lamictal with me; most of them agreed that  the effects of weaning were often as bad as they were in ramping up the dose . There was also a consensus that there could be random energy surges as well as the more visceral effects; it is possible that those surges are what wake Nik, too. They certainly could account for some of his highly energetic \u2014bordering on frenetic \u2014and rascally behavior during the day! I could go on and on about the things we are seeing and realizing; that might require a new post each day as the changes are coming so suddenly. Tonight, for example, Nik had a complete frenzied meltdown when we tried to put the  duct tape  around his pajamas  as we have done every single night  since late March. We even made a game out if it and he came to love the whole routine. Suddenly, tonight, he was a frantic, flailing, kicking, screaming wild cat. We\u2019re learning to adapt when these things come up but it sure is distressing to see my normally happy-go-lucky little guy turn feral on us. He was so upset that he was actually punching Niksdad as he carried him up to bed.  Niksdad!  His  bestest buddy  in the whole wide world! It was heartbreaking to watch. I share this long, laborious tale for a number of reasons. First, for my readers who have gone through the ups and downs of trying to find answers and help over the past 20 months; I wanted to fill you in on what I  hope  will lead to a happy resolution \u2014eventually. Second, I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone who is going through a horrendous experience with their nonverbal child \u2014a child who  may  be unable to communicate that they feel funny due to medications. I share this to urge you to educate yourselves fully ( and I mean fully ) on everything about the medications your child takes or is about to take \u2014or even medications you are discussing with your child\u2019s doctor. So many of the medications which can help  some  people can also harm others terribly \u2014 especially when it comes to the realm of anything which affects the central nervous system . The balance is such a delicate one that  any  alteration in the brain\u2019s signaling mechanisms and pathways can create great disturbances even with very low doses of medication. That\u2019s not to say I think medication is bad for everyone. On the contrary, sometimes it can be remarkably helpful. But I think so many of us  mistakenly assume  that a physician prescribing a specific medication knows  absolutely everything about it ; they don\u2019t and they can\u2019t really predict how each individual patient might respond to a drug. Would that they could. It is up to us as parents, advocates, and consumers to educate ourselves, to do our utmost to understand \u2014and to  demand information  so that we can understand \u2014 all  the possibilities. Our children deserve that diligence; they deserve to have us fight as hard for them as they fight to cope with their daily environments or to be heard, understood, and included. I\u2019d be happy to share more about our experiences and discoveries with anyone who is interested. Feel free to contact me by email at niksmother (at) gmail (dot) com. ******************************************************** ETA: For those who have been led to believe that one cannot get \u201cThe rash\u201d after having been on Lamictal for a sustained period of time (we were told that very thing by three doctors within a 4 day period), it\u2019s not true!  Page 51, second to last bulllet point of the prescribing information from GSK indicates  (emphasis mine) : \n \u2022 Although most patients who develop rash while receiving LAMICTAL have mild to moderate symptoms, some individuals may develop a serious skin reaction that requires hospitalization. It is not possible to predict whether a mild rash will develop into a more serious reaction. Rarely, deaths have been reported. These serious skin reactions are  most likely  to happen within the first 8 weeks of treatment with LAMICTAL. Serious skin reactions occur more often in children than in adults. \n \u2022 Rashes may be  more likely  to occur if you: (1) take LAMICTAL in combination with valproate [DEPAKENE\u00ae* (valproic acid) or DEPAKOTE\u00ae* (divalproex sodium)], (2) take a higher starting dose of LAMICTAL than your doctor prescribed, or (3)  increase your dose of LAMICTAL faster than prescribed. In addition, the following appears in more than one place in the document \u2013the first being prominently placed on the very first page of the fifty-seven page document: \n NEARLY ALL CASES OF LIFE-THREATENING RASHES ASSOCIATED WITH LAMICTAL HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN 2 TO 8 WEEKS OF TREATMENT INITIATION.  HOWEVER, ISOLATED CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AFTER PROLONGED TREATMENT (E.G., 6 MONTHS). ACCORDINGLY, DURATION OF 1 THERAPY CANNOT BE RELIED UPON AS A MEANS TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL RISK HERALDED BY THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF A RASH.  ALTHOUGH BENIGN RASHES ALSO OCCUR WITH LAMICTAL, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT RELIABLY WHICH RASHES WILL PROVE TO BE SERIOUS OR LIFE THREATENING. ACCORDINGLY, LAMICTAL SHOULD ORDINARILY BE DISCONTINUED AT THE FIRST SIGN OF RASH, UNLESS THE RASH IS CLEARLY NOT DRUG RELATED. DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT MAY NOT PREVENT A RASH FROM BECOMING LIFE THREATENING OR PERMANENTLY DISABLING OR DISFIGURING. Please note: I am not a medical professional nor do I purport to give any medical advice in this blog. The information shared here is simply anecdotal and based entirely on my family\u2019s experience.

{"date": "February 7, 2009 ", "body": "Thank you to all of you who weighed in on my  last post about our dilemma . When I wrote that post, we had not yet hit the proverbial wall; I didn\u2019t know the behaviors would get even worse. The first night of the medication \u2014only  two doses  given at full strength \u2014left Nik in a lethargic zombie-like state the next day; the second night \u2014doses of only  half strength \u2014 accomplished the aim of uninterrupted sleep and a subsiding of the allergy symptoms but left Nik in an even worse state of hypersensitivity and extreme agitation. We opted to forgo the medication and try to mitigate any allergic response as much as possible using some homeopathic remedies to relieve the symptoms. Now, say what you will about homeopathy \u2014 we are all entitled to our opinions  \u2014but I have personally experienced times that it works both for me and for Nik. I certainly don\u2019t believe homeopathy \u2014or anything else for that matter\u2014 will  \u201ccure\u201d  my son\u2019s autism (or anything else). What I have seen, though, is that it can ameliorate some specific symptoms of physiological responses and make things a bit better \u2014more manageable, if you will. Such has been the case with the homeopathic antihistamine we\u2019ve used. It\u2019s not perfect and it doesn\u2019t solve the problem by any stretch \u2014Nik\u2019s still showing signs of allergy or extreme sensitivity\u2014 but it makes Nik more comfortable and less inclined to claw at his head. And that\u2019s all good. Anyway, we decided Nik in the aftermath of the Atarax was  too close  to our experience of Nik in the weaning stages with  Lamictal . (You may recall that was an ugly time for us.) Nik continues to show us that he  does not  handle certain types of medications well at all. No amount of titration or even minimal use will work. He has had adverse reactions to four different seizure meds, paradoxical responses to another anti anxiety med plus Benadryl, and now this.  At some point, we have to respect the messages he\u2019s giving us.  That point is now. Last night, Friday, was our second night without the Atarax. Nik slept okay \u2014not as long as I\u2019d have liked but soundly none the less. This morning, the light is back in his eyes and the music in his voice. As I write in the loft, I can hear Nik playing happily in the family room below; he\u2019s  actively engaging  with his electronic toys, singing along in time with the music and \u201ctalking\u201d back when they make the letter sounds.  \u201cHuh\u201d  he says when the alphabet train says  \u201cThis is the letter H.\u201d  Instant recall where two days ago there was confusion and extreme frustration at his inability to retrieve the information in his brain. I witnessed the same thing yesterday in his OT session; he couldn\u2019t recall simple things that he\u2019s long ago mastered \u2014this one was matching colors in a sorting activity \u2014and he got so frustrated that he just fell apart. Yet, today he\u2019s able to respond to a disembodied voice from his toy asking him  \u201cWhere is the letter P?\u201d  He recognizes that he has to wait a moment before pressing the right button and he\u2019s actively looking at the letters to find the right one. He even says  \u201cguh\u201d  for  \u201cgood\u201d  when he knows he\u2019s pressed the right button. He is aware in ways he hasn\u2019t been for a few days.\n As for me, well, I suppose I\u2019ll just learn to adjust and sleep less.

{"date": "February 4, 2009 ", "body": "\n I\u2019m trying hard lately to see the glass half full instead of half empty. But when my tank of sleep is running on fumes, it gets difficult to see past the haze and fog of  sleeplessness and worry . In spite of getting some decent sleep last night \u2014courtesy of a new prescription we tried with Nik which knocked him on his little hiney \u2014I still feel exhausted and headachy today. I want a snow day off \u2014a holiday from worry and constant watchfulness \u2014just one day would be fine.\n I\u2019ve procrastinated too long to give the entire back story. Suffice to say, Nik is starting to show signs of developing a  significant  food allergy to legumes. You know \u2014 peanuts, green beans, lentils, peas, chick peas (garbanzos), guar, soy \u2014lots of healthy sources of fiber and protein for a little guy who doesn\u2019t yet actually bite and chew food. We\u2019ve stopped giving him anything but fresh, plain, organic food so far in an effort to mitigate the rashes and gastric distress that seem to have popped up out of nowhere. Except, the odd thing is we think maybe they\u2019ve been there all along and we didn\u2019t know it. The clawing at an ear that\u2019s not infected; the rubbing of his head and poking at his eyes in spite of being on medication to stop migraines. The gastric distress which causes him to wake screaming in the middle of the night every night \u2014in spite of the fact that his reflux is well under control. \n Nik\u2019s modus operandi has always been to give us physical clues to follow. If we are too slow to pick up on them, his body always seems to know just when to kick it up a notch or two to really get our attention. At least, it sure seems that way every time it happens. We\u2019ve gotten pretty good about paying attention and trying to decipher his messages before they reach a crisis stage. We don\u2019t really have any choice; the one time we didn\u2019t pick up on his cues for so long  we almost lost him . \n I feel like I am teetering on the razor\u2019s edge all the time. Nik shows so many signs of being \u201cnormal and healthy\u201d but the possibility of slipping off, of developing a major medical issue, is always just a hair\u2019s breadth away. If I relax my guard, well\u2026I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s the thing that keeps me so in tune to his every shiver and sigh \u2014even in the twilight of sleep. Some people hear \u201cfood allergies\u201d and think  \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Just don\u2019t give him those foods.\u201d  In Nik\u2019s case it\u2019s not that simple right now. \n This new development, if it really is an allergy \u2014and wouldn\u2019t it be nice to finally have a freaking answer\u2014 has provided a real conundrum. Where Nik is totally tube dependent right now, we must continue to give him formula. In an effort to help relieve some of Nik\u2019s symptoms, we\u2019ve recently stopped feeding him  anything  by mouth. But his formula contains soybean oil, and green beans, and pea protein. Oh, and guar (also a legume) in the form of the added fiber (think Benefiber. Yep, legume based.). Even with the absence of food \u2014and now that we are hyper vigilant in watching for signs \u2014we can see the changes in Nik immediately after he gets a tube feeding. The red ears, the runny nose, the clawing at his ear, tugging at his clothing \u2014it all ramps up again. It\u2019s the worst after dinner \u2014his largest meal of the day. \n Common belief holds that someone allergic to soy should be able to handle soy oil because the most of the  sixteen different proteins  are eliminated in the processing. Um, someone needs to explain that to Nik\u2019s poor little body. He had a terrible reaction to  one  small cheez-it cracker yesterday at play group. (N.B. Nik has not exhibited any signs of allergic reactions to wheat or dairy.) The offending ingredient? Soybean oil. \n The immediate reaction was small in and of itself but it tipped the balance just enough that Nik was miserable for the rest of the day \u2014the screaming, crying, clawing at his ear, hitting himself in the head which have become so disturbingly familiar to us. \n We saw the pediatrician yesterday to rule out an ear infection; we were all certain it wasn\u2019t that but had to know before we could proceed down other avenues. We now have a referral to an allergist and a new prescription antihistamine, Atarax. Nik can\u2019t take Benadryl because he has a paradox response; he\u2019s up for hours and it gives him very little relief. Atarax is actually used for anti-anxiety as well and works differently than Benadryl. Where Benadryl works on peripheral histamine receptors (think skin and extremities), the Atarax binds to receptors within the GI and respiratory tracts \u2014working more from the inside out than the outside in. Of course, that also means it has a bit stronger effect on the whole nervous system. \n We gave Nik a dose just before dinner. I have to say, it did do wonders to keep the allergic response at bay. But poor Nik conked out at the dinner table and had to be poured into his pajamas and bed! He woke, briefly, about six and a half hours later \u2014but he woke happy and pain-free! We gave him another dose \u2014and a quiet toy to play with \u2014and another half hour later he was out cold for the rest of the night. The drawback is that it knocks him out cold and has some lingering systemic effects. Today, he is off-balance and very subdued. He feels funny and knows it; he\u2019s been very clingy and easily upset.  Not a good long-term solution ; we fought too hard to get him off of medications that affect him this way to go back. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the potential effects of central nervous system depressants on respiration; not a good fit for a child with a  chronic lung disease . \n So, here we sit, betwixt and between. We have theories but not enough evidence, some evidence that doesn\u2019t fit, and a little boy who keeps trying to tell us what he needs but cannot make himself understood.  \n \n I think I understand how he feels.

{"date": "February 12, 2009 ", "body": "Yesterday was an intense day. Too many appointments, the prospect of lots of lab work for Nik, and the question mark about whether or not he did, in fact, have a rotavirus. You know, just another ordinary day in our lives. We had a great appointment with a new doctor, an allergist, to help us make some headway into figuring out the causes of Nik\u2019s ongoing pains and recent skin rashes. We left feeling really good \u2014despite a long list of allergens to be tested. The doctor was personable and Nik seemed to take to him. Always a bonus. The day took a nosedive from there. The appointment with the pediatrician, to discuss Nik\u2019s recent apparent illness and whether to culture for a rotavirus, ended up not happening. The nurse that had scheduled the appointment had not confirmed it in the computer. When we arrived, we were told that the second doctor in the office had a family emergency; that left Nik\u2019s doctor, Doctor Mary, holding the bag for all the appointments for the day. Since Nik seemed to be so much better than he had been even twenty four hours prior, we opted not to wait in the hopes she could see us. We headed over to the lab to get the blood drawn for Nik\u2019s battery of tests. After a lengthy wait, we were greeted by a seemingly disorganized lab tech. As soon as she realized the tests were for Nik, she balked. Whether it was because it was so close to the end of her day and she didn\u2019t\u2019 feel like dealing with a screaming child or whether it was simply because she felt like it, she told me she couldn\u2019t do the tests because it would require more blood than she could take from a child at one time. I\u2019ve since discovered that wasn\u2019t true but, whatever. So, a lengthy day spent traveling up and down the middle portion of our state, bouncing from appointment to appointment \u2014it made us tired and cranky. By the time we got home, we decided to go out to dinner. As luck would have it, both Nik and I had reactions to some food. Neither was too bad, but it was enough to make us both uncomfortable. I woke this morning feeling pretty tired and crabby; a state I must confess lingered until about lunchtime. I\u2019ve been sitting at my computer, willing myself to find words to write \u2014and coming up dry. I\u2019ve also been listening to my son singing and playing happily in the loft. For some reason, it put me in mind of  this post  from  Kristen . I realized I  could  choose to be angry and resentful about all the energy expended yesterday \u2014seemingly for naught, or I  could  choose to find something good to hold onto.\u00a0 I chose the latter \u2014in the form of a cookie. Yes,  a cookie . And french fries, too. Since we\u2019ve been limiting Nik\u2019s exposure to potential allergy-inducing foods, the allergist warned us that it might actually skew the testing. He actually suggested that we feed Nik some of the foods we\u2019ve come to suspect \u2014especially wheat \u2014in order to trigger an immune response. So, with that in mind \u2014and thinking we were getting blood drawn in the afternoon \u2014I bought Nik a giant chocolate chip cookie. Okay, let\u2019s be honest; it was as much for me as it was for him.\u00a0 But we shared that cookie in the Starbuck\u2019s parking lot like it was manna from heaven. It was Nik\u2019s  first-ever  chocolate chip cookie. Yeah, okay; big deal, right?  Right . The cookie was fairly chewy and soft so I was able to mash up bits and pieces and slip them into Nik\u2019s mouth. Normally, he would either gag or reach in to remove anything larger than a single crumb, but this cookie was sweet and gooey and melted quickly. And he adored it!\u00a0 By the time we were through, Nik had consumed nearly a quarter of the cookie; much of that he even placed in his own mouth \u2014another first \u2014instead of licking it off of my fingers! While we\u2019ve been trying to mitigate all these weird reactions to foods, we\u2019ve had to severely limit Nik\u2019s oral intake; it\u2019s just so challenging to find things he will eat that are the right consistency and texture that are not potential allergens. We\u2019ve been more than a little concerned that he might regress in his desire or ability to eat by mouth.\u00a0 So, after the allergist told us to  \u201cstimulate his system,\u201d  we decided to really go for it. When we went out to dinner last night, we let Nik have some of a buttered roll, a lick of my patty melt \u2014he even tolerated a very small crumble of beef on a fork without gagging\u2014and, of course, french fries. Nik\u2019s favorite thing to do with fries is to dip them in either Daddy\u2019s salad dressing (usually honey mustard) or in ketchup.\u00a0 His favorite thing to do last night? Show off his ever lengthening reach and lightning quick food-snatching skills. At one point, I wasn\u2019t fast enough to stop him; Nik helped himself to a fistful of fries off the plate.\u00a0 The boy\u2019s hands are definitely getting bigger, too! Nik did have a bit of a reaction to all those foods and was a cranky, uncomfortable boy by the time we got home \u2014clawing at his ear, pulling his hair; we gave him a quarter dose of Atarax at bed time and another half dose five hours later. He slept through the night and has had relatively few side effects today. The allergist gave us a prescription for Allegra to see if that will help with the symptoms without causing the neurological side effects. We will start that after the blood draw on Monday. Meanwhile, we\u2019ll be sharing cookies \u2014 with our glasses half full .

{"date": "June 24, 2007 ", "body": "(Note: Photos added 6/25/07) \n Wow, my  last post  really took a turn after I got that email from P last night. Not at all what I wanted to write about but apparently I needed to. (For what it\u2019s worth, I did send a reply to tell her how grossly offensive it was and that I hoped to never receive such a thing again.)\n What I really wanted to write about is the ups and downs of our week. Been dealing with a variety of things. Some good, some bad, some just are what they are. \n The bad first, so I can end on a high note. Got a letter from the neurologist \u2014FINALLY \u2014outlining his thoughts on Nik\u2019s needs for educational support. To give some context here, the doc is a highly respected and brilliant man but he\u2019s way over scheduled. We saw him in early April and have not yet gotten the official report. The letter, a one page summary, was sent only after I called and badgered his assistant \u2014telling her, truthfully, that we were at a complete standstill around being able to advocate for certain things at school without that letter of support. \n Be careful what you wish for. The letter is brutally blunt and, frankly, painful to read. In the summary, the doctor states that Nik has enough going on to warrant placement in a highly focused autism program (most likely at  another school  than where he is now), and that Nik may need to be in an even more specialized, smaller program to help with the \u201cdysfunctional behaviors.\u201d Ok, I know that the letter is strongly worded so as to get the attention of the school district, so they will take our requests seriously. I know that the letter does not negate anything about who Nik is or what he is like. But god almighty, it is hard to read those words in black and white. \n Meanwhile, we are still waiting to hear back from the autism program evaluators so we can begin the IEP process, including any transition planning if necessary, for the start of the school year. \n We are still struggling with Nik\u2019s eating. After some great progress last week \u2014moments which really made us all think he had turned the corner \u2014Nik will not eat again. There is no identifiable physiological or anatomical reason for these cycles. I am not a trained expert, but I think the crux of the matter is sensory, compounded by typical toddler independence. Nik has the desire to eat and the hunger. He also has the drive to \u201cdo it myself!\u201d but does not have the motor skills to coordinate self feeding. Nor does he have the oral motor skills to allow him to advance beyond pureed foods. Throw into the mix that Nik likes very strong flavors (horseradish, hot mustard, salsa, etc.) and food becomes a huge challenge. \n There are days I have felt like a failure as a mother simply because the inability to help Nik in this area is just overwhelming. We\u2019ve been through tons of evaluations and no one seems to have any insights. The speech therapist at school has basically done nothing \u2014not a damn thing \u2014to help Nik develop the oral motor skills he needs to eat. She has focused on the outside evaluations and consultations, \u201cLet\u2019s see what (insert name of specialist here) has to say.\u201d Or has deemed it a medical issue versus an educational one. \n When we told her about the upcoming eval scheduled for next week, her response was tepid at best. \u201cOh, maybe they\u2019ll have something useful you can share with us.\u201d I told her the plan is to create a prescribed feeding plan (including oral motor exercises to be done at or before each meal), she responded, again, with the medical vs. educational crap. I explained that this IS an educational issue and she continued to take a \u201clet\u2019s see\u201d attitude. If Nik is placed in the autism program he \u201cbecomes someone else\u2019s problem\u201d in her mind. \n I\u2019ve already called the case manager to complain. One of Nik\u2019s unmet IEP goals was around oral motor development as measured by increased intake of food by mouth. According to his report card, one of the supporting objectives was met because Nik kept his tongue in a more forward position THREE TIMES IN A ROW. Yes, you read that correctly. Out of an entire freaking school year, they think he met an objective because he did something THREE times. The boy is NOT eating by mouth at all right now where he started the school year eating nearly 100% of everything he was offered (pureed). ARGH! My next step is to ask to see all Nik\u2019s therapy records to see just what the hell this woman has done (or thinks she has done)in those \u201cminimum of 30 sessions per year.\u201d \n We see our fabulous behavioral psychologist, Dr. S., this week and will ask about referrals to outside SLP\u2019s. We hadn\u2019t wanted to set the precedent of distinction between education and medicine but cannot sit by and watch Nik struggle and fail. I would sell my soul to Lucifer himself before I let that happen. \n So, that\u2019s the bad stuff. Now, to wind up on a positive note\u2026kind of like those Hallmark Hall of Fame movies\u2026 \n Nik is making incredible progress in his physical and social development. He\u2019s developing a funny rapport with himself in the mirror (and in windows, too!). Every time Nik sees himself in the mirror, he has to \u201ckiss\u201d himself (the whole hand over mouth, blowing a kiss routine) then sits down on the floor and claps both hands and feet as he laughs. It is hysterical to watch. Even better, though, is that Nik is also giving those kisses to Niksdad and me. He still tilts his forehead toward our lips but he now adds the \u201cmmmmmmmmwah!\u201d sound effect. Melts my heart every single time. \n Nik is also beginning to do some of the \u201cItsy Bitsy Spider\u201d gestures to himself in the mirror as he quietly hums. \n My little boy is growing like a weed right now, too! Just ten days ago he couldn\u2019t reach the latch on Nanny\u2019s storm door \u2014a fact for which Niksdad and I were very grateful as Nik is obsessed with opening and closing doors. Imagine my surprise yesterday when Nik reached right up and opened the very same door! Gulp! \n Walking downstairs holding my hands \u2014standing the entire way down instead of sitting on his bottom. He looks so proud of himself when he gets to the last step. As we pass the mirrored wall on the way through the dining room (long story to that decorating choice \u2014not ours!), Nik stops, sits and claps with the boy in the mirror. \n Let\u2019s see, new sounds on the horizon. Lots of babbling but now with total inflection and intention \u2014and sometimes significant intensity, too! Nik\u2019s recently added a \u201craspberry\u201d that\u2019s more of a V or PH sound than a TH sound. (Sorry, I\u2019m not good at capturing the essence of Nik\u2019s speech yet.  McEwen  gets my vote for best technique there!) \n Overall, Nik is making significant progress in either joint referencing or in leading us to what he wants. When I ask him certain questions such as \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d or \u201cShall we go zoom-zoom?\u201d (which means in the car), Nik responds in both a physical and verbal fashion. He is making very deliberate choices when we offer him toys or something which requires choice. He really takes a moment to weigh the options before he emphatically makes his choice. Must get that from Niksdad \u2014I\u2019m the impulsive one in this family! \n Nik\u2019s attention span has generally improved. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s dietary changes, maturity, or what\u2026but we\u2019ll take it! In spite of this, Dr. S. has mentioned wanting to at least talk about the possibility of medication for Nik to help him with self-regulation at meal times. It is not something I am comfortable with or willing to try yet. \n Nik\u2019s been communicating so much lately \u2014like he did at  the beach last week . It\u2019s got to be so frustrating for him to be surrounded by a bunch of \u201cdolts\u201d who cannot interpret what he is saying. He clearly is saying something of significance when he talks to me. Sometimes I can tell by the tone that he is chiding me for something or that he is angry or tired. I can\u2019t wait to see what we can come up with in the way of a new SLP to help Nik begin to have ways of communicating with others that isn\u2019t about extremes of behavior to get attention. \n Nik is making lots more eye contact with people he knows and loves. He totally captivates his Nanny and Granddaddy every single time they see him. He flirts and laughs and makes physical contact. His favorite pastime is leading Granddaddy around the house and upstairs and down. I love to see the joy and pride on my father\u2019s face as he grumbles \u201care we done yet, Nik?\u201d Yes, Nik requires LOTS and LOTS of energy. \n Sometimes the sheer joy and pride I feel watching my son acquire new skills and deepening relationships \u2014watching the unfettered joy and exuberance he brings to each experience \u2014sometimes it just overwhelms me and I have to cry. \n He is the Yin to my Yang, the up to my down. The joy to my sorrow. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to love my son more than I do. But each time I look at him, I feel my heart get full to overflowing.

{"date": "February 17, 2009 ", "body": "Boxes of old papers and photographs, stacks of books, piles of medical records and therapy reports I need to scan and organize. \u00a0  The loft in our small town home has become the black hole of all the little bits of our life for which we have no clear cut place. \u00a0  The loose ends, the question marks  \u2014\u201cDo we need to save this?\u00a0 What if we need this?\u201d \u00a0  \u00a0 While my husband has been in school and working every weekend our time together has been limited. \u00a0  Much of that time is taken up with things like, oh, parenting Nik and dealing with his ongoing health issues; there is never any time or energy left over for tackling any but the smallest of projects around the house. \u00a0 Niksdad\u2019s recent job loss turned out to be a bit of a mixed blessing this week. \u00a0  He was home and wasn\u2019t buried in the books so we had a chance to finally tackle the loft. \u00a0  It\u2019s not finished by a long shot but the work has begun; the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d of moving filing cabinets, repairing a sagging book case \u2014the things I cannot do myself while also keeping a watchful eye on Nik \u2014are complete. \u00a0  The difference is remarkable; the loft feels larger already in spite of the boxes still stacked in the middle of the room. \u00a0 I can finally imagine what it will look like when we have completed the project. \u00a0  More to the point, I can already feel the sense of ease which permeates the space. \u00a0  Where we once felt squeezed into our little corners of the room \u2014where our desks sit tucked into opposite corners \u2014already it seems more tranquil, more comfortable. \u00a0  We both wonder why it took us so long to make this space \u2014where we spend so much waking time\u2014 our own. \u00a0  I say it was the vagaries of time and our limited energy supply but I think, in my heart, it goes deeper. \u00a0 ******************** \u00a0 Nik\u2019s recent bout of gastrointestinal illness has been very disturbing; not only has it gone on longer than any other virus he\u2019s ever had, its intensity is unnerving when the waves wash over him. \u00a0  He is unable to communicate the nature of the pain with more than screams and howls as he doubles over or as he shrieks and kicks his legs to seek some relief. \u00a0  He clasps his long fingered hands together over and over asking us to help him, to ease his pain. \u00a0  To make it stop. \u00a0  We feel helpless to do more than hold him and croon soothing words as we rub his belly or his head, to clean up the aftermath of his body\u2019s release. \u00a0 This latest development, the hardening of his belly as his too slender body braces itself for the impending pain and uncontrollable outcome, frightens me. \u00a0  It seems to last for hours and I am gripped with a fear that we are missing something that could mean the difference between life and death. \u00a0  The recent loss of  beautiful Evan  sits heavily on my heart as I struggle with my desire to call  his mother ,  Vicki , for advice and my unwillingness to ask her to relive that horrible pain. \u00a0  I cannot; it would be too cruel. \u00a0 My husband, the nurse, is quick to assure me that Nik\u2019s bowel sounds are good and his belly does soften some after he\u2019s had a bout of diarrhea \u2014though not nearly back to \u201cnormal\u201d enough to ease my fears. \u00a0  I return to another memory packed away in my own mental loft \u2014a place where there is not and never will be a neat, tidy, compartmentalized storage system for all the hurts and memories of watching my son struggle through so much of his early life. \u00a0 The discovery of Nik\u2019s  intestinal malrotation  was unexpected; he\u2019d been showing many of the same symptoms that he has over the past two weeks and he had normal bowel sounds then, too. \u00a0  Then, he was considered a \u201cvery lucky little boy\u201d; the doctors discovered a partial  volvulus  \u2014an obstruction \u2014which they said was \u201ca time bomb waiting to go off.\u201d \u00a0 I want to assume there is no such time bomb awaiting us now but the memories of all those times we thought we might lose Nik have built themselves up into a thick, smooth scar upon which I worry \u2014much the same way others might rub a stone or rosary beads \u2014each time Nik\u2019s health takes an unexpected turn. \u00a0  The history is too strong and the memories run too deep. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 I want to shed the burden but I seem unable to. \u00a0  There are times it is the thing which keeps me pressing forward for answers on Nik\u2019s behalf.\u00a0  I fear the complacency. \u00a0 ******************** \u00a0 I sit at my desk, still wedged into the corner but less crowded now. \u00a0  The room is the same yet it feels different. \u00a0  Attitude?  \u00a0 Belief? \u00a0  Perception? \u00a0  I am uncertain what makes the difference as I begin to make my way through the boxes of old hospital bills and NICU discharge reports.  \u00a0\u201c What if I need this? \u00a0  What if Nik needs me to have this?\u201d   \u00a0 I examine the pages, searching for clues \u2014answers someone may have overlooked. \u00a0  On those same pages, I see hope; for each date racked up on that enormously large hospital bill, it was another day my son lived. \u00a0  Another day of getting stronger, healthier \u2014closer to coming home. \u00a0 I realize the answers I seek are not to be found on those pages. \u00a0  Still, I am unable to let go.

{"date": "December 22, 2007 ", "body": "Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow, Will find it hard to sleep tonight ~The Christmas Song Well, our eyes are all aglow here \u2013at least two out of three of us anyway \u2013but it\u2019s not from the joyous anticipation of Christmas. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we all love Christmas and are excited about it\u2019s imminent arrival; it\u2019s just that we\u2019ve been a bit preoccupied with a recent visitor \u2013I\u2019ll call him Joe \u2014 G.I.  Joe.  As in \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Chuck?\u201d (Okay, if I have to explain it\u2026never mind!) It\u2019s been another very full week with lots of things going on \u2014 besides  the advent of our unwanted pal, Joe. But he did bring us some early gifts \u2013including fever, nausea, and a very upset tummy. The glittering I see in the eyes looking back at me? One hundred and one degrees shining back from both the kid and the face in the mirror. There  is  such a thing as too much symbiosis. Really. I\u2019m not sure I have the energy to write in detail about it all so here are the highlights: Nik saw Santa on a hook and ladder truck Sunday night \u2013right on our street; Nik was joyfully overwhelmed and practically kicked poor Niksdad in the face as he flapped and squealed with delight from his vantage point on his Daddy\u2019s shoulders. The local fire department brings Santa around to all the neighborhoods each year. The past two years Nik has slept right through it. This year we decided to see how he handled it. Santa  who ? He wants the big, shiny, red truck with the flashing lights. Fat guy in red suit optional. Monday, Niksdad took over and marshaled Nik to his appointment with the cardiologist; it was his annual check up \u2013something he\u2019s going to need to have for life. The visit was good but Niksdad does have a couple of questions based on the written report we got in the mail on Wednesday. Something raised a red flag about possible thickening of one of the atrial walls.  In and of itself it\u2019s not a scary thing but it bears investigation and clarification.  Overall though, he was given a pretty clean bill of cardiac health. Yippee! Wedged in among doctor\u2019s appointments this week were a couple of feeding therapy sessions and some OT and PT, too. All good stuff with positive, forward motion.   More on those another time. I\u2019ve been watching how Nik has been playing lately and notice a big shift; he\u2019s more interested in and attentive to some of his books \u2013the musical ones with thick board pages that he can\u2019t tear, of course.  Where he used to simply toss them aside or only played the music, he now will choose a book from a couple I offer and very deliberately sit on the sofa to read.  He still plays the music and pushes all the buttons, but he also actually looks at the pages and turns them back and forth, trying to make some sense of what he sees.  He\u2019s also begun playing with wheeled toys in a very appropriate way.  The two trains he got for his birthday are now more than objects to mouth; he actually rolls them back and forth across the floor and then goes after them.  The neat thing is that he figured that one out all on his own \u2013no help from constant repetition by me or Niksdad. We finally got to see the diagnostician on Thursday.  Almost didn\u2019t make it because Nik was in the throes of the GI bug.  We waited too long to get the appointment; I wasn\u2019t about to cancel.  I am still processing thoughts and impressions from that visit and will save that for another post.  It wasn\u2019t all that I had built it up to be in my mind; expectations can be such a tricky thing.  No matter how good the reality is it still doesn\u2019t measure up.  Sigh\u2026 We added a new service professional to Nik\u2019s team yesterday morning; an orientation and mobility specialist from the state division for the visually impaired came to evaluate Nik.  This, too, will warrant a separate post soon; Niksdad and I really liked the guy and he has some great ideas for helping Nik learn to navigate his environment and develop a greater awareness of his own body in space. The presents have all been bought (I think) but need to be wrapped, the tree is finally decorated \u2013though not in our usual style, and I do not have to cook Christmas dinner.  Whew!  It\u2019s been an overwhelming time here lately and I feel so behind in things I want to write about and share; I\u2019ve been tagged for some memes and awards and I haven\u2019t had the time to respond but I will soon. In the midst of the craziness, there have been some beautiful bright spots.  I received the most wonderful, thoughtful Christmas package from another blogger.  I don\u2019t want to embarrass her so I won\u2019t name her.  But I do want to publicly thank her for sending me some much needed Christmas cheer and a little TLC, too.  I fully understand where her children get their loving, generous spirits and why her students do some inspiring things, too. On the same day her package arrived, my father came over to help me with some household projects that have been put off while Niksdad has been in school.  Big things like modifying my desk and helping to transform our loft space into a more usable office space for both Niksdad and me.  He helped me identify some other projects \u2013such as putting in a new front entry floor, adding a counter and cabinets to my tiny laundry closet to make it more user friendly, even helping my husband install or replace some lighting fixtures. None of it is truly  mission critical  \u2013it doesn\u2019t keep us from moving ahead with the things we need to do (well, not usually).  But having those things done will surely make our home feel a little more settled, a whole lot less frenetic and cluttered, and someplace where we can find a small measure of serenity.  Something  everyone  can surely use, no matter the time of year.

{"date": "December 23, 2007 ", "body": "It\u2019s beginning to feel a lot (more) like Christmas, everywhere I go. In keeping with the holiday spirit, I\u2019ve decided to jump on the bandwagon and share my Christmas meme-ories with you. Thanks to  Kristen  for  the inspiration ! Part I: \n What are your three favorite Christmas songs and who sings them? I\u2019d have to say I am rather a purist when it comes to my  favorite  Christmas music; my tastes run to the classical and traditional. I\u2019m  not  a big fan of all the pop stars\u2019 versions of timeless classics. I like to hear  O Holy Night ,  I Wonder as I Wander , or  What Child Is This?  done by someone like Kathleen Battle (in her  pre-Diva-from-hell  heyday she was my all time favorite), or groups like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. That said, I have found some newer, more contemporary, Christmas songs done by the likes of  Bette Midler ,  Josh Groban , and  Amy Grant  that I really enjoy, too. I love all kinds of authentic Christmas music (meaning not glitzed and glossed beyond recognition);  just don\u2019t mess around with my classics, ok? My  all time favorite  isn\u2019t exactly one song \u2013it\u2019s an  entire opera .  Amahl and the Night Visitors  is a simple and beautiful telling of the miracle of selfless love on Christmas Eve, as told from the perspective of a poor widow and her crippled son. It has the power to make me ache and weep, sing and dance, laugh and rejoice  each and every time I hear it.  Christmas isn\u2019t  truly  Christmas for me until I hear  Amahl . What are your three favorite Christmas foods? Well, that sort of depends on where I am. As we\u2019ve gotten farther away from the nuclear family and become spread far and wide, I think we\u2019re losing touch with traditions I grew up with. As a child, I remember big turkey dinners complete with stuffing and cranberry \u2013and homemade pies; it was kind of like Thanksgiving but with presents! When my husband and I got married, we continued one of  his  traditions \u2013making  krumkake , a Norwegian cookie that his grandmother used to make.  This  year, we\u2019ll be having lamb at my parents; we won\u2019t have pie or krumkake but will start a new tradition of homemade eggnog ice cream with gingerbread. In spite of the changing traditions, there are a few timeless favorites I enjoy. I love a good  eggnog . Yes, that fatty, thick, gooey, sweet elixir \u2013with or without the spirits added!  Gingerbread , thick and hot from the oven \u2013served with warm lemon sauce makes it even better.  Homemade iced sugar cookies . I don\u2019t make them myself because I don\u2019t have the patience to decorate them. But I do appreciate a good sugar cookie. What are three Christmas secrets? I can\u2019t think of a single one. Well, except that I like opera and eggnog\u2026but I already spilled those beans, huh? What are your three favorite Christmas movies? It\u2019s a Wonderful Life ; Zu-Zu\u2019s rose petals, Clarence, the bells, George Bailey\u2026can\u2019t get enough of \u2018em. Call me a sappy sentimentalist. How the Grinch Stole Christmas  \u2013both the animated and the live action versions. It\u2019s a great story full of humor and redemption. The Santa Clause . Tim Allen in his prime. And I still believe in Santa, too. Part II: \n What is your least favorite holiday task? Wrapping all the presents; they always seem to  multiply  the night before I start wrapping! What is the worst gift you have ever received? I should be all PC here and say \u201cOh nothing, they\u2019ve all been wonderful, given in the spirit of love, blah, blah, blah\u2026\u201d but the truth is there have been some really  weird  things given to me over the years by my mother-in-law. (It\u2019s okay, she doesn\u2019t read my blog. If she miraculously finds it, well, she  needs  to know these things.) The absolute worst was the year my husband and I had moved into the first home we had purchased. For some reason, my MIL \u2013who has never taken much time to get to know me and what I might enjoy \u2013decided that I really  loved  to decorate with the color purple. And mirrors \u2014 painted with swans . I think that gift spent a long time in the closet of our guest room until it finally got broken in our move back east. Damned careless movers\u2026 For the record, I have  nothing  against purple; it is a perfectly lovely color \u2013for fruits, clothing or gemstones. Who is the hardest person in your family to shop for? That would be a toss up between my father and my husband. Neither one ever has any idea of what to ask for; they never need much in the way of clothing or things like that \u2013the polar opposite of my teenage neices. And their wish lists usually include  very  large,  very  expensive \u201ctoys\u201d (mostly tools) that no one can either find or afford! What relative do you dread seeing at the holidays? Or, when you were a child, what relative did you dread seeing? I am actually ashamed to confess that I  dread  seeing my in-laws. It\u2019s always awkward when we do see them. That might have something to do with the fact that my MIL is very uncomfortable with Nik\u2019s disabilities. I think she  truly  loves him in her own way but doesn\u2019t know how to just  BE  with him and see past the disabilities to the incredible child he is. She ends up meddling in an effort to find solutions to \u201cfix\u201d him and it just pisses me (and my husband) off. I bite my tongue and let it wash over me in the moment but it makes me sad and angry and the bitter taste lingers. Fortunately, we don\u2019t see them that often; the last time they came to visit was nearly 18 months ago. That\u2019s a factor, too; they live a mere three hours away and have only seen Nik three times since we moved back east in 2005. What holiday tradition would you eliminate if you could? Um, visiting in-laws?? Just kidding; if I did that then we wouldn\u2019t see my parents either! \n If I had the power to make it so, I would make it  illegal  for retailers to put up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving. I get so sick and tired of the crass commercialism of the \u201choliday season.\u201d The significance of the  actual  holiday \u2013regardless of the religion or holiday one celebrates \u2013becomes minimized and marginalized to the point that people aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s okay to say to one another. What do you swear, every holiday season, that you\u2019ll never do again, only to find yourself doing it again the next year? Waiting until the last minute to wrap gifts. Eating too many cookies while I bake them. Sending Christmas cards late. But hey, why break with tradition, right? \n What are  your  traditions and favorites?

{"date": "June 28, 2007 ", "body": "Boy, things sure change fast around here! Sort of like the old joke about living in New England\u2026don\u2019t like the weather, wait a few minutes.\n So, last night I was all set to write about some stuff that has transpired this week \u2014not an awful lot of it terribly wonderful. Not bad, per se, just really frustrating stuff with Nik\u2019s school. It has had me feeling so overwhelmed trying to sort things out to find solutions for all that Nik is lacking at school. I simply couldn\u2019t sit and concentrate enough to actually form the words into cohesive (or coherent) strings of language which would be meaningful to anyone else. (Hmm, I wonder if that\u2019s what it feels like to Nik. If so, I can certainly understand the \u201czoning out\u201d he sometimes does; it\u2019s exhausting trying to communicate sometimes!) Anyway, I was all set to vent and didn\u2019t. Then I had an experience today that helped put things in a new light \u2014a calmer frame of reference. \n First, though, a little context about where I was last night when I went to bed \u2014 \n So here I had worked up a good and righteous head of steam over some things going on with the SLP at school \u2014namely that she\u2019s  just  finished her fellowship training and gotten her official license last week (and may have been working with an expired temporary license for the last six weeks) , doesn\u2019t have the experience and/or skill set to deal with a child like Nik with overlapping issues,  and  she either doesn\u2019t know that she doesn\u2019t know or won\u2019t admit it. Either way, it sucks. As a result, Nik\u2019s had ZERO oral motor program since Christmas. There\u2019s more but that\u2019s pretty much it in a nutshell. \n I also just found out this week that the PT we love, Miss B., is being deployed to Germany in September \u2014for the entire year! Boy, I am soooo going to miss her! She\u2019s been the one therapist at school who has made consistent efforts at not only communicating with me about stuff but actually having me join in on some of the sessions so I can get hands-on training from her for home carry over. She even joined us for swimming (with the class) on Tuesday to show me things I can do with Nik in my sister\u2019s pool over summer break from mid-July to late-August (the one I am so anxious about!). \n In addition, we had the letter from the neurologist and the non-eating issue (again) which I already talked about  here . Add to the mix that Nik hasn\u2019t been quite himself lately \u2014more  sleep disturbances , fussier, sleeping like a stone at school where he wouldn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t?) nap before. One of the little guys in his class went home sick the other day and I\u2019ve been hearing about a stomach bug going around \u2014 including our pal, Charlie . Without going into specifics (which we can all well imagine, thank you very much for our stellar scatological detecting skills, eh?), I think Nik is on the verge. \n So, the turnaround today came in an unexpected form. Nik\u2019s feeding evaluation with a new therapist at the hospital. Ostensibly, the eval was supposed to be so we could take home some specific oral motor exercises to do both at home and school. Frankly, I didn\u2019t have any expectations much beyond that. Call me jaded but we\u2019ve seen tons of specialists including those at the pediatric feeding and swallowing center at CHOP in March of this year. Let\u2019s just say, no one has actually bothered to listen to our thoughts, theories, and concerns \u2014until today! \n We came away from today\u2019s appointment with a renewed sense of hope. Now, let me state for the record that I firmly believe my son can do  anything . So trying to understand why he went from a kid who would eat baby food a year ago to completely tube dependent now, with all the cycles of eating and refusal in between \u2014well, it just wears you down. When \u201cthe experts\u201d are so far off the mark \u2014\u201cIt\u2019s a learned aversion.\u201d \u201cSimply turn him away when he does a behavior you don\u2019t like (throwing food, spoon, bowl, etc.); he\u2019ll stop acting out because he wants your attention.\u201d \u201cMake him wait and look you in the eye before each bite.\u201d HELLO??? Have these people never worked with autistics before? Yeah, OK, I know it\u2019s different for every child, but how many of you have a kid that, at the age of 3 \u00bd, really cares if you ignore them when they don\u2019t want to eat?? Nik is perfectly content if I ignore him when he\u2019s like that! \n Sorry, I went off on a bit of a tangent there. Back to today\u2019s session\u2026 \n This therapist, B, was amazing. She went through the whole \u201cHave you tried\u2026?\u201d We had; it didn\u2019t work. Instead of scratching her head and saying, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what else to tell you to try,\u201d she dug so deep down into her bag of tricks and pulled out several rabbits and those scarves-that-turn-into-bouquets\u2026you get the idea! For example, she helped us find ways to try to turn even Nik\u2019s refusals into opportunities. You know those chewy tubes (the ones Nik will only bite once then throw)? Well, B, suggested that there is a way to stuff the end with something like a dried veggie stick (or mini pretzel stick) so that when Nik takes that ONE bite, he gets the proprioceptive input of the crunchy stick. Ok, maybe some of you have \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d but we\u2019ve tried darn near everything to get Nik to bite anything. No go. Putting thinned purees into a cup for Nik to drink (he\u2019s constantly trying to pick up the bowl and lick it so why not?). And those mesh feeder bags \u2014Nik won\u2019t even touch the bag; he flings it away from him or picks it up by the handle and bites the handle. Yet, he\u2019ll chew on a wet washcloth. Guess what we\u2019ll be using to wrap up some bits of fruit to try? \n I think the thing that amazes me is that it\u2019s all tuff that, when B said it, sounded so simple and logical. Yet NO ONE has ever gotten to that level of detail. B even has referred us to the hospital\u2019s developmental feeding program so Nik can be seen as an outpatient by a team of people it turns out he is already familiar with from previous evals and such. Gee, I feel like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz \u2014it was right in my own backyard! \n The real transformation came though when B listened very thoughtfully (and patiently) as we told her about the frustrations at school and the SLP lack of experience. B was so professional and diplomatic. She said that she understood what it must feel like for us but that feeding is such an involved area of specialization that most school therapists don\u2019t have the background for many, many years. She helped us let go of the drive to  make  school handle the problem (my emphasis) and focus instead on how we can use the feeding clinic to reinforce things for Nik and create the carry-over and training that will allow him to progress at school. God, again, it sounded so simple that I can\u2019t believe we couldn\u2019t step back far enough to see it. \n B is a gem and Nik took to her right away; he let her touch his face and rubbed his cheek against her hand in invitation. He initiated hand play, he smiled and laughed with her \u2014in spite of his obviously not feeling well (as evidenced by bursts of hysterical arching and howling pain as if a horrible bellyache had taken hold). She was articulate, resourceful, creative, and she really respected our input. In short, we\u2019d like to adopt her into our family of Nik\u2019s special friends and service providers. \n The catch? She\u2019s moving 2000 miles away in three weeks! And our beloved pediatrician retires as of tomorrow, too! Seems like we just find the really good ones and then they move on.

{"date": "December 27, 2007 ", "body": "Ah, intuition takes me there Intuition takes me everywhere ~John Lennon In my desire to share last week\u2019s experience with  the diagnostician , I realize now that I left out some pertinent information which may put my attitude into context for some of my readers who are outraged on my/our behalf. (And, truly, I am so touched by that. You have no idea how much.) I am not going to let that doctor\u2019s attitude, arrogance, laziness \u2014call it what you will \u2014deter me from finding answers for my child. I don\u2019t know what steel I have found within me but I refuse to let go of my  knowledge  that whatever is going on with Nik has a  physiological  cause. It may have some significant neurological manifestations but, based on our  evidence-based knowledge  that Nik\u2019s brain has sustained no further injury since birth and there is no sign of any progressive degeneration, the cause is  absolutely  physiological. I  know  that from some deep-seated, intuitive understanding which I cannot explain but I trust implicitly. Sometimes, when I am starting to doubt myself \u2014to think that  maybe I might be wrong  \u2014things like  this article  pop up in unexpected places and fan the embers of hope which I refuse to let die. Lee J. Nelson  struggled for years with a  similar  issue as Nik is experiencing\u2014not the same but close enough \u2014and yet he would not accept the diagnoses of the myriad doctors he saw.  Sixty over the course of six years. One hundred different medications.  He never gave up in his  knowing  that there was a root cause which could be addressed.  His story  is worth reading; it inspires me. Nelson sums up exactly what I think many parents and patients with anything less than a straightforward, text book diagnosis may have come to believe: Nelson said the experience has radically altered his view of doctors. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful I had the [financial] resources and the gray matter to do what I did,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut I think that a lot of physicians have lost their intellectual curiosity and don\u2019t want to work with a patient.\u201d  [Emphasis mine.] I will not give up.

I\u2019 ve  been holding off a bit because we are going to see the new neurologist soon and are  hoping  he may be able to shed some light on something that was, possibly, inadvertently unearthed by the diagnostician. Was it really only just a week ago? My, how time flies when you\u2019re having such fun. The long and short of the visit is that  the doctor , whom we had heard such wonderful things about from  Doctor Mary , fell short of our expectations and desires. Well, obviously the desire part since we  desire  a comprehensive diagnosis \u2014complete with magic wand \u2014to make  Nik \u2019s excruciating pains go away.  Didn \u2019t happen. What did happen though is that we felt patronized, marginalized, and disbelieved \u2014yet  again .  WTF ??? Do other people  really  put up with being treated this way by the people they are  paying  to tend to their medical needs? The doctor  wasn \u2019t glaringly rude or obnoxious, it came across more in the diagnosis and solutions he suggested\u2014 and his questions to us. Okay, someone  please  explain to me how  \u201cDoctor, my child wakes up screaming in pain \u2014or sometimes it happens when he\u2019s awake and playing \u2014and begins punching himself in the face and jaw as if he\u2019s in agony,\u201d  translates to  \u201cWell, now, you may not think there\u2019s anything you\u2019 ve  changed about his sleeping environment but, really, think about it and I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ll find something that you\u2019 ve  changed \u2014something subtle \u2014that is keeping him from being able to fall back to sleep.\u201d  Hello?? We\u2019re not talking about a kid who has  insomnia  for God\u2019s sake! I  wish  I were exaggerating. The copious notes and videos I compiled and delivered (as requested) the week before the appointment? Wonder Doc  N-E-V-E-R  looked at them. His explanation was that he \u201csees a lot of medical records and I don\u2019t always have time to look at them before each visit.\u201d (ETA:  What he meant was the extra stuff not already a part of the patient\u2019s electronic records.) The preliminary diagnosis?  Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo . His solution? Drugs \u2014 more fucking drugs . Do we actually  believe  this diagnosis? Negative; almost  nothing  about what we witness on a nearly daily basis fits with the symptoms of this particular disorder. Of course, he would have known that had he bothered to read the notes or watch the videos. The medication he is suggesting? He needs to discuss it with the  \u201cbrilliant neurologist\u201d  \u2014you know the one who never returns phone calls even to our pediatrician \u2014to figure out which of  Nik \u2019s other  meds  to change. I won\u2019t hold my breath that he\u2019ll get an answer any time soon. The supreme irony, though, is that when we came home and looked up the medication in  Niksdad \u2019s  Nursing Drug Handbook  so we could learn about possible side effects and drug interactions, we found that it can also be used to treat  cluster headaches .  Hmmm \u2026 Hello, Mr.  Google ? BINGO!  According to  this description  put out by the Mayo Clinic, this fits  Nik \u2019s symptoms to the last detail \u2014including this one: They may scream, bang their heads against a wall or hurt themselves in some way as a distraction from the unbearable pain. We see the new neurologist on Friday and will be discussing this with him. It may not be the right answer but it sure feels like a direction to explore. Keep your fingers crossed.

{"date": "May 23, 2007 ", "body": "Well, I decided to try an experiment today. Not sure why I picked today of all days given that  Nik  was up at 4:15 this morning, was tired out from a full day at school, AND we were having dinner at my parent\u2019s tonight while  Niksdad  was at work. Usually a recipe for impending doom as the hour grows later\u2026 The experiment? Treat  Nik  like a  completely typical kid  regarding discipline. No allowances for  possible  language comprehension problems, no compensation for his complex history, and no sympathy for those killer baby blues with the ungodly long lashes. (I can\u2019t help it, I am  such  a sucker for that kid\u2019s eyes and smile!) Know what? IT WORKED. It wasn\u2019t perfect but nearly every time I told  Nik  \u201cNo\u201d in a very firm voice and either made him pick up whatever he threw, move away from whatever he was about to throw, or move away from dangerous/breakable things, etc. he actually  responded appropriately ! I was so shocked.. and pleased. Now, I know that it\u2019s a lot easier with a smaller child and I am not so naive as to think one successful experiment means the battle with  Nik  is won. I know it\u2019s going to get a lot worse before it gets better and even then it will change through the years. However, I won a far greater victory today\u2026the battle with myself to stop seeing  Nik  as some fragile creature who might break if Mommy says \u201cNo!\u201d Hah ! Not this little guy\u2026the one who likes to flip himself backward and head first off the couch. The kid who likes to slide on the big kid slides instead of the toddler slides (also head first when Mom and Dad aren\u2019t fast enough to stop him). The kid who like hot salsa,  Chinese  hot mustard, horseradish, and lemons (hold the tequila for now!). Definitely not a frail flower! The gloves are off.

It\u2019s not about taking on the world on behalf of the boy, it\u2019s about taking on the boy and teaching him to find his own way in the world.\u201d ************************************************************************************* I\u2019m sure Kristen over at From  Here to There and Back  was thinking of a slightly different context when she wrote  this  yesterday. Still, it\u2019s been ringing in my head all day long. Today we had an eye-opening session with Nik\u2019s behavioral psychologist, Dr. S. She\u2019s been invaluable to us as we\u2019ve dealt with various feeding-related issues \u2014 Nik\u2019s eating, he\u2019s not eating, he\u2019s eating again, he\u2019s not eating, it\u2019s sensory, it\u2019s behavioral, no it\u2019s sensory\u2026you get the idea. In addition, as we are gearing up for the summer session at school and Nik\u2019s IEP (which won\u2019t happen until the district\u2019s autism program evaluation is completed \u2013 hopefully by mid-June), we are very aware of some new behaviors that Nik is exhibiting which cause some trouble both at home and school. Specifically, tantrums when he encounters unmet expectations (whether a toy malfunctions or he expects to go in Mom\u2019s car and we go in Dad\u2019s, etc.), difficulty with transitions of all kinds (nothing surprising there, eh?), and the physical manifestations of those things. We went to see Dr. S. to get some guidance on these things so we could have a greater measure of consistency between home and school; thus far, school seems to be waiting to follow  our  lead about what to do and how to handle certain situations. It turned out to be a  much  richer appointment than that. We came home with a feeling of tremendous support and partnership in helping us work with the school on a number of fronts. Such a wonderful \u2014 and RARE\u2014 feeling! We are working on some specific plans for a more focused feeding program at school, some specific plans for home around behaviors, and looking at how best to frame our arguments for a one-on-one paraprofessional for Nik beginning as soon as possible (but not later than the start of the school year in September). Even so, it was a bit surprising when Dr. S. began to talk to us about her thoughts and observations of how  we  interact with Nik during his tantrums (which she got to witness first-hand today). The bottom line is that she told us we need to be much firmer with him and, unless he is in danger of hurting himself, let him wear himself out with the tantrum and start putting him in a safe time-out place. (That\u2019s going to take some creativity!) I think we\u2019ve become so tuned in to Nik\u2019s nuances that we (I especially) have gotten adept at figuring out how to diffuse the situation before it escalates. However, I am thinking now that perhaps that\u2019s not always in Nik\u2019s best interest. In doing the things we do, which are loving and supportive no doubt, we may be reinforcing not only the behavior itself but sending a message that expressing his feelings of frustration (outrage?) is not as important as \u201cgetting a hold of himself\u201d in order to accomplish\u2026well, whatever it is in the moment. Sometimes that is correct. Often, though, it\u2019s not the message we want to send and may, in fact, be disrespectful in some ways (my thoughts, not Dr. S\u2019). But what\u2019s been rattling around in my head since we came home tonight is the larger issue of discipline for kids with special needs. Not just autism and any other conditions which may have a stronger behavioral manifestation, but also things like cerebral palsy, leukemia, cancer, Fragile-X, Downs Syndrome, etc. I find myself wondering tonight if, because of Nik\u2019s multiplicity of overlapping, sometimes, intertwining diagnoses and conditions, I don\u2019t discipline him enough (I don\u2019t mean punishment!). Do I make unnecessary allowances for his physical limitations, or for his inability to express himself? Do I make assumptions about what he is or is not trying to express through his behavior? Do I \u201cbaby\u201d him too much in my attempts to keep that peaceful, easygoing spirit of his ever present? Do I do these things consciously or unconsciously? Out of guilt? Out of fear? I don\u2019t have any answers yet \u2014 just lots of questions to ruminate upon over the coming days. Opportunities for me to take a step back and look at my parenting style. Not so much to change it in any global sense but to decipher the roots of my reluctance to (my inability to?) see my son as capable of handling the discipline of a typical childhood. How do  you  discipline your children with special needs? Do you treat them differently than any of your other children? If so, why? If not, was it always that way? What prompted the change? What have you done with your exceptional child/ren that has worked? What works/ed for different age ranges? I think there\u2019s a kernel of a great parenting book in there somewhere\u2026just give me credit for the idea, ok?

{"date": "May 28, 2007 ", "body": "Well, here goes a mini-brain dump. (Um, that refers to the size of the \u201cdump\u201d not the brain, ok?!) Good weekend. Long, but good. Niksdad had to work all weekend so I felt pretty much like a single mother most of the time. We did get to go to a friend\u2019s BBQ yesterday evening. What an experience. It was the first time I\u2019ve ever been in a situation with Nik where I\u2019ve been pretty much expected to make small talk and, if necessary, explain Nik to strangers. It was extremely uncomfortable for me. At the park, I can always pretend I don\u2019t see the other parents or can distract myself with some interaction with Nik. Not so at the party. Trying to figure out where to draw that hazy, shifting line between telling Nik\u2019s amazing story and revealing too much information is so difficult for me. I am so proud of my amazing little fighter and how far he\u2019s come. I am also aware that not everyone in the world either cares (screw \u2019em!) or understands, or wants to. It was challenging to watch someone\u2019s 11-month old daughter not only toddling around on her own but eating food by herself and saying several words. I got a lot of sympathetic kudos from other women, mostly of my mother\u2019s generation (though not family). \u201cOh, you are obviously such a good mother. You must be exhausted. You must have your hands full with that one.\u201d And things of that nature. I nearly spit out my drink when one woman took my hand and pressed it between her palms and said quite earnestly, \u201cYou have secured your place in the Kingdom of Heaven!\u201d I mean, how the hell do you handle all those well-intentioned people who just don\u2019t have a stinkin\u2019 clue!? Yeah, Nik had a couple of major coping challenges but, overall, he did pretty well. Especially considering that it was a loud, large gathering and there was nowhere for him to safely get down and scoot and crawl and cruise. Thank God for my parents. Nanny (my mother) took Nik for a walk down the street and back to give him some quiet and me a chance to eat and have a modicum of adult conversation \u2014which unfortunately consisted of the aforementioned well-intentioned biddies\u2019 \u201ckudos.\u201d Took Nik to the park this morning, before Niksdad had to go to work. Nik did lots of climbing and sliding down the big-kid tube slides \u2014feet first and on his tummy. What a ham that kid can be. The park was very quiet this morning and it felt peaceful. I really needed that mental respite before gearing up for the balance of the day alone with Nik. (It gets exhausting after three days straight.)  While we were in the toddler area, letting Nik crawl and cruise and roll around to his heart\u2019s content, a little boy came over to play with Nik. The other child was a fairly good-sized two year old; he was bigger than Nik (who is slightly small for his age) and far more verbal, mobile, agile, you name it. His mom was watching and telling him to be careful and not run over the other Nik. I laughed and told her they were fine. I could tell she wanted to ask some questions about Nik but wasn\u2019t sure if she would offend us. I offered up the fact that Nik doesn\u2019t yet walk or talk and isn\u2019t always aware of other kids playing around him and left it at that. She was very protective of Nik and I think a little worried that her kid was going to hurt him as he barreled down the toddler slide and ran into Nik with his feet. Nik was unphased. We let them manage their own encounter; it was fascinating to watch. As the mother was telling me that her son, Jordan, was a middle child and played kind of rough and tumble with his bigger brother, Niksdad and I watched him moderate his actions to match Nik\u2019s. Where Jordan had, at first, been running and sliding he was now cruising and crawling alongside Nik. When Nik lay down on the warm decking and began to rock his head back and forth (rubbing, really), Jordan did the same. Nik would stop and look at Jordan and then sit up and move on. Jordan followed. They had this wordless ballet going between them and it was astounding to watch. Whereas  last time  Nik was oblivious to the other children playing near him, today he was completely aware of his silent playmate. I felt hopeful about progress Nik seems to be making in awareness of his surroundings more and more lately. On another note, I am finally getting around to reading some of the books that have been recommended on other blogs. I started with Paul Collins\u2019  Not Even Wrong  which positively captivated me. His narrative style, intertwined with the whole wild boy (and other) research, really connected to something deep in me that I am not sure I can yet identify. I found myself moved to tears often. I found myself thinking that this would be such a fabulous novel; in fact, in my pre-Nik life, I may have read it from that vantage point. Collins\u2019 descriptions of some o his interactions with Morgan were so poignantly reminiscent of mine with Nik. Not the actual content, of course \u2014Nik has neither language nor any apparent savant-like characteristics \u2014but the tenor of emotions so raw and real. I want to know more about Morgan and how their story unfolds. I\u2019ve also been reading Ellen Notbohm\u2019s  Ten Things Every Child With Autism Wishes You Knew . If I thought she\u2019d really read it, I\u2019d love to send a copy to my mother-in-law. Yeah, I\u2019m feeling pretty resentful toward her at the moment. Never mind the history of her attitude toward Nik \u2014which is so complicated and convoluted, despite her apparent love for him. I thought we\u2019d made such great progress in her acceptance of Nik exactly as he is and where is. LONG STORY SHORT \u2014M-I-L has some health problems which make long travel very difficult for her. So, she\u2019s (they\u2019ve\u2026my F-I-L, too) opted to drive 12 hours to a family wedding (her great-neice\u2019s) without any plans to stop to see Nik. We only live THREE HOURS FROM HER. She smokes like a fiend and we cannot go to her house because of Nik\u2019s chronic lung disease, so Niksgrandma & Niksgrandpa need to come to us.  They haven\u2019t seen Nik in a year. Got miffed when we returned their combo birthday/Christmas gift because it was UNSAFE. (This, in spite of the fact that we provided a long list of suggestions along with a thumbnail of where Nik was developmentally at the time.) But, don\u2019t get me started or I\u2019ll have my own meltdown! Anyway, due to MIL\u2019s health, I am certain that they will make it to the wedding (come hell of high water, because GOD FORBID the family thinks they don\u2019t care!) but by the time they are heading home, she will be in too much pain that they have to chug on through without stopping. I know I need to let it go but, goddammit, I can\u2019t! This is the same woman who refused to even acknowledge Nik\u2019s existence to any of her friends or family members until we sent out birth announcements when he was 4 1/2 months old and still in the NICU! She was more upset that we hadn\u2019t consulted with her before we sent them! ARGH!!!!!! (For clarity and context here, Niksdad shares my feelings about this so it\u2019s not like I am MIL-bashing\u2026exactly.) Ok, I\u2019m doing some deep, slow breathing now to regroup\u2026Well, that was an unexpected little explosion from yours truly. So much for not having that meltdown!  I feel like I need to end on a positive note because that\u2019s what I have always done my entire life \u2014apologize for my strong emotions. Not today. I\u2019m tired of playing \u201cnice.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m just tired? Nik takes so much work somedays. Between the need for structure in general, the need for a strict schedule in particular regarding his tube feedings and medications, and the equipment I need to schlep around to go places \u2014 it\u2019s challenging to be able to get out and do \u201cnormal\u201d things. Tonight, for example, my sister invited us over to swim and have dinner. We went but it was stressful. Changes of clothes, diapers, toys, stroller, feeding equipment, food for the off chance that Nik might deign to eat by mouth tonight (he did \u20142 ounces of fruit!). Then there\u2019s the hyper-vigilance which ensues the moment we walk in the door. Lots of doors, stairs, unguarded cabinets, the dog dish full of water, the large pony-sized dog, the swimming pool, the brick steps, the concrete patio with the wrought iron chairs (two if which Nik managed to pull over \u2014nearly on top of himself), etc. All become potential hazards which I must steer Nik away from. Yeah, a nice relaxing time in the pool\u2026did I mention Nik screamed most of the time until I figured out he hates his new floatation vest? Or that he had a mild sezure and whacked his head on the concrete patio?  Yeah, that was a blast\u2026NOT.  I don\u2019t know how single mothers do it! Honest to God! I think I got drunk on my half glass of wine because I was chugging down great gulps between sprints toward Nik and some imminent danger. Hic! Wow, I am really feeling sorry for myself tonight, aren\u2019t I? Yuck. Well, that\u2019s life. Guess I\u2019d better get a good night\u2019s sleep tonight because tomorrow I have to suck it up and do it all over again! Sigh\u2026where\u2019s a fairy godmother when you need her?

I lie awake in the darkness listening to the tenor of his cry, wondering if it will pass quickly or escalate. 3:40 a.m.  I look over at my husband, sleeping in peaceful oblivion. \u201cI should make good on my threats and wake his ass up!\u201d I think as I leave my cozy tangle of blankets and pillows. I don\u2019t wake him because I know, as does he, that I would only lie awake and listen to his attempts at soothing Nik\u2019s aching belly before catapulting across the hall to take over. Niksdad is great at many things. Middle-of-the-night-soothing-aching-belly-or-night-terrors missions are not exactly one of them. That\u2019s Mama\u2019s specialty, a fact of which I am simultaneously resentful and prideful.  3:41 a.m.  My little one is writhing in his half-sleep state alternately whimpering and wailing. In the pitch black, I instinctively reach for his little boy form and begin the gentle, rhythmic motions of soothing. Flashbacks of months spent in the NICU doing this same maneuver rush unbidden to my mind. Thank God for Miss Bette\u2019s teachings. A diminutive woman with hands of iron, she made a mission of teaching frightened parents how to bond with their fragile children lost amid a tangle of wires and tubing. \u201cUse firm, connecting strokes\u201d, she would instruct. \u201cCircle the belly with moderate pressure to help move the gas through, like this.\u201d A technique, called sun and moon, I have used it more times than I can even recall; Nik\u2019s surgeries have left scars which seem to have their own phantom pains soothed by the warmth of the sun and the caress of the moon. 3:48 a.m.  Nik\u2019s body arches and his belly tightens. Over and over. Time for Plan B. I fumble through the array of bottles on the table by the window. Finding the one I need, I pour out a small quantity of homeopathic tablets; Natrum Phosphoricum does wonders for gas. Years ago I was a skeptic; I have witnessed enough firsthand to even harbor any doubts in the middle of this night. Gently stroking Nik\u2019s tummy then his face, I tell him \u201cMommy has remedies for your owies, Baby. Let Mama help your tummy.\u201d He ceases his wailing long enough to let me slip the sugary tablets under his tongue before he arches again. Rub, rub, rub in rolling, rhythmic circles on his taught belly and over his lower back. What ancient mother-tongue is passed through countless generations of women that flows from me now, I do not know. The coos and shushes come instinctively. As does the need to connect to my child and soothe his pain. 3:50 a.m.  Nik\u2019s cries begin to ease a bit. More Natrum Phos to help the gas. In the stillness of Nik\u2019s room, our song begins to play on his lullaby CD. It\u2019s the same CD we played for endless hours in the NICU. The same one we\u2019ve taken with us each time Nik\u2019s gone back to the hospital. The very same which has played every single night as Nik drifts off to sleep. It has become the soundtrack of our lives.  In the inky stillness, I hear \u201cour song\u201d begin to play. The song I used to hum through my tears as I walked the NICU floor at Nik\u2019s bedside, cradling my miniature fighter. Rocking him and soothing him through torturous hours of similar episodes of gastric pain which ultimately led to the discovery and repair of his twisted, obstructed guts. The song, which words I never really have known but been content to make up my own version that seemed to fit, never fails to bring a lump to my throat. \u201cGoodnight, My love. Precious Dreams in the night, my love. Mama\u2019s here by your side, in the night, to shower you with love.\u201d  This night, as if compelled by some deep-seated memory rooted in the music, Nik reaches for my hand. His smooth little fingers wrap around mine and pull my hand toward his face. I am overcome with a fierce, raw ache in my chest. Could he possibly remember those hours so long ago in what seems like another lifetime? In a moment, not of my choosing, God has made himself known to me in the touch of my son\u2019s warm hand. It is our bond, Nik\u2019s and mine. Our connection forged through the fires of NICU hell, it is unshakeable in these hours. It transcends spoken words. 4:00 a.m.  Nik farts. Sighing, he settles in to sleep again. I watch his angelic face and delicate form relax into slumber. In these moments, he is not yet little boy but still my baby. A tear slips down my face as I lean over to kiss his satiny cheek. \u201cGoodnight, My Love. Mama will be here in the morning. Goodnight, My Love\u201d I whisper against his silken hair. His breathing becomes deep and even as I gently close his door and return to my room. 4:30 a.m.  I cannot sleep. I am overcome with the bitter sweetness of the moments just passed.

{"date": "December 28, 2007 ", "body": "\u201cToo often we under estimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.\u201d ~ Leo Buscaglia   As so many of us know from personal experience, the world as we know it can change in an instant. Receiving an unexpected \u2014possibly devastating \u2014diagnosis, the premature birth of a child, the death of a love d one, the loss of a job or relationship; all can shatter our perception of the world as we have known it. The look across a crowded room into the eyes of a stranger \u2014who one day becomes your spouse, the sound of your child\u2019s first cry or the feel of their tiny hand in yours; the \u201cHail Mary\u201d shot that wins the big game; the potential agents of change are myriad and limitless. This morning\u2019s visit to Nik\u2019s new neurologist feels very much like a life-changing experience. We have had so many  frustrating  visits to doctors that just don\u2019t seem to care or understand; brilliant but, perhaps, burned out doctors with no curiosity left to enable them to see that a box can indeed have more than six sides and eight corners. Doctors who simply want to scribble an indecipherable, unpronounceable name on a pad, pat our hands with a sympathetic nod of the head, and send us on our way to deal with the consequences. We are  understandably wary  of things which sound too good to be true.  Our initial visit with Doctor G. (no, not  that  one; we hope not to see  her , well,  ever ) lasted  nearly an hour and a half . During this time, the doctor sat and actually  listened  to what we thought was the primary issue, why we were seeking his help. He spoke candidly with us about what he saw on Nik\u2019s multiple MRI images done over the course of a few years; he was pleased to tell us there is nothing significantly disturbing and certainly no sign of anything progressive. We already knew that from our own readings of the radiology reports, but had never had a doctor explain to us what he actually saw on the films or what it all may mean. He queried, he listened, and he took  copious  notes. He stood beside me and watched the videos on our laptop computer \u2014 all of them  \u2014and then he asked if he could get a copy of the disk so he could review them more in depth and possibly discuss them with his colleagues. He did not dismiss our questions or theories out of hand  nor was he patronizing . And Nikolas, who is a very good judge of character, took to him right away \u2014in a way he has  never  taken to any other neurologist. Nik clapped hands, played with Doctor G\u2019s hair, and followed him with his eyes a great deal.  Together, we were a family at ease for the first time in a very long time. Doctor G walked with Nik and made some observations about his gait and balance which put things into a clearer view for us and gave us something concrete to work on in physical therapy. He  praised us  for trusting ourselves and making good choices for Nik and for providing him with the things he needs. There was never any mention of a strict educational program at a  certain school  which, Niksdad and I agree, would likely remediate much of Nik\u2019s uniqueness out of him in an effort to have him \u201cfit in.\u201d The subjects of tests and medications \u2014and autism \u2014were all discussed in depth. Doctor G made some recommendations for some ways to evaluate Nik\u2019s apparent pain response \u2014whether it is from seizures, headaches, or some other source \u2014in a  systematic  way. He discussed the possibility of changing some of Nik\u2019s current meds and possibly adding a new one down the road but he made it clear that it was a discussion we would have much later \u2014 not a done deal . He then asked a question I have  never  been asked by a medical professional in all of Nik\u2019s life.  \u201cHow do you feel about this plan?\u201d  Since I had initially raised a thought about one of Nik\u2019s seizure meds, Doctor G suggested we could start with that change if it would eliminate a concern for us, despite his opinion that it probably wasn\u2019t the cause.  He wanted us to be comfortable with the care plan and truly wanted our input. And if  that  wasn\u2019t enough to bowl us all over and make us fall head over heels for Doctor G, he then said,  \u201cI will always tell you when I don\u2019t know but I will also always keep looking for answers to help Nikolas.\u201d   \u201cHome is not where you live, but where they understand you.\u201d ~  Christian Morgenstern \u201cNot only is another world possible, she is on her way.

{"date": "May 31, 2007 ", "body": "Tonight, Nik sang with me.  Well, hummed really.  He always hums some toddler tune or another \u2014usually in nearly perfect tune and almost always in rhythm.  In fact, it\u2019s often how he communicates with us.  Whenever I start to hum or sing along, Nik always stops.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too distracting for him or if he would just rather do it alone or what.  Tonight, when I joined in Nik kept right on going and we \u201csang\u201d through to the end of the song.  He was sitting between my legs, leaning back against my body.  When we finished, I started to clap and cheer for a \u201cgreat job!\u201d  Nik turned his torso a bit and cocked his head to one side (the better to see me with his good eye) and gave me the cutest sideways grin as he looked me square in the eye.

{"date": "May 31, 2007 ", "body": "A recent post on  Autism Vox , titled,  Parents against Parents\u2026 , brings to light a very disturbing situation in the Cherry Hill, NJ public school system.  From reading through the numerous comments, it is apparent that this is truly hot button issue.  I hope you\u2019ll give it a read and share your thoughts. I suppose I should be happy that my son is in a special needs school in our district and that the issue of 1:1 paraprofessional support in the general education setting is not on our radar screen; it may be at some point in the future but not for a few years. Meanwhile, I have actually had some pretty good experiences with our school; that\u2019s not something I expected to ever say just a  short while ago .  The principal of Nik\u2019s school retired at the end of March, though he really stopped being fully engaged much sooner than that.  The current acting principal is also the  case manager .  She\u2019s stepped into the job with great gusto and enthusiasm and a wealth of experience and perspective that is sorely needed right now.  She is putting a lot of focus on parent involvement \u2014not something her predecessor did well, and she is really taking a hard look at how the school communicates with parents/care-givers.  She\u2019s also very clued in to assistive technology in a way that the old principal was not. I recently had the opportunity to participate in the interview process for the new principal.  There were some great candidates, the current acting principal among them.  I am not at liberty to give any details yet (I signed a confidentiality agreement) but hope the school board will make its choice at their June meeting; the intent is to have someone on board July 1.  I came away from the interviews feeling very hopeful. The candidates which were sent on to the next round of interviews (with the district super) are equally capable of infusing new life and broader perspective into the school and, I hope, in making it a more vital part of our district and our community.   All of which I think would benefit not only our specific school but the community at large as well. Meanwhile, I have also been asked to serve on the strategic planning committee for our school as well.  It feels great to know that family voices do matter and that parental input is valued.  I am lobbying hard to get some programs going at our school to bring in speakers sponsored by our state\u2019s parent information training center and to make families feel more included and welcomed at school beyond just picking up and dropping off kids or attending IEP meetings!  There are a lot of years of hard feelings which need to be overcome and I think it is going to have to come from the new families.

{"date": "July 26, 2007 ", "body": "So much to write about and so little time lately\u2026 Nikshouse is  healthy again . HURRAY!  Thanks everyone for your good wishes and thoughts.  Nik is completely over his summer cold and I\u2019m on the tail end of mine \u2014having sounded like a cross between Greta Garbo and Kermit the Frog for a few days there.  Believe me, it wasn\u2019t pretty!  Nik\u2019s  stoma  (g-tube site) is healing nicely and doesn\u2019t seem to bother him in the least now.  If only we could figure out the ear thing.  If you\u2019ll pardon the pun, it waxes and wanes; sometimes it seems to hit out of the blue and others we can sort of predict when it\u2019s going to be a bumpy stretch.  We\u2019re somewhere in between right now as  Nik slept through the night  last night for the first time in a while.  Alas, Niksmom did not. Blame that Potter kid!  I finally laid my hands on a copy of the new HP book and simply couldn\u2019t put it down until the wee hours.  I feel like someone might feel after being zapped with a cruciatus curse.  I have no one to blame but myself. Sigh\u2026it was worth it! LOVED the book.  I won\u2019t spoil it for anyone by discussing it here. Let\u2019s see, where do I begin?  Wow, all of a sudden the lyrics to the  theme from Love Story  started running through my head.  Think about it; they\u2019re very apt when applied to a parent-child relationship.  But I digress. Nik had his evaluations with the  new PT, OT, and SLP  on Monday and Tuesday.  We went for his first sessions this morning and have scheduled something at least three days a week for the next few weeks.  I am so impressed with the therapists already.  They zeroed right in on some of the key things we\u2019ve been concerned about within the first few minutes of the evals.  The greatest part is that the OT, Miss D (not the same Miss D from school), wants to spend a great deal of time working on just sensory stuff with Nik.  Hallelujah!  We\u2019ve been asking for someone to do that all school year.  She\u2019s even contacted the pediatrician about increasing the number of OT sessions per week so she can work with Nik before each of the OT and Speech sessions. The physical set up at the facility (I\u2019ll call it the \u201cgym\u201d) is wonderful.  Something for nearly every level of ability to accommodate all sorts of abilities while providing challenges, too.  Today, Nik actually climbed up a ladder (with some help from Miss T, the PT) to a sliding board.  Not steps\u2026A LADDER.  Who knew he could do that?  Certainly not I.  There are separate rooms for quieter, more focused activity which is where Miss D went through a pretty rigorous brushing protocol and did lots of joint compression before trying some vestibular activities with Nik. We\u2019ve made an interesting discovery.  Rather, I should say we\u2019ve confirmed something we suspected.  Nik has some pretty significant insecurity about not having his feet or his trunk somehow firmly grounded.  Miss D put Nik in the vestibular cradle/net swing (which is only 6 inches off the ground) and he completely freaked out.  Screamed himself purple, thrashed and bucked until he got himself out of the swing.  This cannot possibly be the same child who used to adore being cradled in a blanket and swung through the air by his Daddy, can it? Nik had the exact same response when he was placed on one of the large therapy balls.  I know it is something that the PT and OT will help him with \u2014developing a stronger sense of where he is in space, but it was excruciating to watch him in such a panic.  Mind you, neither Miss D nor Miss T persisted in any activity once it became clear that Nik was truly panicky.  But the wildness which overcame him was instantaneous and heartbreaking. On a happier note, Miss D and Miss T both feel that the sensory work will help Nik a lot.  They both said they saw a significant change in Nik\u2019s posture and muscle tone, as well as his ability to stay focused on an activity for longer than a minute, after a good 20 minutes of sensory activities.  I did see somewhat of a difference.  I guess I was just wishing that it would so immediate that Nik would remain calm and focused long enough to eat lunch when we got home this morning.  No such luck. Our eval with the SLP went well, too.  Miss C, actually met Nik last summer when he started at school.  She worked with him once or twice before she left for one of the charter schools in our district.  She works at the school and the \u201cgym\u201d.  She\u2019s friendly and very informative.  She is going to be working with Nik on some oral motor activities as well as looking at communications methods for him.  We all feel that PECS is not really an option for Nik right now as he tends to put everything in his mouth (including the cards).  Plus, Nik\u2019s secondary \u201cobsession\u201d after doors?  VELCRO.  Miss C has her work cut out, for sure.  We told her all the things we\u2019ve tried for oral motor facilitation and she was floored.  Hopefully, though, with the help of Miss D and her bag of sensory tricks, we might make some headway.  Stay tuned! Nik is making tremendous growth gains lately.  My little guy who was once not even ON the growth charts \u2014adjusted for prematurity or not\u2014 has made some great catch up growth.  According to the nutritionist, Nik is now hovering somewhere around the 90-95th percentile for body mass! It\u2019s all muscle, I swear!  I watch Nik\u2019s body lengthening and his legs getting more muscular; he\u2019s losing even the toddler look he\u2019s had about him.  My baby is turning in to a small person, a beautiful boy.  I still  watch him sleep  at night and see glimpses of the baby in his posture \u2014but even those are becoming fewer and fewer. Nik is now taking a few steps on his own throughout the day.  A few weeks ago he would take a step or two then his eyes would go wide \u2014as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure how he did that \u2014and he would plop to the floor on his bottom.  Not so anymore.  Now, he actively cruises along a wall and then lets go to take a step or two, sometimes three or four, and then launches himself toward a target \u2014a wall, a door, a leg.  Sometimes he will start to sit then stoops instead and places his hands on the floor.  He cannot yet stand up without holding on to something but I see him diligently figuring out the mechanics of the thing.  My days of even the slightest hint of peace are numbered! Nik is also communicating so much more.  No words but so many more consistent \u2014and affectionate and funny \u2014gestures and sounds.  Now when putting on shoes and socks, instead of simply sitting between my legs, Nik must climb onto my lap and lean as close to me as he can without actually getting into my clothing!  When brushing teeth or singing our bedtime songs, he does the same; he even admonishes me with a little squawk if I am not singing the right words or if I am singing too loudly.  When I comply with his wishes, he sighs and settles back against me.  Or he\u2019ll turn his little face up toward mine and smile at me with a twinkle in his eye.  Yep, gets me right THERE every single time.  I kiss his forehead and give him a squeeze. We don\u2019t really need the words, but I long for the day I might hear his little voice say \u201cI love you, Mommy.  I\u2019ll meet you in Dreamland.\u201d  I know that there are no guarantees in this life \u2014for anyone \u2014and I need to accept that he may not ever be able to articulate those words in the way I would hope.  That is not to say I am giving up on the idea of Nik talking \u2014very far from it.  I will make sure he has every possible chance to learn to speak; I just won\u2019t make it the be all and end all.  That Nik has a means of communicating is far more important to me than the method used. I have lots more on my mind but I think I\u2019ll save it for another post (or two?).  As my dear friend,  Mary Poppins  says, \u201cEnough is as good as a feast.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/whos-running-zoo.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/keep-on-keepin-on.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/05/nocturne.html", "http://www.jumbojimbo.com/lyrics.php?songid=2985", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/keep-on-keepin-on.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/05/nocturne.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/spoonful-of-sugar.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/07/26/a-moveable-feast/", "title": "A Moveable Feast?"},
{"date": "July 27, 2007 ", "body": "Today I feel like crying \u2014for no reason, for every reason.  For joy, for grief long past, for frustration, for my son, for my life.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a combination of factors such as sleep deprivation and hormones (gotta love PMS), but the feeling is so overwhelming that I am afraid to give in to it; I am afraid that once I start I will be unable to stop.  I want to wallow but I cannot go there today.   Nik  needs me to not go there today.  Still, I cannot shake the feeling.  Maybe I need to let it out to move on. I have read and re-read  Jennifer\u2019s  post on  ParentDish  about her twins, Bennett and Avery.  It is a beautiful post about their brotherly bond and the ways they are changing as they grow.  It is also evocative of the anxiety which ensues upon coming home from the  NICU  with more than one vulnerable baby.  It is, truly, a wonderful post.   I hated it. It made me cry \u2014hard.  Not from the beauty of Jennifer\u2019s words or the images of her boys falling asleep, limbs tangled together.  For me, it was like ripping a scab off of a wound I have buried so deep within my soul that I had nearly forgotten its existence.   Nik  had a twin. Somewhere in the transition from my first to my second trimester,  Nik \u2019s twin simply vanished.  Gone as if it had never existed yet I have the ultrasound pictures to prove that it had been very, very real.  I was crushed.   Niksdad  and I had tried for so long to achieve a successful pregnancy \u2014riding the roller coaster of infertility treatments and multiple early-term miscarriages \u2014that we had nearly given up on our dream of our \u201cprefect\u201d family of four.  While we  hadn \u2019t intended to have two at one time, we had just started to get used to the idea of our \u201cred-headed twin boys\u201d which is what we were sure we were going to end up with. I remember crying on the way home from the doctor\u2019s office.   Niksdad  gently held my hand and whispered that maybe we could try for another one after \u201c Poindexter \u201d was born.  But I knew in my heart that we  wouldn \u2019t; I was turning 40 in just a few weeks and I had already had a difficult first trimester out of work on limited-activity disability which might as well have been complete bed rest.  What should have been a period of joyful anticipation for us was, instead, a time of intense anxiety and hyper-vigilance.  I packed away my tears and pain over the loss and tucked it in the back of my heart.  The baby living and growing inside of me needed my energy now.  Grief would have to wait for another day. As fate would decree, that day would have to wait for a very long time.   Nik  was born three months early but measured as if he had been four months premature.  We  hadn \u2019t known until during my delivery that I have an anatomical anomaly \u2014 a  septate  uterus.  A thin, membranous wall divides my uterus in two; the \u201cwall\u201d has no blood supply.  Apparently, the placenta had attached itself to this membrane as well as to the uterine wall.  The result is that  Nik  had less than optimal blood supply throughout my pregnancy.  The doctors suggest that this is the reason for  Nik \u2019s prematurity and extremely low birth weight as well as the reason his twin vanished.  No one can say with absolute certainty though. With  Nik \u2019s very premature arrival and the resulting changes in our lives \u2014on the order of some very significant magnitude \u2014I\u2019 ve  just never stopped to look back.  The intensity of the early months in the  NICU  and the fears of whether our dearly wanted child would even live consumed our every waking thought.  I  couldn \u2019t spare a jot of energy for anything or anyone beyond my husband and our son.  I\u2019m not sure  Niksdad  would even want another one after all we have been through with  Nik ; it has been like the tempering of steel in a very hot fire.  The heat is exhausting and the fear of being burned is too great. Bit by bit, I am coming up for air and discovering that life still exists in the \u201coutside\u201d world though it seems just barely on some days.  My  not-so-baby  boy still needs me, perhaps now more than ever.  He needs me to help him navigate his way through his day to day world, to guide the hands and hearts of those who teach and work with him, to stand firm in the face of ignorance, pettiness, prejudice, and a tightwad school system.  Having another child is simply not an option that  Niksdad  and I feel we could responsibly, or in good conscience choose; I have been told by my doctor that I would be on complete bed rest and face a pretty high chance of having another premature, medically vulnerable child.  While I  wouldn \u2019t have terminated my pregnancy had I known what was coming with  Nik , I would not knowingly risk a second; it  wouldn \u2019t be fair to anyone involved.  So I don\u2019t think about the twin that vanished or the idea of having another child anymore \u2014when I can help it. Still, there are quiet moments when I am caught unaware by an invasive sadness; sometimes, it sneaks up on me as I watch  Nik  playing \u2014especially if he seems bored.  It is sadness for what might have been.  Not  Nik  as a \u201cnormal\u201d healthy toddler without disability or challenge.  I can no more alter my son, nor would I want to anymore, than I can call down the moon.  Instead, I am filled with regret and longing for the brother or sister  Nik  will never know.  For the sibling who could have\u2014might have\u2014 taken the lead and taught him things, shown him things, played games,  or shared secrets and tangled limbs as they fell asleep in the dark.  For the brother or sister who would also learn from  Nik  \u2014about strength and dignity and courage.  About loving fiercely and unconditionally.  About grace and acceptance. If it is true that God only gives you what you can handle, then I must be grateful for the gift of  Nik  and God\u2019s confidence in me.  Frankly, there are days I doubt my ability to give  Nik  what he needs and I am convinced that God got it wrong.  Still, there are days I wonder why God chose only one for me.  Blessings and lessons come in unexpected ways.

The Animal Fair (old minstrel song, origin unknown) \n \n \n \n Well, today I feel like the elephant has knelt upon my chest as I fight this summer cold that Nik was so kind as to pass along to me. To add insult to injury (mine, lest that be in question at this point), Nik is no longer sleeping through the night. Well, sort of\u2026 \n \n \n \n \n Nik has begun to \u201ctalk\u201d and cry in his sleep. Not enough to wake him\u2026just me! I find myself waking multiple times in the wee hours and stumbling, eyes half closed, to Nik\u2019s door to wait for the escalation of cries that doesn\u2019t come. I stumble back to bed with a not-so-silent prayer, \u201cPlease God, let him sleep throught he night  quietly !?\u201d  \n \n \n \n Alas, that prayer has gone unanswered lately. No, Nik is now  actively  waking at roughly 3:00 or 4:00 each morning and in the mood for serious play. I stumble to his room to put a toy in the crib. As I leave his room again, I hope in vain that he will get bored and go back to sleep. He does\u2026around 5:00 a.m., a mere half hour before Niksdad\u2019s alarm drags me from my newfound slumber. \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n Now, all of this would be mildly tolerable were it not for the fact that Niksdad is off to work most of these past few days leaving me to handle the monkey. Yes, the monkey.

Looking at the calendar of Nik\u2019s appointments and Niksdad\u2019s school and work schedules, I think I will be able to sleep on Thursday next. So if I ramble on in my comments on other blogs, have pity on a poor mother? \n \n (On a serious note: I am complaining tongue in cheek, but I am also exalting in how very, very far my little monkey has come!

{"date": "July 28, 2007 ", "body": "Yesterday, as you can probably tell, was a  difficult day  for me. I am sure the fact that Nik had such a difficult day, too, didn\u2019t help one bit. His blankety-blank  ear  is acting up again\u2026worse lately than it has been in a while. No signs of infection (yet), but I think it\u2019s on the way; he woke up screaming this morning and hitting his ear. Sigh\u2026 Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been starting to make some connections that are leading us to wonder if Nik may have some sort of vestibular disorder. It\u2019s still early stages of mulling things over but we will definitely ask the docs to consider checking it out. He\u2019s got significant vestibular insecurities (more than he used to), his balance has been kind of funny of late, and his eyes\u2026well, they\u2019ve got a lengthy history of their own. Throw in the whole weird ear saga that continues to worsen with no sign of infection. I don\u2019t know that we would have put these particular pieces together but the  new OT  indicated some things in her initial evaluation which do seem to be cause for concern; it certainly bears checking out.  Yesterday was one of  those  days for Nik. Manic tears and laughter all morning long. Nothing made him happy or comfortable until he had Advil at lunchtime. After a short non-nap (happy quiet time in his crib), my happy-go-lucky boy was back. In rare form, too! It never ceases to amaze me how Nik makes such rapid progress when he is well and healthy and how quickly he seems to lose skills when he is under the weather. In the morning, my angel couldn\u2019t pull hiimself together to be able to cry out for \u201cmamamamama\u201d; even a trip to the park just didn\u2019t cut it. Yet by the afternoon he was literally climbing the walls\u2026and the furniture\u2026and the windows. I took him for a walk to my parents house (roughly 2/10 of a mile round trip) without his orthotics; I wanted to wear him out so he\u2019d sleep well! LOL. He walked the entire way there without having to stop and sit once! Just held my finger and marched his wobbly little body all the way there. He knew where we were going and was very excited; he  adores  his Nanny and Granddaddy! Good thing it\u2019s mutual; Nik fairly attacked his Granddaddy by climbing onto his lap and demanding \u201ckisses\u201d by touching his forehead to Dad\u2019s\u2026over and over and over. My dad was in heaven. Nik showed off his newly developing walking skills by taking a few steps here and there to Nanny\u2019s outstretched hands, demanding that she play their special singing, clapping game. No one does it quite like Nanny. Niksdad\u2019s work schedule was changed for this weekend\u2026some unexpected time off. Between studying for his final exam on Monday and getting some yard work done, I think we are going to try to have a date night tonight! Woo hoo! Here\u2019s to a brighter day\u2026for everyone!

{"date": "July 29, 2007 ", "body": "Well, my parents were not able to babysit last night so we didn\u2019t have our  date night . Harrumph! We did manage to rent a movie and get some \u201cdown\u201d time that wasn\u2019t about studying, cleaning, doctor\u2019s appointments or taking care of Nik. We got a commitment from my folks for this coming Friday night, though, so I think we can muddle through another week without forgetting each other\u2019s name! ************************************************* Today has been a terribly stormy day with thunder and lightning and driving rain. Though, why on earth it\u2019s called driving rain is utterly beyond me; you can\u2019t see a darned thing to drive when it rains that hard! Our well laid plans \u2014to take Nik to the park in the morning then the pool in the afternoon \u2014fizzled out big time. We took Nik to  XBos  instead. Overall, he did really well. He cruised and climbed and slid with both Mommy and Daddy a few times. He seemed to be really enjoying himself until Daddy took him up into the structure one last time to try a different slide. We still don\u2019t know what it was \u2014the noise, the lights, being tired, or maybe fear \u2014 that made Nik completely freak out midway through the trek. I was waiting on the ground level while Niksdad took Nik up through the structure. They were having a perfectly good time until somewhere near the top. I could see Nik fighting against going up the platforms as they got closer to the \u201cbig\u201d slide (which Nik loved when he went down with Daddy a little while before). Daddy would help him up and then Nik would climb right back down. This went on a few times and then Nik just went ballistic. He fell to the floor screaming, crying, kicking, hitting his head and biting his hand. To say it was awful would be an understatement; I know you all fully understand what I am describing. Poor Niksdad made the mistake of trying to restrain Nik (he was in a relatively safe area and was not in danger of falling) and got a head-butt in the nose as Nik thrashed and reared into him. I felt helpless and frustrated. I could see what Niksdad was trying wasn\u2019t working and I didn\u2019t want to tell him so in such a public way. I simply told him to keep Nik safe and I was on my way up. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever climbed and clambered so fast in my life. When I got to Nik he was still frantically wild \u2014very much out of control. I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him into my lap \u2014receiving my own head-butt in the neck for my efforts. My objective wasn\u2019t to restrain him but to stay with him (thinking very much of Kristina\u2019s  post about being Zen  with Charlie) and to let him know he was OK. I just told him over and over that he was ok and that no one was going to make him do anything he didn\u2019t want to do. As I spoke very calmly to him, I began doing some joint compressions on his hands, arms and shoulders and gently pressing his hands together so he could (maybe?) get some calming input. I started to rock forward and back as I held him and hooked my arms under his knees, hugging them close to his chest. I felt his body begin to ease and the crying became more of a whimper. I scooped him up in my arms and asked Niksdad to go down first so I could hand Nik down to him as we went from level to level. At one point, I simply carried him until we got all the way down. By the time we got to the main floor, Nik was nearly recovered. We took him into the toddler play area \u2014with all the little  Tumble Forms type  stuff \u2014Nik was back to normal in minutes. We decided it was time to go and headed back out in the rain. By the time we got on the road, Nik was singing and smiling as if nothing had happened. I felt so awful for Niksdad. One, because Nik hit him so hard that he nearly broke his nose. Two, he didn\u2019t know how to help when Nik really needed him. I don\u2019t mean that in a judgmental way at all; rather, that we are still fumbling our way around and trying to figure out what works. Niksdad is still learning that restraint makes it worse. I think I get it more readily because I am the one that is usually with Nik at all of the  \u201cawful\u201d appointments  where he needs to be held down for something (like the g-tube stuff or EEG\u2019s). Since I am not strong enough to hold Nik as he gets bigger, I have had to find alternatives. The only reason I thought of trying the joint compression is because of  Miss D, Nik\u2019s new OT . I\u2019ve watched what she\u2019s done with him the two times we\u2019ve seen her; it isn\u2019t a magic cure at all, but it definitely helps Nik maintain focus and calm. I\u2019ve been trying it at home over the weekend but haven\u2019t been able to tell if it helps. I think I can safely say, after this morning, that it does. Nik ended up having lunch and taking a nice nap while Niksdad got to study for his final exam tomorrow and  I got out of the house  for a short break. All is well and  Nik is now sound asleep  for the night.

Between his going back to school to become a nurse anesthetist (we still have a few more years to go) and working part time, Nik\u2019s school schedule, Nik\u2019s doctors\u2019 appointments, and the general stuff that needs to get done around the house\u2026well, let\u2019s just say there\u2019s never enough energy to go around for both of us at the same time. When he\u2019s up, I\u2019m down and vice versa. With some of Nik\u2019s special needs \u2014most glaringly, his feeding tube and the fear it seems to invoke in any non-parental caregivers \u2014it\u2019s quite challenging to find a babysitter very often. My parents are pretty good sports though and do come over once in a while after we\u2019ve put Nik to bed, giving us a chance to slip out for a movie once a month or so. Still, it never seems like enough. Just the other night, I told Niksdad that I really missed \u201cus.\u201d Now I look back on all those times we used to take for granted when we could hop on the back of his Harley and ride off to a vineyard for the day, go for a drive in the mountains, a weekend in the country, a late dinner and a movie followed by an even later (decaf) coffee. Sigh\u2026those days are gone. Long. Gone. Forever. I cried on his shoulder last night about how we never have time to even just touch anymore. I\u2019m not talking sex (don\u2019t even go there!), but the affectionate embraces we used to share as we made dinner together or sat on the sofa watching a movie. All the subtle cues that remind a person they are loved and cherished. Now, our lives are so full we barely even have time to do things together that aren\u2019t some sort of task on a to-do list. If it can\u2019t be \u201cdivided and conquered\u201d we don\u2019t bother to tackle it anymore. Sad, but true. Now, lest anyone think the love is gone, the flame has died, etc, I think I should note here that we have a tremendous amount of love, respect, trust, and affection for one another. We just seem to be sadly lacking in any modicum of mental, physical, or emotional energy left to do more than kiss one another and assure each other that \u201cI love you, Darling,\u201d or \u201cI love you, too, Honey. G\u2019night\u201d before we pass out at the end of each day. Only to wake up six hours later to repeat some variation of the same theme the next morning. I know my husband loves me and he is working damn hard to create a new life for us \u2014not to mention a fulfilling career for himself. And I know that what I do as a mother to our son is irreplaceable. Niksdad and I did a rough estimate a couple of years ago and determined that, in order for me to work full time outside the home, I would need to make nearly $200k a year to cover it the additional costs incurred for childcare and nursing care. Niksdad likes to remind me of that once in a while; I guess maybe that\u2019s his way of letting me know that he appreciates everything I do. Still, I really miss our time together as a couple. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to look like as we get further and further into Niksdad\u2019s nursing training \u2014longer class hours and clinicals on top of that, plus the study time \u2014and I worry that we will drift apart. Not for lack of love and commitment but for lack of energy and creativity. For lack of something in common anymore that isn\u2019t our son. My fear is that, as Niksdad grows and changes into his new career, I have nothing to show in my life besides being Niksmom. Have you been there? How did you weather it, what did you do to keep things alive in the face of utter exhaustion and shared concern over your child/ren? How did you get out of what I call \u201cthe roommate rut?\u201d ************************************************************************************* I wrote all that the other night and didn\u2019t have the cajones to post it; it somehow felt too personal and maybe would make someone (besides me) uncomfortable. I am my own worst censor \u2014always worrying about someone else\u2019s needs first, even when I write sometimes. Sigh\u2026 Niksdad headed off to work this afternoon. About 40 minutes later he came strolling through the front door looking baffled. Seems his work schedule was changed and no one thought to tell him. He works part time at Home Depot as he is going to school. We have been fortunate enough to be able to take some equity out of the house so his income isn\u2019t mission critical. Well, it is in the sense that it will help us make the money stretch farther, but it isn\u2019t in that we can certainly afford to pay our monthly expenses without it. So, now Niksdad is completely off of work for the next two weeks. Hmm\u2026I sure hope my lamenting about not having time together didn\u2019t misfire in the universe\u2026 The old adage \u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d sure applies here! So here I\u2019ve been grousing about not enough time together and all of a sudden \u2014WHAM! Now what do I do? I mean, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing, right? How do I strike a balance between quality time with my husband and us wanting to kill each other from being together 24/7? Yeah, I know\u2026I\u2019m never satisfied.

Thanks everyone for not only your supportive comments on  my existential crisis , but especially the reminders that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d (eventually). I guess I\u2019ve gotten so used to worrying about something that it was inevitable I would turn my radar inward to myself and my marriage. Not a bad thing to do every once in a while, I guess. Things are looking brighter these past couple of days. Niksdad seems more relaxed \u2014now that he\u2019s embraced the \u201cno work for two weeks\u201d concept. He\u2019s been taking Nik to the park in the mornings after breakfast; giving me a chance to get back into my workout routine which has been interrupted by first  Nik\u2019s  then  my illness . It\u2019s felt really good to get out of the house to do something that makes me feel more vibrant afterward. Sweaty, but vibrant. We\u2019ve made plans to take care of some projects around the house \u2014big ones, like replacing the yucky carpet in the family room with some sort of wood laminate. The family room is where Nik spends a great deal of time and it takes a real beating. The carpet is ugly and stained and I don\u2019t even want to think about what\u2019s possibly growing underneath! We won\u2019t be able to do the actual work until Nik goes back to school on the 22nd. But, the process of planning and making flooring selections \u2014which of course leads to discussions of other projects \u2014has felt good. It feels reminiscent of the early days in our marriage when we would tackle projects together in our first house \u2014the one in CA, where we lived when Nik was born. We were partners and made a great team. In fact, we still make a great team; everybody remarks on that and tells us how lucky we are. They are right. We\u2019ve had to shift our focus quite a bit in these past few years but we\u2019ve always worked well together \u2014planning, discussing, researching, strategizing, dreaming together, and inspiring one another. Maybe we took our eyes off the road for a little bit but I think we\u2019re on the right track. It\u2019s a bit like all the times I\u2019ve been on a car trip by myself (in the olden days before Niksdad came along). I\u2019d be off on an adventure, driving down the highway \u2014not always toward a specific destination. I\u2019d look down and the gas gauge would read near empty and the next exit wouldn\u2019t be for miles and miles. I\u2019d drive along, darting anxious glances at the fuel gauge every few seconds, wondering when I would run out of gas on some lonely stretch of road. Know what? It never happened; I always made it to a gas station in the nick of time. I need to remember that more often when I get antsy about my life \u2014especially my marriage. The frustration, though, of not being able to have consistent time alone together gets tough. Unfortunately, we aren\u2019t exactly in a position to shell out bucks for specialty care givers \u2014which are VERY hard to find around here. In fact, there\u2019s such a demand that no one with the right qualifications wants to work the small number of hours we need. The respite system in our area is the pits for us right now. Medicaid doesn\u2019t recognize the need for couples to go out once in a while as legitimate. If I worked or were in school, then they would consider our eligibility. The only drop-off respite we\u2019ve been able to find doesn\u2019t\u2019 work with our schedule and our needs. So, we limp along with the help of my folks for now. During the school year I think (I hope) it will be a bit easier; some of the Para\u2019s also do childcare/respite once in a while and I know lots of them! Meanwhile, though, we\u2019ve been making plans to do some things together as a family; things like a return trip to the  beach , a trip to the zoo, a local peach festival this weekend, the pool at my parent\u2019s country club in the afternoons (weather permitting), and a trip to a new  \u201cCan Do\u201d playground  which opened up about an hour north of here, near the hospital where Nik sees all his specialists. We might even try  XBos  again! It feels like a time of renewal somehow. Maybe not quite what I had envisioned \u2014you know, candle light and romance \u2014but perhaps better, more important as we, Niksdad and I, learn to make the most of the precious time we do have together. Time that must include our son right now. Long before Niksdad and I got  married , I wrote a vision for myself of what I wanted our marriage to be: Niksdad and I have a loving marriage and raise healthy children in a warm, loving, creative, and stable home. Our relationship touches the lives of many as we open our hearts and home to many children. Our love helps heal others. Deep, huh? It may not look quite the way I had envisioned it all those years ago, but perhaps we haven\u2019t lost our way after all. Maybe I just need to check the map every once in a while to realize that the wrong turns or missed exits will still get us to our destination \u2014wherever that may be. And if I let myself, I just might enjoy the ride.

We\u2019re going to take a very different tack on this next go \u2018round and will do everything in writing and record the session. We\u2019ve already got some specific points we need to follow up on which weren\u2019t addressed in the  last IEP . And, going forward, we\u2019re going to be cordial but, frankly, a pain in the butt about requesting an independent educational evaluation (IEE). We have already provided our own privately done evaluation which school has virtually ignored. You may recall that  Bobo  indicated that it didn\u2019t matter anyway. Well, we\u2019ll see about that one. \n We will play their game only better. We\u2019re going to be looking over the goals and objectives with the proverbial fine-toothed comb. We truly feel the goals they have set for Nik are not appropriate and seriously underestimate Nik\u2019s abilities. Of course, we\u2019ll also be looking for an increase in services and now, with the change of Nik\u2019s placement from school to \u201chome instruction,\u201d we\u2019ll be pushing for a teacher to come work with him at least one day each week. \n The challenge now is for me to sit down and write up cogent arguments supported by facts and concrete data. It\u2019s a challenge getting my emotions and mama-bear protectiveness out of the way. But I have to in order to give Nik the best shot at a  meaningful  IEP. I don\u2019t want to go through another year like  last  year. I mean, I know that Nik will grow and progress and flourish on his own (well, perhaps Niksdad and I might have a tad to do with it, too). But the things he could do, the catching up he could achieve if he is given the right combination of supports, services, and challenges\u2026 he could actually  benefit  from his FAPE instead of just filling space and marking time. \n In the time since he\u2019s been home, in spite of his being ill and running a continual low-grade fever, Nik has been so much more animated and focused. He\u2019s consistently (well, almost consistently) cooperating in most requests such as \u201clie down so I can change your diaper,\u201d or \u201cturn the toy off and give it to Mommy, please.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s right. Along with the newly emerging skill of standing independently, Nik has already made significant progress on TWO of his IEP goals. Frankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much more than the fact that he\u2019s not so bloody overwhelmed by is environment. But, hey, what do I know? I\u2019m \u201c just his mom \u201d and can\u2019t be objective. (Sarcasm dripping from her voice\u2026) \n So anyway, I may be a little quiet online for a while as I gather resources and compile data. I\u2019ll be lurking and commenting from time to time but I may not write much this week. Don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ll be back!

{"date": "September 25, 2007 ", "body": "\n Naturally When I discover the cleverness of a remarkable me, How can I hide it When deep down inside it just tickles me so That I\u2019ve gotta let go and crow! \n Peter Pan  (stage version) \u201cI\u2019ve Gotta Crow\u201d   \n \n OK, so I know  I said I\u2019d be offline  for a bit doing the research and whatnot for our yet to be scheduled follow-up to the  IEP from hell . But, well, I gotta crow! Besides, I am waiting for a critical bit of paperwork which school doesn\u2019t have ready yet. Uh-huh, you guessed it; Nik\u2019s IEP isn\u2019t even in it\u2019s final form yet and we are ELEVEN DAYS past the meeting date. Wonder what they would have done if Nik  hadn\u2019t  been  ill  all  last week \u2026 \n So anyway, back to the crowing bit. \n Today, Nik is completely  fever-free ; he still has the runny nose and slight cough but he\u2019s better. Sooooo\u2026I took him to OT, followed by PT, then playgroup this morning. It was an experiment to see if he could tolerate the full two hour window of work and play.  \n Nik did awesome.  He gave Miss D (the OT) a run for the money with some things but it was evident to both of us (D and me) that Nik was so happy to be there with her. He did pull his own little \u201c gaslight \u201d on Miss D when she made him ride a scooter around the room. He fought and screamed and kicked and thrashed. Miss D never gave in. When they made it to their destination \u2014the ball pit \u2014and Nik got off the scooter, he gave Miss D a smarmy little look that said \u201cHa, this is what I wanted all along.\u201d He laughed and toddled off smirking. What a stinker. \n In spite of his protests during the scooter ride, Nik actually used a lot of vocalizations and inflections (where\u2019s the speech therapist when you want her, right?). He also did a lot of really great, focused work doing tasks to completion multiple times where he used to simply throw things midway through and go in search of a door to play with. He even let Miss D swing with him for a good long time. \n He also did a great job with Miss T during his PT session. Lots of hard work because we are trying to help correct a muscular imbalance in his hips which has developed over time. Nik doesn\u2019t like to bear as much weight through his right hip as he does the left; it\u2019s simply a matter of uneven use and posture but it\u2019s become a habit we need to break. He fought it but made it through and did some nice things in the process. Nik\u2019s gotten pretty good at communicating when he\u2019s either bored or overwhelmed and needs a change of activity. When he\u2019s bored, he throws the things he\u2019s playing with (blocks, puzzle pieces, etc.); when he\u2019s overwhelmed he throws things, too, but it is accompanied by a fit of uncontrollable giggles. Hey, I suppose ti could be worse, right? \n So the real crowing is about to start\u2026playgroup. Nik was so present and focused. He played nicely \u2014appropriately and calmly \u2014with a variety of non-electronic toys. Sure, Nik still obsessed about each door and tried to get to them whenever he could and he stuck to lots of things he already knew how to do well. But he tried several new activities and seemed to enjoy them.  \n He crawled under a low obstacle course Miss T had set up; Nik is not overly fond of crawling or being on his belly and this activity required both. He did this same activity three or four times; each time he did it better and more smoothly. \n He played with a baby doll, giving hugs and kisses on the forehead!  \n He interacted socially with people as if it were a natural every day occurrence for him. \n He wanted what two of the other kids had and came over to them to check it out! \n I know that many of you understand how some of these things have rocked my world today \u2014in the best possible way! \n I think I said this to someone in an email last night \u2014 I am convinced that having Nik away from the sensory overload of the school environment for more than a week has made a tremendous difference in his ability to self-regulate. This, in turn, helps him make such wonderful strides as he did today. \n I am so proud of my son \u2014today and everyday; he makes me crow with glee!

{"date": "September 26, 2007 ", "body": "It\u2019s over. Done. Chapter ended, book closed; we\u2019re moving on. Tonight, with Niksdad literally helping me to hit the SEND button on the email, we withdrew Nik from school\u2026and not for the medical reasons we thought we were going to use. I was on my way to school with Nik this morning after his feeding therapy at Easter Seals; I happened to run into our advocate who was on her way in for a meeting of a special council for children with disabilities. She asked me to join the meeting and I said I couldn\u2019t; I had to get Nik to school. She gave me the \u201chairy eyeball\u201d and asked whether we had or had not decided to take Nik out of school. Long story short, Nik and I stayed for the meeting. When I came home and got Nik settled in for lunch and his nap, I called the Community Legal Aid Society; they have a special Disability Law Project group that handles all sorts of things including FAPE and insurance issues. They took my information and someone will review it and call me back. As I hung up the phone, I cried. Frustration and exhaustion hitting me all at once; I feel weary before the battle even begins. It shouldn\u2019t have to be this hard. When Nik woke from his nap, we played and laughed and sang and tickled. We played together with his shape sorter for nearly 30 minutes \u2014taking turns, picking out the shapes when I asked him to, finding the shapes of the same color. It wasn\u2019t always consistent and perfect but there was clear cut intent and understanding \u2014and enjoyment for both of us. Every once in a while Nik leaned into me making smacking sounds to give me kisses. He chose another toy and snuggled into my lap with it. It was the way I always dreamed it could be to spend time with my toddler. The way I knew it couldn\u2019t be if we had to keep school in the picture. Regardless of Nik\u2019s placement as \u201chome instruction,\u201d if we pulled Nik out of school for medical reasons, we would still have to fight all the same battles with school. Niksdad and I talked it over at dinner and decided that we were going to take the chance and cut school out of the picture entirely. We may have to do some battles with Medicaid but we agree that it will be easier than dealing with the school district. And, in the (please, God!) unlikely event that Medicaid completely stops all services \u2014 well, we\u2019ll just do the best we can until we find other solutions. I am not going to lie and say I am 100% comfortable with that possibility; I am afraid that I might not have what it takes to give Nik what he truly needs in terms of education and development without the support of PT, OT and Speech therapies. It\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever known. But, I do know a lot of rehab professionals who would give me great resources to use and I am smart and willing to do anything to help my child. I guess that counts for more than I give myself credit for. And Niksdad and I agree that we don\u2019t want to have to go through the hassles we would with school until Nik absolutely must be there. We\u2019ve even decided that we are not going to follow up on some of the procedural types of things (and there were many!) which school screwed up. We will make it known for the record that we do not agree with his IEP as it is written; hell, it\u2019s not even complete. There are two full sections missing \u2014his OT and Speech present levels, goals, and objectives aren\u2019t even done. But, we will make damn sure that when we ride this merry-go-round again that we play their game from the get-go. We will insist on every prior written notice, every 10-day notice for meetings. We will record every meeting, do everything in writing, and sign nothing we don\u2019t agree with. We will make sure that we know the laws better than they do and use them to our complete advantage. When Nik is five. For now though, we\u2019ve jumped even though we can\u2019t quite see the net. It\u2019s a funny thing, too, because between Niksdad and me, I am usually the one taking leaps of faith and dragging him along with me. But it feels right \u2014and good\u2014 that as I leap, he is right there holding both my hands, looking into my eyes, and telling me \u201cIt\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d He\u2019s always right, you know. ***************************************************************** Of course, I should have mentioned that I *do* have a safety net for myself\u2026all of my blogging friends who keep me sane, send cyber hugs when I\u2019m down, and celebrate the good stuff.

{"date": "September 30, 2007 ", "body": "I stood in the darkness of my kitchen. Evening twilight filtering through the woods behind the house, I wept uncontrollably. I am shaken to my core by the plight of a child I don\u2019t even know. The impact of what I have read pierces through the armor of my daily life. I am hurtled back in time to my early days with Nik. The visceral grip of endless days and nights of fear and panic, uncertainty and inability to control my child\u2019s destiny. I must do something to help, but what? One hour ago, I met a new family through another blog,  Rhett\u2019s Journey . The family is not Rhett\u2019s, though they are a wonderful family, too. No, I met Chelsea and her family for the firs time today. Chelsea is a beautiful little girl, about 1 1/2 years old, with Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). She is also in the hospital right now facing the fight of her life. For her life. Just last week Chelsea was diagnosed with leukemia and now she is undergoing chemotherapy. You can read her story  here , in her blog written by her mother. You can see a recent video of Chelsea in her healthy glory right here.

{"date": "September 30, 2007 ", "body": "I think I\u2019ve mentioned more than once recently that  Nik  seems to be making really wonderful strides in the two weeks since we\u2019ve taken him out of school. (See  here ,  here , or  here .) While, technically, there is still much to be resolved around services such as PT, OT, Speech therapy,  Niksdad  and I are at very much at peace in our hearts with whatever comes. And it seems with each passing day there is some new affirmation of the rightness of our decision. Today\u2019s came in an unusual and unexpected medium \u2014a  temper tantrum . Note, I did not say a \u201cmeltdown\u201d or \u201ccoping challenge\u201d though, in truth, the latter is exactly what it was. The scene was my parent\u2019s house. My parents live a mere six doors down the street and it is not an unusual occurrence for us to walk down to visit with Nanny and Granddaddy. In fact, when asked if he wants to go see Nanny and Granddaddy,  Nik  will usually drop whatever toy he is holding at the moment, squeal, and make a bee-line for the gate in anticipation of the journey. To put it mildly,  Nik  adores his grandparents; they have a lovely mutual admiration society going. When we venture off to see Nanny and Granddaddy, we almost always go through their garage and into the house, where  Nik  makes the rounds of every door on the first floor. The layout of my parent\u2019s home is such that  Nik  is able to make a path around the hallway and practice going up and down single steps unassisted. He loves the sense of freedom and autonomy, I am sure; I loathe having to chase him from door to door telling him \u201cNo door\u201d over and over. Today, however, my parents were outside working in the yard when we arrived.  Nik  greeted them with his usual affectionate zeal which involves clapping Nanny\u2019s hands and rubbing his forehead against  Grandaddy\u2019s  chin. A little unorthodox, true, but no less joyful and affectionate than hugs and kisses. Greetings over,  Nik  marched himself right over to the garage door and waited to be let inside. When he realized that wasn\u2019t going to happen, well, he lost it. And he  didn\u2019t . In the past,  Nik  has \u2014as many of you are very familiar with from your own child\u2019s meltdowns \u2014simply willed the bones in his legs to turn to liquid and hit the floor or ground with alarming force as he screams and cries.  Nik  would usually get so worked up that often  Niksdad  or I would simply have to pick him up and either carry him or put him in the stroller and leave. Today, however,  Nik  screamed and cried and carried on so that the neighbors must surely have thought that wicked old man (Granddaddy) must have hurt the poor little boy! Poor Dad; he stood looking at his beloved grandson and was helpless. I\u2019ve never seen a man look poleaxed like that before.  But  Nik  kept his legs under him . In fact, once he realized that Granddaddy wasn\u2019t going to let him inside \u2014and he tried desperately to get Mommy and Nanny to acquiesce, to no avail \u2014 Nik  simply grabbed  Grandaddy\u2019s  hand and began to drag him away. Mom and I thought he was going to try the front door. Nope.  Nik   proceeded  to drag his Granddaddy down the driveway and out to the street \u2014 straight home to his own front door!   Nik  cried and fussed and fumed the entire way home as I trailed along behind pushing the stroller. God bless my father; he knew exactly how huge a development this was and he went along with  Nik  willingly. Once we got  Nik  inside, he let go of my hand and marched, I  swear  he marched, through the dining room, turning right into the kitchen and proceeding on into the family room \u2014\u201dhis\u201d room \u2014 and threw himself onto the floor for a good  hissy  fit. I must have drawn blood biting the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing out loud. Not missing a beat, I grabbed one of  Nik\u2019s  new books which plays music (of course, would he have any other kind?) and sat down on the sofa to play with it.  Nik\u2019s  curiosity won out quickly and he came to sit in my lap. In. My. Lap. He sat, leaning against me, playing with his book for a good ten minutes. He\u2019d press a button and I\u2019d sing along with the song and point to the pictures for him. Every once in a while he just sighed and turned to look at me with a sweet smile. I\u2019m sure I sighed a few times, too. I can\u2019t help but wonder how differently this would have all played out had  Nik  still been in school.

{"date": "September 28, 2007 ", "body": "So here we are on Friday\u2026playing hooky from school since we apparently need to sign an IEP to officially remove Nik from school. I haven\u2019t returned school\u2019s calls yet; I am waiting to talk to the person from Legal Aid to determine the next steps which will protect Nik. I also got a message yesterday from \u201cNurse Nosy\u201d from school. Thank goodness for caller ID; I let the machine get the call. Her message was a chatty but brief \u201cHow are you?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Funny, she didn\u2019t bother to call at all during the ten days Nik was actually ill. Fishing for information much? Yeah. Oh, sure, I\u2019ll call her back\u2026right after hell freezes over. But enough of that rant. Today I have random thoughts and stuff to share. I usually delete all the Autism Speaks emails I get. Today, for some reason, I checked it out and found a link to an interesting RAP video. It\u2019s made by a young man who works with autistic adults in New York. I couldn\u2019t find a lot of information but it appears that he is a licensed professional who works in an institutional setting. It\u2019s an interesting video. On the surface, I don\u2019t necessarily agree with some of the choices he makes to describe autism. But then again, if he is working with an institutional population he may see more of the extreme end of the spectrum than I have. None the less, I think his message is heading in the right direction \u2014no mentions of cures! It\u2019s worth a look. Check it out and share your thoughts. You can find the video  HERE . On another tangent, I\u2019ve not yet had the chance to read the wonderful book which Kristen sent me \u2014 What You Can Do Right Now to Help Your Child With Autism . That\u2019s on my nightstand to start this weekend. I\u2019ve also reserved a copy of John Elder Robison\u2019s  Look Me in the Eye  at my local library and can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s available. Some other lucky person currently has the  one  copy available in my county. Yes, Delaware is a small state. Meanwhile, Nik seems to be doing so well since he\u2019s been home from school. I\u2019ve already written about that in a few other posts. I have been trying to capture this on video but Nik is very aware of the camera and tends to either clam up or come right to the camera to play with it. So, it\u2019s a little late for  Wordless Wednesday  but here is a quick clip to give you an idea of what I\u2019ve been hearing more and more of these days. It\u2019s becoming more consistent and ubiquitous \u2014as Nik plays in the family room, during his PT and OT sessions, in his crib, at the dinner table, in the car. The boy has lots to say in his own unique and beautiful way. I\u2019ve had so many ideas for some posts inspired by other blogs. Alas, I haven\u2019t written them down and they are gone for now\u2014 crowded out by all the recent events and concerns with school. If they return I\u2019ll share them. If not, just know that those of you whose posts I read regularly inspire me to thought and action throughout the day. Happy Friday.

{"date": "October 25, 2007 ", "body": "Things I learned today: Nik  does too  have pincer grasp. He uses it very nicely, especially on zippers. My sofa cushions unzip easier than I thought they do. Nik\u2019s feet have grown at a rapid pace. He\u2019s already outgrown the shoes we bought for him in August. Nik can remove his shoes and socks in 5 seconds flat. Nik has fairly good aim and a strong arm. Size 6 1/2 toddler Nike\u2019s hurt when they are flung at the back of your head while driving down the highway. Nik has grown taller at nearly the same rate his feet are growing. The door handle at the hairdresser has obviously been moved lower; must be to accommodate all the little old ladies\u2026 It takes 6 adult women to cut one (nearly) four year old\u2019s hair. One to cut, one to hold, and four more to join in the singing and hand clapping which masks the sound of the clippers. Wheels on the bus is the current song in top rotation on the play list.

{"date": "October 29, 2007 ", "body": "\u201cWhen the student is ready, the master appears.\u201d \n ~Buddhist proverb \n Thanks to everyone for the wishes of good health, hugs, and cyber ice cream after  yesterday morning\u2019s trip to the doctor . Apparently, Nik didn\u2019t get the message in time. A new lesson learned yesterday?\n The fever it takes to actually  stop  Nik instead of merely slowing him down? About 105.1 Fahrenheit. \n By dinner time last night, while Niksdad was at work of course, Nik\u2019s fever spiked fast and hard. It peaked at 6:30 p.m. bringing with it significant chills and a bright red rash. Funny, with  all we\u2019ve been through  with Nik, this one came closest to bringing me to my knees. I called Niksdad and asked him to come home to accompany us to the hospital. To make a very long and exhausting story short (why should we all suffer this morning, right?), we made it home at 1:30 a.m. this morning. \n Yet again, there is no readily identifiable cause for Nik\u2019s sudden bout of feverishness and continued intermittent  illnesses . \u201cWell, it\u2019s most likely viral. But that  right ear  looks a little iffy. Let\u2019s keep him on those antibiotics just in case.\u201d The good news, I think, is that the ER doc was able to tell us that Nik might get worse before he gets better and how to handle it. Would\u2019ve been nice if  the guy that did that strep test  in the morning could have told us that. We might not have had to go to the hospital after all. Sigh. \n Oh and speaking of  that strep test ? Turns out, it\u2019s  not a great idea  to run the test after it\u2019s been dropped on the floor after all. When I told the attending doc in the ER about what had happened he was, well, floored. They ran another one and will call us with the results. Even if Nik has strep, the results won\u2019t change the method of treatment at this point. \n Poor Niksdad. Such a trooper he is. He dashed home from work, gobbled down some celery and peanut butter and then followed me to the hospital in his car; the last time we made a trip like this I ended up enjoying the fine accommodations of the hospital with Nik while Niksdad had to drive back and forth to school and work. After just a few short hours of sleep last night (this morning, really), Niksdad was off to school. He\u2019s pushing himself  so hard  and I know it is tough for him. I hope he knows how much I appreciate all that he does for our family. \n I can tell  the decision to take Nik out of school  is paying off. Last night in the ER, Nik did  great . In spite of feeling pretty punky, he was very present and interacted appropriately with the hospital staff. That includes  kicking  the first nurse who tried to put the hospital band on his wrist. (Hey, I said  appropriately , I didn\u2019t say  nicely !) I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sensory or just really  awful memories  but those bands can push him over the edge hard and fast. He was very cooperative with the doctor though \u2013meaning he didn\u2019t yank the stethoscope out of the poor guy\u2019s ears, didn\u2019t grab his glasses, and didn\u2019t try to bite him when he went to look in Nik\u2019s throat. Progress.  Major progress . In fact, in more lucid moments between bouts of chills from the fever, Nik wanted me to sing to him and clap hands with him. \n Today, Nik\u2019s fever is way down and he\u2019s in good spirits. He\u2019s been a bit off kilter at moments but I suppose that\u2019s a pretty normal stress response. He\u2019s been through the wringer these past twenty-four hours. Even so, I think that by this afternoon I will be looking for inventive new ways to entertain him indoors. \n Kids \u2013how can they be so incredibly resilient? The way Nik bounces back from every single thing that\u2019s been thrown at him really leaves me in awe of my amazing child. I have so much to learn from him. \n   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/sunday-school.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RyX3NWkS0mI/AAAAAAAAARI/YPe9B8H2feo/s1600-h/20071028_sick+Nik.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/04/ramblings-of-neophyte-orig-posted-422.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/04/storms-orig-posted-42707-on-voxcom.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/ear-ye-ear-ye.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/sunday-school.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/sunday-school.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/closer-to-home.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RyX5u2kS0oI/AAAAAAAAARU/qoaWxp3c5o8/s1600-h/20071029_Nik+in+a+bucket.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/10/29/pardon-me-son-your-resilience-is-showing/", "title": "Pardon me, son, your resilience is\u00a0showing"},

This mysterious rash seems to come and go as the fever escalates. I\u2019ve heard that this happens but we\u2019ve never experienced it with Nik before. It\u2019s a tad disconcerting to watch the red splotches creep up his leg in front of my eyes, only to disappear just as quickly as soon as I pick up the phone to call the doctor. (Do you think the rash can  hear  me dialing?  Could it possibly recognize the number?? ) Poor little guy (um, that would be Nik,  not  the rash). Obviously he hasn\u2019t learned the trick for staying awake after conducting his maternal torture sessions. I brought him downstairs, changed his diaper and gave him Tylenol (Advil plus empty stomach equals tummy ache). He was singing happily on the sofa. In the time it took me to walk ten feet into the kitchen and start to prepare the pump for his breakfast, he fell silent. When I turned to check on him? Out cold. Four and a half hours. We are going to the pediatrician again this afternoon \u2014with photos of the rash. Let\u2019s see, I think this makes six trips in seven weeks, not counting the two round trips to the hospital this weekend. But really, who\u2019s counting??

Nik takes after his Mom, not his Dad; Tylenol does diddly for his fever. Advil, however, rocks. After an hour and change on Tylenol, his fever was only down to 102.8. An hour later, back up to 103.1 and climbing. After an hour on Advil? 100.7 \u201cRapid\u201d strep tests can still be run  even if they are dropped on the floor .

Well, not really the worst, but  something . Something that compels a parent to go overboard with costumes, presents, extravagant parties for a child who, really, doesn\u2019t yet understand the significance of the day or event? Who not only doesn\u2019t understand, but cannot yet even participate in the manner his parent hopes for? I find myself wondering whether I am trying to recapture some lost moments of my youth. Or perhaps to re-create the moments as I would have liked them to be? Surely my son doesn\u2019t yet understand what birthdays and Christmas and Halloween are all about. Yet with the approach of each one I am filled with deep  longing  for him to leap into the fray with the same enthusiasm I have.  Is it my need to celebrate every last little moment and milestone? Perhaps. Or, perhaps, is it my need to feel like a  \u201cnormal\u201d  family every once in a while? I am reminded lately of how  not -normal our family is as we have logged a  few hundred miles  on the car this week racing from doctor to doctor and to the hospital on Sunday. Of the hours of sleep we have lost in the middle of the night with our son who cannot tell us what is wrong, where it hurts or what he needs. Of the frequent need for blood tests, x-rays, numerous daily medications, and other medical interventions. Our child who cannot tell us what he needs on a daily basis. This is  our  \u201cnormal\u201d now. Most days I accept this new paradigm with grace and humor. Then there are the days, like today, when I struggle to find the grace and strength. Yet, given a choice, I wouldn\u2019t trade our life. Because it is not normal to celebrate each moment of triumph which passes for ordinary in other families. The growth and changes normal families don\u2019t notice until they have become second nature. Things they take for granted, we recognize as herculean tasks accomplished with great effort. Nothing ordinary about them. So, while we  won\u2019t  be dragging our little caped wonder from house to house tonight because of the mystery ailment* which has put him out of commission, we  will  be enjoying the treat of being Nik\u2019s parents and all that encompasses.

I\u2019ve been ill the past week or more with some gunk that has decided to move in for a longer stay; I\u2019ll be calling my doctor Monday to ask about a sinus infection and bronchitis. Frankly, I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s taken  this  long for it to hit me given the stress of recent months. But lately, I\u2019ve been feeling odd too and I can\u2019t say it\u2019s  all  (the cold) in my head. I try to write about things \u2014fairly significant things about Nik and his health, progress, or development \u2014and I can only get part way through. I seem to get so easily distracted that I lose my train of thought and either fall out of the groove I was in or I take off in a completely different direction. My writing lately has felt more like \u201cstream of  un consciousness\u201d than anything else. Sure, it could be the gallons of cold medicine I\u2019ve been imbibing (liquid daytime and nighttime meds in case you were thinking something more exciting!). But tonight, on my way home from the grocery store, I discovered the real culprit lurking in my neighborhood.\n   Seriously, it\u2019s been a strange time in my head lately. So many things going on with Nik, my being ill, Thanksgiving and the approaching Christmas holidays, and Nik\u2019s fourth birthday. I feel like I haven\u2019t had a chance to catch my breath and when I do, I can\u2019t seem to articulate the thoughts I want to share.\n So bear with me as I disentangle my threads of thought and try to regain my sense of order and control (well, in some  small  measure anyway). \n Here\u2019s the first of a few installments\u2014 \n \n Nik\u2019s speech therapy: \n I\u2019ve alluded to this in previous posts. We\u2019re at a crossroads with Nik\u2019s therapy; he\u2019s not making any discernible progress as far as I can see. There are  no new sounds or gestures  to communicate specific intent or thoughts. And yet, he  does  communicate pretty clearly. Niksdad and I are the only ones who know how to interpret it though and that\u2019s not a great thing for the longer term. Nik\u2019s current therapist, Miss K, is the same one that worked with him (and I use the term loosely) last year at school. She left in September to go into private practice. At the time we started seeing her, I didn\u2019t realize that Nik\u2019s former therapist through Easter Seals, Miss M, could still see him. Since we had already made the arrangements with Miss K, we started to see Miss M for feeding therapy; she has a sub specialty in that and we knew Miss K wasn\u2019t equipped to help Nik with the intense oral motor therapy he needs for eating skills. I also thought the exposure to different people would be good for Nik.\n Well, here we are a couple months down the road and Nik is making  tremendous  strides with feeding but  not  with communication that others may be able to understand. I think Miss K doesn\u2019t have the experience to handle a kid with the complexities of Nik\u2019s background; she\u2019s only one year out of her clinical fellowship. Miss M, on the other hand, has been in practice more than ten years and has seen all sorts of kids through early intervention. After an entire school year of working with Nik, mostly in group settings, Miss K still doesn\u2019t quite  \u201cget\u201d  him; she doesn\u2019t see or understand the autism and she just doesn\u2019t connect with him. Miss M has the advantage of having worked with Nik in our home for more than a year. Nik adores her and will do nearly anything for her \u2014 ok, except eat outright and talk.  But the relationship they have is beautiful;  Miss M gets him  on so many levels. She doesn\u2019t necessarily see or understand the autism piece but she engages Nik in a way that few others can. They laugh and clap. they take turns, they make pretty good eye contact. Miss M has made such a lasting impression on Nik that he initiates playing a game with her that he remembers from  more than a year ago . \n So why isn\u2019t Miss M seeing Nik for his speech therapy you ask? Good question. She doesn\u2019t have any more time slots available \u2014though she says she could do both feeding and speech combined in the two sessions a week we already have. I don\u2019t have a sense of how in tune she is with augmentative and assistive technologies. I guess I need to ask her. My fear is taking away that extra session a week that we have been using to see Miss K and not making sufficient progress with augmentative devices or strategies to help to communicate with others in a meaningful way. As I write that, I realize how silly it sounds. It boils down to whether I want to spend an extra hour each week (including travel time) to see a therapist who totally  doesn\u2019t get my kid  and who doesn\u2019t make me feel heard and respected \u2014not that she has made me feel overtly  DIS respected\u2014and not have any discernible progress to show for Nik\u2019s and my time. Or spend less time but with someone who not only totally gets my son and loves him  as much as her own child  but who also makes me feel like  I  am the expert on Nik and who is genuinely interested in what insights and observations I may have to share.\n The alternative to either scenario is that I spend roughly  three hours each week  (an hour and change travel time each way, door to door) to see yet another therapist who may or may not \u201cget\u201d Nik or engage him the way Miss M does. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a chance I am willing to take. I guess when I see it in writing it\u2019s kind of a no-brainer. That\u2019s one of the many things I love about blogging; it allows me to stop and try to put my thoughts in order and \u2014voila!

My upbringing was such that I was admonished never to make a nuisance of myself. It certainly was not acceptable to burden others with my needs and any request I might make was sure to be an imposition. Accepting help from others is not easy for me; I have always been the listener, the advisor, the fixer of broken things and solver of problems. I even managed to make a profession out of it.\n \n I once managed to find the laptop an old boss thought had been stolen off a plane in Chicago en route to Switzerland. He needed  everything  on it replicated for a meeting he was scheduled to have 36 hours later. I got him the new computer in the nick of time \u2014data and all (thank God for corporate system-wide backups!). I also managed to have his old laptop in my possession the same day. Oops, he had (I suspect had too much to drink and) \u201cforgotten\u201d it when he changed planes in Chicago. A very savvy flight attendant picked it up and secured it in his locker until his next shift so he could turn it in. I sent him a lovely thank you gift from my boss.\n I tell that story not to boast \u2014though it  was  one of my more challenging feats (for the same boss whose family I relocated from Norway and whom I took for a driver\u2019s license test after he broke his shoulder skiing in Canada. It was  great  preparation for motherhood, I must say). It simply illustrates the degree to which I have had to be self sufficient. I have had to work hard to earn the respect of coworkers who thought I was too young or inexperienced to handle the level of responsibility I was given.  I don\u2019t let myself fall very often so when I do I usually do it  quite  spectacularly. The world comes crashing down around me and everything grinds to an abrupt halt. Well, it used to in my time BN \u2014 before Nik . Now I realize that I need to simply reach a hand up through the quicksand and, even if I can\u2019t see the face it goes with, hold on and accept the hand up. It\u2019s still difficult for me not to feel like I am imposing on others\u2019 good will but I am practicing.

Music is such a  vital  part of who I am and yet, in our current situation, I haven\u2019t been singing or playing music or even listening to much except when I am working out at the gym; even that one has been sporadic lately! I think that contributes a lot more to my state of mind than I realized. I\u2019ve been feeling really down this past week over the prospect of not decorating for Christmas (too many dangers for Nik) and really scaling back due to finances. After finding the CD\u2019s last night, I popped one into the car stereo on the way home and instantly felt more grounded and soothed. Today, I am listening as I putter around the house on this rainy, gloomy November day. Every little bit helps, right? We had feeding therapy this morning; it was another wonderful session with Miss M. She is so proud of the progress Nik is making and was pleased to hear how well he did at Thanksgiving dinner; I haven\u2019t blogged about that but he did  great  taking tastes of everything on the table (except the peas) and even tolerated a few very small soft chunks on his tongue without panicking. He\u2019s showing a bit more conscious control over his tongue as well.  Major progress . I talked to Miss M about the augmentative communication (AC) and some of my concerns about whether she had enough exposure since she\u2019s been working with \u201cthe little guys\u201d for so long. She told me that there is a very big push now to start using AC much sooner so she is getting up to speed. In addition, Easter Seals has opened a new assistive technology department right in her building and we will have access to their services while we work together. We even agreed that we would extend the two sessions by fifteen minutes on the front end (we are the first appointment of the day) so we can get some extra time in. I felt good as we left. The same kind of good feeling I had when we made the decision to remove Nik from school. A  right  feeling down to my bones. Nik\u2019s birthday is Sunday; I cannot believe that he will be four years old. It seems like only yesterday he was a frail, tiny bundle with wires and tubes attached to him. I can still smell, in my memory, the scent of freshly laundered hospital blankets and the slightly sweet plastic of his oxygen tubing. For so long I couldn\u2019t even  imagine  what my child would look like without those things. Yet here I am today, mired in the memories and fearful of letting them go. Not because I don\u2019t want to move on and forge ahead into whatever the future may hold. I don\u2019t want to forget where we came from. I know that time will soften the jagged, raw edges but I am wary of letting the scar fade completely. I want to remember the fight in my son\u2019s spirit \u2013filling his tiny body \u2013willing himself to defeat such seemingly insurmountable odds. I think if I can only hold on to that, I can remember more readily that same fighting spirit in those moments when the fight isn\u2019t literally life and death. That my warrior-angel child has fought tougher battles and prevailed and will continue to do so \u2013over and over, as long as he draws breath and as long as he is loved and nurtured. Yes, that I can do for my child. That has been \u2013continues to be\u2013 my special gift to him every birthday. Every day. Hard to believe that  four  years ago Nik was fighting for his life every moment of the day. Three  years ago, he was just learning to sit up independently. Two  years ago Nik was unable to stand independently. Today, I watch my child in awe and wonder as he rambles and roams about our family room \u2013chattering and humming all the while. Listening to his laughter as he carries the pillows from the sofa \u2013one clenched between his teeth, the other in his little fingers \u2013to deposit them on the other side of the gate to the back hall. It is a game of which he doesn\u2019t tire easily. I watch in amazement as he moves his large castle climber about the room, gauging exactly where to position it so he can climb up and reach something on top of the television. I scold him with a laugh; he relents with a smirk and scampers on to his large green toy bucket (a 20 gallon bucket that I stow his toys in at night) to climb inside and then tip himself over. From there it is back to the castle. He slides head-first backward down the small sliding board. He giggles when he hits the bottom and does it over again. From such humble and frightening beginnings to the laughing, confident, perpetual motion machine I see today. Perspective \u2013that is  his  gift to me. ************************************************************************************** Miracle (Written by Linda Thompson/Stephen Dorff, Recorded by Celine Dion) You\u2019re my life\u2019s one miracle Everything I\u2019ve done that\u2019s good And you break my heart with tenderness And I confess it\u2019s true I never knew a love like this \u2019til you You\u2019re the reason I was born Now I finally know for sure And I\u2019m overwhelmed with happiness So blessed to hold you close The one that I love most Though the future has so much for you in store Who could ever love you more?

{"date": "November 25, 2007 ", "body": "\n Look out! Look out! They\u2019re walking around the bed On their head Clippety cloppety Arrayed in braid Pink elephants on parade \n \u201cPink Elephants On Parade,\u201d from Dumbo \n \n It feels like there\u2019s a huge pink elephant sitting in the middle of my cyber living room and I cannot get past it to write anything else until I deal with it. Of course, no one else can see this elephant because it is really in my mind. But since blogging seems to help me work out some of these things, well, you lucky readers will get to join me in my sorting it out. Grab your hankies, this feels like an emotional journey of epic proportions today.\n Since Nik was born, this has always been a very difficult time of year for me. I know that it should be filled with joy and hope, faith and miracles, and all that sort of stuff. But for me, try as I might to let it go, it still carries the essence of anxiety. The glimmers of impending catastrophe that gnaw through my veneer of calm, cool collectedness. \n We knew just before Thanksgiving that there was something \u201cnot quite right\u201d with my pregnancy. I spent the two nights before Thanksgiving at the hospital getting steroid shots and being monitored for hours before they would let me go home. My sister\u2019s in-laws \u2014who always welcomed me with open arms to every family gathering since my own family was 3000 miles away \u2014pampered me and waited on me hand and foot that year. Nik was born via emergency C section the following Tuesday afternoon following a scary non-stress test (you gotta love the oxymoron name of that one, huh?!). My husband was somewhere under the San Francisco Bay \u2014on his way to a conference in the same town where I sat alone and terrified in a hospital labor and delivery ward waiting to find out whether our child would make it long enough to be delivered. \n Nik was in rough shape with no amniotic fluid to cushion him, the umbilical cord was wrapped a couple of times around his tiny fragile neck, and he was in a breech presentation. Try as they might, the OB and perinatologist couldn\u2019t get Nik to respond to any stimuli. His body was shutting down and his heartbeat was irregular. Time was slipping away and attempting to take my child with it. Niksdad made it with some few minutes to spare. Nik followed soon after. \n I don\u2019t\u2019 remember much of the delivery, except the feeling of my insides being stuffed back in before they stitched me up. Niksdad had left my side to be with Nik. He was the only one of us who saw our son\u2019s face unencumbered by breathing apparatus for weeks. Niksdad\u2019s strongest memory of the moments after the delivery is of touching Nik\u2019s hand and feeling Nik\u2019s miniature grip around the tip of his index finger. \u201cI\u2019m here, Daddy. Don\u2019t go away.\u201d \n Yet here we are four years later with our strapping boy. He has so many challenges and he fights like a hero every single day. I know I should be reveling in that spirit. And most days I do but, for some reason, these days approaching Nik\u2019s birthday are always a roller coaster of emotions for me \u2014and for Niksdad though he doesn\u2019t show it quite as obviously as I do. There never seems to be an end in sight, a soft place to land to catch our collective breath. \n I am sure some of this feels more intense this year because of the episodic pain that Nik has been having and our anxiety about finding a cause \u2014and putting an end to Nik\u2019s pain. Then, too, there is the fear and uncertainty of what lies ahead for Nik in terms of his overall development. We refuse to accept that Nik will not progress beyond where he is now in terms of his ability to communicate his wants and needs. With each passing day I see Nik become so much more engaged in his environment, so much more interested in socializing with familiar people like his grandparents and his therapists. Yet we also see so many times where Nik is simply not present at all; he has retreated into a place where we cannot reach him. There seems to be no middle ground, no place where we can see a continuum of progress unfolding. \n We feel lost as to what to do for Nik. We pulled him out of school because we knew it was too overwhelming for him. Yet he needs something more than I am able to give him by myself. There is such a dearth of resources in our state unless your child is in the school system. It feels so damnably unfair that I have to put my child in a situation that I know is not good for him in order to gain access to certain services. And it breaks my heart that our financial situation is what it is right now and that we are not in a position to be able to pour dollars into additional therapy for Nik; he responds so well when he gets it. \n Maybe that is the emotional parallel that I am feeling right now \u2014the uncertainty, the fear of whether my child will be alright, and the worry that I am not up to the task. It definitely feels the same as it did four years ago; that\u2019s a feeling I haven\u2019t had for a very, very long time. I know that I cannot see into the future and I\u2019m not certain I really would want to know anyway. But I seem to have lost my sense of being grounded recently and I don\u2019t know what to do to get it back. \n I need guidance, practical guidance, to find resources I can use to help my child. Things that I can do right here, right now \u2014at home \u2014that aren\u2019t going to cost me an arm and a leg. Things that will give Nik some good sensory input and help him regulate himself enough to stay present more than spurts and moments in a day so he can learn the things he needs to learn. To communicate when he\u2019s had enough and needs a break, when he\u2019s hungry, when he\u2019s bored and wants my company \u2014and so much more.

{"date": "November 30, 2007 ", "body": "One foot in front of the other One foot back to counter it Days like these you\u2019ve got to find it in some other way It\u2019s all or nothing baby Avalanche, start inside of me Avalanche, down through the trees Avalanche, start inside of me Avalanche, hell down through the trees \u201cAvalanche\u201d by Matthew Good I read an email from Susan at  The Family Room  \u2014 who didn\u2019t tell us she was celebrating a birthday this week  \u2014earlier this evening and was all set to reply when Nik started howling like he hasn\u2019t done in a couple of weeks.  Had he not been in his chair with the pump running it  definitely  would have been one of those drop to the floor, head slamming episodes.  It lasted roughly  40 minutes .  Off and on , waves of pain and tears and head hitting coming one on top fo the other.  Spent from the effort, Nik has been passed out cold in his crib for nearly two hours now. Poor Nik was scrunching up his eyes and flicking his right ear and screaming, punching his face and crying and he  STILL  kept trying to hold my hands to do \u201cIf you\u2019re happy and you know it!\u201d  It broke my heart.  I guess he wanted to do the song/clapping because it\u2019s his favorite thing to do and  it makes him feel good .  The juxtaposition of the clapping and the teary, scrunched up face\u2026it was all I could do not to cry in front of him. I  thought  I was hanging in just fine lately until this happened.  We\u2019ve managed to string a few good days together in a row \u2014the nights, not so successful yet.  You know, seeing how much it takes out of him and then how far back it sets him when it goes on and on\u2026this is what makes me worry about the future.   How can he make the continual progress if he keeps getting dragged down by the cycle of pain and recovery?   It\u2019s like we take a giant leap forward and then go toppling off the mountain peak.  The falling is the hardest; the initial ascent is rough too \u2014until we find our rhythm again and can catch our breath for  just a little bit .  It feels like we keep gaining momentum and then we hit a patch of ice and go tumbling down again. Not the behavior or the skills that Nik is learning and mastering.  It\u2019s his  health  that takes the hit and then he seems to have a fairly significant regression or stagnation.  It comes and goes in cycles and seems to take so much out of him.  When we\u2019re on an upswing it\u2019s fast-moving and exciting.  When the squalls hit, it\u2019s as if an avalanche tumbles us, leaving us buried us for a while.  We dig our way to the top and begin  all over again .  When we are in the trough of that cycle I\u2019m not sure I can see the forest for the trees. There\u2019s been no real movement on the medical front in so far as finding any answers or any greater comfort for Nik; our appointment with  Dr. House\u2019s team  isn\u2019t for another three weeks.  Meanwhile, we\u2019ve got some other things coming up on the horizon.  There\u2019s a multidisciplinary evaluation next week which I am really looking forward to.  It\u2019s done by a team of therapists who work with the Developmental Pediatrician whom we see twice a year.  They are wonderful people and they really like Nik a lot.  More importantly, they haven\u2019t seen him since before we pulled him out of school; I am eager to see what kind of progress they think he has made.  Equally important will be the recommendations they make for Nik\u2019s therapies.  I will not be surprised if they recommend an increase in all areas and hope they can help me make the case with Medicaid to increase services.  Over the summer, Medicaid had authorized two sessions of each discipline per week instead of the one they cut back to in October (after we pulled Nik from school).  Not that I  want  to increase the number of appointments we have,  really , but they did make a huge difference. After the team evaluation there\u2019s Nik\u2019s  four year old check up (!!!)  followed by another sedated hearing test (ABR).  We had to reschedule the appointment with new neurologist until the end of the month so we had enough time to gather all the necessary records to send in advance.  We will also get to see the cardiologist and the pulmonologist this month, too.  That\u2019s in between seeing the orthotist to adjust Nik\u2019s ankle-foot orthotics and seeing the Rehab Engineer to adjust the seat and foot plates on Nik\u2019s chair\u2026and to possibly order a  special bed  for Nik.  Oh, and I think there\u2019s Christmas in there somewhere, too! Whew, putting all that in writing makes me grateful that I  have  started to ask for help. In another health update \u2014 mine \u2014 I am finally getting the coughing crud mostly under control.  It turns out I contracted a staph infection \u2014 NOT MRSA  \u2014 on the heels of a plain old upper respiratory infection and it turned into  tracheitis .  Not highly common in adults \u2014we usually get bronchitis then pneumonia \u2014 it is basically  croup .  Well, you know, I like to think of myself as a kid at heart!  Before I went to the doctor this week and got some antibiotics and cough syrup with codeine (that\u2019s  my  excuse for my rambling writings this week!), it felt like a mule team had been tap dancing on the base of my throat and I was coughing so much, especially at night that I was hoarse and experiencing some embarrassing hygiene situations if I coughed too hard (don\u2019t make me spell it out, people!).  It\u2019s still not so great at night but that may simply be aggravated by Nik\u2019s renewed nocturnal waking this week.  Still, I feel  much  better and managed to actually go work out this morning.  I had to reintroduce myself to my trainer it\u2019s been so long! So, like I said in  my previous post  \u2014 you know the  antithesis  to this one? \u2014it\u2019s been a  very full week. TGIF!

Full scale rebellion! In a desperate, sleep-fogged moment the night before last I had to change Nik and only had an overnight diaper. A reasonable choice since it  was  2:00 a.m. and that\u2019s what I had in his room, but Nik had other ideas. As I was drifting back to sleep sometime around 4:00 a.m., I  thought  I heard the sound of a zipper \u2014twice in fact. I recall thinking, \u201cOh, he can\u2019t get the safety tent open from the inside so it\u2019s ok\u201d as I drifted off to sleep in my codeine-induced stupor. Imagine the  rude  awakening Nik and I both got two and a half hours later \u2014when Nik wet his bed. The zipper I thought I heard? The first was his sleeper; the second was the sound of the Velcro tabs on the diaper he had  removed  before falling back to sleep. ************************************************************************************* Then, as you\u2019ve already seen in the  video , came Nik\u2019s newly declared autonomy at the dinner table.

Despite his lack of  actual  oral motor skills \u2014rapidly increasing with the help of our beloved Miss M, Nik now must have something of his very own to hold and dip. He mimics Miss M\u2019s technique to a tee \u2014dip, dip, dip, followed by tapping the spoon (or pretzel rod in Nik\u2019s case) to remove the excess so it doesn\u2019t make a huge mess. This is followed by voracious licking and slurping by Nik. Sometimes he gets a little over zealous in the dipping and tapping and we have to reel him back in. The boy is in heaven;  so are we . And related to the above-described dining ritual is something that just started yesterday. The background here is that Nik has a special seating system that we use; we can wheel it about in the house to put him either at the table with us or in the family room where he plays with toys while he dines. We also have a booster seat on one of the dining room chairs; Nik used to sit in it when we were doing actual oral feeding many,  many  months ago. The booster is  not  a good seat to use when we have to use the feeding pump; Nik\u2019s pumped meals take roughly more than an hour and he can\u2019t sit in the booster that long and  definitely  not unattended for even the amount of time it takes for me to get up from the table, walk five feet to the kitchen and return. Yesterday, at lunchtime, Nik grabbed my hand and marched me to the safety gate to open it. We walked over to his special chair to push it into the family room; Nik is a very big help in pushing it and climbing in all by himself. He can even fasten the pronged buckles on the ankle straps \u2014needed to keep Houdini Junior from climbing out of the chair while the pump is running. The kid is  not good  at sitting still for long periods of time! Well, instead of helping me push the chair, Nik grabbed my hand and  dragged  me over to the chair with the booster in it. It wasn\u2019t until he did it again today that it dawned on me. He was telling me, \u201cMommy, I don\u2019t want to sit in my special chair and play with toys while you write (or take a shower or some other thing best done while Nik is unable to get into too much trouble). I want to sit at the table with you and share lunch!\u201d I guess I\u2019ll be planning more sit-down meals for myself from here on out! ************************************************************************************* Then there\u2019s the  vocalization extravaganza . I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just wishful thinking on my part; all of a sudden it seems that Nik is really using so many more sounds and intonations for  very purposeful communication . I can\u2019t always make out what he\u2019s trying to convey but there are times when I can\u2019t help but laugh. The kid has an amazing ear for tones. My cell phone chimes like a door bell when I get a text message. The other day, I got a message from Niksdad while Nik was sitting having his lunch. As I went to retrieve my phone, I hear a sing-songy little  \u201cHm-Hmmm\u201d  from Nik. Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. Miss M and I have been playing a funny little game with Nik. She\u2019ll say \u201cYah-hoooo!\u201d and put his hands in the air. He laughs and claps but doesn\u2019t do it unassisted. He\u2019s getting to the point now that he will raise his hands by himself when I do it with him. Well, last night as I was making dinner, I hear a funny little two-toned squeal from Nik and looked over in time to see his hands going up in the air. Yup, he figured it out and thought it was pretty darned funny. ************************************************************************************* Niksdad used to take Nik to the park in the warmer weather; it was their special \u201cguys only\u201d time and a little bit of a breather for me. Since the weather has turned, we are seeing the effects of Nik not getting enough exercise; he is  extremely  hyper and wound up a lot. Niksdad, being ever the problem solver, came up with a great solution. He takes Nik to Home Depot and they wander around the store; sometimes they actually need to buy something and Daddy lets Nik push the cart. Niksdad works at Home Depot on the weekends; I often bring Nik by for a short visit on the nights we know Daddy won\u2019t be home before Nik goes to bed. Consequently, Nik is fairly well known by the store staff. Niksdad told me this week that Nik has taken to approaching Daddy\u2019s co-workers and letting them pick him up, or grabbing their hands to clap them together. I\u2019m not sure why, but that is probably Nik\u2019s  favorite  thing to do when he first greets someone; he grabs their hands to sing and clap. I worry that it annoys people but Niksdad tells me how much all the grandmotherly types at work adore it \u2014and Nik. Who knew my little social butterfly would emerge amidst the power tools and electrical supplies? ************************************************************************************* Nik\u2019s birthday is Sunday; we\u2019re not really having any sort of party. Niksdad has taken the day off and we\u2019ve gotten tickets to ride the  Santa Clause Express  \u2014an authentic steam engine which runs along parts of the Delaware River Valley. Santa will be on board and we\u2019ll have lots of opportunities for pictures. Mostly though, it\u2019s a chance for us to get out as a family. We don\u2019t know if Nik will like the train; he likes the sounds of trains but hasn\u2019t shown much interest in the actual cars themselves. I\u2019ll write more about it after the fact. ************************************************************************************* Let\u2019s see, Nik\u2019s perfected his acrobatic routine. Truly. This week he decided was a good time for all of the following:\n \n \u2014Sliding  backward and head-first  down the slide at therapy The  BIG  slide. \n \n \u2014Learning to do a  flip  into his twenty gallon toy bucket. Again,  backward  and head first. I\u2019ll try to post video of that sometime soon. It\u2019s very funny to watch and Miss M thinks we should submit it to America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos. Who knows? We  could  use the money! \n \n \u2014Nik finally decided the feel of the safety net on his crib isn\u2019t  actually icky enough  to keep him from climbing out when Mommy\u2019s back is turned for a split second!  \n ************************************************************************************* \n Oh yes, then there\u2019s the fact that I  actually asked  for \u2014 and am  accepting  \u2014some help from some  remarkable  people. I won\u2019t embarrass them by naming them but you all know them and they are gifts to me right now. I must have put the message out pretty strongly; it seems the universe is listening and responding.\n Nik participates in a developmental playgroup every Tuesday morning; he\u2019s actually the only child with any disabilities. The rest of the kids are all under the age of two. We\u2019ve been going for a couple of months now and it\u2019s always the same kids. The moms seem to know each other from somewhere else \u2014work, other social connections, who knows? I have felt awkward around these women; they are younger, they work, they don\u2019t have the same context or view point of parenting that I do. I have tried to join in conversations but felt slightly shut out. I don\u2019t know if it has been their uncertainty about how to approach me \u2014though I think I am  fairly  approachable most days \u2014or if they\u2019ve been sizing me up and finding me lacking. The optimist in me hopes it\u2019s the former; they\u2019ve gotten a taste lately of Nik\u2019s health challenges, including seeing some of his painful episodes first hand. \n Maybe they finally figured out that  I\u2019m doing this mommy gig pretty much alone . No baby sitting co-ops, play dates in the park, nights out with my friends, etc. Or maybe  I  have finally opened myself up to the possibility that  I don\u2019t have to do it alone   and am asking for help. In any case, one of the moms approached me Tuesday to ask me if I\u2019d like to join their chapter of the moms\u2019 club. She emphasized the mom\u2019s nights out once a month and the weekly play dates and just made it sound so  warm and inviting . \n I think I may take a page out of  Kyra\u2019s  book and say  \u201cYes! Yes! Yes!\u201d  and give it a try. I\u2019ve never been much of a joiner but I\u2019ve always  longed to belong . And I can\u2019t keep Nik and me separate from the rest of the neurotypical world forever, right? This may be just the right way for me to start to get comfortable in this collective skin that Nik and I share. I may just like it and find some face-to-face friends; maybe find \u201cmy people.\u201d  \n   \n *************************************************************************************\n And \u2014  as if that weren\u2019t a full enough week  \u2014I must have blinked somewhere. Overnight, it seems,  Nik has lost all vestiges of baby appearance . Sure it\u2019s his new \u201cbig boy\u201d haircut with the spiked bangs, but there\u2019s this  intangible  thing about him. He\u2019s changed in ways I cannot quite identify except in glimmers and moments. The  knowing  look in his eyes when I tell him \u201cNo!\u201d and he actually stops what he\u2019s doing \u2014but laughs as he toddles off to find new mischief. The  unfettered joy  in his laughter at some secret thought or joke which only he understands, or in a moment shared with Mommy and Daddy. The  utter confidence  which exudes from him when he does his slides, his flips, his dragging me to the booster seat. \n There is a  presence  about Nik that hasn\u2019t been as evident until now. He is hearing and responding more to simple instructions and he is more frequently, more easily calmed or distracted from his tantrums and upsets. Oh, he still has his perseverations and his transitional meltdowns. But Nik seems to be really making his presence felt in his environment and is more engaged. It isn\u2019t always consistent and I  can  miss it on some days. But when it\u2019s there? It is dazzling and brilliant like a flawless, multi-faceted diamond glinting in the sunshine. \n Because of? In spite of?  Whatever the source, my boy is growing so fast. He has \u201cmiles to go\u201d but he is on his way. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/wordless-wednesday.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/feels-like-circus-in-my-brain.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/put-your-hands-up.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/put-your-hands-up.html", "http://www.thismom.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1BlNggV8AI/AAAAAAAAAV0/RBX5Zd5xG8g/s1600-R/DSC01652.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1BlOAgV8BI/AAAAAAAAAV8/Vy3IxqhU9fI/s1600-R/DSC01669.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1BlkggV8CI/AAAAAAAAAWE/mKKhLGiGrmc/s1600-R/DSC01658.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/11/30/friday-expose/", "title": "Friday Expos\u00e9"},
{"date": "August 26, 2007 ", "body": "Well, never let it be said that it is ever dull or quiet at Nik\u2019s house! Let\u2019s see in the span of a week we\u2019ve had  ear surgery , Nik started  walking , we replaced our family room  floor , the start of  school , and  the bump on the noggin  scare. We are definitely riding the roller coaster this week. Tonight, it\u2019s on the upswing, or I suppose it could be down; it all depends on which part of the roller coaster ride is your favorite. Mine is standing on the sidelines watching! \n So, you know we\u2019ve been doing the  \u201cintensive\u201d OT  for a little over a month now, right? We\u2019ve seen some  amazing changes  and rapid progress in Nik\u2019s  physical skill  development, his social interactions, his attention span \u2014you name it, it\u2019s  galloping forward  right now. Except the  eating . Now, in Nik\u2019s defense, I have to come clean and confess that I have not made any efforts to feed him for awhile because of the whole  flooring issue  in the family room which is now  beautifully resolved . Plus, I got tired of feeling like a failure multiple times a day because I have not been able to get my child \u2014who once used to eat quite a bit (albeit pureed foods) \u2014to even accept so much as a spoonful of anything without it becoming a major struggle. I am certain that the behavioral therapist and the  feeding specialist  would both huff and sigh and tell me that \u201cOf course he won\u2019t eat if you aren\u2019t being consistent\u2026blah, blah, blah.\u201d \n However, this is one of those times I absolutely trusted my instincts \u2014 and I think it is paying off! I have thought for a long time that the root of Nik\u2019s yo-yo eating has been sensory; he just cannot regulate himself enough to focus for more than a few minutes at a time \u2014certainly not long enough to make it through a \u201cmeaningful\u201d meal!. I\u2019ve been waiting to see how he responded to the OT before attempting oral feeding again. Now that I no longer have the  family room floor  as my excuse for not feeding Nik, I decided, \u201cTonight the feeding commences whether I am ready or not!\u201d \n After playing with Nik for a while, I did the whole brushing and joint compression routine that Nik has come to crave. Seriously. Whenever he sees the sensory brush, he starts humming \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d (the song I sing to him while I brush him and do compressions) and comes scooting over to sit on the floor between my legs. He snuggles back against me and, every so often, reaches for the brush and starts to rub his palm on it. You\u2019d never know this same child couldn\u2019t stand the touch of this very same brush on his palms just six weeks ago! My hungry little guy climbed into his chair, fully expecting the usual tube feeding and desultory licks of Mom\u2019s apple or something. Boy was he thrilled when I broke out the food! I mean, it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t offer the kid food a lot \u2014we do. But he only ever wants to lick things. Tonight, he gobbled down an ounce of apricots (pureed), let me \u201cbrush\u201d his teeth with a teething biscuit, tried a lick of a strawberry fruit roll up, and devoured a slice of peach in a mesh feeder. My cynical father jokingly remarked, \u201cA whole slice? Boy, another week and he\u2019ll have finished the meal!\u201d Har-har.  \n So, just what is the big deal about tonight\u2019s meal? Well, let me rattle \u2018em off\u2026 First, the fact that Nik ate  at all  without even fighting me for control more than once or twice is huge! He even tried to feed me a couple of bites of apricots. He laughed, he made eye contact, and he opened his mouth and took the whole spoon. Nik normally either takes the smallest bites humanly possible, or he somehow gets the spoon under his tongue \u2014where everything goes. He is an incredible \u201cguarder.\u201d\n Second, is the stunning fact that Nik actually tried a  new flavor ! The strawberry roll up got mixed reviews. But I am proud of him for trying it. I know he likes fresh strawberries so we may just have to work on the whole texture of the roll up thing. So, that\u2019s actually third \u2014a  new texture , too! Then, Nik allowed me to actually  touch his te eth with something resembling food (the teething biscuit) and he didn\u2019t fight or gag or choke. Major,  major ,  major  deal about that! Usually everything goes under the tongue. Watching Nik taking a \u201csip\u201d from a glass or open cup always cracks me up; it reminds me of my cats\u2019 drinking water from a bowl. Lap, lap, lap. \n Finally, the  biggest ,  hugest ,  most colossal  deal of all? Drum roll, please\u2026 \n Nik. Touched. The. Mesh. Feeder.  The same object which only  weeks  ago was a thing to be reviled and swatted away \u2014preferably with Mommy\u2019s hand so Nik didn\u2019t even have to touch the loathsome texture! Not only did my fearless boy touch the thing, he licked it \u2014 a gazillion times!  He slurped and lapped and squeezed and sucked on that feeder like nothing I have ever seen him do in his life! At one point, he actually growled a cute little sound and shoved the whole thing in his mouth and  BIT DOWN!   \n \n The poor peach slice never stood a chance. When Nik was done, all that was left was the merest residue. A hint of pulp. And one sticky, smiling boy. \n Cry?  You bet you\u2019re ass I cried!  I\u2019m crying now as I\u2019m telling you about it. I am  so  proud of my child. I feel like there is a light at the end of this damnably dark, serpentine tunnel called \u201coral feeding.\u201d It may take us a while longer to get there; we may falter and try to turn back. But I think that somehow \u2014I don\u2019t know when \u2014we will make it through to the light. I feel so encouraged. Hopeful. Light. Filled with  grace .

During the appointment, Nik was very focused on the doctor\u2019s stethoscope since he is enamored of all things medical. While Nik played, we discussed his symptoms with the doctor and plotted next steps including ruling out some things. We have not seen this doctor again (yet) since the initial visit. Lately, Nik\u2019s been having an upsurge of similar symptoms including intractable head pains. He\u2019s also started using his device to ask to see this particular doctor. I, stupidly, assumed he was just randomly naming one of his many doctors. Until this morning. I asked Nik, after he had said this doctor\u2019s name a few times, \u201cWhat do you want the doctor to do?\u201d Nik started answering with his self-scripted litany of the processes involved in taking vitals, etc. We see enough doctors that Nik not only knows the routine but has incorporated it into his play routines. It\u2019s only recently that we realized he only engages in this routine when he feels \u201coff\u201d or needs to soothe himself somehow. Nik became entrenched in this line of pretend play and I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. What was he trying to tell me. He asked for the doctor by name yet again. Knowing how he might respond if I asked the question the same way as before, I changed my approach, asking him what he wanted the doctor to FIX. His reply blew me away, \u201cFix head feel hurt.\u201d Always, ALWAYS presume competence and understanding. Even when you can\u2019t put the pieces together, they are there.

{"date": "June 4, 2008 ", "body": "What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight \u2013 it\u2019s the size of the fight in the dog. ~ Dwight D. Eisenhower As we\u2019re weaning Nik off of naps and one of his meds, he definitely gets more tired by the end of the day.  I suspect it\u2019s a combination of increased energy and alertness which leads to greater physical activity\u2014which I didn\u2019t think was even  possible  for this kid \u2014and greater sensory input to try to process; the result is that Nik is exhausted at the end of the day.  Today is no different.

He is so tired he nearly runs into the kitchen cabinet en route. He spies one of the cats lounging on the back of an armchair but is too tired to give chase; he acknowledges the cat with a sing-songy  \u201cmah-mah-mah,\u201d  his way of saying  \u201cmeow,\u201d  as he pinches and pulls his cheeks to make the sign for cat.

He pauses about midway; sitting back on his foot, he nearly tumbles but Niksdad is there to steady him.   \u201cNikolas, do you want Daddy to carry you?\u201d  my husband asks. Nik pauses and turns his body toward us; I expect him to reach for his father.  Instead, he turns brusquely away.  His determination makes me smile.  Nik refuses to ask for help except in the direst of circumstances; this, clearly, does not qualify.  He continues to crawl; his progress is much slower than before.  He pauses to rest his forehead on each step before he climbs \u2014as if he is gathering strength for his arduous task.  You would think he is  Sisyphus , pushing the boulder uphill, he is working so hard and is so determined! Reaching the top step at last, Nik staggers into his bedroom and heads right to his crib.  I am  certain  he will ask for help in getting into bed; he is so tired I cannot fathom that he has the stamina to do it in the usual fashion ** . Apparently, I am mistaken yet again.

{"date": "July 12, 2008 ", "body": "\n I stood in the kitchen, bleary-eyed from short sleep, pouring my first cup of coffee as Nik played animatedly in the family room. Singing and laughing merrily as he emptied his large green toy bucket onto the floor piece by piece, Nik somehow seemed different this morning. My steaming mug in hand, I leaned against the stove and watched as Nik walked over to the gate. Almost unconsciously I noticed how much taller he has gotten recently; he\u2019s grown nearly one and three-quarter inches in the last six months! This from my little peanut who weighed only nineteen ounces and was no bigger than a sheet of notebook paper when he was born!\n Nik\u2019s twinkly blue-grey eyes looked knowingly across the gate; clearly, he knew something I didn\u2019t. As if I were watching a slow motion film, I was rooted to the spot; Nik crouched down, swung his arms forward and catapulted himself into the kitchen in one superhuman standing broad jump worthy of any Olympian. It wasn\u2019t until he darted past me into the living room \u2014and toward the unlocked front door\u2014 that it actually registered. My coffee cup shattered as it hit the floor, splattering hot liquid on my bare feet; feet which were in motion faster than I have ever moved in my entire life. \n As my husband\u2019s alarm clock went off, I sat bolt upright in bed, disoriented. Nik\u2019s early morning happy serenade softly filtered through the monitor on my night table. With a trembling hand and a shaky breath, I reached to turn on the light; the aftermath of my dream dissipated but left me shaken. \n I know that some things simply are not possible \u2014Nik vaulting over the gate for one \u2014but it seems that the paradigm I have held for so long is suddenly tilted on end. After living in a state of high alert \u2014extreme watchfulness and high anxiety over Nik\u2019s fragile health and unknown diagnoses \u2014relaxing my guard does not come easily. Yet the evidence mounts before me on a seemingly constant basis. \n I have to remind myself that \u2014while they are generally very, very good \u2014 my instincts  can  be off-base when I let my emotions cloud my thinking. Sometimes I cannot see the forest for the particular tree under which I stand. \n I have had an odd sense \u2014fueled in part by a seeming consensus among many of the bloggers I read on a regular basis \u2014that things are not exactly \u201con track.\u201d That is to say, things aren\u2019t bad; but things aren\u2019t exactly good, either. Chalk it up to the change of routine inherent in summer days or the effects of the humidity and heat; I\u2019ve just felt like there must be something  more  I should be doing with Nik, for Nik.  I read of  GP\u2019s difficulty with recognizing words  he has already learned and I worry that Nik cannot recall the signs he uses on a regular basis. I read of  Drama Mama\u2019s foray into the land of \u201cWhat If\u201d  and find myself wanting to join her on the journey; I  have  on many a day done just that. Or I read about  Lyle\u2019s recent bouts of dysregulation  and see much of my son reflected back at me.\n But then, I also read about  Joey and Andy\u2019s wonderful lunch at the King\u2019s Arms  and I think of how well Nik did on the Fourth of July; he was a happy, well-regulated little camper in a crowd of strangers at a BBQ to meet my sister\u2019s future in-laws. He was fully present and engaged in the excitement of our town\u2019s local parade; he even made friends with one of our gubernatorial candidates. Had he been able to stay awake long enough, I think Nik would have even enjoyed the fireworks; he loves lights and loud, crashing noises. \n I read about  Isaac making pancakes  or telling his mom, Susan, that he missed her; I see the adoration in my own son\u2019s eyes when we play together \u2014those same eyes which once, in the not so distant past, looked blankly at the world around him and now take in everything. E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. I feel the love in the touch of Nik\u2019s hand as he reaches to pull me close to him so I can sing along with his Signing Time video; he pulls me so close to his warm little body and makes me wrap my arm around his shoulders as he presses my cheek against the top of his head. Sometimes I weep with the fullness of my heart.\n I read about  Charlie\u2019s love of the water   and music  and I see the tremendous progress Nik has made in those areas as well. He can consistently intone a  specific  song to request some quiet time in his crib, a diaper change, or a favorite game we play together. Nik has also rapidly discovered the joys of jumping off the second step of my sister\u2019s swimming pool and being buoyed in the water without holding my hands. In fact, he now splashes and kicks and spins happily away from me without reservation. Where Nik once had extreme anxiety \u2014panic, actually\u2014 about tipping his head back or even letting me hold him so he could float on his back, he now laughs with delight as he tips himself back and kicks his feet on the surface of the water.\n Just over a year ago, I watched through the classroom window as Nik sat in circle time at school\u2014sandwiched between two experienced para\u2019s \u2014 ignored  and left to his own little disconnected world. I thought my heart would shatter in a million shards of piercing grief. \n Today, he initiates games with a sly grin and the hum of a few notes. Nik knows how to use his \u201cnice words\u201d when he asks for something and  is as stubborn as any other child  when he doesn\u2019t feel like using them \u2014but he definitely knows the difference. I watch him figure out how to work smart instead of hard; Nik used to be the hardest working kid I ever saw. Nik now pays attention and cooperates \u2014well, mostly \u2014when I ask him to pick up a toy he has thrown or to  \u201cgive it to Mommy.\u201d \n We spend quality time each day playing, singing, practicing nice words and new skills, and exploring the world around us. Our days, once full of watchful anxiety are now filled with laughter and music, joy, and a new found ease.\n When I step to one side of the tree \u2014when I change my perspective just a little bit \u2014I can see how far we\u2019ve both come in this past year together at home. It\u2019s been a long, bumpy road full of unexpected twists and turns but we  have  found our way. We might be moving a bit slower than I\u2019d like on some days but they are balanced by the days I cannot even catch my breath \u2014let alone my thoughts. \n In rare quiet moments, such as tonight when Nik is asleep and Niksdad is at work, I can savor all the little moments which add up. \n I find I am sated from the rich fullness of my life.

{"date": "June 6, 2008 ", "body": "Lest I give everyone the impression that our week has been full of  anxiety ,  exhaustion , and  illness , let me assure you it\u2019s been a rich, full time around here!\n Nik had a  highly successful  session with both our PT and OT this week. By \u201chighly successful\u201d I mean he didn\u2019t  scream   or cry  ONCE. Not on the way there, not when we pulled into the parking lot, not even when I told him to sit in the chair so I could take off his shoes. Not once did he even  attempt  to throw himself on the floor or bang his head. In fact, Nik was  so happy and so focused  for an entire hour that I wondered aloud, more than once,  \u201cWho is this kid and what has he done with my son?\u201d \n Seriously, that was the day Nik woke at  two in the morning and never went back to sleep.  He was tired and had been bordering on hysteria all morning at home; it was so bad that I had considered canceling the sessions (they were back to back) because I  knew  it would be a nightmare and push him over the edge. Go figure; wrong again! \n We had some  superlative play time together  during the week, some outings to the park with Daddy, and a fairly good week of sleeping through the night, too. There were the usual appointments for Nik, I got my hair cut and colored, Niksdad took a CPR re-certification class and got his eyes examined; we had dinner with my parents, and spent a lot of time outside between thunder storms. \n Besides all that, with Niksdad home during the day lately, I managed to get caught up on several days\u2019 worth of gardening chores. I finished  all  my planting in my front beds; last year I wasn\u2019t finished until \u2014ahem\u2014 July. Niksdad rented a pole saw (a small chainsaw on an extension pole) and cleared all the overgrowth and saplings from the small hill directly behind our house. It really opened up the view to the water and the woods which abut our property. \n After the  great chainsaw massacre  , uh, deforestation project  clearing of undesirable growth too close to the house, I was inspired to actually  plant  the day lilies my mother gave me two years ago from her own lovely garden. Yes, you read that right \u2014 two years ago.  They\u2019ve been sitting in a plastic garbage bag \u2014dirt, roots, and all \u2014for two years without so much as an intentional watering or feeding. They were in gorgeous yellow flower when I put them in the ground this week.  I think they are dying now. \n Next, I was motivated to actually plant the beautiful double impatiens my in-laws sent me for Mother\u2019s Day.  Well!  All of a sudden my scrubby, mossy, pathetic excuse for a backyard \u2014which I have always hated for its relative  un-usability  \u2014started to look pretty nice. I went out and splurged on a pretty new bird feeder  and  a new hummingbird feeder. No more ugly utilitarian feeders for my feathered friends! I even bought a bird bath. Oh, and pavers to put under the grill! \n Giddy with power  On a roll, I decided I wanted to plant some tomatoes and peppers in the one sunny patch in our back yard. They are growing like crazy and I am looking forward to some killer veggies later this summer. \n I feel such a sense of accomplishment and pride now in my yard \u2014both front and back. For many years, I have always thought I had a brown thumb! But now \u2014when I pull into the driveway and see the beautiful colors and variety of plants and flowers\u2014  sigh  \u2014it just feels great. \n I think I\u2019ll just sit back, relax, and enjoy the view for a while.  \n \n   Gardens at Versailles ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/06/florence-er-um-fred-nightingale.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/06/never-say-die.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/06/now-we-wait.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/05/highs-and-lows-keep-coming.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/05/unwritten.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008_05_01_archive.html", "http://www.3dphoto.net/world/europe/befraluxmon/paris/versailles_garden.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/06/06/in-all-not-a-bad-week/", "title": "In all, not a bad\u00a0week"},

{"date": "March 10, 2008 ", "body": "You thought it was a tough situation for your kids in public schools now?   Try being a home schooling parent in the state of California right now.   A recent decision by the 2nd District Court of Appeals ( re Rachel L. ) states that  \u201cParents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children.\u201d   Those are the words of Justice H. Walter Croskey in his Feb. 28 opinion for the court.  The case decision mandates that a parent must now have a valid teaching credential in order to home school their child.  According to Croskey,  noncompliance could result in a criminal complaint against the parents. Swell. The case is detailed quite well  here  at the Home School Legal Defense Association\u2019s ( HSLDA ) web site along with links to the actual  court opinion  and HSLDA\u2019s  response . The family in the case at hand in the 2nd District Court of Appeals chose to home school for religious reasons.  That is but one of so many reasons a family might choose to home school.  Other reasons may include safety or  health concerns for your child, the need for a smaller class setting which school cannot or will not accommodate through a child\u2019s IEP or 504 plan, or children involved in some aspect of sports or entertainment which require a self-paced learning progam \u2014to name a few.  I cite these examples because it is too easy to read the stories in the news and dismiss the impact because \u201cit will only affect the religious home schoolers.\u201d  Not so. Whether you are a home schooling parent or not, this decision could greatly impact your child.  If other states follow suit, the result could be a very large influx of currently home schooled students \u2014with either or both general and special educational needs\u2014 into the already strained (near breaking in many cases) public school system.  Every student could be affected by a significant decrease in available resources in a system where most teachers are already stretched to the maximum in terms of class sizes and financial and material resources available.  Many teachers already use some of their personal funds to provide supplies for students in need as well as to supplement continuing budget cuts.  If you think I am exaggerating, check out nearly any school\u2019s list of supplies expected to be provided by families at the beginning of the school year.  In my district, Kindergarten families are expected to provide tissues, folders, glue, hand sanitizer and the like; supplies which should already be staple items in a school. Those of you who know me, either in person or on-line, know that I am not a terribly politically active creature; I prefer to keep my politics and religion to myself for the most part.  But this issue has the potential to deeply affect me and my family; in my state, home schooling is classified as  non-public  and, as such, is not eligible for any funding, grants, or resources available to public and private schools \u2014 especially for special education support or services .  Like it or not, the decision in the  Rachel L  case could affect your children as well.  I cannot urge you strongly enough to read the articles, understand the court case and its potential impact on the future of education in this country, and then  sign this petition .  You don\u2019t have to be a California resident to make your voice heard on this issue.   Our kids \u2014all of them\u2014 are counting on us.

{"date": "March 4, 2008 ", "body": "Damn  Murphy  anyway.   I should have known better than to post all that wonderful  \u201cspring is coming, la, la, la\u201d   crap  the other day.  I might as well have stood in the middle of Fifth Avenue just  daring  the Manhattan cabbies to hit me as I crossed against the light. Whatever it is that goes on in Nik\u2019s head \u2014and I mean that  entirely  literally \u2014to cause such pain and distress is on the rise again.  It\u2019s been an ugly couple of days around here.  Nik\u2019s been  Jekyll and Hyde,  the master of the mixed message, contrarian  extraordinaire .  He wants me;  he doesn\u2019t want me.   He clings to me;  he pushes me away  but gets upset when I leave his side.  It\u2019s no longer sweet and endearing.  We\u2019ve far surpassed bonding and moved right into the stalker stage. And the pain.  The physical pain that washes over him unexpectedly.  While he\u2019s playing or dining.  While he\u2019s watching  Mary Poppins .  It\u2019s as if someone has stuck him in the eye with a hot poker.  And Nik seems to want to blame it on someone \u2014 anyone  \u2014and I seem to be conveniently at hand.  I can\u2019t say I blame him, really.  I mean, I\u2019d like to be able to blame someone or something for the topsy-turvy days, the disjointed nights, and the bruises and tears.  If I am feeling this way  without  the physical sensations Nik is experiencing, well, I can only imagine how he feels.  Though, last night I did go to bed early with a migraine; I\u2019ve not had those in nearly a year. We\u2019re back to the daily Advil habit to mitigate the worst of the pain \u2014or at least dull it to a tolerable level.  I hate when we have to resort to that, though; it really starts to wear on his stomach.  Today he\u2019s been clutching at his belly periodically.  It makes me wonder if it\u2019s the Advil or if it\u2019s new symptom being added to the  mystery ailment . The irony is that Nik is making such  great  strides in so many areas; I just hate that it comes wrapped in such prickly packaging. If I try to be really objective, I might be able to see that, perhaps, Nik\u2019s sudden clingy, bossy,  come-here-go-away  behavior is an attempt at controlling something that feels out of control to him.  A small measure of comfort when he feels ill at ease, perhaps?  Maybe it is those things and maybe it is not.   I wish he could tell me what hurts, what he feels and hears.  What he needs. Tomorrow morning Niksdad and I get the dubious pleasure of taking Nik to the sleep lab at our neurologist\u2019s office; at 7:30 tomorrow Nik will be hooked up for a 24 to 48 hour ambulatory EEG.  Thank goodness Niksdad does not have school tomorrow and will not only be around to help me in the morning, but will give me an opportunity to get out of the house for a bit by myself.  The last time we did an ambulatory EEG, Nik was not walking; in fact, he had just learned to sit up a month before.  I can\u2019t help but wonder how Nik will respond to all the electrodes on his head and lugging around the backpack-recorder.

Songbird ~ Barbara Streisand I don\u2019t\u2019 know if I can attribute it  directly  to the  wonderful evaluation  Nik had this past week or if it\u2019s simply something in the air \u2014a shift away from the  malaise  of January \u2014but I feel invigorated. Renewed and hopeful once more, I am making plans for things. Yeah, sure, some of them are boring and mundane like doctor\u2019s appointments and reorganizing my garage. But some of those plans are  just for me  \u2014and it\u2019s been a damn long time since I planned anything for myself. When Nik was born, and in the years since, my life has been so much about making sure  his  needs are taken care of \u2014because they have been  so great and complex  \u2014that I\u2019ve let myself languish in the background. It was not a conscious, martyred choice; it just  happened  \u2014almost by default. And it\u2019s been slowly killing me. Perhaps not quite in the way that  Drama Mama  writes about  here  \u2014my disappearance was, maybe, less  conscious  though no less conspicuous. I became so consumed with Nik\u2019s needs that mine just piled up behind the wall I\u2019d built in my heart. But, like the over-full cabinet in my garage which finally collapsed under its own weight today, the walls I\u2019ve built can only hold back so much before they start to crack. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve been for the past month \u2014trying desperately to hold up that wall. It didn\u2019t\u2019 help that over the holidays (really, from Thanksgiving straight on through New Year\u2019s) I let myself succumb to stress eating and not working out \u2014a combination which, for me, is lethal. This week, I got back on track with a new trainer \u2014my old one having quite literally abandoned me for a new job at another club without so much as a goodbye! Since then, I\u2019ve worked out three out of the last four days \u2014I\u2019ve even found a work out buddy and met some new people as a result. I also spent the past couple of days doing some badly needed/long overdue cleaning and organizing \u2014not only of my house but of my psyche \u2014and I feel good.  Clean. In the process of going through some old boxes of photographs and memorabilia, I\u2019ve taken a stroll down memory lane. I\u2019ve confronted some old dreams which never came to pass and I\u2019ve been blessed with the opportunity to look back over the germination of seeds \u2014sewn years ago \u2014which have led me to this place in my life. This place of being the mother I always wanted to be and knew I could be.  This role I\u2019ve been afraid to fully embrace for fear it wasn\u2019t enough.  Or so I thought. I read an article in today\u2019s paper which said, basically, life sucks in the middle \u2014all the joy is in the beginning and the end. I\u2019m not so sure I agree with that assessment. Here I am in my mid forties and I  finally  feel like I know who I am and what my life is about. My life is rich with meaning and a purpose so much greater than I could ever have imagined in my youth.  It is enough. Things feel good, for today, and I am running with it as far as I dare go \u2014and maybe even a step or two beyond if I dare to push myself. Those old dreams that never came to fruition; can they be repurposed to something less grandiose but still fulfilling? Maybe I\u2019ll never sing at LaScala or the Met \u2014and certainly not on Broadway. But when the time is right \u2014and it  will  be again one day, I know \u2014maybe, just maybe I can wow \u2018em at the local community theater. Maybe I can find a local folk or jazz group to sing with. Not for fame and fortune as I once dreamed as a kid, but for the sheer  pleasure  of performing, of using my instrument, and of bringing joy to others. In some small ways, I am doing more of that here at home. Nik seems to have gotten over his distaste for the sound of anything but the Wiggles or Mary Poppins. He now actually  enjoys  when I sing to him; so I\u2019ve been breaking out some old show tunes and simple arias as he sits in my lap playing with a toy. Every once in a while he will turn and smile at me, pleasure radiating from his smile and sparkling in his eyes. My voice breaks a bit but I keep on singing. It\u2019s not Broadway but it feels like my own personal standing ovation. It keeps me going lately. As Nik struggles to find his own voice, to make himself known and heard, he gives me the courage to try to find mine again, too.

{"date": "January 3, 2008 ", "body": "Wow, a new year and  already  I feel like I am playing catch up!\n \n Quite some time ago, Steve of  One\u2019 Dad\u2019s Opinion  tagged me as a recipient of  this wonderful award . Steve\u2019s writing is always very thoughtful and thought-provoking; I was honored by his accolades. I regret that it has taken me so long to share it with others but the holidays \u2014and a few small bouts of illness in our household \u2014distracted me from it. \n The award was originated by Seamus over at the  Shameless Lions Writing Circle . You can find his original post  here . In Seamus\u2019 words, \u201cA Roar For Powerful Words is the chance to scream from the mountains the good news about the powerful posts that are produced every day in the  blogosphere , despite what some mainstream columnists and journalists claim. This is also a good chance to examine exactly what it is that makes writing good and powerful.\u201d \n Indeed. What makes writing \u201cgood and powerful\u201d for me is writing that makes me think, makes me reevaluate a position I may have held on an issue, or makes me see or understand something in a new way. It also makes me feel deeply \u2014the emotion  isn \u2019t necessarily as important as the depth of it, the chord being struck by the writer\u2019s words. Sometimes it is a purely visceral response to another\u2019s description of an idea, an event, an emotion, a memory which has been crafted with such exquisite attention to nuance and detail that you don\u2019t even notice it at first. Still other examples are from writers who make me care about them as individuals; I want to get to know more about them. I want to call them into my circle of friends whom I would invite over for tea, or a Sunday afternoon summer barbecue, or a rollicking good cocktail party. \n There are so many  bloggers  who make me feel and think and yearn for their company and, absent that, the company of their words. Yet, there is a handful with whom I check in on a nearly daily basis to see what new ideas and experiences they have to share. The ones, as I once wrote in an email, I miss when they are gone \u2014as if I keep driving by a friend\u2019s house to see if she is home from summer camp or vacation yet. \n It is my pleasure to share them with you now: \n Jennifer  Graf   Groneberg , who writes at  Pinwheels  (and  ParentDish ), writes in warm and moving ways about her family life, especially parenting her three sons; her take on things always moves me in some way. \n Christy  Everett writes about  Following Elias , her amazing little boy with a fearlessness and can-do attitude to match my own son\u2019s. I discovered her blog through Jennifer\u2019s, in fact; she writes in moving and thoughtful ways and I always like to check in on her adventures living and parenting in Alaska. \n My pal Drama Mama writes  Like a Shark . I now understand why she calls it that; she\u2019s been described as the kind of person who \u201cbites life in the ass.\u201d Her wit and insights often leave me howling with laughter. But she can also move me to tears with the most exquisite recounting of experiences she has with her daughters. Jump in, the water\u2019s fine and she won\u2019t bite you! \n Kristen, who writes  From Here to There and Back , writes with a spare elegance which I envy. She can convey so much with a few nuanced phrases. Yet, she is not one to couch things; she just has a style \u2014and a family \u2014I am drawn to. Go here and when you do, you\u2019ll keep coming back. \n And last, but certainly not least,  Mom-Not Otherwise Specified  writes very powerfully about life with her son, Bud. Her style is also elegant and spare; she chooses her words extremely wisely and well. The pictures she paints are, for me, as rich as any multi-hued medieval tapestry; there are shadows and hints of things but always there is room for reading between the lines or only seeing what is in the spotlight. If you blink you might miss something subtle but telling. \n Go ahead, \u201clisten\u201d to any of these lions roar; you\u2019ll like what you hear, er um, read.

{"date": "February 5, 2008 ", "body": "Vision can be an amazing thing. When I remember that I have a vision for something, and I actually keep it in front of me, things seem to magically fall into place. Well, okay, maybe not exactly magically but with significantly greater ease. It\u2019s true, I swear! When I was in my thirties and still lamenting being single \u2014having met Mr.  Rightbutnotrightnow , Mr.  WhenHellfreezesover , Mr.  OopsdidIneglecttomentionmydivorceisnotfinalized , Mr.  Rightfortonight , etc. \u2014I created a vision of what I wanted in the man in my life. Now, let me be perfectly clear and up front; we\u2019re not talking the wish list of  \u201clooks like [insert celebrity hunk name here]\u201d  or  \u201cmakes XX amount of money.\u201d  More like  \u201cloves children and wants a family,\u201d \u201cEducation and learning are important to him,\u201d  and  \u201cmakes taking care of himself a priority.\u201d  There was more but those were among the top five characteristics I knew  I wasn\u2019t willing to compromise on . I held onto that vision and didn\u2019t compromise; I had a lot of first and second dates that never went any further. And then, one day\u2026BAM! There he was, the man you know as Niksdad; and he was everything that was  most important  to me and more. Somewhere along the line \u2014okay, ever since Nik was born \u2014I stopped making time to create visions for the really important things in my life. Some people might prefer to call it a  roadmap  or a  path  \u2014it all depends on the technology or ideology you may have learned along the way. In any case, the net result is the same. We\u2019re talking about drifting through life \u2014and through some pretty major events in that life \u2014on a river with a swift current, hidden rocks, and sudden rapids. And here I am floating along  without  a life vest and an extra paddle or even a  clue  as to where the shore is. See, the thing about having a vision and keeping it present every day is that \u2014eventually \u2014one of two things will happen. You\u2019ll either decide it\u2019s not  really  what you want and let it go with grace or you\u2019ll  take steps to make it happen.  Like with my vision for Niksdad; I didn\u2019t actively go out and look for him, I merely  changed my behavior  so that my standards were higher and my needs became clearer to me. In other words, I stopped settling for less than I wanted. So it has been with this homeschooling, home educating \u2014call it what you will \u2014 taking Nik out of school . While it was all well and good to give myself an  adjustment period  to \u201cfigure out what our schedule looks like\u201d and  yadda yadda yadda , I\u2019ve realized if  I  don\u2019t steer this course \u2014hell, if I don\u2019t  set  a course \u2014we will simply be adrift. Together, but adrift none the less. So I have started to think long and hard about what I want our daily life to  feel  like, what sorts of things I want to expose Nik to, how to make it all fit together. I\u2019ve started to create \u2014 (drumroll, please) a  vision . It\u2019s not complete by any stretch. But there  are  pieces which are crystal clear to me. The process is illuminating. And you know what I\u2019m learning along the way? Something I  knew  once but forgot; Vision is about  hope , about  possibilities , dreaming maybe  a little bit bigger  than you think you deserve or can handle. And most important of all? Having a vision requires an open heart \u2014something I haven\u2019t let myself have in a long time. It\u2019s a scary,  oh-so-vulnerable  place to be. If my heart is open then there is a very large chance that it could get bruised or broken; I don\u2019t suffer disappointments well and certainly not on my son\u2019s behalf. But,  open it I must . The nice thing is that my heart is like any other muscle in my body; the more I use it and exercise it the bigger and stronger it becomes. The more I open my heart and let in hope and possibility, the more that comes back to me. Serendipity seems to abound when I have my vision groove on, too. This week, as a result of my  warbling  about repurposing dreams and such, things began to fall into place. I was at the YMCA on Saturday, having worked out with my new buddy Andrea; as I was leaving, I stopped at the desk to inquire about pool schedules. One of the things I\u2019ve wanted to do is get Nik  back into the water ; he loves it and really gets a lot of benefit from the sensory input. I over heard the following from the woman in line ahead of me  \u201cI\u2019d like to inquire about the special adapted swim for kids with special needs? My son has autism and I think he\u2019d really benefit from this.\u201d  Next thing I know this mom and I are exchanging names and contact details and talking about the program her son is in,  etcetera ,  etcetera . Meanwhile, we both left a note for the new aquatic director. I\u2019d done that in the past and not gotten a response so I didn\u2019t have great expectations about anything working out. HA! That was in my  pre -vision days, obviously. Tonight, I received not one but  two  phone calls from the new aquatic director. She\u2019s only been there a few weeks and is totally revamping the entire swimming instruction program. The first call was to find out more about Nik and what we are looking for. The second call \u2014less than thirty minutes later!! \u2014was to tell me that she has an instructor who is already working with some special needs kids and is available to do one on one with Nik on Monday afternoons beginning on February 25th! She is going to check with the other mother to see if she would like to have her son join us; if not then Nik will have one on one pool time every Monday afternoon \u2014all for $35! So, if you ask me how this vision-holding thing is working out I\u2019d have to say\u2026 Wait for it\u2026 Swimmingly!  I\u2019ll keep you posted\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/case-closed.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/02/songbird.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/visionary-or-all-wet/", "title": "Visionary or All\u00a0Wet?"},
{"date": "January 7, 2008 ", "body": "Ugh. I have so many things I want to write about and no time to do it right now!  Niksdad is still home on school break (one more week) and we\u2019ve been doing things like renovating our laundry room (well, closet really) from floor to ceiling, catching up on finances (fun, fun, fun), and trying to make some order out of the chaos that has been our loft/office for more than two years.  Toss into the mix all the usual therapy appointments, the holidays, etc. and \u2014 Voila!   No time to blog. I thought I would catch up tonight and write all sorts of wonderful things about Nik\u2019s new orientation and mobility teacher.  Or brag about the progress Nik\u2019s making in feeding therapy \u2014and the latest explosion of emerging communication skills.  Or maybe share a bit about some of Nik\u2019s funny new play routines \u2014including pictures and video.  Yes, I could even write about how Nik\u2019s getting sick again and is having more episodes.  Or how we\u2019re waiting to schedule an in-patient multi-day video EEG to rule out new/different seizure activity as a cause of the ongoing mysterious pain. That was before the phone rang mid-morning; it was my in-laws calling to tell us they were coming to visit \u2014tonight.  Unlike some people, I do not have the most warm and loving feelings for my MIL.  I respect her because she is my husband\u2019s mother and gave him life; the rest \u2014the wonderful human being he is today?  All his own hard work; he overcame his childhood to be the man he is now instead of the screwed up guy he could have been. If I sound bitter \u2014well, I am.  This is the same woman who didn\u2019t acknowledge the birth of her  only  grandchild until he was  four months old  \u2014even then, we had to send out birth announcements to force her hand.  The same woman who, shortly after our engagement, said to Niksdad,  \u201cWell, you know, everyone is talking about what a huge mistake you\u2019re making.\u201d   And the same woman who hasn\u2019t seen her grandson but three times in nearly three years; the last time was 18 months ago.   They only live three hours away.  Every time they talk, my MIL has something to say to Niksdad about Nik\u2019s autism or his not eating \u2014none of it supportive or even well-informed.  She reads something in a magazine or sees something on television and becomes the instant expert, ready and willing to tell us what we are doing wrong.   \u201cHave you tried\u2026?\u201d  or  \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just\u2026?\u201d   She does not see the magnificence that is Nikolas \u2014right here and now \u2014through her denial-colored glasses.  He doesn\u2019t quite know it yet \u2014and for that I am exceedingly grateful.  But the day will come, probably sooner than I am ready for it, when Nik will feel her distaste, her disappointment, her uncomfortableness with who he is.  It makes me angry and sad \u2014and brings out the fiercely protective mama bear in me.   \u201cDon\u2019t f*ck with my kid, lady!\u201d  They will stay at a hotel because my MIL smokes like a chimney and Nik cannot be around that; they will breeze in and breeze out in roughly twenty-four hours \u2014like an emotional hurricane leaving a path of destruction and disruption in its wake.  Meanwhile, I already feel like I am under siege and they haven\u2019t even arrived. So, if you don\u2019t hear from me for a while it\u2019s because I\u2019m either recovering from  Hurricane In-Laws  \u2014or I\u2019m hiding from law enforcement!  I\u2019m just kidding about that one!  I\u2019d never act on it but dammit that woman makes me so mad I could spit! I try to be zen; I really do.  But some things are just hard-wired; protecting my family is one of them.

{"date": "February 15, 2008 ", "body": "\n \n Nothing really exciting to write about tonight\u2026I\u2019m just sitting here at my desk rockin\u2019 out to my  new MP3 player . My old one died after a year plus of hard use at the gym and in my car. Boy was I bummed. But, as luck would have it, I just unloaded our old treadmill to a friend of my mother and he gave me a hundred bucks for it! Yep, I went out today and  s-p-l-u-r-g-e-d!!  I contemplated getting an iPod but I refuse to spend the kind of money I would have to for all the features I want. And, I\u2019ve never been a big Steve Jobs fan; I heard too many unsavory things about him in my days in the computer industry. (In his defense, it may have  all  been hearsay. Still, he\u2019s rich enough!)\n So, my  new MP3  is a sweet little  red  number with all kinds of awesome features. My old player was pretty basic \u20141GB of music and an FM receiver. The user interface was clearly designed by someone who hasn\u2019t actually ever tried to use the thing at the gym. Trying to read the screen while bouncing along on the elliptical trainer, or trying to adjust the settings?  Fuggeddaboutit!! \n \n My  new  lovely? Sigh\u2026intuitive, sleek,  sexy , and inspiring! I can download videos and photos and run slideshows to music while I work out for goodness sake! Of course, if I do that, I might fall off the treadmill or something\u2026Oh, and it\u2019s Bluetooth compatible, too!\n So tonight, I\u2019ve been completely  recharging  myself. Did I mention that the purchase price (more than 25% cheaper than the iPod Nano!) includes a  free  thirty day subscription to  Rhapsody ? With  unlimited  downloads?? Sigh\u2026if there\u2019s anything almost as good as sex and expensive dark chocolate this is it.  Unlimited downloads, people!  I\u2019ve already downloaded  twenty-five  albums (what does one call them when they are in this format, anyway?)! According to my computer, that\u2019s 1.4 days of nonstop music. Wahooooooo! \n Some of those downloads have replaced old favorites which were long ago stolen \u2014while Nik was still in the NICU \u2014by some  moron  who thought a \u201992 Saturn, four-door with a manual transmission, was a good deal. Poetic justice prevailed\u2026the car broke down somewhere outside Richmond, CA in the middle of the night and the culprit was left stranded; it saved us the trouble of trying to unload the car some other way! Unfortunately, insurance didn\u2019t cover the more than thirty CD\u2019s which were stolen from my clunker. Everything ranging from Sinatra to Evanescence, Streisand to Bad Company, some Broadway cast recordings, and my  favorite Branford Marsalis CD . I\u2019ve been putting off replacing them because of the cost. \n Can you say  \u201cJackpot! \u201d? Yep, heaven. \n Now, lest you think me a  complete  tightwad (well, okay, I am in many areas), this isn\u2019t just about getting tons of music for free. As I\u2019ve been downloading and formatting my playlists, I have felt myself coming back to life. I mean that in a literal, visceral sense. I feel more peaceful and energized, more centered and able to cope than I have in a very, very long time.\n   \n \n Music is the thing which speaks to me on some level so far  beyond  the conscious that I didn\u2019t realize how much a part of me was missing until I brought it back. I don\u2019t know if that makes any kind of sense to anyone else. I think if I had to choose between living a life without books or a life without music \u2014well, it  would  be a tough choice.  But music would win every single time. Since we moved from California in 2005, I don\u2019t have my own office space; I didn\u2019t even bother to unpack the stereo and all my CD\u2019s until recently. Niksdad and I don\u2019t necessarily have compatible listening habits and Nik has, until recently, been really iffy about music that\u2019s not kid friendly. What I didn\u2019t realize until tonight is that simply  doing without  was slowly cutting off my creative charge.\n So, as Nik sleeps not-so-peacefully down the hall and Niksdad is at work, I have been jamming in my seat to techno, country, singing with opera\u2026 you name it . Unabashedly, unrepentantly loud \u2014and feeling  alive  like I haven\u2019t been in nearly two years. \n God bless technology. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R7ZlN8_K1eI/AAAAAAAAAf4/7TZ8l-xXUzQ/s1600-h/Dance+Party+button.png", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R7ZivM_K1cI/AAAAAAAAAfo/UiOqtETqwV4/s1600-h/solid_gold.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R7Zk5M_K1dI/AAAAAAAAAfw/cXlPZ-P7e5M/s1600-h/Dance+Party+button.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R7Zla8_K1fI/AAAAAAAAAgA/x0QQ0wxiMwI/s1600-h/solid_gold.jpg", "http://www.firstglimpsemag.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F2008%2Ff0503%2Ffg4%2Ffg4.asp", "http://www.firstglimpsemag.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F2008%2Ff0503%2Ffg4%2Ffg4.asp", "http://www.rhapsody.com/home.html", "http://www.spun.com/music/product-detail.jsp?id=782262"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/02/15/friday-night-dance-party/", "title": "Friday Night Dance\u00a0Party"},
{"date": "August 9, 2008 ", "body": "His indignant cries rouse me from my state of half-sleep. I sit up and groggily reach for the monitor, turning it up so I can hear a bit better. Through his sleepy sobs I hear him singing the tune of  \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d  \u2014his  \u201ccomfort me, Mommy\u201d  song.  Like one of Pavlov\u2019s dogs, I am trained well; I slither out of bed and stumble across the hall. He closes his eyes and whines a moment as he moves my hand into just the right position to press over his right ear. Something still causes him discomfort but he cannot tell me what it is; it has been thus his entire life. I rest my hand on the side of his head; my palm covers his ear and I gently stroke his cheek with my thumb. He turns his face slightly into my arm and sighs. He snuffles and wiggles to settle in again. In the dim light I watch him tuck one hand between the mattress and the side of the crib as if anchoring himself in place. Within minutes he is fast asleep again; I extract my tingling hand and stumble back to bed to wait for the next summons. It is the same each night; like clockwork, he stirs and comes to half-consciousness several times. Each time I stop what I am doing and go to him. Unlike those endless and horrible nights of mere months ago, he no longer requires pain relievers, homeopathic remedies, or extra padding in the crib to protect his head from the force of his thrashing about. Now, he settles almost instantly when my hand touches his face. Like before, though, he is unable to tell me what troubles him so. As I watch his cheeks go slack and his chest begins to rise and fall with the steadiness of slumber, I ponder whether the touch of my hand actually eases a physical pain or if it simply comforts him. Does he remember all that time spent together in the NICU? Two hundred nine days \u2014 five thousand-sixteen hours  \u2014of which roughly half was spent with me by his side nearly always touching some part of him. Does he remember the feel of my hands cradling his tiny head and impossibly slender bottom when he was mere days old and so incredibly fragile? Does his body remember, even now, the outpouring of love and strength which flowed through my trembling fingers \u2014willing him to live, to fight? Is this then what pulls me to him even now in those quiet hours in the middle of the night? ***************************************************** His quiet singing and laughter rouse me from my state of half-sleep; I roll over and look at the lights on the monitor. With a smile, I sit up and rub the sleep from my tired eyes. Each morning is the same; in spite of a night of disturbed sleep and whimpering cries, he awakes as if sunshine runs through his veins. He happily entertains himself while I drag myself to nearly full consciousness. I cross the hallway and pause outside his door; breathy strains of  \u201cOld MacDonald\u201d  or  \u201cSigning Time\u201d  gently tease my ears. With a smile, I open the door. The sound of the opening door interrupts his musical reverie; he sits up with a sly smile and begins his nonsensical but deliriously happy babbles. I understand he is happy to see me again so soon. He stands and leans on the side of the crib, his face tilted up and lips pursed to deliver an unasked-for kiss. I steal two quickly before he begins to pull on my shirt in an effort to climb out of the crib. Bracing his hand on something more stable than knit cotton, I help him down. He continues to chatter and sing as we make our way down the stairs. He squeals and scampers over to his toy bucket and begins to systematically empty it as quickly as he can. He finds his chosen toy for the morning and carries it to the sofa. He climbs up to await our routine of medicine through his tube, followed by clean pants and clothing. He proudly pulls his shirt on by his self and then lies down to await his clean pull-up and shorts. Supine, he reaches to pull up his shorts. Once they are settled just so, I help him with the zipper. He sits up and snuggles against my side, glancing up at me with his most engaging smile. \u201cAahh aahhh aahh ahhh ahhhhh!\u201d I intone my best Tarzan yell as I gently beat my fists on my chest. He collapses against me in a fit of the giggles. I do it again just to hear his laughter and see the sparkle in his eyes. \u201cYour turn; you do it!\u201d I tell him as he reaches to pull my hands against his chest. He pats his chest with two open palms and tries to mimic the sound; it comes out as more of a satisfied sigh than a throaty warble. My heart turns to goo as he collapses against me in another fit of the giggles. I warble and beat my chest as his body shakes with mirth again and again and again. Life is good. Sleep is overrated.

{"date": "April 29, 2008 ", "body": "The universe and my child are conspiring against me it seems. Well, at least in terms of my recent ability \u2014rather, inability\u2014 to find the time to sit and write coherent prose of any sort that is not a simple regurgitation of recent events. Today is chilly and rainy which means I cannot be waylaid by the plethora of chores in my garden; the weeds get a respite it seems. Nik has finally deigned to  actually  sleep at nap time, and my husband is still at school for a while longer today. I\u2019d better work fast\u2026 Four weeks ago,  Jennifer Graf Groneberg\u2019s   Road Map to  Holland  hit the stores. I think I may have gotten the first copy on sale in my hometown; I was so excited to read more about Jennifer and her wonderful family. You see \u2014I have a confession \u2014I have just a  teensy  bit of a blog crush on Jennifer. It might have something to do with her amazing writing style, or her obvious love for all of her children and her love and respect for her husband,  Tom . But, really, I think it was  Tom\u2019s   books  (one of which I reviewed  here ) which cemented it for me. I don\u2019t know how to possibly explain except to say that having read some of the back story, as told by Tom, I knew that the woman who shared this grand adventure of life as he described it \u2014and who not only survived but thrived and blossomed in the process \u2014was someone I would want to call friend and be proud to call sister. By now, you\u2019ve surely seen all the reviews. If you haven\u2019t then you should go  here  and browse to your heart\u2019s content. There are so many  insightful and erudite reviews  that I am a tad embarrassed even to be sharing my own. What could I possibly write about  Road Map to Holland  that hasn\u2019t already been said at least twice over by any of these reviewers? A must read for any parent of a special needs child? Emotionally powerful and moving? Raw, honest, unflinching? Poignant, poetic, wise and insightful? Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes, again. And yet\u2026I found it very difficult to read the first few chapters of this book. The story itself wasn\u2019t the challenge \u2014I know how it turns out (so far, anyway); the difficulty was the memories it evoked of my own experience after the birth of my son at 27 weeks and our subsequent 209 day stay in the NICU. At each turn of the page, I found such viscerally painful memories startling me that I could only read small bits at a time. As Jennifer\u2019s beautiful prose unfolded before me, I felt the uncomfortable sting of familiarity. The rawness of the emotions which overtook me at times made me remember that lost feeling I had after Nik was born \u2014the utter  conviction  that I had already failed in my abilities as a mother. The confusing swirl of emotions which assaulted my psyche each day as I sat at Nik\u2019s bedside, or at home trying to pump the milk that simply would not come in no matter how much I willed it; the worry, shame, guilt, fear, and inadequacy I felt \u2014and the desperate isolation\u2014all came rushing back to me. Fortunately, I am beyond that after all these years. Now, facing other issues as my son grows, I have the camaraderie and sisterhood of other blogging mamas \u2014Jennifer among them\u2014 to help me understand that all is not lost in the moments when I am certain it must be; that I am not alone and I do not have to be. That life not only goes on but can be beautiful, funny, and richly rewarding. The connection is a blessing \u2014a lifeline when I feel at risk of drowning. I wish I\u2019d had the benefit of another woman\u2019s understanding and wisdom in those early days after Nik was born; another woman\u2019s healing and acceptance, and another woman\u2019s compassionate permission to feel the grief and fear and anger I felt but had no where to direct. Jennifer\u2019s story really is, I think, the story of  Everywoman  who has walked in similar shoes. Certainly, some move through their stages of grieving, accepting, forgiving and forging ahead at different paces; but the realization that we share so much in spite of our different circumstances is powerful. Empowering. Jennifer\u2019s book stands not only as a wonderful resource for parents of an infant newly diagnosed with a disability, but also serves as a moving and inspiring road map to self-healing and self-acceptance. A road map to becoming the mother our children need us to be \u2014at whatever pace we may take. A must read for any parent of a special needs child? Emotionally powerful and moving? Raw, honest, unflinching? Poignant, poetic, wise and insightful? Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes, again.

{"date": "April 22, 2008 ", "body": "Today being Earth Day I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re expecting a post about that, right?  Well, you\u2019d be mistaken.  Sorry.  Nope, today I am off to a quarterly meeting of the Inter Agency Coordinating Council for my state\u2019s birth to three/early intervention programs .  It\u2019s one of those large bodies which meets every three months to discuss the state of early intervention services from every conceivable angle \u2014and believe me when I tell you there are angles I never even imagined existed! But more important than the mere fact of my attending this meeting, what I really want to share with you is  the fact that I am attending.   You see, since we took Nik out of school in the fall, I have missed the last two meetings because I couldn\u2019t find appropriate child care and I couldn\u2019t take him to the meeting.  I mean, sure he\u2019s cute and all but he is also  extremely  high maintenance and would be a complete disruption to the very vital work of group. It sure makes it tough when parents of special children can\u2019t find meaningful ways to contribute to our communities all for want of appropriate care for our kids.  I really thought I was going to have to resign from my three-year term; we aren\u2019t planning on putting Nik back into school in the foreseeable future and Niksdad\u2019s school schedule precludes him from staying with Nik. Nik\u2019s medical needs, while certainly not as onerous as they once were, are still great enough that he would require a licensed nurse to provide care.  There is a special day care where I could pay to leave him for the day but I am not comfortable leaving him somewhere for an entire day without knowing who is taking care of him and what they are capable of handling should the need arise.  Nor do I want to be across town in case of an emergency. When I brought my concerns to the executive committee of the council, I truly expected to hear  \u201cGee, we\u2019re really sorry, Niksmom.  We hate to lose you but we understand.\u201d   What I actually heard instead was  \u201cGee, we\u2019re really sorry Niksmom.  We had no idea that we were making it so difficult for valued members to participate.  How can we support you to feel like your son is well cared for while still close at hand and you are able to participate fully?\u201d   I was completely stunned. After all these years of feeling so isolated \u2014first because of Nik\u2019s medical needs which dictated extremely limited contact with others for  two years , then because of the frustrations of trying to find our place in this world of \u201cnormal\u201d which doesn\u2019t seem to quite fit most days \u2014well, you can understand the relief and gratitude I felt.  It didn\u2019t even matter to me if we couldn\u2019t find a solution; what mattered was the effort. The effort paid off richly.   I am soon going to be loading Nik and a metric ton of his gear into the car and taking him with me to what will be the first of our quarterly meetings  together .  The state birth to three organization director has rented an extra room in the building and my friend S \u2014who knows Nik well, is going to entertain and occupy my little tornado just down the hall.  I can slip in and out of the meeting to start Nik\u2019s tube feeding and give him meds, I will be close at hand if he completely falls apart for some reason, and I am comfortable with the whole set up. If only the rest of the world were so understanding, so aware of what we parents of our special children have to offer.

{"date": "April 17, 2008 ", "body": "\n If music be the food of love, play on; give me excess of it, that, surfeiting, the appetite may sicken and so die. ~William Shakespeare~ While he may lack the prodigiousness of the Bard, Nikolas seems to be experiencing an  explosion  of communication lately. Not just in the generic  cooing and babbling  which he often does, or even the  \u201csinging\u201d  of certain songs/tunes \u2014though he  has  been singing more in context to indicate an activity or desire, come to think of it. No, Nik really seems to be catching on to this whole  communication gig . We\u2019re having some mixed successes with the actual  AAC devices ; Nik is making good progress with sequencing but the whole bit about conscious choice-making with the push of a button? Sporadic at best. I\u2019ve been working with Nik\u2019s speech therapist, Miss M, on finding ways to develop this skill. We are both thinking  waaay  outside the box here. Nik really is not cued in to visual symbols yet but  is  keen on music. We\u2019re working on some ideas to incorporate a snippet of music \u2014like a line of a song from a video he likes\u2014  only   spoken,  not sung, and coupled with a visual representation so he has to hit the button if he wants to actually  hear  the music. So, when you add in the powerful motivator of music, with Nik\u2019s new found  crush on Rachel , and his  intense desire to eat \u2026 well, you get something like this: \n\n (For clarity: the sign for apple is made by rubbing your knuckle in a small motion in the apple of your cheek.  Children who are just learning to sign \u2014or those with fine motor impairments \u2014often use approximations rather than precisely mimicking the sign.) Now, the video is  obviously  set up but I did so in response to Nik actively requesting a piece of apple from me at dinner time.  TWICE  and without prompting! In addition to the spontaneous signing \u2014in the correct context, too, as he signed \u201c eat\u201d  and then  \u201capple\u201d  in succession \u2014Nik has also begun mimicking the intonation of certain words or phrases that he hears me say or is learning from the  Signing Time  videos. Tonight, after I gave him the apple wedge and he started slurping away like there was no tomorrow, I said  \u201cNik, can you say Thank you!\u201d  as I made the sign, too. He thumped his chest with his palm (apparently  his  way of saying  \u201cthank you\u201d  as well as  \u201cyes\u201d ) and said  \u201cuhhhh-uh\u201d  in perfect intonation. The words may not have been there, but I swear I heard  \u201cI love you, Mama\u201d  in that simple guttural utterance.  Nik beamed at me; I laughed \u2014then wiped away a tear.

{"date": "April 26, 2008 ", "body": "Oh my.  These  two   posts  today have got me in a very serious frame of mind \u2014not in a bad way, just in a way that I would prefer  not  to think about just yet. So, in my campaign of avoidance of issues which make me cry and/or feel my mortality too keenly\u2026 Joey\u2019s mom  tagged me recently for this meme of five things.  I am delighted to procrastinate on contemplating my mortality (or that of those around me) and happily share this with you instead! Five things found in your bag: Wallet  chock full of plastic cards for every conceivable purpose \u2014many of which have nothing to do with actually paying directly for anything \u2014and a picture of my son and my husband. Cell phone  with far more pictures and videos of Nik (and his daddy) than telephone numbers for people I ever talk to; it\u2019s my portable memory book. Eyeglass cleaning kit  for the reading glasses I never seem to remember to take with me anywhere. Empty business card case . Though I don\u2019t have an actual job which requires business cards, I made some up for myself to make it easier to exchange information at conferences and workshops.  I gave the last one out at Tuesday\u2019s meeting to a visiting parent who was looking for some local support. Pens.   Lots and lots of pens.  I seem to attract them for some strange reason; never mind that I rarely have anything to actually write on in my bag! Five favorite things in your room: I am currently in my loft so I\u2019ll go with what\u2019s here \u2014 My entire CD collection  which ranges from Annie Lennox to Enya to ZZ Top with a very healthy dollop of Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Mozart, Sondheim, Frank Loesser, Gershwin, Glen Miller, and a whole host of every genre of music (except gangsta rap).  One might call my musical tastes eclectic \u2014or schizophrenic. My small and equally eclectic collection of antique books.   If I had the space and funds it would be a much, much larger collection \u2014preferably housed in a large English manor somewhere, in a library with floor to ceiling shelves and lots of quiet nooks for reading or napping.  My most prized specimen was an original copy of Elizabeth Barrett Browning\u2019s  Sonnets from the Portuguese  (1850) which I was foolish enough to take that to college with me;  some  schnook  stole it.  The works range from Twain to Dostoevsky, Hegel, Kant, Spinoza, and E.B. White. Among my favorites are leather-bound, gilt-edged works by Thackeray, collections of essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson published the year before his death in 1882, an English translation of the Koran published in 1880, and John Greenleaf Whittier\u2019s  Among the Hills  (1869); many of these once belonged to my Nana Cook whom I adored.  Also included in this treasure trove is a small representation of lighter fare such as Louisa May Alcott\u2019s  Under the Lilacs  (1887),  A Spinner in the Sun  (1906),  Minkie  (1907), and  Persis Putnam\u2019s Treasure  (1908)\u2014all of which once belonged to my paternal grandmother, Momo.  Mostly suitable fare for a young woman brought up in a modest Quaker home just after the turn of the Twentieth Century (she was born in 1897).  I remember reading some of these books as a young girl when I would visit my grandparents at their summer home in Cape May, NJ.  But my favorite \u2014the book which I  still  take down periodically and ever so gently turn its pages \u2014is Longfellow\u2019s  Song of Hiawatha  published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1906 with exquisite illustrations by Harrison Fisher.  This, too, belonged to my Momo. Most of these books are not worth a lot except to me; they are a scant yet tangible connection to my family history.  Most, if not all, of these books belonged to cousins or aunts and uncles of my grandparents\u2019 or great-grandparents\u2019 generations and were lovingly gifted between them with inscriptions in spidery copperplate.  I cannot explain it but I feel a strong connection to these remnants of lives long passed; as if these books might speak to me and tell me more about the people on my family tree. Framed photographs I took  of the ocean crashing onto the rocks as the tide came in on the beach in Davenport, CA.  I used to love driving down Route One with the sunroof open, music blaring, the wind whipping my (then) long hair into dark tangles dampened with salt to arrive at this quiet little cove.  I\u2019d wander along the water\u2019s edge finding shells and stones as I waited for the perfect inspiration \u2014photo or otherwise.  It is this same beach where Niksdad and I often stopped to stretch our legs while out for a ride on his Harley.  Sometimes we would make it a destination for a romantic picnic or a special way to celebrate Easter morning at sunrise.  I\u2019ve always felt a strong connection to the ocean; I don\u2019t think I could live anywhere that I wouldn\u2019t at least be able to drive to it within a couple of hours. A small cedar box  which contains the ashes of my beloved cat, Tasha.  She chose me when I was in college in Louisiana.  This tiny little gray and black and white tiger striped kitten climbed up my pant leg and nestled into my arms; she stole my heart immediately and irrevocably.  We grew up together, Tasha and I.  She slept under the covers with me, shared Kalamata olives with me, and was my backup alarm clock when I hit the snooze one time too many and her breakfast was late.  She moved with me from Baton Rouge to Boston to South Jersey, Philadelphia, and New York City.  She was an intrepid cross-country traveler as my parents drove me from Delaware to California in an RV when I moved to San Jose in 1998.  Settling in California, Tasha and I rounded out our seventeen years together until she grew too ill, too old and frail to survive another move.  Tasha always had impeccable instincts about men \u2014Niksdad is the only one she ever took to.  I often wonder if she held on long enough to make sure I was going to be okay; she died in my arms in the middle of the night just weeks before my wedding in 2001.  I miss her every day. Rocks I collected on a trip  to Nova Scotia one year \u2014another exciting RV excursion with my parents.  We visited the Bay of Fundy\u2014one of two places in the world to experience the phenomenon of tidal bore \u2014 and walked out into the actual bay while the tide was out.  The specimens we collected were exquisite!  The rocks are small talismans I keep on my desk to remind me of the forces of nature, the strength of family, and that time can smooth out many hard edges. Five things you have always wanted to do: Visit the British Isles ; I\u2019d love to rent a small country cottage for a summer and really soak up the countryside. Sing at La Scala or The Metropolitan Opera in NYC.   I came close in a six-degrees kind of way; I once studied voice with  McHenry Boatwright  who once sang at the Met.  I also studied with  Luba Tchereseky  who was, allegedly, blacklisted at the Met and so, subsequently, were her students.  I did, however, once sing in a recital  here . Learn to play the guitar. Sing professionally with a band  performing music of the big band/swing era.  Hey, Nik\u2019s first home-PT experiences were often to the music of Glenn Miller or Tommy Dorsey! Learn to draw and paint.  Five things you are currently into: Being the best mom I can possibly be to Nikolas. Learning to take better care of myself. Planning my summer household reclamation project  (aka figuring out how to dig our way out from under all the junk we seem to have accumulated but not found a place for)! Learning as much as I can about Augmentative Communication  so I can help Nik with his communication efforts. Trying to find the time and energy to write more regularly.

{"date": "April 24, 2008 ", "body": "Image courtesy of  Richard  Winskill Jennifer Graf Groneberg  has a  beautiful post  today at  Parent Dish  about ice cream \u2014and ripples. It got me thinking this morning about what effect  I  have on the world around me \u2014both in my own closely circumscribed world of family and in a larger, more global or community sense.\n It\u2019s so easy to go through the motions of each day, one moment at a time, without fitting the bits and pieces together \u2014never seeing the forest for the trees. Days start to run together and events repeat with a numbing regularity which dulls my senses. Sometimes, in order to see ourselves more clearly, we have to step outside our daily routines; take the road less traveled \u2014or at least the left turn instead of the right \u2014and things change. \n If we are lucky, we can see the change we are being and creating as we go. If we are, perhaps, not as observant but equally lucky, we have friends who are there to help us not only find the forest but navigate our way through it. That has been my experience in this past year of blogging. Some days \u2014weeks really\u2014 I have been moving so fast and furiously that I\u2019ve missed the beauty around me \u2014until some kind blogging friend has reached out and touched my heart, reminding me that my absence is felt; there is a hole which no one else can fill. \n Tuesday, the day of  my high muckety muck committee meeting , was also my blogging anniversary. I was so busy \u2014and have been all week \u2014that I completely missed it! But, you know, there\u2019s a funny thing here because \u2014without the support, encouragement, wisdom, humor, and self-discovery I have shared with my readers and blogging friends over this past year \u2014I would never have had any sense that my absence was felt at those committee meetings that I missed; that my one voice  does  make a difference. I would never have spoken up and had my needs \u2014and Nik\u2019s\u2014met with such grace and ease. \n Nor would I have been so beautifully reminded of the gifts I bring when I share my son with others \u2014both online and in person.  I  know my son is magnificent and special; what parent doesn\u2019t think that about their own child? But seeing my child through others\u2019 eyes has made me a more conscious parent, more willing to recognize and, when appropriate, place my son\u2019s needs ahead of my own desires and ego. I feel the weight of the responsibility a little heavier than I would like on many days but I shoulder the load with love because I know I am not alone in the journey. \n The meeting itself went well; perhaps I will write more about that another time. The child care, depending on your perspective, was pretty good. There are things I learned that I will do differently next time to make sure Nik has a bit more guided activity for part of the time. Also, I realized that people do not fully understand perseveration until they experience it first hand. The unfortunate effects of allowing certain perseverations to continue for a long time have lasted long past Tuesday afternoon. But I can see that it is up to me to guide those who care for my son as well as to find new and creative ways to distract Nik and keep him more fully occupied in the days which follow. \n None the less, I know that Nik was cared for by a loving and conscientious friend; S was not afraid of Nik\u2019s high energy and insatiable \u2014bordering on dangerous\u2014 curiosity. She\u2019s even willing to do it again for the next meeting in July! S sent me a beautiful email after she got home; she wrote \u2014 \n I so loved spending time with Nik. I want you to know, that I was able to connect with how awesome of a kid he is! I know you already know! \n Niksmom, ALWAYS keep the hope in your heart going strong. That one-on-one time with him was amazing. I watched how he problem-solved. I watched how he NEVER got discouraged when attempting something. I watched him enjoy his now \u2013 which so many of us adults can never do. I watched his compassion as he wanted to share his apple with me, just like his Mommy \u2013 I was honored. \n Niksmom, I loved being with your blessing. Because guess what, he is a blessing to me too. A reminder of WHY WE DO THIS! Our precious, precious children. \n When is the next ICC meeting? You have me for as long as you can use me! \n With love for you my friend, \n Because of S\u2019s generosity and the ripples  she  created by tossing her pebble into  my  tiny pond, I was able to do some work on an issue which is really important to me \u2014helping families understand and successfully navigate the transition from the early intervention program to the schools. I am now heading a subcommittee which is going to create a family guide to be used statewide by the birth-to-three program and the parent information resource center. Ironically, our horrible experience with Nik\u2019s transition (and subsequently, his bad school experience) puts me in a really good position to look at this issue from the standpoint of hindsight about what I wish we had known going in and how I wish things had been handled; I also have one of the more medically involved children that they have dealt with in a long time. There are other parents and some service professionals on the subcommittee, too, who have a variety of unique perspectives to share. I am looking forward to the process.\n One day I took a pebble called  blogging  and tossed it into my little pond; my pond was forever changed. Then I took some pebbles from my  own  garden and dropped them into several  other  ponds. The ripples are still moving outward and I cannot see how far they extend, but I know that I am changed yet again. \n Thank you for being a part of my journey, my growth, and my change. Thank you for the ripples you\u2019ve made in my heart and in my life. \n Photo courtesy of  http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/photo/rain.html ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SBEvvhn1BwI/AAAAAAAAApo/LNGpZLzMrJU/s1600-h/pebbles.jpg", "http://richardwinskill.co.uk/Miscellaneous/wallpic/pebbles.jpg", "http://jennifergrafgroneberg.wordpress.com/", "http://www.parentdish.com/2008/04/24/ice-cream-in-fancy-dishes/", "http://www.parentdish.com/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/04/another-kind-of-awareness.html", "http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/photo/rain.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/04/24/pebbles/", "title": "Pebbles"},

{"date": "May 19, 2008 ", "body": "It is said the darkest hour is just before the dawn.  Each day brings with it a new dawn and a darkness which, depending on circumstances, can seem bleaker and blacker than one thinks possible. Yes, as  Drama Mama  said in her comment on  this post , we do seem to do things in a  BIG  way here at NiksHouse.  I\u2019d give an awful, awful lot to be  oh-so-very-small  right now.  Really, truly, I would. In the wake of  this awful stuff , and on the heels of  this amazing stuff  \u2014well, it just keeps on getting better and better.  Sorry, you couldn\u2019t sense the  sarcasm  oozing from those words?  Let me elaborate. Today, Nik had  the worst experience  ever with PT and OT.  We had back-to-back appointments this morning after another  phenomenal session with Miss M .  Nik  actually  made it to the parking lot again before he lost it.  Like  last time , he went inside \u2014screaming and crying in protest the entire time.   That was the good part.   I\u2019m sporting a fat lip tonight as a result of letting my guard down.  Technically, I didn\u2019t really let my guard down; it\u2019s more that I didn\u2019t think Nik would react as strongly as he did today; he reached a new high.  Or is that low?  Whatever your perspective, let\u2019s just say that Nik\u2019s flailing head and Mommy\u2019s lip are not a good match. Miss D worked with Nik and  tried  to follow his lead and redirect and distract him when and where she could.  They even took a walk outside in the sunshine and fresh air while I waited inside.  It went great until Nik saw our car and tried to open the door; when he couldn\u2019t open the door and Miss D led him away from the car \u2014you can imagine the scene in the parking lot.  He  completely  fell apart and just was not able to pull himself back together \u2014even after Miss D brought him inside and I held him and sang to him; he quieted for a moment but then ramped right back up. We\u2019ve hit a crossroads in many areas it seems.  First, and I wasn\u2019t certain I wanted to share this yet but it seems appropriate at this junction, our  neurologist  wants to put Nik on  this   medication .  Niksdad and I have made it clear that we are not  yet  ready to go down that road until we have exhausted all other possibilities and ruled out any potential underlying physiological causes for Nik\u2019s pain.  And it  is  pain; I can see a very marked difference between his  pain episodes  which strike out of the blue and the temper he displayed today. Today.  Ah, it was  really  difficult to not react negatively when talking with Miss D about Nik\u2019s cognition and behavior.  She truly thinks that he  \u201cknows what he\u2019s doing\u201d  and seems to think he has some measure of control over it.  I, on the other hand, do think he knows what he is doing but that he cannot control it \u2014 yet.   It was agonizing to watch as Miss D held Nik by the arms in a chair and spoke sternly to him as I was putting on my shoes; it was nowhere near a true restraint such as  this , but it was enough to make him even more agitated.  And, to be fair, she had to hold him in order to keep him from running out the door into the parking lot which borders on a very busy road.  None the less, I hurriedly donned my shoes and got Nik into the car. I have to accept the fact that Nik is growing bigger, stronger, faster, and smarter.  With that growth and development, I assume, will come tremendous gains; but they seem to be coupled with equally tremendous challenges in coping with change, communicating his needs, and being in control \u2014or not, as was the case today\u2014 of himself and of his environment.  And yet, I  know  that Nik is not an angry and aggressive child; this behavior is fairly new and, until recently, I have usually been able to help him work through it. I cried all the way home \u2014mostly out of frustration at not knowing how to help Nik navigate his world, our world.  For the first time, I had to see the  potential  for Nik to be a danger to himself or to others should his actions be misunderstood or if someone tries to restrain him.  I immediately thought of  this book   (which I had dismissed in the past as not being relevant to Nik) and wondered if there might be something there to help us.  Until very recently, I haven\u2019t seen Nik as an explosive child; he\u2019s never done anything to anyone that has ever given cause for concern \u2014except to himself.  There does seem to be a correlation, or at least I think there may be, between these explosive outbursts at PT and OT lately and a  rougher-than-usual  afternoon; after mornings like today, Nik doesn\u2019t nap and his tolerance for frustration seems to be nearly nonexistent.  This afternoon, he was almost manic in his nap time antics \u2014see-sawing from giddy laughter to flat out shrieking hysteria at still being in his crib.  Poor Niksdad was here with him while I was at the grocery store; when I came home, Nik had four new bruises on his head and face \u2014one across the bridge of his nose from pressing his face so hard against the crib slats.  Hours later, his forehead still bears the imprint of the mesh netting from his  crib tent . I know that we are not the first family to experience this and we will certainly not be the last.  But I\u2019d sure love some thoughts and maybe even a little advice on ways to weather this storm and still keep my sanity \u2014and keep Nik\u2019s beautiful little face intact.

We have no idea why; I\u2019ve been with him nearly every single time and if I wasn\u2019t then Niksdad was. Nik used to laugh and clap and squeal with glee when we pulled up in front of the office. For the past three weeks though \u2014whether in conjunction with the  escalation of his pain episodes  or for some other reason entirely \u2014 Nik has had complete meltdowns each time we go. Things progressed from Nik screaming and crying as soon as we walked through the door \u2014and proceeding to then thrash and slam his head on the (carpeted) concrete floor\u2014 to having a complete screaming, crying meltdown in the car as soon as he realized where we were going (based on the route we took). On Tuesday of this week, Nik lost it shortly after we left home; it\u2019s a six mile trip each way. We decided to discontinue his playgroup because it got to be so bad; I think he was freaking out some of the other moms and one or two of the kids, too.\n Anyway, yesterday was no different \u2014at first. As soon as we pulled out of our neighborhood and onto the main road, I saw Nik\u2019s face scrunch up in the pre-meltdown expression. Since he\u2019d been in a great mood thus far all morning, I knew it wasn\u2019t from pain; I started to distract him by singing songs from  Signing Time  videos \u2014over and over  and over . It worked to not only distract him but it got him laughing and clapping and trying to sing along. (You should hear his rendition of  \u201c\u2026Signing Time with Alex and Leah, come and play\u2026;\u201d  it\u2019s utterly adorable!) I thought I had found a magic solution \u2014until I pulled into the parking lot. \n Interestingly enough, Nik cried and screamed but he cooperated with me. He didn\u2019t kick and thrash and roll on the ground as he has done in the past few weeks. He sat down in a chair at my request, took off his shoes and coat, and then ran screaming\u2026to the playroom! There were many bumpy and hysterical patches but, overall, Nik did really well. Miss D, our awesome OT who is now fully certified in sensory integration diagnosis and techniques, followed his lead and found ways to turn each struggle into a new game. By the time we left, Nik was smiling and happy. He spent more time playing one-on-one with Miss D and  really  paying attention to her \u2014her eyes and her face especially, and he even gave her a kiss when we left! Then he turned around and wanted to go back inside again! So we did that for a little bit; I really wanted our leaving \u2014and Nik\u2019s experience of entering the building, too \u2014to be joyful for him. \n I am happy to report that it worked. In fact, Nik spent the entire rest of the day being giddy and giggly, affectionate and funny, and as cooperative as any willful toddler can be in one afternoon. In short, the rest of the day was delightful! But it gets better\u2026 \n We had a feeding therapy session in the afternoon; Nik\u2019s nap was cut short \u2014always a crap shoot \u2014and it was a decided change in routine which I wasn\u2019t sure Nik would handle well. You guessed it; I was  wronger than wrong ! I think I can say without reservation that this was his best session ever.  EVER. \n Maybe it was our visit to the  neurologist  on Thursday, followed by the  bloodletting  \u2014er um, visit to the lab\u2014 for a multitude of tests. Or perhaps the moon and stars were in perfect alignment. Whatever the reason, Nik was a total superstar with Miss M. To quote Miss M,  \u201cNik\u2019s the best speech therapist I\u2019ve ever met!\u201d \n You see, Miss M has been working with Nik to teach him the necessary oral motor skills to  actually  take a bite of food. Progress has been slow. It\u2019s only been very recently that Nik would even tap an apple wedge against his top teeth, let alone let any other food come into contact with them. He still guards his lower teeth with his tongue even when he\u2019s sipping from a straw. We\u2019ve been doing exercises with his  chewy tubes  to strengthen his  masseter muscles  as well as to try to reduce some of his oral defensiveness.  \n The game plan has been to gradually move through stages:\n 1. accepting the tube near the back of his jaw, followed by; 2. five consecutive bites on the tube at he back of his jaw on each side, then; 3. inserting something crunchy like a potato stick inside the tube and repeating the bites at the back of the jaw to introduce the sensation and sound of crunchy solids. \n The idea is that Nik would gradually tolerate the sound of the crunch \u2014which startled him terribly once before\u2014 and allow him to get the tiniest bit of dust-like crumbs on his tongue. This would then lead up to: 4. taking multiple bites on the tube and crunching the contents and then; 5. voluntary biting in the front of his mouth, followed by; 6. biting and crunching along the full range of his mouth.\n You can see where this is going, right? \n If I told you that we\u2019ve only  recently  mastered  step two , you might understand why Miss M and I were both utterly speechless yesterday when we introduced  step three  and Nik took off like a champion thoroughbred and raced through the entire process \u2014 all the way to step six  \u2014completely independent of any coaching or input from Miss M! Multiple times.\n As if that weren\u2019t enough, Nik showed off his new growing sign language vocabulary for us; he can now sign  eat, apple, please, thank you, more, shoes,  and  cat.  He is close to mastering  share, cheese,  and  bye-bye.  Yesterday, we added another emerging sign to the list, too! But let me back up a bit, first. \n Nik\u2019s  current  manner of asking for things is to grab our hands and direct us toward the object he wants; sometimes he wants us to perform a task such as opening the buckle on his lap belt or taking off his shoes. We are trying to pair Nik\u2019s non-specific requests with at least an acknowledgment. For example, when Nik drags my hand toward his lap belt I will say  \u201cOh, you want Mommy\u2019s help? If you want Mommy to open the buckle show me \u2018please.\u2019 Sign \u2018please\u2019 for Mommy.\u201d  As I say this I am also showing him the signs for  open  and  please . (Nik doesn\u2019t sign  yes  so we use  please  in its place.) When he signs  please  by patting his chest, I open the buckle and praise him. \n The most important element is that we make Nik  acknowledge and confirm  what he wants. He is becoming much more consistent with this. When and where we can, we try to introduce new signs. So when he \u201casked\u201d me to open his lap belt yesterday at the end of therapy, I asked him to show me  open  \u2014fully expecting that he wouldn\u2019t but that we would make a few attempts before we defaulted to  please.  You could have knocked me over with a feather when Nik responded with a sign which is clearly  his  rendition of  open  and then followed it with the  intonation of the word  as well! \n Yes, I got teary.\n Meanwhile, Miss M needs to completely rewrite  all  of Nik\u2019s feeding goals and some of his speech goals. His  augcom devices  have  finally  been ordered and should be in soon. At this rate, I suspect Nik may outgrow the need for those specific devices pretty quickly. We are going to start working on photo cards soon, too. \n In other areas, I think I\u2019ve mentioned before that Nik is beginning to really cooperate with simple directions such as  sit down, give it to me, give Mommy a kiss, come here  (not as consistent but I think that\u2019s more about willfulness!), and the like. He is also making big strides in self help skills such as putting on socks and shoes \u2014with help, of course. Nik also practices taking off and putting on his own shirt nearly every chance he gets \u2014sometimes with very humorous results.  \n   So, as  Kristen  reminds us in  this eloquent post , our children\u2019s stories \u2014indeed, all our stories \u2014are still largely unwritten.  Nik\u2019s will, I suspect, have multiple plot twists and more than a few cliff-hangers before it\u2019s finished.  Just when I think I am in control of the plot, my main character throws me a curve.  But then, I wouldn\u2019t enjoy the ride half as much without a little excitement, right?

{"date": "May 29, 2008 ", "body": "When I was a  much  younger woman \u2014in my wild and impetuous days as a single gal in NYC\u2014 I had a friend, Anne. Anne was roughly a dozen or so years older than I and was a single mother raising two young pre-teen boys. Though Anne was far from perfect \u2014she  reveled  in being right about things (and she usually was) \u2014 she had a heart of gold and a righteously protective streak a mile wide. She would offer me the shirt off her back, the food in her cupboard, and a soft place to land when my world came crashing down around me. She was also the first to stand by a friend in need \u2014\u201cfighting the good fight\u201d\u2014 or to teach that same friend how to stand up for herself. We lost touch a number of years ago through simple neglect; our paths diverged so greatly after the birth of my son, the geographical distance between us, and who knows what else.\n Anne always had a habit which annoyed me to no end; every time we would go out to eat, she would ask me if I wanted to  \u201cjoin the sharers club.\u201d  She always wanted to share whatever we each ordered; I, on the other hand,  never  wanted to share. Call it miserly, greedy, thrifty \u2014I was, after all, a single woman living alone and pinching pennies in a very expensive city\u2014 but I really got annoyed. Anne never took it personally though. She would simply smile and say,  \u201cAw, sweetie, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing. One day you\u2019ll realize the joy of sharing.\u201d \n ******************************* \n Amid the clatter of emptying the dishwasher \u2014Nik\u2019s laughter echoing through the playroom and into the kitchen\u2014 I hear the sound of uneven footsteps and the banging of a heavy object as it bounces along the floor. I turn to see Nik dragging one of his new toys over to the kitchen gate. As he hoists his little cash register toy up over his head, I fly to the gate to keep the toy from crashing to the floor. Nik stops mid-toss and laughs.  \u201cAre you all done, buddy? Do you want Mommy to take your toy?\u201d  I should know better than to ask a question like that; Nik doesn\u2019t have the communication skills to answer such a query. \n I take the toy from him and begin to place it on the armoire near the telephone \u2014still in sight but safely out of reach. Nik begins to vocalize something and gestures at the same time \u2014tapping the fingertips of his right hand into the palm of his left as if he\u2019s making a \u201cTee.\u201d My eyes widen in surprise. Am I seeing what I think or is it just a coincidence? I\u2019ve seen Nik do that gesture before but assumed he was  just copying  the video and didn\u2019t really understand the concept. \n \u201cSweetie, do you want to  share  the toy with Mommy? Is that what you want? You want to play with Mommy?\u201d  Nik emphatically begins to pat his palm against his chest \u2014his universal sign for  \u201cYes, please. I  really  want it.\u201d  How could I possibly resist such an entreaty? Picking the toy up from its high perch, I carry it to the sofa and ask Nik to join me.

{"date": "May 28, 2008 ", "body": "Too tired for fluid and coherent prose tonight.  Things are good.  Nik\u2019s recent blood tests all came back \u201cnormal\u201d and his CT scan is on June 9th. We\u2019ve been weaning him from one of his seizure meds and do see a bit of a decrease in the  painful episodes . We\u2019re starting to wonder if the ear stuff (flicking, swelling, shaking his head, disturbed equilibrium) is completely unrelated to what seemed to be cluster headaches. They both started up around the same time (well over a year and half ago) but the headache-like activity increased shortly after we added this particular med \u2014which, ironically, is also used for treating severe headaches, too! Interesting to note, too, is that Nik\u2019s need for a midday nap also seems to have diminished as we\u2019ve reduced his morning dose of this med. In fact, for nearly a week now, we\u2019ve cut out his afternoon nap and Nik has fallen asleep pretty quickly each night and made it through most nights without so much as a peep!  He\u2019s been sleeping roughly eleven hours straight! We\u2019ve also noticed  another  uptick in Nik\u2019s communication skills/language acquisition. Just this weekend, he started to use  two  signs together when requesting something  \u2014\u201copen please\u201d  or  \u201cmore please\u201d  being the most common. He\u2019s still crying, screaming, or head-banging to get our attention if we are not within his line of sight; once he knows we can see him, Nik reverts to trying to sign. Not perfect but a marked improvement. Speaking of improvement\u2026Nik\u2019s  communication devices  have finally arrived! It felt like Christmas when I picked them up today. And, finally \u2014well, not  really  but I\u2019ll save the rest of it for another post \u2014Nik took his first  voluntary  bite of a pretzel stick today! It scared him a bit and he wouldn\u2019t try it again but he did let Miss M continue to tap it against his back teeth. Progress. Well, I\u2019ve run out of mental steam \u2014Nik had me up at  o\u2019dark-hundred hours  this morning to change a stinky diaper and pajamas. The little fink went back to sleep right after I left for the gym. Ah well, it builds character, right?

{"date": "May 24, 2008 ", "body": "Imagine; your five year old comes home from kindergarten one day, utterly devastated. He never wants to go back. You wonder what could possibly have upset him so. He\u2019s a quirky, cute, smart little guy with a heart of gold. Sure, he\u2019s got some challenges; what five-year old  doesn \u2019t? Okay, he\u2019s being evaluated by school as possibly being autistic; but they know that so it can\u2019t be a school issue, right? Something must have happened with a kid on the playground. Yeah, that\u2019s it. Better check with his  teacher . This  is what happened to five year old Alex Barton of Port St. Lucie, Florida: Melissa Barton said she is considering legal action after her son\u2019s kindergarten teacher led his classmates to vote him out of class. \n After each classmate was allowed to say what they didn\u2019t like about Barton\u2019s 5-year-old son, Alex, his  Morningside  Elementary teacher Wendy  Portillo  said they were going to take a vote, Barton said. \n By a 14 to 2 margin, the students voted Alex \u2014 who is in the process of being diagnosed with autism \u2014 out of the class. \n Melissa Barton filed a complaint with  Morningside\u2019s  school resource officer, who investigated the matter, Port St. Lucie Department spokeswoman Michelle Steele said. But the state attorney\u2019s office concluded the matter did not meet the criteria for emotional child abuse, so no criminal charges will be filed, Steele said. \n Port St. Lucie Police no longer are investigating, but police officials are documenting the complaint, she said. Steele said the teacher confirmed the incident took place. \n When I read this story, I was utterly horrified. Yes, it is a blatant act of discrimination against a child who is  potentially  classified as \u201cdisabled\u201d and who should be protected by numerous federal laws against discrimination. But this incident goes so far beyond just autism or disability rights that it\u2019s mind-boggling; I\u2019m not even sure where to start to express my thoughts and feelings. First of all, what the hell was this teacher thinking in facilitating such a disgusting show of immature and exclusionary behavior? That the very person who is charged with educating young children and who should be modeling some fairly core, fundamental principals of human behavior \u2014of which acceptance of each others\u2019 differences and learning how to get along with those who may not be \u201cjust like us\u201d should be paramount\u2014 should be the driving force behind such bullying leaves me outraged. Frankly, autism is not even the issue here. I would feel the same outrage if this happened in  any  class or among any age group. Children are cruel enough to one another when left to their own devices; what could possibly motivate an adult to encourage such thinking, let alone acting on it? I simply don\u2019t understand. Before someone gets all righteous on me and slams me with the \u201cdisruptive behavior\u201d card, let me be perfectly clear.  I don\u2019t know Alex Barton; all I know is what I read in some news articles.  The child has some alleged behavior issues which, from the sound of it, have been disruptive in school.  Do I think the teacher should simply turn a blind eye and roll over on this issue?  No, but public humiliation and a class lesson in Bullying 101 is not the answer. It\u2019s been indicated that he is being evaluated for  Aspergers  and may be eligible for an  IEP .  No matter what, it seems to me this goes beyond a mere lack of resources or training necessary to cope with challenging behaviors in the classroom and the teacher should be held accountable for her actions in  some  fashion. Other  bloggers  are covering this story as well. I don\u2019t have a full listing but you can check for yourself at the  Autism Hub  where you will find a phenomenal collection of voices from parents, professionals, and most importantly, autistic adults.) The first posts I saw were from  Amanda  and  Bev .  Bev \u2019s post  includes contact information for the school officials so you can let your voice be heard. An interesting point of information to note here is that  Florida  is one of only a handful of states given a stellar rating by  this watchdog organization  for its recently enacted anti-bullying legislation. Unfortunately, it  doesn \u2019t go into effect until December 1, 2008. Perhaps the teacher thought she\u2019d better get her licks in while she still could? If you live in  a state with no anti-bullying laws , you might want to contact your state legislators and urge them to draft and pass one. Your kid could be the next one voted off the island\u2026 The opinions are flying on this one, folks. Some people actually think this teacher did a  good  thing. (Go  here  to read comments on the news article.) Lest my point be lost on you, I do not agree. What do you think? How would you feel if it were your child?

My dad sat next to me, his tuxedoed legs hidden beneath the voluminous folds of my dress. I fidgeted, my gloved hands in my lap, nestled in a thick swath of tulle and hand appliqu\u00e9d lace; my  something old  and  something borrowed  in the form of my eldest sister\u2019s wedding veil \u2014 made with so much love by my mother nearly twenty years before. Daddy gently laid his hand across mine; I noticed, not for the first time, the slight spots wrought by time and age. There was a strength and sureness in his touch \u2014his years of surgical training, I suppose\u2014 but there was a gentle tenderness I had not felt since I was a small child. Though I wasn\u2019t troubled, I felt soothed by the contact.\n \n \u201cYou know, Sweetie, you don\u2019t have to go through with it if you\u2019re at all uncertain.\u201d  His voice wavered just a fraction as he continued,  \u201cI just want you to be happy \u2014to make sure you want this.\u201d  My throat ached with unshed tears at his tenderness, his protectiveness. I knew that this step was just as fraught with emotion for him as it was for me. Number three \u2014his littlest girl, the one most like her mother. Letting go felt bittersweet, I\u2019m sure. \u201cYes, Daddy, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ve never been more certain of anything in my life.\u201d He gently squeezed my hand and then rapped on the glass. The door opened with a slight rush of warm, full air. I reached to touch the rosebud on his lapel; it felt like a necessary touchstone in that moment. He slid out of the limo without a word then turned \u2014his smooth, familiar hand outstretched in invitation.  \n I had a sudden flash of memory; when I was very young, he taught me to waltz. He would always begin the dance with that gesture \u2014the invitation\u2014 and he would sweep me into his arms as I balanced on the toes of his shoes.  \n I felt like the most beautiful girl in the world.\n As I got out of the limo and settled my skirts around me, Daddy turned to me and gently kissed my cheek.  \u201cHe\u2019s a fine young man; your mother and I like him very much. But if you\u2019re ever truly in need, I hope you know we\u2019re here for you, no matter what.\u201d \n Little did he know I would take him up on that\u2026for babysitting! \n Happy Anniversary to my wonderful husband, Niksdad.

Niksdad and I actually got to go on a date on Friday night \u2014candles, wine, good food, and a drive in the country to reminisce about the wedding night we spent in  this  quaint little bed and breakfast. It was really wonderful to reconnect and relax. Of course, we  did  talk about Nik\u2019s  CT scan  results \u2014a lot. But we had a lovely time. I think it was the first time we\u2019ve been out for a nice dinner (and without Nik!) since before Nik came home from the hospital. Hmmm\u2026I think we need to get out a bit more, don\u2019t you? Family.  In my family, the span from Mother\u2019s Day through the Fourth of July is  insane . In addition to the Mother\u2019s Day/Father\u2019s Day/Independence Day celebrations, we have  eight  birthdays and  four  anniversaries. So, this past Sunday we got together at my sister\u2019s for a family barbecue and pool party. This year, to add to the excitement, we also celebrated  Niksdad\u2019s passing his LPN board exam , my eldest niece landing a great internship she\u2019s been hoping for (in the music/recording industry), and my sister\u2019s engagement! It\u2019s her second time around; we all really,  really  like the guy she\u2019s marrying. I especially like him because he adores Nik and makes sincere efforts to meet him where he is. He doesn\u2019t ever ask stupid or insensitive questions and he\u2019s always willing to lend a hand watching Nik so we can eat, swim, or whatever it is that everyone else is doing that we usually sit on the sidelines. He\u2019s a great guy and I\u2019m very happy for my sister. Changing Insurance for Nik.  Hey, this is a biggie! We changed managed care organizations (MCO) through Medicaid and have recently discovered some pretty nifty perks. Our pediatrician is apparently rated as a  \u201cgold star provider\u201d  which means that any referrals written by her do not require any authorization. That\u2019s right \u2014 NONE . So those prescribed twice weekly PT and OT sessions which the previous MCO denied on the basis of  \u201cNik should be in school so school would be providing these services\u201d  (never mind they\u2019ve been deemed medically necessary and truly are)? Covered without a blink of an eye. We start our new schedule with Miss D and Miss T in just a couple weeks and we are all so excited to see how Nik blossoms even more as he gains new skills. Nik is thriving and happy again at PT/OT.  Don\u2019t know what the turning point was but Nik has now decided he loves PT and OT again.  No more tears.  In fact, yesterday we couldn\u2019t get him to leave! He actually ran away from me when I told him it was  \u201ctime to go zoom-zoom home.\u201d  He\u2019s been so much more engaged and lively; he\u2019s really been  seeking  interaction with people so much more lately. Our visit to the ENT today.  You know, sometimes we get so accustomed to all the weird, unusual things that go on with Nik (well, okay, in our defense his history  is  pretty chequered!) that we tend to see bogey men everywhere we turn. And, given the questions we\u2019ve been asking for a year now about Nik\u2019s head pains and ear problems, it was a natural leap to make when  Dr. Mary called on Friday afternoon.  But this time, it really  isn\u2019t  a big deal after all.  Normal, ordinary childhood ear stuff. Turns out that none of us knew Nik\u2019s myringotomy tube in his left ear had worked its way out (which is normal) quite some time ago. Unfortunately, Nik also has a significant propensity toward fluid build up in his left ear. And his adenoids. In other words, as the doctor put it today,  \u201cIf you do a scan on a kid with a snotty nose, stuffy sinuses, and fluid in his ears, you can get a scary looking scan. But you have to look at the clinical presentation, too.\u201d  No signs of infection \u2014whew! But then, we kind of already  knew  there was no infection. So we\u2019ve discontinued the nasty antibiotic. Not a moment too soon, either, since it\u2019s begun having awful gastric side effects after just a couple of days! But we  are  looking at surgery to put in new tubes and to remove Nik\u2019s adenoid. It\u2019s not a guarantee that Nik won\u2019t have pain or ear infections \u2014there is so much surrounding the ear that it\u2019s possible the pain is actually referred from somewhere else \u2014but it will most likely  minimize  the snotty sinuses and will help with Eustachian tube function so the fluid shouldn\u2019t build up so much. It\u2019s not a magic answer \u2014we didn\u2019t expect one\u2014 but it does give us a measure of comfort we didn\u2019t have before. Niksdad and I agree;  we would rather have this surgery than put Nik on yet another medication which has significant long-term repercussions and side effects. And, frankly, since we\u2019ve decreased his daily Depakene level by a third, we\u2019ve seen such a tremendous shift in Nik\u2019s attention span and level of interest/engagement that we are loath to give him something which might dull his senses again. We really enjoy the little boy that is starting to emerge and can\u2019t wait to see how he does as he begins to feel better. As for all this celebrating? I feel a bit rusty at it but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get the hang of it again.

This invitation to participate in her latest endeavor reawakens a part of me which has lain dormant for so long. It was once a vital part of me but it is not now an integral part of my daily life. It has been, until now, a memory of a dream \u2014a fragment of me in the distant past. The door has been closed, locked, and the key buried deep somewhere. My seventeen year old niece is a fledgling singer-songwriter.  (Click  here  to listen to a sample; I am not on this recording. You may need to turn up the volume to hear clearly.)  She\u2019s gotten some  very  positive feedback from professionals and is currently working on her first studio CD. She\u2019s also doing her first gig as a headliner in a summer music series of free concerts on the green in the historic section of our town. Her style is in the vein of indie folk pop. I am incredibly proud of her \u2014and, I confess, a  tad  envious. I joke and tease her, telling her she is living my dream;  the dream I was too afraid to pursue. For some reason, she has decided that her decrepit old auntie has some sort of wisdom to impart and talent to add to her bag of tricks. When she asked me to give feedback and help with some of her arrangements I was touched, flattered really. When she asked me to help her in the recording studio I was thrilled; the experience was a trip down memory lane. When she asked me to perform with her in her concert \u2014so what if it was only for one song \u2014I felt reborn. Rehearsing with her (very young!) band has stirred memories and kindled thoughts. [Unfortunately, the concert got rained out Thursday night; it\u2019s been rescheduled for next Saturday.] When I left NYC all those years ago, I thought I had to put away the dream and grow up, be responsible. And I did a really good job of convincing myself that it was all  \u201cpart of my youthful fantasy.\u201d  Niksdad and I got married; we worked hard and saved money, bought a house, and began living the American Dream. I always figured I\u2019d become active in the community theater scene at some point. Then, along came Nik and all thoughts of returning to performing were shoved aside for good. My son needed me and, frankly, I could barely pull myself together in those early days. Even now, it just isn\u2019t  practical ; I\u2019m a SAHM to a child with multiple special needs and my husband is going to nursing school \u2014trying to build a new, more secure life for us. I had thought I would patiently wait my turn until Niksdad finished not just his RN but also his MSN and his  CRNA . I thought I\u2019d wait until Nik was back in school and on a more regular schedule before I even thought about music and theater again. Evan\u2019s death  struck a chord so resonant inside of me; it shook me to the core of my being. For the first weeks and days afterward, I felt guilty for voicing the thoughts, the fears which arose each time my son spiked a high fever of unknown origin or when he played much more quietly than is his usual mode. I found myself jumping at bogey men in the dark \u2013the dark of night, the dark of my thoughts. Recently, I had a long, heartfelt conversation with  Vicki . We talked about many things including \u2014especially \u2014about Evan. One of the things we talked about which has stayed with me is the certainty that we must live our lives with no regrets. Neither for our children nor for ourselves. I think about this as it applies to so many things in my life. I spend my days helping my son to achieve  his  potential but what kind of example am I really giving him to follow? I don\u2019t want him to learn to sublimate all his dreams and desires because of handicaps \u2014either real or perceived. The world will throw enough road blocks in his path; it\u2019s up to me to teach him to forge ahead even when it looks and feels difficult.  He  taught me that simply through his  being ; I am  obliged  to live my life as a reminder for him. I\u2019ve always fantasized about forming a small combo and performing jazz and standards; though my training is operatic, my love is definitely cabaret. For so long, I\u2019ve listened to my inner critic \u2014the one which tells me  I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not good enough, it\u2019ll never work, my family needs me . But, maybe it\u2019s time I pull my voice out of mothballs and give it a good workout. Spend this year getting my chops back and start looking for musicians to jam with \u2014even if it\u2019s only once a month. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to look like but if I don\u2019t at least try,  I\u2019ll regret it . And  that  would be a waste.

{"date": "June 25, 2008 ", "body": "\n It\u2019s amazing how quickly things can turn around here; One day  we\u2019re up , the next  we\u2019re down  and then  we bounce right back up  again! It seems that my recent weeks-long bout of sluggish energy and really poor concentration\u2014 to the point that I have felt the need to nap after working out and couldn\u2019t remember what I\u2019d said or done mere hours before\u2014 and a few other symptoms, including the muscle cramps and  migraines  I had at the end of last week, may have been the result of a fairly significant potassium deficiency. With my efforts to lose weight (pretty much at a standstill right now) and my working out quite vigorously, it seems I don\u2019t consume enough potassium in the normal course of my day to sustain the amount I actually sweat out of my body.\n Good thing  my husband, the LPN , is such a smart guy! He caught it and bought some potassium supplements yesterday. After taking a few doses throughout the course of the day, most of my symptoms cleared up by mid afternoon. By this morning I felt more \u201cnormal\u201d than I have felt in a few weeks! I even had a great workout and felt completely revitalized afterward. Wow. Now I know the signs to watch out for \u2014and what to do, too! \n ************************************************************************************* \n As I\u2019ve  mentioned a time or two , Nik has become enamored of  Signing Time  videos. The progress he has made in the short time we\u2019ve been watching them is, to me, nothing short of amazing. (Don\u2019t believe me? See  here ,  here , or  here !) Lately, Nik has been making such clear efforts to communicate \u2014 including asking for help \u2014 and having fewer and fewer instances of extreme frustration which lead to potentially self-injurious behaviors. Of course, I\u2019ve learned many more signs than Nik but he watches and takes it all in \u2014even if he cannot replicate the signs he sees. We\u2019re learning how to adapt and helping Nik find ways to make choices and needs or wants known; whenever possible, I ask him to  \u201cuse your words\u201d  or  \u201cshow me your words\u201d  as I model them for him. \n We\u2019ve progressed to auditory and visual scanning in many cases, too! When I know what Nik wants, I will play a game with him and present\u2014 with  both  words and signs\u2014a variety of choices including the one I know he wants. When I get to the one he wants, Nik will often sign  \u201cplease.\u201d  Then I will say  \u201cOh, you want Mommy to open the box?\u201d  for example.  \u201cCan you use your words? Can you show Mommy how you say open?\u201d  All the while I am showing him the sign so he can imitate me. When he has shown me the sign for what he wants, I ask Nik to use his  \u201cnice words.\u201d  [One of the ST videos has a great song about  Please, Share, Your Turn, My Turn,  and  Thank You. ] He almost always signs \u201c please\u201d  or \u201c thank you !\u201d  \n \n Much to my surprise and delight, Nik has recently begun  imitating the   intonation  of certain words. When I am expecting to see him signing something, lately Nik has instead been making the tonal sounds of the word as he simultaneously signs  \u201cplease.\u201d  I\u2019m still getting used to the idea that I have to listen more closely to the specific sounds he is making and put them in the right context.\n The layering of language in the videos is so effective; the music and printed words, the singing, the video modeling by both adults and children \u2014of all walks of life and abilities, is so powerful that I often find Nik gesticulating wildly in an effort to try to communicate! He knows he is \u201csigning\u201d in his own way. I must confess; it\u2019s adorable to see though it\u2019s not always easy to interpret!  \n \n I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that these videos have changed our lives significantly. I\u2019ve also not made any mystery of my desire to own the series but they are not cheap!\n ************************************************************************************* \n Back in May, I filled in at the last minute for a parent-presenter at a conference which focused on how to build successful relationships with and work with practitioners \u2014primarily educators, therapists, and medical professionals\u2014 to advocate for causes relating to our children with special needs. It was an honor to have been asked and I wasn\u2019t sure what I had to contribute; the professional I was partnered with had things well in hand. But, I willingly stepped up and served where I was needed. It was a tremendously enlightening and fulfilling day; I was surprised to find out\u2014 after the fact\u2014 that I was to receive a stipend! My past experience with stipends for this sort of work has been that it\u2019s really a small amount which might cover the cots of gas. Imagine my surprise last week when I received a fairly sizable check in the mail! \n I\u2019m not talking about a  buy-a-new-wardrobe  kind of check but something in the neighborhood of a  buy-a couple-of-nice-outfits  check. \n I finally decided to buy  this ; it arrived today! I threw in a copy of  this , too; it makes me weepy and emotional sometimes!

Tomorrow afternoon I am embarking upon a solo journey to visit one of my oldest, dearest friends for a couple of days.  She will soon be moving to Switzerland to join her husband who has already moved for a new job.  It is our last chance to spend time together before Niksdad starts school soon. I\u2019m not going far \u2014just north of NYC \u2014yet I feel like I might as well be traveling to Mars.  I have only been away from Nik once since he came home from the hospital and that was a cross-country house hunting trip over Easter weekend in 2005.  But this trip feels different in so many ways. Nik is older and so much more aware of what goes on around him.  He\u2019s also going through a significant period of clinging to me and of needing me in the middle of the night.  I know the time away will be good for all of us.  Niksdad and Nik need the time to develop new ways of being with one another beyond just being pals at play; I need the time away to just  be  with my friend \u2014and maybe even get some much-needed sleep! Still, I worry because Nik doesn\u2019t yet understand visual calendars and schedules and he definitely doesn\u2019t understand the concept of time.  I am always here for him, with him \u2014ungrudging and without fail.  How will he handle my not being there when he cries out in the middle of the night?  Will he miss my singing along with Signing Time or Mary Poppins?  Niksdad, God bless him, can\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket. Even worse, how will  I  handle not seeing his impish little face for two days?  Will I survive not hearing his laughter or feeling his gentle kisses as he tries to bribe me into doing or giving him something he wants?  Will my hands know what to do without his delicate face to cradle in the middle of the night? It\u2019s going to be a looooong stretch between tomorrow afternoon and Wednesday night when I get home.

There have been many, many times I wondered if he would be dependent on a wheelchair or walker.

I worried whether his inability to walk would hamper his self esteem or put him in a position of feeling less than equal with those who walk and move about unencumbered.

{"date": "August 25, 2008 ", "body": "So\u2026  the concert  was Saturday.  It went fairly well; it was my niece\u2019s first concert and there were lots of small things that could have been done differently or maybe better but it\u2019s all a learning curve.  The song I was singing in was the finale; it went well \u2014if you don\u2019t count the fact that  my microphone didn\u2019t work  so no one heard me! My parents were quite disappointed but I look at it this way \u2014it wasn\u2019t  my  moment.  In my mind and in my heart it was about my niece, about giving her the courage and support to take flight.  Apparently, having me there to help her  did  give her some added confidence and that\u2019s all I could hope for. (Side note: Nik did incredible at the concert!  It was past his bedtime and he needed to walk for the first half hour with Daddy.  Then, he sat next to me on a lawn chair and played \u2014mostly quietly \u2014for about fifteen minutes right up to the end of the show! I was so proud of him!) I told my niece after the show that I\u2019d like to have my keyboard back; I loaned her mine about a year ago before she got her own top of the line, state of the art equipment.  My dinky old keyboard sits at her dad\u2019s house mostly unused.  But it suits my needs just fine right now; I have music in my head and my heart which I must get out before it gets crowded out with other thoughts and worries. My other niece\u2019s boyfriend plays guitar in a rock band; he approached me after the show to tell me he was sorry the mic went out and that he wants to try to start a country-rock band.  We might try to get together this fall to jam a bit.  And another of my niece\u2019s friends has \u201colder\u201d relatives who already play in a jazz combo and want to move to Delaware.  Who knows what might happen down the road. It\u2019s a funny thing when you put stuff out to the universe \u2014creating an opening for possibilities; opportunities start to pop up pretty fast and you need to decide if you\u2019re full of shit or if you\u2019re ready to take a leap.  It\u2019s no accident that, today in Nik\u2019s OT session, Miss D mentioned the local community theatre group she volunteers with.  She said they have selected  Rogers and Hammerstein\u2019s Cinderella  (one of my all time favorites!) for their autumn show for 2009.  (Wow, talk about your advance planning!)  I figure that gives Niksdad time to finish his RN and start working full time, time for me to get my voice in top shape, and time to figure out the childcare situation, yes? I got a sweet email today from  JoyMama   asking about the concert. (See, J, you inspired a post!)  In her email she asked me,  \u201cWhat happens to a  dream deferred \u2026 when you pick it up again for another look?\u201d A dream deferred and then revisited? Hmmm\u2026 it definitely  looks   different .  Not as big and sparkly as the original but, perhaps, more satisfying for the possibilities?

I couldn\u2019t help myself; I was awash in nostalgia.  I was filled with memories of the good times I had as a single gal living in NYC  oh-so-many years ago .  Memories of friends and relationships, adventures and mishaps, dreams chased and dreams set aside \u2014all were embodied and brought back to life as I glimpsed familiar sites along the way. \n I  thought  I was homesick for those long ago days \u2014that a piece of me was missing \u2014but, the truth is, I really am not; I\u2019m not the same woman I was back then. \n My life has taken me in such a different direction than I ever could have imagined.  I didn\u2019t accomplish many of the things I thought I would when I set out for California; I didn\u2019t start my arts camp for kids with special needs and I didn\u2019t make my fortune in the internet start-ups or high tech companies I thought would be my ticket to a better life.

Truth be told, he\u2019s a better housekeeper than I \u2014though he never makes me wrong for it; we both recognize that we have different strengths and we use them accordingly when possible.  I should go away more often; the floors were vacuumed, the carpets steamed, the bathroom cleaned to a shine, and the laundry was done.  I breathed a deep sigh of relief and contentment; I wept tears of appreciation mingled with my sadness and frustration over my visit with my friend.\n The story is not mine to tell and I\u2019m not sure I can even wrap my brain around it enough to convey more than the barest essence anyway.  Suffice to say, my trip was an eye opening journey which was at once painful and liberating.  Painful to see how people may or may not handle the adversities thrown in their life path \u2014the roads taken and choices made which lead each of us to our current place on the map.  Painful to watch dreams die and spirits wither from inflexibility.  Liberating in the knowledge that there absolutely is choice in each situation and that strength lies in embracing the choices and making them work for us.  Liberating in the knowledge that one of the biggest choices we can make is our attitude; the choice to either be vanquished or victor, diminished or augmented, to be resentful or resourceful \u2014hopeless or hopeful \u2014is one we can choose anew each and every day. \n Hope\u201d is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all \n ~Emily Dickinson ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/08/22/dreams-deferred/", "title": "Dreams Deferred"},

{"date": "July 28, 2008 ", "body": "I still struggle to find the words not only to describe but to  comprehend  the  unspeakable loss of Evan Kamida.  I first \u201cmet\u201d his mother,  Vicki Forman , just over a year ago when I found her essay,  The Mother at the Swings , through  Mom-NOS ; it was Vicki\u2019s first essay at  Literary Mama.  Her words struck a chord with me and I wanted to find out more; I was instantly drawn into the stories she shared of her family and, especially, her beautiful son, Evan.\n Vicki\u2019s story touched me on so many levels; some of the parallels between our sons\u2019 situations made me feel an instant kinship with her and a deep, abiding affection and admiration for Evan. Like my own son, Evan overcame some incredible odds to share his spirit with the world. \n I found myself often looking to Vicki and Evan for some insights about how to handle something with my own son. Sometimes, I simply turned to them for inspiration when things seemed tough. With each post, each email exchange with Vicki, or each beautifully crafted column she would write for Literary Mama \u2014I became enthralled. I felt a closeness to Vicki \u2014we have some commonalities in our past, but I fell in love with her beautiful boy. \n Each day, thanks to Vicki and Evan, I try in some small way to remember that the \u201cother\u201d moms \u2014the ones who may be watching in the grocery line as my son begins to bark like a puppy and clap his feet in a rhythm opposite from his hands \u2014may not be judging us.

{"date": "February 16, 2008 ", "body": "Before I get too mired in angst and agita \u2014engendered by Nik\u2019s  recent surge  in those  mysterious episodes of pain \u2014 I\u2019d better take a moment to acknowledge a couple of recent awards I was given. Oh, yes, and to pass them on, too! Joey\u2019s mom, over at  Life with Joey , was the very first \u2014and highly deserving\u2014 recipient of  this wonderful award . It honors the recipient\u2019s ability to  \u201csee the beauty within.\u201d  It was created especially for her by her pal,  Monkeygirl . There are no strings attached, no meme, and no rules.  Just pass it on to whomever you wish.  I like that! I am flattered that she chose me for this. I do strive to find the good within a tough situation, the redeeming qualities in a not-so-lovable or slightly-prickly person. I like to believe in the inherent goodness of humanity \u2014despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary as I look around the world today. But it isn\u2019t always easy \u2014and, being  utterly  human, I often fail. I believe I have this capacity for seeing the beauty within largely due to my having Nikolas in my life. Sure, I was an idealistic youth. I wore my heart on my sleeve and often got it a bit battered and bruised, but I kept on believing in people. At some point, as I grew older and, I thought, wiser, I became jaded; I\u2019d been burned enough by people I loved and trusted that I didn\u2019t even believe in  myself  anymore. Now, I\u2019m not saying that Nik is single-handedly responsible for turning that around and rekindling my faith in humanity. No, I get to take a great deal of credit for all the \u201cself-growth\u201d type of work I did in my twenties and thirties. But Nik? Nik gives me a  reason  to believe anew each and every day even when \u2014especially when\u2014 I don\u2019t want to; when I am feeling guarded in my spirit and my heart, Nik strips away the walls and pulls me out into the light. He shows me the good. The beauty. I\u2019d like to bestow this on my friend Kristen, who authors  From Here to There and Back . Kristen truly does look for the good in everything. She still believes that people want to do the right thing and that good will triumph over bad. In this crazy, mixed up world I\u2019d say those are some pretty great qualities worth celebrating! And, Karen, of  Beyond Understanding , who lives her life as an example of constant striving to find the beauty and the good. I admire her sense of purpose and her willingness to live it each and every day. It takes a rare and special spirit to do that. ********************************************************************************* Still more love and goodwill flowing through the blogosphere this week! I received  this excellent  award  from  Casdok . I take that as high praise indeed as I think she writes such compelling and thought provoking posts \u2014and almost always with a touch of whimsy and humor. Casdok\u2019s style is such that she encourages you to take the subject at hand seriously without taking yourself too seriously. It\u2019s a difficult balance to strike and she does it with grace and apparent ease. Thanks for the tip of the hat, m\u2019dear! I\u2019m going to share this one with Susan over at  The Family Room . I feel a real affinity for her. I like her style and I like what she has to say. Of course, the fact that she thinks so highly of Nik and  thinks our sons are somewhat similar  doesn\u2019t hurt either! Kyra, aka  This Mom , is another writer I respect and admire. Her blog is a funky, eclectic mix of musings on life raising her autistic son, home schooling, writing, and of living life large and without reservations. I love this blogging world, I really do!

Thank you, everyone, for your prayers, good wishes, and healing energies put forth on Nik\u2019s behalf.\n   The O.R. was backed up and running an hour late. Nik was dopey on his seizure meds and an empty stomach; he ended up tripping on  air  something or other. Gave himself a huge goose egg on his forehead and lots of tears ensued.

I\u2019m not sure why that kind of freaked me out a bit but it did.

He\u2019s dopey and exhausted but unable to sleep more than 15-20 minutes at a time before he wakes up screaming and disoriented. I\u2019m anxious about the red flush he has all over but the hospital staff told us it was most likely from the narcotics; Niksdad said the same thing but I\u2019m still watching Nik like a  protective mama hawk ! \n I have no reason to think anything will go awry tonight but I am not ashamed to confess that I will be much happier \u2014more at ease \u2014 once my rough and tumble little guy is back to his old self! \n Meanwhile\u2026here\u2019s my Wordless Wednesday contribution.

{"date": "February 16, 2008 ", "body": "Another day has almost come and gone Can\u2019t imagine what else could go wrong Sometimes I\u2019d like to hide away somewhere and lock the door A single battle lost but not the war. Cause, Tomorrow\u2019s another day And I\u2019m thirsty anyway So bring on the rain It\u2019s almost like the hard times circle \u2019round A couple drops and they all start coming down Yeah, I might feel defeated, I might hang my head I might be barely breathing \u2013 but I\u2019m not dead, no Cause Tomorrow\u2019s another day And I\u2019m thirsty anyway So bring on the rain I\u2019m not gonna let it get me down I\u2019m not gonna cry And I\u2019m not gonna lose any sleep tonight Cause Tomorrow\u2019s another day And I am not afraid So bring on the rain Tomorrow\u2019s another day And I\u2019m thirsty anyway So bring on the rain (Bring On the Rain ~ Billy Montana/Helen Darling,  recorded by Jo Dee Messina w/Tim McGraw ) I was  afraid  it was too good to be true. Alas, it seems maybe I was right this time. Trust me;  I\u2019d rather be wrong on this one. Nik\u2019s  pain episodes  have begun a new cycle over the last few days. We hit a really smooth, quiet patch for several consecutive weeks and I let myself get lulled into a false sense of victory over this nemesis. I thought, perhaps, we had hit upon a magic answer with the shift in Nik\u2019s feeding schedule and that the pain may be driven by hypoglycemia. That may all still be true.  However\u2026 A few days ago Nik had a sudden  drop seizure . Fortunately, he was sitting on the floor when it happened and Niksdad was right there to keep his face from slamming into the playroom floor. It was brief and we haven\u2019t seen it since. But we have seen a bit of an  increase  in his  absence seizures  (also called  petit mal  seizures) since then. We\u2019ve also noted some other changes in Nik\u2019s overall behavior and patterns/routines. Nik gave up napping back in December; every day I put him in his crib for some quiet pay time for him \u2014and some sanity for me. Lately, however, Nik has not only been sleeping but he\u2019s been tough to wake as well. Something else I\u2019ve noticed is that the episodes seem to start less suddenly and then, as the days go by, they ramp up in frequency and intensity \u2014just as they did many, many months ago. Nik\u2019s squinting and banging his head, flicking at his ears again\u2014 none of which he\u2019s done in the past two months.  Nik also seems to be more sensitive to visual overload; he\u2019s even begun to scream and cry in a certain part of his beloved  Mary Poppins  \u2014a part which used to make him laugh and clap. As soon as I forward through that part he recovers quickly. The difficult part of it is the uncertainty about what sorts of once-loved things will now become triggers for intense physical pain for Nik. And the sleep?  I guess it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019ve stockpiled some extra sleep these past few weeks \u2014and that I am finally getting to work out a bit more regularly. (Thanks, Mom!) Nik\u2019s generally been sleeping roughly twelve hours a night,  uninterrupted ; lately, though, he\u2019s been waking or at least crying out quite violently several times a night. In addition, the head banging on the side of the crib is picking up again; I hear more and more with each passing night. Nik\u2019s also running hot and cold \u2014literally \u2014with intermittent low fever and cold extremities. All of this brings with it some difficult behavioral challenges, as well. Nik\u2019s ability to cope with frustration and disappointment is nearly non-existent and he has been extremely rigid in his perseverations \u2014particularly his obsession with doors. He\u2019s also been biting his hands so much that they are constantly raw and red. It feels, in some moments anyway, like we are backsliding. I know that no one\u2019s growth and progress is ever strictly linear; I also know that sometimes there is some regression \u2014or the appearance of regression \u2014preceding a large developmental spurt.  I hope that is the case here. Am I looking for the sliver lining in this dark storm cloud which keeps blowing onto the horizon? Perhaps. It certainly seems like Nik is making some marked progress in many areas lately. He\u2019s showing increased interest in different textures of food and will even try putting some small bits into his mouth by himself. That is  major  progress as he usually only takes food from someone else\u2019s hand or a utensil; anything Nik picks up usually gets tossed to the floor with a laugh. He\u2019s begun touching his tummy with his fork or spoon while we are dining; he touches it right to the feeding tube, as if to say  I know that what goes in my mouth fills my tummy just like this tube does.  It is a major cognitive leap for Nik \u2014one that bodes well for the future, I hope. The eye contact, initiating play, laughing along with games we play together \u2014all of that is continuing apace. Nik is even beginning to initiate some hand gestures to simple songs and games like Pat-a-cake and Itsy Bitsy Spider. Believe me, that\u2019s monumental for him; for the longest time everything has been hand over hand. Today, we even had a  successful transition  to the  Kid Zone at the Y ; in fact, when it was time to go, Nik didn\u2019t want to leave! There are days \u2014or large parts of days \u2014when I think to myself  what\u2019s all the fuss? We\u2019ll be just fine.  And then the tornadoes \u2014the swirling vortexes of pain\u2014 hit Nik and the world as I know it gets blown to smithereens. Like tornadoes on the plains, it is difficult to predict when Nik\u2019s are going to strike or how much damage they will leave in their wake. And, yes, there are definitely days I feel like we have landed in  Oz . We go to the hospital on the 26th for a 48 hour video EEG. Just a couple of weeks ago I was wondering if it was a complete waste of time. Now, I hope Nik progresses to full-blown episodes \u2014 just for the short time we\u2019re there ; it would be great if someone else saw it happening live. I really hope this test and the observation can give us some new information and some answers. Meanwhile, I\u2019m desperately looking for ideas for small and portable things, or activities, that I can take with us to help pass the time and distract Nik from the electrodes trailing him everywhere in our very small room. Oh, and ways to disguise the doors and door handles, too! \u201cI\u2019m not gonna let it get me down\u2026\u201d But I  might  cry. And that\u2019s okay. Bring on the rain.

{"date": "February 18, 2008 ", "body": "Let me be perfectly blunt. I may do that with you, may I not? I mean, if you are here reading my blog then you have some sense of me by now, I hope. I  HATE  choosing sides. I can\u2019t help it; I\u2019m a true Libran, always striving for balance and even-handedness even in my zealous passions. I am also a  reformed journalist . My training dictates that I try to see all sides of an issue and leave my opinion out of things. Because, really, in the end, your own opinion has to matter more to you than mine, right? And so I feel about the ongoing debate about whether vaccines cause autism. If I had to come down on one side or another, I would have to say that I do not believe vaccines cause autism. Certainly, if that were the case the entire vaccinated civilization as we know it would all be autistic. Hell, maybe we are and we just don\u2019t recognize it? I mean no disrespect to anyone with my flippancy, truly. But I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the sole mitigating factor in what made  my  son autistic. I think it may, in fact, be  possible  that vaccines  and a number of other necessary interventions used during my son\u2019s early life  have all had an impact on how he perceives and functions in our environment. But I think that would be the case for any child born three months prematurely, weighing a mere nineteen ounces, and requiring multiple life-saving surgeries within the first four months of life. Vaccinated or not, that child would face significant hurdles in their young life. However, in the interest of fairness \u2014and pandering to the pull of my Libran traits \u2014I understand those people who are  convinced  that vaccines caused their child\u2019s autism. I\u2019m not saying that I think they are right; let me be very clear. What I am saying is that  I understand and respect their right and privilege to feel and think what they do. I look at this debate much like I look at religion \u2014specifically, the belief in God. Despite scientific evidence to the contrary \u2014Darwinism, Big Bang theories, etcetera\u2014millions of people believe with all their heart and soul that God created the Universe and all its inhabitants. Me? I think it\u2019s something of a mixed bag; that science and religion are not that neatly separated despite man\u2019s fervent need to make them so. It is about  faith . Do you put your faith in science or in the things that seem to make sense even if you can\u2019t explain them or back them up with anything besides a  feeling ? It is up to the individual to decide. No matter what scientific evidence one presents to a person of deep religious faith, they will not be swayed from their stance. And vice versa. In either case, though, one\u2019s beliefs do not give them the right to force them on others. And that seems to be happening a lot right now \u2014especially from people and organizations who are utterly convinced that vaccines are the  cause  of autism. Despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary, there are those who would rather cry conspiracy and cover up than look in other directions. There are those who espouse any number of non-traditional treatments \u2014medical and otherwise\u2014 and claim to have cured their children. Maybe they  have  in their own minds. Or maybe those children weren\u2019t truly autistic but subject to something else which can mimic some autistic characteristics? I\u2019m not saying they were or weren\u2019t.  I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t know . There\u2019s not enough evidence to convince me. But their voices are loud; they want to drown out any voice that doesn\u2019t sing the same tune. Last I checked, this was still a democratic nation with freedom of speech. Whether or not you like what\u2019s being said is not necessarily as important as the fact that  you have an opportunity to hear all the messages.  So, in the interest of fair and even-handed coverage, I offer you this letter from Susan Stevens Martin of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Please read the following and then  decide for yourself  where you stand, how you feel, and what part you want to take in this ongoing issue. \u2018Cause it\u2019s not going away anytime soon, folks! *************************************************************************************** (Text of Susan Stevens Martin\u2019s letter begins here.) Hello, As part of our ongoing response to media stories regarding autism and vaccines, the AAP communications department is compiling a list of parents who support the AAP and are available for interviews. We are looking for two types of parents who could serve as spokespersons: Parents of children with autism spectrum disorders who support immunization and who do not believe there is any link between their child\u2019s vaccines and his or her autism. Parents of children who suffered a vaccine-preventable illness. This could be a parent who declined immunization, whose child became ill before a vaccine was available, or whose child was ineligible for immunization. We are asking for your help identifying parents who would be good spokespersons. They do not need to be expert public speakers. They just need to be open with their story and interested in speaking out on the issue. We will contact candidates in advance to conduct pre-interviews, to offer guidance on talking to reporters and to obtain a signed waiver giving us permission to release their name. If a parent were placed on our list, we would offer their name and contact information to select media. We hope to build a list of parents from a wide range of geographical areas. As the Jenny McCarthy and \u201cEli Stone\u201d stories illustrate, this issue is likely to recur in the national and local media. The AAP is committed to doing all we can to counter such erroneous reports with factual information supported by scientific evidence and AAP recommendations. The anti-vaccine groups often have emotional family stories on their side.

{"date": "January 11, 2008 ", "body": "Sunrise, sunset Sunrise, sunset Swiftly flow the days Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers Blossoming even as we gaze Sunrise Sunset ~ Fiddler on the Roof (Bock & Harnick) Somehow, amidst the day to day concerns \u2014school and doctors, therapy and play group, and trying to strike a balance between play and learning, enough activity and too much stimulation \u2014somehow Nik has  blossomed . Either  because  of all of the aforementioned \u2014or in spite of it\u2014 time has marched on and Nikolas has joined in the parade. I know the changes I see have not happened overnight; it\u2019s been a mostly gradual process. Still, I feel like Nik is changing so  fast  that I cannot keep up with all of the changes to record them fast enough to be able to share them or tuck them away for memories. It is both giddy and exciting and a little frustrating. I could simply write a \u201claundry list\u201d of new developments but I want to be able to  share  the feelings, the moments of pride which wash over me sometimes. They\u2019ve been so long coming, that I want to savor each moment and serve it up like home made cookies on my Nana\u2019s silver platter \u2014something to be celebrated, honored, and enjoyed in the company of friends. Nik now likes books.  Roughly 75% of the time he will now choose one of his growing  library  of books \u2014not all of them electronic, either \u2014over a loud, bright flashy toy. It  still  takes me by surprise when he does that; for so long he would only tear or bite the books, chewing them to a pulpy mess or reducing them to a pile of shredded paper. It\u2019s as if he is finding his own equilibrium and figuring out those moments when he needs a quiet break. I don\u2019t know this for a fact, but I  do  wonder. Lately, his favorite book is a very simple board book which talks when he turns the page. No lights, no music. Just a simple voice speaking simple words. Simple sentences accompanied by large, bright photographs of children with Mommy or Daddy, children with a ball, a glass of milk, waving Bye-Bye. Nik studies this book with a keen intensity I\u2019ve seldom seen him apply to  anything  without lights or moving parts. He carries the book around with him quite often; he even takes it with him on his sliding board. (Can you picture him, sliding down head first on his belly \u2014holding his beloved book open??) It\u2019s not as if he can\u2019t bear to be parted from the book; he will often carry it to me and gently shove it into my hands to tell me he is finished with it \u2014for the time being. I let Nik take one quiet toy up to nap or bedtime each day; lately, he nearly  always  chooses a book of some kind. He usually carries it himself as he holds my hand and toddles off to bed. Sometimes, after putting on his pajamas and brushing his teeth, Nik will choose this particular book as his bedtime companion. And companion it truly is; I often hear him singing and \u201ctalking\u201d to it before he drifts off to sleep. Tonight, he very tenderly picked up his favorite book and brought it to me. I took it from him, asking  \u201cIs this what you want to take to bed?\u201d  He took it back as if he didn\u2019t trust me to let him have it. I reassured him that it was okay. He paused for a moment and then gently placed his beloved book back in my hands. He reached his little hand up to mine, pulling me toward the gate, his sweet face turned up to mine with sleepy eyes, confirming that he was ready to head off to Dream Land. The book was the last thing I heard before the soft, whistling sighs of Nik falling asleep settled into the quiet.  \u201cBye-Bye. Baby waves bye-bye.\u201d  A tender smile lit my face as I dashed away a tear and felt my heart swell with love and admiration for my growing boy. Oh, and have I mentioned that Nik has taught himself something new? How to wave Bye-Bye.

{"date": "January 9, 2008 ", "body": "The purity and generosity of a child\u2019s heart can be astounding \u2014and humbling. A child\u2019s experience has not yet shaped the walls and barriers that we erect to protect us from life\u2019s insults, injuries, and injustices. Children, somehow, have an uncanny ability to see the heart of a person when they are given a chance to spend some time with them. It is evident in the way a small child will shy away from a family friend or gravitate immediately to a seldom seen relative. Their radar is highly accurate when we give them a chance to use it and listen to it. The gifts  we  can receive from this can be profound \u2014perhaps even miraculous. My in-laws arrived on Tuesday night. As I wrote in  this  post, I was filled with trepidation, anxiety, and resentment at the intrusion. The history between my MIL and me has been cordial \u2014on the surface \u2014but strained as far as I am concerned. There is a lengthy history on her part of passive-aggressive behavior \u2014toward even her own family\u2014lying, secrecy, condescension and resentment when things do not go according to her plan. On my part, there has been anger and resentment at her manipulation of her own family members, her intrusive questions about aspects of our lives which are none of her business, and \u2014the  most damning sin in my eyes  \u2014her cavalier attitude about her only grandchild, my son. My father-in-law is a man of very few words \u2014to anyone; he spends much of his retired life outside the house. I don\u2019t know if this is to avoid confrontation at home or to fuel his rabid obsession with trains \u2014all things trains. Knowing what I now know about Autism, I might venture to guess that he falls somewhere on the spectrum but I cannot say for sure. In any event, when it comes to maintaining family relationships (or not), my FIL simply goes along for whatever ride his wife directs. My FIL is cordial and affectionate enough when it comes to me; I don\u2019t think he harbors any resentment or ill-will. I do think he is simply tired of fighting in his own home so he tunes out or goes along. The net result is the same \u2014ineffectual. The last time my in-laws saw Nikolas was June of 2006; it was a few weeks before he started school. At that time Nik wasn\u2019t yet standing on his own and he wasn\u2019t doing much communicating; he was a happy little boy in his own world which, sporadically, he would open up to others. On that last visit, he wasn\u2019t terribly interested in his grandparents and, frankly, they didn\u2019t know what to do with him.  They were at a loss as to how to be with him. I understand that uncertainty may have fueled much of my MIL\u2019s misinformed and intrusive inquisitions \u2014about Nikolas and how we are raising him \u2014in the intervening months since that last visit. Perhaps, as my husband once suggested, she was afraid of what she would see when she came to visit and so she stayed away. Meanwhile, she created an alternate reality in her mind \u2014a reality which was far from what we experience with Nik and of Nik each day. In spite of our assurances that Nik really  is  making tremendous progress, I think my MIL could not bring herself to believe our words. Yet, on the other hand, she could not  bear  to see for herself if her imagined reality were to be true. My logical mind understands and appreciates the difficulty of her dilemma \u2014truly. But the proud mama, the loving wife, the woman who wants to share her bounty with the world has such a hard time  not  being angry and resentful. My son, it seems, would have it be otherwise between us. From the first moment my in-laws saw Nikolas on Tuesday morning (he was already asleep when they stopped by Monday night), my hackles were raised; I was in my full protective-mama regalia before they even walked in the door. As I sat in the loft, making notes from a conference call I had just completed, I could hear my MIL talking in a baby voice \u2014 in the third person  \u2014to Nikolas (who was in his seat having his lunchtime tube feeding),  \u201cOoh, what songs does Nikowas know?\u201d \u201cGrandma\u2019s so happy to see Nikowas!\u201d \u201cGrandma wants Nikowas to use those toofies to chew-chew-chew.\u201d  Nauseating.  Infuriating . I could hear my FIL asking Niksdad,  \u201cDoes he sit in that chair all day? Can he roll around on the floor? Can he crawl yet?\u201d  I had to wonder if they even  listened  to all those weekly phone calls from their own son, Niksdad, telling them about all of Nik\u2019s milestones and progress. Did they even  look  at the pictures we\u2019ve sent on a regular basis? To say that I could feel the visit rapidly sliding downhill would be an understatement \u2014a  gross  understatement. Yet, somehow, after a crappy partial day in which Grandma cooed and talked baby talk between bouts of grilling us about  \u201cWill he ever\u2026\u201d  or  \u201cDo you think he can\u2026\u201d  and  \u201cHave you tried\u2026\u201d  and a near family meltdown over a miscommunication \u2014in which no one was blameless \u2014we managed to go out for a nice meal together to celebrate Niskdad\u2019s birthday (which is today). I was so upset that I really didn\u2019t want to go but I love my husband very much; when he told me it would mean a lot to him if I went \u2014that it wouldn\u2019t feel like a celebration without me \u2014a swallowed the lump in my throat and went anyway. I don\u2019t regret the decision. Somehow, in the intervening hours between the cloying baby talk and having my buttons pressed, my in-laws found their equilibrium with Nik. The baby talk stopped \u2014well, for the most part \u2014and they really began to  engage  with him. As you can see in  these  pictures, Nik rewarded them richly for their efforts. They both expressed such surprise \u2014 tinged with grandparently pride  \u2014at all the things Nik is doing now. They marveled at his problem-solving aptitude, his laughter and music, his independence in so many things; they were bowled over by his charm.  Finally. When Grandma and Grandpa stopped by today to say their goodbyes, Nik was sound asleep (see adorable proof  here ). It gave my MIL a chance to spend some time talking with Niksdad alone. She made it clear that she didn\u2019t want to be interrupted so they went to the living room. My first reaction was that I was  miffed ; I thought she was snubbing me in my own home. Since we live in a small townhouse and my MIL wasn\u2019t making any effort to speak quietly, I eavesdropped \u2014shamelessly.  I don\u2019t regret it one iota.  In fact, I am  so  grateful that I listened; I gained tremendous insights into some of my MIL\u2019s attitudes and behavior \u2014and why she has nearly severed all ties with her siblings. The latter fact has baffled me for years and Niksdad has never been able to shed any light either. Since it is not my story to tell, suffice to say the story my MIL told left me stunned and horrified \u2014 and feeling much compassion for her as a woman.  I know it doesn\u2019t change the behavior she has exhibited through the years, but all of a sudden I felt like I had been looking at her like one of those Rorschach ink blots and only seeing one thing. What I overheard today gave me a different picture and made me pause to think about her actions and attitudes more as her defense mechanism. Much like I often do with my own son, I had to put her behavior into a different context than the norm I expect in most relationships. When Nik awoke, he was  ecstatic  to see his Grandma and came right over to climb up on her lap to play. I watched them laughing \u2014both of them chortling with glee \u2014as they had their little love fest. Nik\u2019s Grandpa even joined in \u2014in his own stoic way. I took lots of pictures and was struck with awe at the  unfettered love and joy I saw through the lens.  The  tenderness  with which Grandpa stroked Nik\u2019s cheek reminded me of my own husband; a man of few words most times, he can convey so much love and tenderness with a touch or a look \u2014whether it be toward Nikolas or me \u2014and it melts my heart. I could see the family  connection  being made before my very eyes. It\u2019s been a long, long time coming. I  know  there will always be the same behaviors from my MIL but I have new knowledge \u2014a  different context  in which to see her. I also, apparently, have the world\u2019s most charismatic child \u2014a spirit capable of healing tremendous rifts in people\u2019s hearts and souls and of teaching important lessons to those who are willing to listen and learn.

{"date": "January 16, 2008 ", "body": "\n In all the many months my son spent in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) \u2014more genteelly labeled as the \u201cIntensive Care Nursery\u201d or ICN \u2014I bore silent witness to things that most people, God willing, will never have to experience except through second-hand stories or books and movies. I watched children fight seemingly insurmountable odds of survival; children born too early, too small, and too fragile to survive without incredible interventions of technology and medicine. Children with frightened parents such as myself sitting vigil for days, weeks, months on end. Many were lucky and went home with their families while others fought long arduous battles with their own bodies just for survival. Some of those same children had no one to hold them, to love them, or be proud of the deceptively small victory of making it through another night.\n I also watched as some of those same children lost their fight, became too worn and weary to go on. Twice, I witnessed the death of innocence. It all happened so fast that there was no time for me to leave the room in a show of respect for the child, the family. It didn\u2019t matter that I didn\u2019t know the families involved or that I\u2019d never held the baby. What mattered was that I felt the loss as keenly as any other person in the room. The loss of light, heart, hope \u2014potential. \n A child dying so young, dying before a parent or grandparent is not the natural order of things as we know them. Nor should it be, would it be in a perfect world. The tragic and senseless murder of Katie McCarron, at the hands of her own mother no less, strikes me as even more horrible a thing to occur than the death of a child from illness or insurmountable congenital defects. \n Having watched the most stoic and gruff of doctors weep uncontrollably at the bedside of a child they had known mere days \u2014or hours, it is inconceivable to me that Karen McCarron could have so coldly and calculatingly have murdered her own child \u2014for any reason. How could she not see the potential within her beautiful little girl? I didn\u2019t know Katie, but I know from reading the words of her grandfather, Mike, that she was a loved and loving child, a child full of energy and vitality, full of a zeal for girly things, a girl with an infectious smile. What made Karen McCarron decide that  there was no hope  for her child \u2014or for herself? What crystal ball did Karen purport to have that she could ever  possibly  predict that the challenges she thought were so awful when Katie was just a toddler of three would last a lifetime, that there was no hope? \n It is beyond my comprehension that Katie should have died  at all , but to have suffered so cruel and surely frightening a death? Reading the reports from the trial have sickened me to the point that all I can do is stand over my beautiful sleeping boy \u2014who is about the age Katie would have been now \u2014and weep. I pray in the silence of his darkened room for continued strength on the difficult days, and with gratitude for the presence of mind to walk away when I feel too overwhelmed. \n Why couldn\u2019t Karen McCarron do the same? It is too late for Katie, but it is never too late for another child. In the name of Katie, in her memory, I would ask of any parent feeling so overwhelmed that you simply walk away. Run if you must. Then call a neighbor, a friend, or the police for help.

{"date": "January 12, 2008 ", "body": "\n Eighteen months ago Nikolas was eating.  It wasn\u2019t a wide variety and it wasn\u2019t anything that involved any sort of chewing or significant oral motor effort \u2014all pureed baby foods with some rice cereal mixed in for extra calories and bulk. But he  was  eating \u2014nearly one hundred percent of what he was offered every day; this made up roughly seventy percent of his overall diet. We were excited; we thought we were on our way to losing the g-tube \u2014 in the home stretch. Then, shortly after Nik began attending school in June 2006, it all came to a screeching halt. We watched as the school OT, then the teacher, then a couple of paraprofessionals all tried different ways to get him to eat. The OT began her campaign while Nik was still eating some \u2014though the quantity was dwindling with each passing day; she was determined to teach him  \u201cthe right way\u201d  to feed himself.  \u201cGive us some time to get to know Nik,\u201d  she said.  \u201cLet us try it our way for a while and see how he does.\u201d  To me, that was the beginning of the end of Nik\u2019s eating as we then knew it.\n By September of that year, Nik was refusing absolutely  every  attempt to feed him. He was content to sit and clamp his lips together and push away the spoon or throw it if you gave it to him. He would laugh hysterically as if to say  \u201cThe joke is on you!\u201d  We went through great angst over this new development. We saw a behavioral psychologist, outside speech and occupational therapists for evaluations \u2014we even went to Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to see  specialists  in the pediatric feeding and swallowing program. No one was able to figure out why Nik wouldn\u2019t eat or what to do about it. \n I had my theories but couldn\u2019t prove them \u2014that Nik had been  forced  into something at school and he rebelled. That  the total school experience was too much for him  and he couldn\u2019t pull himself together enough to eat on top of all the other demands being made of him. I knew then that Nik has significant sensory issues but no one was willing to listen. Even the \u201cbrilliant specialists\u201d at CHOP ignored our concerns over sensory issues and discounted the PDD-NOS diagnosis Nik had been given nearly a year before they saw him. Their advice was simply to  ignore  the negative behavior and it would go away. We knew instinctively that was not the answer. \n Niksdad and I were frustrated and downhearted about what the future might look like with a feeding tube as a permanent fixture in our lives. For a very long time, I held on to hope and kept trying new things on my own with Nik every once in a while; nothing seemed to help with any measure of consistency. After a while, we stopped trying \u2014we even stopped seeing the behavioral psychologist; after all, she was supposed to help us with the feeding issues and we had reached an impasse.  We surrendered to the presence of the hated feeding pump. \n It is a natural and normal part of being a mother to nurture and nourish your child. Yet, for the second time in Nik\u2019s young life,  I felt that I had failed him.  When Nik was born, so tiny and fragile, I was unable to breast feed him; he was on a ventilator and I couldn\u2019t produce enough milk. After six weeks or so of valiantly trying to express what milk I had and only getting a few ounces a day, I had to concede that I would not get to experience that critical bonding with my child. \n Now, nearly three years later, I felt that I had  again  not measured up as a mother; it was a bitter pill to swallow. \n September 2007; we took Nik out of school. We were tired and frustrated and  very  concerned that our son was retreating further and further away into his own world during the school week and taking days to recover. Every weekend \u2014and every week he was out ill from school \u2014the Nik we knew would start to emerge again only to disappear shortly after returning to school. After withdrawing Nik from school, we began to have regular individual OT, PT, and Speech therapy sessions. Bit by bit, Nik began to return to his usual happy, energetic self \u2014in spite of his ongoing health issues. By the time we started with dedicated feeding therapy twice each week, my sense of hope had returned in full. \n Nik\u2019s therapist, Miss M, is the same SLP that followed him through the early intervention program with Easter Seals; she has known Nik since  before  his second birthday and loves him like her own child. He adores her and trusts her implicitly; they have a very strong bond and affection for one another. On top of everything else, Miss M  gets  Nikolas completely. She doesn\u2019t exactly understand the autism piece, but she sees how smart Nik is and how determined he is to communicate and participate in his own ways.  She follows his lead  and she seeks my input and insights all the time. \n Nik is still not eating by mouth but he has come light years beyond where he was just three short months ago. Nik is now interested in nearly all food  except  baby food; if he  sees  a jar of baby food, he will push it away and refuse to even try it. He wants  REAL  food \u2014the food all the grown ups are eating. \n \n While Nik has not yet figured out the mechanics of chewing \u2014though he  is  accepting the chewy tubes now where he used to bite them  once  and then throw them \u2014he has the most advanced licking technique I\u2019ve ever seen. Nik can even manage holding the spoon all by himself to dip into food I offer; he taps the spoon on the edge of the plate to clear the excess, as Miss M does, then licks the underside and the bowl of the spoon. He will not accept the spoon  into  his mouth or allow it to touch his lips at this point. Yet he will lick food off my finger, and will allow us to rub foodonto his lips \u2014just no spoons! But we\u2019re working on that. \n \n Meanwhile, Nik is into all sorts of tastes and consistencies from salsa and wasabi mustard \u2014I kid you not \u2014to garlic roast leg of lamb and black bean chili. If it\u2019s on our plates Nik wants to try it. And we are willing to let him try  anything he wants . He\u2019s a big fan of his Nanny\u2019s homemade peppermint ice cream and caramel custard!\n Nik has never been big on finger foods. He used to get very upset when his hands got dirty; no surprise there to anyone whose kid has sensory issues. As Nik has gotten more exposure to a variety of things both at home and through OT, his tolerance for messy, sticky hands has improved greatly. Where once Nik would pick up a cheerio or a goldfish cracker and throw it, he now brings them to his mouth to sample. Often he will throw the first half dozen or so before he settles on one to  savor  \u2014licking, kissing, and sucking on the poor thing until it\u2019s a mushy mess. \n Nik has taken a bite or two of solid crunchy food before but it was kind of snuck in by using a thin pretzel stick in the chewy tube. The first time scared him so badly he wouldn\u2019t even touch the chewy tube for a few days. Miss M said that\u2019s normal; the sound is usually very startling. She said it sometimes takes a while after that for a child to try again.  \n \n \n She was right; just this week, Nik took his first voluntary bite \u2014 completely unprompted .\n He had been savoring one particular goldfish cracker, holding it by the head, when he gently put his teeth on the tail fins. He didn\u2019t apply any pressure; he just felt the fish between his teeth for a moment. He took it out of his mouth and looked at it with a mixture  of pride and curiosity. Going back for a second attempt, Nik applied more pressure this time and  broke off a fin in his  mouth.  Both Miss M and I held our breath as we waited for Nik to begin to gag. The gag  never  came. Nik didn\u2019t swallow the piece (which was about the size of a grain of rice) but he didn\u2019t gag; he merely worked his tongue around until the bit of cracker was forward enough for him to remove it with his fingers. Miss M and I cheered loudly. \n We haven\u2019t yet seen a repeat performance but I know it is coming \u2014Nik is  far too interested in food  not to persevere.

{"date": "January 20, 2008 ", "body": "Last night, we went to a birthday party for one of Nik\u2019s old school mates, N, who just turned seven. It was a pizza, cake and ice cream kind of party; the  first  party Nik has ever been to outside of school which didn\u2019t center on a holiday or being with extended family. We didn\u2019t know who was going to be there or what to expect; we prepared for the worst in terms of Nik\u2019s ability to handle a potentially overwhelming situation.\n Armed with a small, soothing musical toy to which Nik has lately gravitated, chewy tubes, goldfish crackers \u2014 and a ready excuse to make a hasty exit with a small boy who had not napped \u2014 we set of to explore this new horizon. While I can\u2019t say it was a perfect evening, it wasn\u2019t anywhere  near  the disaster we had prepared ourselves to face. Other than an early incident of Nik, um, \u201cwatering the floor\u201d when we changed his pull-up, there were no tantrums, no wild racing around the room in search of things to throw, no episodes of head banging. \n In fact, Nik was quite content to play with the large number of developmentally appropriate toys which belonged to N\u2019s little sister, S. Nik spent a great deal of time playing with a shape sorter (his favorite non-musical toy, I think), some small cars, blocks, and pushing around S\u2019s little shopping cart. Ever the inquisitive clown, Nik tried to get  into  the shopping cart with less than stellar results; one must give him credit for knowing when to give up the fight. \n The gathering was an eclectic mix of adults and children \u2014mostly co-workers of M\u2019s husband, who is in the Air Force, and their children ranging in ages from 16 months to 10 years old. Things were very low key; the kids all played with whatever toys they wanted to while the adults socialized. Being the only non-military family there, we felt a tad awkward at first but Nik took care of that by grabbing the hands of whomever was closest to him to clap; like his Nanny, Nik\u2019s never met a stranger he didn\u2019t like. Every so often he would disappear up the stairs and one of us would have to chase him to keep him out of mischief. \n Nik and N were in school together a year ago. In fact, the last time I saw N and his family we had not yet pulled Nik from school. Nik was on the verge of walking and N was in the process of getting his  Dynavox . It was an exciting time for both our families. \n I was eager to see N\u2019s family again; his mother had been one of the  only  mothers to reach out to me when Nik started school. Her friendship made the struggles of adjusting a little bit easier. I was anxious to see N in action with his cool  Dynavox  \u2014the one his mother jumped through hoops to make happen over the summer \u2014and to hear about the progress N has made in his new placement in a smaller class \u2014roughly a third of the size of the preschool class he had shared with Nik. I was excited about showing off  all the changes and progress  in Nik, too. \n Nothing was as I expected ; I came away feeling very sad for M and her son. It turns out that the school has not only  not  hired a new speech therapist to replace the one that left in the beginning of September (after taking off the entire summer, too), but  they had not told any of the parents about it.  Poor M was nearly in tears when I asked about N\u2019s  Dynavox  and how it was going. It seems that  no one is using it at school  and there is no consistency from school to home so N has regressed to randomly touching buttons to hear the sounds and has not made progress toward developing any meaningful way of communicating. \n Niksdad and I both started to give M some coaching about what she could or should do but I could see that she was just too overwhelmed to take it in. In addition to her sweet son, N, she has a  spitfire  little girl of 16 months old who runs her ragged. On top of that, she is a military wife \u2014which is only relevant because her husband is being deployed to Iraq in less than three weeks. He will be gone for six months as he coordinates and runs transport operations for daily troop movements. To say M is anxious and hanging by a thread right now would not be an understatement. \n I feel so bad for her and want to try to help in some way. All I can offer her is compassionate understanding  and information . I truly think that N is somewhere on the spectrum. (As many of us often remark,  \u201cWe recognize our people.\u201d ) He is sweet and docile, completely non-verbal, perseverates to the extreme over any and all wheeled transportation \u2014 to the point of nearly being hit by a car on several occasions because he was so absorbed in watching it that he walked into the street to get closer  \u2014and he has significant oral motor issues with lip closure, drooling, and tongue thrusting. His gait is incredibly uneven \u2014it has actually been described to me as a \u201cFrankenstein walk.\u201d I say I think he is on the spectrum because he has not been diagnosed with anything like cerebral palsy or any genetic disorders. \n Yet N has never been evaluated for autism, let alone diagnosed, by either medical or educational professionals. This is, to me, the greatest travesty. Here is a child who can program his neighbor\u2019s television remote to translate into French but who cannot communicate in a way anyone else \u2014including his parents \u2014can understand. Who clearly understands what is being said to him and responds more or less appropriately, yet no one at school has ever suggested that he be evaluated for  anything  beyond his current classification of \u201cdevelopmental delay.\u201d I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised; if he is placed into an autism program the school loses the funding they get for  warehousing  him five days a week. \n On some level, I think, M knows this, too. N\u2019s IEP is coming up next month and she hasn\u2019t the faintest clue about what is in his IEP and how to advocate for what he needs. I think she is afraid to look  too closely  because she doesn\u2019t want to see what is right in front of her. M did say she really wants to get N out of his current school; since they moved he is eligible to go to a different school in another district. I urged her to lobby for the change of placement immediately. \n I feel so sad for N and his family who don\u2019t know what to do for him. And I feel such a profound sense of relief and comfort with the choices Niksdad and I have made for Nik. There but for the grace of God\u2026 \n Knowledge IS power.

{"date": "January 18, 2008 ", "body": "NB: The following is, um,  lengthy  (says the mistress of understatement). Please, settle in with a cup of coffee, a bottle of scotch \u2014whatever your beverage of choice may be \u2014and enjoy the ride! ************************************************************************************** I get the sense that there is a mass movement taking place among many of our children right now; it\u2019s a movement encompassing sensory regulation, social development, speech and language, motor skills, and improving health. Truly, all you have to do is read what\u2019s going on with so many of Nik\u2019s cyber-pals \u2014 GP ,  Isaac ,  Fluffy ,  Maizie ,  Miss M ,  Bud ,  Charlie , and so many others \u2014and you can\u2019t help but feel that this truly is a rousing good start to the year. Now, that\u2019s not to say that everything is perfect and rosy every day for every kid. Of course not; the learning and developmental trajectory for our kids doesn\u2019t seem to be quite as  linear  \u2014certainly not as smooth and consistent \u2014 as the average child. I like to think of it as more of a  sine wave . Some days are up, some down. Lately, it sure feels like there\u2019s an awful lot of \u201cups\u201d happening in our household and around the blogosphere. I think Nik has made tremendous strides in overall sensory integration and learning to tolerate and accept certain kinds of input. He certainly is showing signs of becoming increasingly self aware and is finding ways to give himself breaks and down time that aren\u2019t necessarily preceded by a complete meltdown \u2014or  \u201ccoping challenge\u201d  as I sometimes call them. Perhaps it\u2019s a combination of his growth and development and mine, too. I am trying to adopt some of  Kristen\u2019s  Zen attitude and am practicing letting go \u2014and continuing to really trust my instincts even when others would tell me they\u2019re wrong.  It\u2019s paying off in myriad ways. It is said that when a person loses one of her senses she finds that the others become heightened. For example, a deaf person\u2019s sense of touch may be very keen, or a blind person\u2019s sense of hearing or smell seems to increase. Perhaps that is so with parents of non-verbal children; perhaps our intuition becomes heightened to allow us to really tune in to the subtleties of our child\u2019s body language and facial expressions. I truly feel that has happened with me and Nik. The  multitude  of ways Nik is communicating now is astounding to me. He still doesn\u2019t\u2019 speak and he won\u2019t point or grunt but he  will  look very pointedly in the direction of the thing he wants if he is seated and unable to get it for himself \u2014all while making happy little song-like sounds. If what he wants is out of his reach and someone is nearby, Nik will insistently tug at their hand in an effort to drag them to retrieve it for him. More and more lately, I find myself being willing to go along to see where he is taking me. Sometimes I know what he wants but I want him to  ask  for it. Others, I think I know what he wants and he ends up surprising me. Always, the communication is clear,  determined , and involves some joint referencing. Nik continues to be highly motivated by and responsive to music. We have  specific  songs for mealtimes, diaper changes, brushing teeth, washing hands, giving medicine, sensory brushing, playing a certain game together, and bed time. Nik will often start to hum one of those songs to indicate he\u2019s ready for a diaper change, a meal, play, or bed. There are many, many other songs we sing too but they are more for fun and learning; those are the songs I often hear through the monitor in the early morning hours as Nik begins his day in the quiet solitude of his room. Nik is beginning to really catch on to the concept of  sequencing . Where he used to go ballistic if we didn\u2019t do a desired activity or an expected routine in a certain way, Nik now understands when I say \u201cDiaper first, then toys,\u201d for example. He used to fight me when I changed him because he wanted his toys  right then . Now, he generally cooperates \u2014though he certainly has his giddy, rascally, or obstinate moments. He knows that I will keep my word and give him the desired toy after I change him. The down side to this is that I have to break it down into each step; otherwise, he thinks that as soon as the diaper is on his bottom it is time to bounce off the sofa and play. Never mind the fact that his pants may be around his ankles or he\u2019s got nothing else on since we just removed his pajamas! Nik\u2019s  cooperating  so much more lately. Whereas he used to launch a toy from his chair during meal time, Nik will now not only turn off the toy but he will then make attempts to  get my attention  and hand me the toy. Ditto with his socks after he takes them off in his crib; he used to throw them over the side and laugh maniacally. Now, I can stand there and ask him to give me his socks  and he does . He is getting better about showers \u2014he hates bathtubs and has finally outgrown his infant tub \u2014about brushing his teeth, getting dressed, and so many things. It\u2019s really quite pleasant most days! The ability to express hunger seems to have blossomed recently; it is still non-verbal but it is very clear. When Nik is hungry he will start to whine a bit and lift his shirt to expose his belly. If he knows I am watching, he will sometimes start to pluck at his feeding tube and growl a throaty little growl like a hungry little bear. When I ask if he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019ll either growl again or punch himself once in the side of the head. I\u2019m not sure where  that  one came from \u2014one of the girls he used to go to school with did that so I wonder if he remembers that.  We are working on eliminating that little mannerism! Often, I will ask Nik if he\u2019s ready to eat or if he\u2019s ready for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. He clearly understands the  names  of the meals because his response to either question is the same \u2014he  signs  \u201ceat\u201d very emphatically! Sometimes, he will walk over to me and take my hand to make the sign, too. He really looks forward to meals now and I try to give him tastes of all sorts of things. As I recently wrote about  here , goldfish crackers are becoming  quite  popular with Nik. Of course, with his desire for strong flavors I have to get the pizza, extra cheddar, or buffalo wing flavored ones! I can only give him one at a time or he licks them and tosses them in expectation of receiving another. If he sees me put the rest somewhere, he will lick the one he has, toss it, then  very emphatically  sign \u201cmore.\u201d Demanding little guy! Today, he finally repeated the  unsolicited bite of food  \u2014three times! Once was with a goldfish cracker and the other two were with animal crackers. With the latter, he actually bit off a large piece that I had to fish out of his mouth because he got panicky and couldn\u2019t work it forward by himself. But it didn\u2019t\u2019 deter him. He even let me crush up a cracker and give him bites of crumbs of varying sizes directly on his tongue.  The kid wants to eat so bad he can, well, taste it! Since it\u2019s too cold to go to the park, one of the ways Nik and his dad get to spend some time together is by going to the mall. It\u2019s a great place for Nik to be able to do lots of walking while wearing his harness \u2014backpack really, it looks like a puppy. He gets to walk independently while Niksdad gets to keep him close at hand and safe. When Nik gets tired or overwhelmed, he simply sits down wherever he happens to be. After a few times of this, he ends up getting a ride on his daddy\u2019s shoulders. Hey, the kid\u2019s  not  dumb! Seriously, though, we have started to really figure out that it is one of Nik\u2019s ways of showing that he is on sensory overload; he begins to stumble a lot, or starts looking up at the ceiling while he walks (and then trips), or he sits. Niksdad used to get so angry because he thought that Nik was just being willful. I figured he was simply tired. Then we started to notice that it happens more at certain times of day and usually coincides with any of the following: no nap, a big morning of PT/OT and play group, the mall is crowded, Nik didn\u2019t\u2019 sleep well the night before. All of these things \u2014either alone or in some combination \u2014really tax Nik\u2019s ability to process his environment. As soon as we made this connection, so many other things have started to shift into better focus for us. The times when Nik has suddenly stopped playing and just lain on the floor playing with a favored musical toy, his wanting to sit with his books first thing in the morning, his need to bite sometimes \u2014all seem to occur when Nik is either overloaded and  needs a break  or when he\u2019s still groggy from sleep. In both cases, he can\u2019t handle too much input. Once we realized the connection, I was able to let go of a lot of worry; I used to think that Nik was in danger of regressing when he would send so much time on the floor. Now I realize it\u2019s what he needs to help him regroup. It\u2019s interesting for me to watch as Nik becomes more self aware and also more  socially  aware. It is especially evident when we are at his OT/PT sessions. We do those back to back, thirty minutes each session and the therapists work closely together \u2014often observing one another if they don\u2019t have a child they are working with at the time. Nik has been really exhibiting some developmentally appropriate behaviors \u2014 flat out tantrums  \u2014when he is being asked to do things he would rather  not . On one hand, I want to cheer. On the other hand, it shows me a lot about Nik\u2019s obstinate streak as his personality really begins to shine. (He must get  that  from his father\u2019s side of the family. Heh, heh, heh.) Nik\u2019s OT, Miss D, is wonderful with it. When he starts to kick, scream, cry, and pour it on, Miss D simply puts Nik on a mat and lets him work it out. Then, she tells him that she knows he understands her and she\u2019s sorry he doesn\u2019t want to do \u201cX\u201d but he needs to do \u201cX\u201d anyway. It\u2019s always in a loving and respectful way; it\u2019s never about control but is very much about helping Nik to understand that he  doesn\u2019t always get his way . And she\u2019s  usually  giving him some sort of deep pressure or brushing as she\u2019s telling him that, too. We\u2019ve talked about the importance of  presuming competence  and Nik\u2019s ability to understand while also honoring his boundaries and sensory limitations. I feel like, between the two of us, we have a pretty clear sense of when Nik is being a typical toddler and when he\u2019s truly reached his limits of tolerance. So we are now starting to build in some behavioral elements to his OT sessions. It\u2019s slightly daunting for me but exciting at the same time; it\u2019s a place that, just four months ago,  I wasn\u2019t sure we would get to . The truly wonderful thing about it all is watching how motivated by positive interactions Nik has become; he really responds well to Miss D\u2019s warmth and love. Nik\u2019s been very responsive lately to all sorts of affection and attention. Nearly overnight it seems my little loner has become interested in playing with Mommy and Daddy nearly  every  chance he gets. It is both gratifying and annoying all at once! Yes, I know,  be careful what you wish for , right? There are days when I get almost nothing done because I am playing games with Nik \u2014sorting shapes and colors , spinning him around in his giant green bucket, tickling, making funny faces and noises which he is starting to mimic. And yet, oddly enough,  I don\u2019t really mind it.  I know the time will pass so quickly and I don\u2019t want to miss a thing. We missed so much together in Nik\u2019s early life that I don\u2019t mind trying to make up for lost time with him \u2014 even if it sometimes feels like we\u2019re trying to make it all up in one afternoon\u2019s worth of play . All of this sensory awareness and growth is really spilling over everywhere. Nik is suddenly very interested in the world around him. From our two cats he\u2019s recently discovered \u2014 who have been living with us for Nik\u2019s entire life and would be just as happy if he continued to ignore them  \u2014to the snow falling outside the window yesterday morning which Nik was watching through the glass with great excitement and curiosity; it\u2019s as if a whole new world has just cracked wide open for Nik to discover and explore. He\u2019s unnervingly fearless when it comes to climbing, sliding, touching, or even tasting. He goes through his waking hours at warp speed and comes crashing down to sleep mere moments after his head touches the crib. In fact, Nik has been sleeping better lately, too. We\u2019ve  finally  debugged the whole bedwetting thing \u2014for now\u2014by using sleepers with the zippers in the back (cut off the feet and turn them around), diapers with the tabs done in the back, and vinyl training pants over the diaper. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a matter of time before Nik figures out how to circumvent that one, too. Seems we\u2019re always looking for that better mousetrap\u2026 Meanwhile (and I hesitate to jinx it by actually saying it), Nik\u2019s pain cycle seems to be in remission or, at the very least, at a temporary lull. Dare I say,  possibly gone  \u2014at least for the past five days and nights? When it hits, there is no question that there is some sort of pain response going on. But we\u2019ve been trying a few  non-pharmaceutical  things that seem to be making a big difference. These things include eliminating the possibilities that Nik is hungry, cold, tired, lonely or bored. Sounds trite, no? But really, if a kid doesn\u2019t talk and needs to get someone\u2019s attention what better way to get it than screaming and slamming his head against the floor? Now, I am absolutely  not  saying I think it is all behavioral;  I do not . There unequivocally is some pain being triggered \u2014by  what  we have yet to determine. However, in eliminating all of these other factors when and where we have been able to, the episodes come into clearer focus. One of the things we started to wonder about \u2014in the absence of any sort of endocrine testing \u2014is whether Nik has been having some bouts of  hypoglycemia . Where he\u2019s completely tube fed and that stuff doesn\u2019t really stay with you a long time, well, it may be possible that he was getting headaches, irritability, and nocturnal wakefulness from it. As we\u2019ve increased his caloric intake some and made sure to give him some small snacks between his bigger meals, we have noticed a  marked  shift. Still no  answers  \u2014but more questions to investigate. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; we will raise the issue with  Dr. Mary  soon. So, there you have it \u2014 in a very large nut shell.

To celebrate the little every day victories \u2014and especially the BIG ones! To lend an ear, a shoulder, an understanding heart. Humor to lighten the burden; laughter is healing and cleansing. Positive reinforcement when the reserves are low.\n \n TulipMom  recently hosted her very own little  bloggy bling-fest  and graciously bestowed a bevy of awards. I won in a category I didn\u2019t even know existed! (And there I was on the red carpet in my curlers for goodness sake!) She thinks I\u2019ve got a  winning attitude ! I am humbled and honored; I will confess I work hard at it and don\u2019t always succeed. (Those would be the lengthy blog silences you might see from time to time\u2026)\n \n \n \n I  really  want to share this with every single one of my readers, commenters, blogging pals, etcetera. Each one of you lifts me up when I need it, cheers with me when it\u2019s warranted, and makes me laugh, think, love, and feel more deeply than I have in a very long time.  But there are two women I\u2019d like to honor who touch my life in very different ways. \n \n   \n On the surface, one might think these two are polar opposites. They come from different worlds and yet, in their hearts, they are so alike. Their humor, their insights, their shared struggles and wisdom always leave me wanting more and always, always,  always  leave me wishing I could be their neighbor. That would be a bit of a stretch though; one lives on the west coast and the other in the West \u2014with a capital W. Both struggle, I am sure, like the rest of us and yet they find ways to see the good, to hold onto the hope, and to share the laughter. I love them and I don\u2019t even know them.\n \n Without further ado (because, really, get me on a roll and I think I can\u2019t shut up! Too much caffeine\u2026), please join in me in a giant round of applause for: \n \n Like A Shark  and  Pinwheels ! \n Okay, the show\u2019s over\u2026everybody move along to those sights now! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R6snSsbSIqI/AAAAAAAAAeI/zYV5edGSXaY/s1600-h/WinningAttitudeAward.gif", "http://tulipmom.blogspot.com/", "http://tulipmom.blogspot.com/2008/02/award-season.html", "http://likeashark.blogspot.com/", "http://jennifergrafgroneberg.wordpress.com/"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/02/07/a-winning-attitude/", "title": "A Winning Attitude"},
{"date": "February 10, 2008 ", "body": "It\u2019s been a  super long week \u2026seven appointments in four days, 300 miles on the car (for the appointments), and a  very high stress day  yesterday which involved a missed workout, mopping the floor  twice , wiping down the TV and entertainment center  and  shampooing the sofa. Oh, and a solo-parent outing with Nik on Thursday night in a non-child-proofed house! In spite of all that, Niksdad and I managed to squeeze in a  date  Friday night and all three of us had dinner with my parents tonight. I even managed to fit in three workouts this week. In other areas: Keep your fingers crossed\u2026I  think  we\u2019ve debugged the  episodic pain thing  (no thanks to any doctors though!), or so it seems. Since we increased Nik\u2019s caloric intake and are making sure he gets a snack or something roughly every three hours, Nik\u2019s been sleeping anywhere from ten to twelve hours each night\u2026 straight through!  And the day time episodes have diminished significantly; we\u2019ve gone from  ten plus episodes a day  to roughly half a dozen or fewer  a week  now. I really do think it has something to do with his metabolism or his endocrine system; it wouldn\u2019t surprise me as I have some issues there as well. Still, we are going to go ahead with the video EEG (Feb. 26-28) to make sure it\u2019s not related to any seizure activity. Nik\u2019s seizures are, for the most part, subtle and can be easily missed. Occasionally, like last night, he will simply drop. Fortunately, Niksdad was on hand to catch him so we avoided any bloody lips or nose, thank goodness! There are times that the pain seems to strike Nik completely out of the blue; he\u2019ll be having lunch or playing happily with a toy and then \u2014all of a sudden he begins to cry and punch himself in the head or poke at his eyes. Those are the ones which cause considerable consternation for us all. But, there are times when Nik uses the  same behavior  to communicate his anger, frustration, or boredom. Teasing out the difference between the two has been much easier since we made the assumption that any actual discomfort may be caused by hypoglycemia or something in that realm. Really, though, I\u2019ve got to give Nik credit for his smarts; he\u2019s identified the fastest and  most effective  way to get Mommy and Daddy to drop everything and come running when he wants us. Since he can\u2019t call out for me, and he can\u2019t tell me what he is feeling \u2014yet\u2014he bangs his head. I don\u2019t  like  it but it makes sense to me. The next step is to work on finding ways for him to express his frustration without causing himself physical harm. My mother and I are constructing a very large \u201ccrash pad\u201d that I want to try to get him to use for those times. We\u2019ll see how that works out. Meanwhile, I need to get things rolling to procure the AT devices which were recommended at Nik\u2019s  recent AAC evaluation . If we can get those into use I think we will have a pretty good shot at, eventually, making some headway in minimizing Nik\u2019s acting out of frustration. I don\u2019t know if Nik is going through some sort of separation anxiety phase right now \u2014or maybe it\u2019s just a control issue; lately he wants me to play with him  constantly . He loves to play with his shape sorter \u2014he has three different kinds, two of which he has mastered and the third he is well on his way to mastery. If I sit with him and talk to him while he works \u2014 Oh, look it\u2019s a red triangle, Nik. Where does the red triangle go? Can you show Mommy the blue square?  \u2014Nik will empty and fill the darned thing a dozen times or more if I let him. But the minute I turn away \u2014even if I get up to blow my nose \u2014Nik gets up from the floor and begins to methodically throw all the pieces over the gate; he never seems upset \u2014in fact, he laughs this giddy little giggle while he is doing it. If I stop him and sit down with him again he will continue to play happily. The kid is insatiable for the company of Mommy or Daddy. We don\u2019t necessarily have to be doing something directly with him; we just have to be close enough for him to engage us if he wants to. The irony is that when I try to take him to the Y and put him in the Kid Zone (childcare) so he can play with other people, he completely freaks out. Last week he got himself so worked up that he threw up everywhere. I know that if I can spend a few minutes with him and distract him with the toys he will be fine and won\u2019t even miss me. Yesterday morning was beginning to be a repeat of last week; when I told the attendant that I needed to help Nik transition, I was told  emphatically  that no adults other than Kid Zone attendants were allowed in. This particular person didn\u2019t know Nik (I don\u2019t usually take him on Saturdays) so they didn\u2019t understand the need. To them, they just saw a small child with a behavior problem; their attitude was pretty much  Tough luck, lady!  I left angry and frustrated \u2014and had to blow off my workout partner! The people that work there during the week all know Nik and work with me to help him adjust. In fact, when I see these same ladies out in the grocery store they all ask me  Where\u2019s Nik? How\u2019s he doing? We haven\u2019t seen him in a while!  There\u2019s a relationship which gives us the flexibility and understanding to bend the rules a bit. Yesterday was my first time encountering a person who either didn\u2019t get it or  didn\u2019t care ; it was eye opening for me in many ways. I realize there will be many, many people who neither get it nor care and I need to figure out how to handle it in a way that takes care of Nik without alienating others. I know we will encounter it more and more as we venture out into the world beyond the safe and familiar confines of our home. Today, though, provided a foil for yesterday\u2019s anger, frustration, and disillusionment. Niksdad didn\u2019t have to work so we had a nice little family outing this afternoon \u2014at the Y! We figured it would be a good idea to see how Nik handled being in the pool before we plunk down the fee for the special adapted swim time I wrote about  here . It\u2019s been about six months since Nik has been in a pool of any sort so we weren\u2019t quite sure what to expect. The tears started as soon as we pulled up in the parking lot; seeing Nik\u2019s bottom lip quivering and the tears running down his cheeks nearly undid me. But we took a collective deep breath and forged ahead. Once Nik realized he wasn\u2019t going to the child care area he calmed down \u2014until he got into his suit and entered the pool area. Does the phrase  \u201cclinging monkey\u201d  give you a clear enough image? As soon as Nik got into the pool with me, the tears and panic set in. I don\u2019t know if it was a sensory issue or just plain old fear; I suspect it was some vestibular insecurity. Whatever the cause, it wasn\u2019t pretty! I held Nik tight in my arms and sang one of the lullabies from  Mary Poppins  in his ear. That helped a bit but he was still really clingy; Niksdad and I were both surprised as Nik was once so comfortable in the water. Eventually, we found a distraction in the form of some  pop-beads  which were floating in the water. Niksdad and I got Nik interested in taking them apart and putting them together again; the whole time I was giving him some deep pressure around his pelvis and making sure he could feel my body under his. About fifteen minutes after we got into the pool, Nik relaxed his grip on me and seemed to settle in. By the time we were done \u2014about thirty minutes later \u2014Nik was only holding onto my index fingers, splashing, kicking, and even dipping his face into the water! The whole family left the pool in a great mood.  You might say we were floating.  Not a bad finish for a week that started off feeling like we were drowning!

{"date": "February 11, 2008 ", "body": "Saturday morning\u2019s frustration  with the Kid Zone left me angry and feeling like I was on the war path. It was  not  a pleasant sensation. And frankly, it wasn\u2019t pretty either; I\u2019ve been on the other side of the fence \u2014watching another person be so consumed with the righteousness they felt that they scorched others with their heat as they blazed past on the way to vengeance and vindication \u2014and thinking what a jerk the person is being. I must confess that my knee-jerk reaction is to do the same in the heat of the moment. This is why I was grateful that the incident happened over the weekend. It\u2019s that whole  cooler heads prevail  thing\u2026\n When my mother came to babysit on Saturday afternoon I was still upset; I seriously considered going off to Starbucks or Wawa for a cup of coffee and a muffin or something sweet then going for a long drive in the country to cry out my frustration. Instead, I  \u201cput on my big girl panties\u201d  and went to the Y to squeeze in the workout I had missed in the morning. I felt better afterward; you\u2019ve got to love the endorphin rush that comes from a good workout! As a result, I was able to deal with the childcare situation a bit more calmly. \n I left a note for the Child Development Director \u2014the person that oversees all the kid\u2019s programs, the day care, the after school stuff, etc. It simply said  \u201cI have a child with special needs and I\u2019d like to discuss one of the Kid Zone policies with you.\u201d  She called today and we had a good, calm, cordial,  and productive  conversation. I explained what had happened and made it clear that I knew the attendant didn\u2019t know me or Nik and that I  recognized I was too frustrated in the moment to try to deal with it . It old her that I appreciate that policies exist for a reason and that I wasn\u2019t asking her to change the policy. Instead, I asked for her  help in finding a solution that would both support Nik\u2019s and my needs and honor the policy. \n It was so simple. In five minutes we had a solution that works for everyone; she is going to leave written instructions for all her staff. The policy is for the protection of other children who have slipped out of the Kid Zone in the brief moment or two it takes for a parent to enter through the main door. I can appreciate this  completely ; I even told the Director that it sounds like something  my  kid would do! The solution is that there is a back door through another room which we can use as often as we need to until Nik gets used to the transition. To her credit, the Director never once made me feel like I was asking for something extraordinary or impossible. And, to my credit, I felt like I had taken a stand for my child without burning any bridges or becoming a negative force. \n There is a phrase which is used so often in talking about IEP\u2019s and disability rights \u2014 Presume Competence . I think the world would be a great deal easier to navigate if we did the same for others we deal with.  Presume competence, presume that others want to help or do the right thing . Find ways to work together to arrive at a solution.    \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/02/is-week-over-yet.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R7Cdo8_K1UI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/GEG0uklcFrc/s1600-h/tug-of-war.gif"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/02/11/y-not/", "title": "Y\u2019 Not?"},
{"date": "April 6, 2008 ", "body": "In an effort to support Nik\u2019s intense and newly blossoming  desire to communicate , I\u2019ve been willing to try almost anything. To that end, I\u2019ve become a convert to a near fanatical movement sweeping the nation in throngs of babies and small children. Even  conservative media outlets  have bought into the hype!\n I\u2019ve resisted the lure for a long time. I had a plethora of what I considered very valid objections to joining the movement; the time and expense were too great, Nik didn\u2019t have the coordination to perform the requisite actions, and I would be the one doing all the work\u2026and so on. \n Well, like any good cult, I found myself drawn in, curious to find out more from the likes of these die-hard followers ( her ,  her ,  her ,  her , oh and  her ,  too ). I kept reading about the enjoyment their children got out of it, the diminished stress levels they personally experienced as a result and\u2014 gosh darn it\u2014 how cute it all is! Being a sucker for cute, devoted to my son having more enjoyment in his life, and a slave to my own stress, I simply had to check it out. \n I was hooked.  But how to support the habit? The library. Yes, it\u2019s true. Even the library is on board! \n You know, it\u2019s said that a cult will make you turn your back on those you love. Well, I hope  Mary  can forgive Nik his betrayal; apparently, he\u2019s got a new  main squeeze . Her name is  Rachel . All I have to do is start to sing a refrain of one of her siren songs and Nik starts smiling like a love sick schoolboy. No, really, I mean it; he even begins to blow kisses to the air! Sorry  Mary , it\u2019s been a jolly holiday. But this thing with Rachel? Well, it seems pretty serious. \n Consider it a  sign of the times . And the times\u2026they are a changing! Nik getting his Rachel fix Nik spontaneously signed \u201ceat\u201d for the first time this morning\u2026 while watching the video, of course! \n ******************************************************************************** Disclaimers: The use of cult references is intended for purely humorous effect. Please accept my apology for any offense given; it is entirely unintentional. In the interest of full disclosure, I must say we have been working with Nik using the sign for \u201ceat\u201d for a while now. He understands it, he will mimic it if he\u2019s specifically asked within the context of meal time.  He has not, before today, ever spontaneously signed this or any other sign.

I\u2019ve been pondering what I think of it and what it all really means in my life.

{"date": "April 11, 2008 ", "body": "There\u2019s lots going on here at NiksHouse \u2014some not so hot but definitely transient (we hope) and much more tipping the scales n the opposite direction. In fact, there\u2019s been so much happening on a daily basis that it\u2019s been difficult to stop and take the time to write about it all. It\u2019s difficult; I don\u2019t want to bore everyone with excruciating detail over each last little health issue, nor do I wish to inundate you with exclamations over each and every little thing Nik is doing lately.  \n Instead, I\u2019ll share an experience we had this afternoon, at the park, which more or less sums up where we are these days.\n This lovely Jamaican woman was sitting and talking with someone as her children played on the play structures. Nik saw her and made a bee-line for her \u2014from across the parking lot! He walked past the person she had been speaking with and immediately took her hands in his to clap them together. As she good naturedly humored Nik, we talked and she told us she is a pediatrician and a neonatologist.  \u201cHe must have known,\u201d  she smiled as she clapped hands and tickled Nik\u2019s chin. She asked a few questions about his early days and was stunned when we told her that we had spent 209 days in the NICU. She turned to the woman she had been speaking with and remarked,  \u201cWhen you meet parents who have spent a long time in the NICU, you owe them lots of respect; they\u2019ve had an unbelievably hard road and they bear so much.\u201d I blushed and stammered something, I don\u2019t know what exactly, denying that we were anything special at all \u2014just ordinary parents loving our child. She took my hand and smiled and said,  \u201cOh no, you are a true veteran and he is a lucky little boy to have you.\u201d  Then she looked at Nik, now sitting on his Daddy\u2019s shoulders in a vain attempt to curtail a rascally streak he was starting to show.

{"date": "April 17, 2008 ", "body": "Nik\u2019s haircuts have always been hellish experiences for all of us. It usually requires Miss Carol who cuts Nik\u2019s hair and is really wonderful with him, myself to hold and reassure him, two other stylists to help hold his hands away from the scissors or clippers, another to continually wipe away the clippings from his tear-streaked cheeks, and another to clap and sing songs with and for Nik. The bigger Nik gets the harder it is to keep him still; he\u2019s so strong and fast!\n Today, Niksdad was not able to come with me to be an extra source of strong hands. I geared up for the worst. When we walked into the salon \u2014which is a very intimate, low-key place \u2014Nik didn\u2019t disappoint me. His lower lip quivered and stuck out in a beguiling pout and the little shrieks of tears began. The waiting was the worst; he kept bolting for the front door and actually managed to get it open! \n I warned Miss Carol that it might be a rough one today; it\u2019s been nearly twice as long between cuts this time since Miss Carol had been super sick with the flu and then some other infection. Nik\u2019s hair had gotten so long I could tuck his sideburns behind his ears! I was really worried that he was going to go ballistic as soon as the clippers came out. \n Nik fought and cried as we strapped him into the booster seat and we  definitely  had to hold his hands. But here\u2019s the thing \u2014Nik fussed and cried but  he sat perfectly still  as soon as Miss Carol started to cut! It only took myself, Miss Carol, another stylist to hold one of Nik\u2019s hands, and the receptionist \u2014a \u201chip, young grandma\u201d type \u2014who held Nik\u2019s other hand, clapped with him, sang to him, and wiped his little tears. At one point, I had to let go of Nik\u2019s head and  he sat so still I was worried he\u2019d passed out! \n I think this is the first time ever that Miss Carol has been able to get a perfectly even cut all the way around \u2014 not  for lack of trying! \n Yes indeed, sometimes, the little things can be monumental. \n   \n   ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SAfesgnVS0I/AAAAAAAAApI/myoJ16GJjs8/s1600-h/Whats+the+Buzz_3.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SAfRLgnVSyI/AAAAAAAAAo4/OyRcleiHbEc/s1600-h/Whats+the+Buzz_1.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SAfRLgnVSyI/AAAAAAAAAo4/OyRcleiHbEc/s1600-h/Whats+the+Buzz_1.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SAfRLgnVSyI/AAAAAAAAAo4/OyRcleiHbEc/s1600-h/Whats+the+Buzz_1.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/04/17/whats-the-buzz/", "title": "What\u2019s the Buzz?"},
{"date": "April 12, 2008 ", "body": "I\u2019ve been so busy keeping up with Nik lately that I haven\u2019t had a chance to share some quick updates. Sorry! Here they are \u2014in no particular order:\n \n \n The issue with Nik\u2019s AugCom  devices seems to be nearly resolved. I don\u2019t know if the larger issue is worked out between the managed care organization and the vendors; frankly, I don\u2019t much care as long as we get what Nik needs. I can\u2019t fight their battles for them, too! The short version of the story is that the case manager managed to get someone at DynaVox to agree to order the AbleNet devices for us. I don\u2019t know when they will  actually  be ordered and delivered; in the meantime, though, the good folks at  DATI  have been kind enough to let us continue to renew the equipment loan until someone else needs the equipment or Nik\u2019s own devices are delivered to us. \n \n \n Nik\u2019s  wild EEG  experience was either really useful or not at all; we haven\u2019t decided. The neurologist told us last week that the results showed no evidence of any seizure activity during the time it was recording. That means one of a few things is possible; either Nik is no longer having seizures (unlikely at this point), the seizures are under good control with the meds he is taking, or his seizures are now less frequent and there simply weren\u2019t any in the twenty-four hour period captured by the test. \n \n \n The good news though is that the  mysterious pain episodes  are not seizure related. We sort of knew that intuitively but it was nice to have it confirmed. That means we are now moving on to the next area of investigation \u2014Nik\u2019s meds. \n \n \n This past week we did a short trial of increasing one med in preparation for decreasing another; it was a  miserable failure  (which is one reason why I\u2019ve been quiet most of the week and unable to do things like finish reading  this  book). For the entire week Nik was like  someone else\u2019s child ; his personality was more than slightly manic, his sleep was greatly disrupted (and so, too, was mine), and his coping skills  deeply  diminished \u2014to the point that even things which used to make him squeal with delight would elicit that reaction and then immediately plummet into a meltdown complete with head banging and thrashing. The doctor had us go back to the \u201cnormal\u201d med schedule and dosing after six days of this.  \n \n \n I am ecstatic to report that my happy little boy is back!  \n \n   \n We are still not  entirely  convinced that Nik\u2019s immune system and/or ears aren\u2019t at the root of the mysterious episodic pain. His lymph nodes both in front of and behind the right ear are constantly swollen yet he has no obvious infection. He  does  get sick more than I think is normal and it always seems to involve his ears and his gut. We\u2019re making another appointment with the pediatrician to discuss a CT scan of Nik\u2019s right mastoid to rule out the possibility of chronic mastoiditis, and to get a referral to another immunologist for a second opinion and testing. \n \n \n Nik\u2019s  overall  progress continues to be rapid and positive. He\u2019s still small for his age \u2014only the third percentile for height and twenty-fifth percentile for weight (he\u2019s solid muscle!)\u2014but he is showing  consistent and steady growth . Not bad for the kid who started out at nineteen ounces, eh? He\u2019s ambling around in his new orthotics with a confidence and balance that belies his shaky start and extremely delayed gross motor skills; his gait is still uneven and somewhat jerky but it doesn\u2019t keep Nik from getting places in a hurry!. Nik\u2019s also tolerating a broader range of textures lately \u2014showing a willingness even to dip his fingers into yogurt or mashed fruit and to pull a favorite toy out of a box of rice or pile of sand. All of those textures sent him into absolute hysterics just a few short months ago. \n \n On the feeding front, it\u2019s still slow going but with small, steady progress. Nik is taking more initiative with the chewy tube and tolerating it for more bites between food or as a preparation for eating. He\u2019s eating a little bit of food by mouth each day \u2014not enough to substitute for a tube feeding but enough to measure in terms of his overall intake. Nik\u2019s constant favorite is goldfish crackers but he will try some of absolutely everything we offer him; he\u2019s not shy about telling us which foods he doesn\u2019t care for though there aren\u2019t too many we\u2019ve found yet; with Nik, it\u2019s more about the consistency or texture.  \n Nik\u2019s overall communication skills have expanded greatly in a short time. He is learning, I think, about intent and effective ways to get my attention. Lately I find, more often than not, that Nik is willing to slow down that fraction of a second it might take to show me what he wants; he\u2019s also doing so well at following instructions now. It helps, I know, if I use consistent language with him and give him cues and clues as to what is coming and what is expected of him. The times I forget to cue him as to what\u2019s next are the times I regret the oversight. \n \n I know Niksdad must think I am trying to control his every little communication with Nik but he is slowly coming to understand that Nik needs that specificity and structure to help him keep it together. Something as simple as telling him the sequence of  \u201cclean pants and pajamas FIRST, THEN toys\u201d  can make all the difference between his joyful cooperation or wrestling him to the floor to change a diaper. \n \n   \n From a social and emotional standpoint, Nik has become  very affectionate ; even the neurologist took note of it last week. Nik knows and understands the value of hugs and kisses and uses them liberally \u2014and not just for effect either! I\u2019m always floored when I\u2019ve been out for a while and Nik drops whatever he is doing and comes to greet me with a big kiss. And I  still  get choked up whenever I watch the way Nik responds  every time his Daddy walks in the room. \n Imagine a golden retriever puppy shivering with delight when it sees its beloved master and you\u2019ll get some  small  idea; it is definitely a visceral response for Nik! When the two of them are playing together or merely sitting side by side on the sofa and Nik leans his little face into his Daddy\u2019s \u2014his hands look tiny as they rest against his father\u2019s cheeks. Sometimes I wonder if he remembers the bond he first formed with his Daddy immediately after birth. He clung to Niksdad\u2019s fingertip immediately after the nurses cleaned him up and the doctor inserted the breathing tube into his miniscule throat and lungs.  They\u2019ve been nearly inseparable ever since. \n \n \n \n \n So, in all \u2014in spite of some bumps and turbulence along the way\u2014 I\u2019d say things are pretty good right now. And I\u2019m not even afraid of tempting  the Fates \u2026 much. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/04/communique.html", "http://www.dati.org/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/03/he-hates-hats-too.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/paging-doctor-house.html", "http://www.jennifergrafgroneberg.com/pinwheels.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SAEltQnVSwI/AAAAAAAAAos/-V4HdQl8rSc/s1600-h/0329081720a.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/SAEltQnVSvI/AAAAAAAAAok/0bJ5Oc-Dcpc/s1600-h/0408081756.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirae"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/04/12/miscellaneous-stuff-vol-199/", "title": "Miscellaneous Stuff vol.\u00a0199"},

{"date": "March 13, 2008 ", "body": "I am not a quilter. But I love the imagery and affinity evoked by the very idea of an old fashioned quilting bee. Not quite like the one in  this movie . I envision something more like what I imagine my great-great grandmother, Addie, might have taken part in. I have one of of Addie\u2019s quilts; sometimes, I can imagine her sitting in the circle creating it. Oblivious to the fact that it is an antique and an heirloom, it is the very quilt I took with me to boarding school as a lonely teenager. The same one I huddled beneath through freezing winters as a a broke and starving grad student. The very one I wrapped around my grieving self the night my seventeen year old cat died just months before my wedding. The quilt is old and worn \u2014and rendered all the more beautiful to me because of its history. The women of her small community on the Texas prairie gathered together creating quilts \u2014not necessarily for special occasions but for  everyday  use. Sturdy, warm, durable and beautiful, they would be made from scraps left over after making dresses, work shirts, trousers, or baby clothes. Some would even incorporate bits of grain and feed sacks. Each woman would work on her own quilt; her fingers deftly moving in an unconscious rhythm as the needle weaves through layers of fragments, piecing together a pattern only she can see in her mind \u2014to others it may look like random blots of color in abstract. Each woman stitching without thought as she listens to the stories in the circle, sharing her own in turn. That is how I feel sometimes about blogging \u2014like we are in our very own sewing circle. This gathering of women \u2014pioneers in our own way \u2014 sharing   our   joys , our  sorrows ,  our   dreams , fears, and  frustrations  as we stitch together the fragments of each day, each moment. At first, the pieces do not make sense until we take a step back and look from another\u2019s perspective. Each one of us has felt what the others have \u2014or we are now, or will sometime in the future. The patterns of interconnectedness emerge with each passing day. When one of us is joyful we share the glow. When one is low and struggling we reach our hands across the circle to hold her up. Sometimes we even lay aside our own sewing to cradle one another as we work through our grief, our fears. At others we may turn to one another and ask for help with a complicated stitch or the placement of an odd scrap of color that just doesn\u2019t seem to fit. We help each other find our true north when we are lost and we help each woman find the fabulousness within her. The energy of our circle is powerful and peaceful. We are soothed and encouraged by our utter acceptance and understanding of one another. We are pioneers from different walks of life yet we are connected as we forge our families and communities on this uncertain frontier. This quilt was made for our wedding by my husband\u2019s \u201cAunt Pat\u201d and is one of my favorite things on display in our home. Alas, I don\u2019t have any pictures of Addie\u2019s quilt and it is now packed safely away to protect it.

{"date": "March 17, 2008 ", "body": "\n So my  already perfect day ? Ended on a high note. Yes, I managed to get Nik to the doctor and got another Rx for the diarrhea-inducing antibiotics. Since they really never had a chance to leave his system\u2026well, you guessed it. \n But, there\u2019s a silver lining. While I was out visiting  this place  with my sister \u2014and joining,  Niksdad got to handle it.  No problem (for me). I arrived home just in time to brush Nik\u2019s teeth and get kisses goodnight! Nik was fast asleep within minutes of going to bed. \n Whew! Yes! I knew having that super-fattening java chip frappuccino from Starbucks\u2019 drive-through would turn my day around! \n So I kiss Niksdad and send him off to the library to study for a test he has tomorrow and I settle in to my evening. I start the very large load of Nik\u2019s laundry which accumulated during the day, eat dinner, draw up Nik\u2019s meds for tomorrow and gear up for a relaxing evening and think  \u201cAh, the night is mine to savor!\u201d The phone rings. My husband\u2019s (soon to be  former , IMO) best friend \u2014 the one who was Best Man at our wedding  \u2014calls to tell us he\u2019s gotten married in a civil ceremony just twelve days ago (in NYC).  AND  he\u2019s getting married in a formal ceremony the first weekend in May\u2026 in the Bahamas!  Now, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s no big deal to guys but\u2026 I am royally pissed off at this guy.  It\u2019s not like we live so far away that he couldn\u2019t have called my husband to say  \u201cHey buddy, come on up to New York to be my witness.\u201d  No, instead he calls to  verbally  invite us to a wedding he knows full well we cannot possibly attend \u2014and he  acknowledges  that! \n Grrrrrr\u2026  I know my husband won\u2019t say anything bad about this guy but I  also   know  he will be hurt by these actions. That makes me sad and angry. \n I hang up the phone, seething. Feeling in need of a little peaceful, loving energy, I tip-toe into Nik\u2019s room to peek at my sleeping cherub.  \n Sniff.   \n Sniff, sniff\u2026do I smell\u2026?  \n No.  \n Yes. \n There\u2019s my innocent angel with one hand inside his jammies (zipped in the back!

{"date": "March 16, 2008 ", "body": "Otherwise titled  How we\u2019ve been spending our time. Wow, it sure feels like I\u2019ve not written very much this week. Nothing is wrong; we\u2019ve just been busy living life with Nik. That simple statement holds so much that I may have to break it up into several posts just so I don\u2019t overwhelm anyone \u2014myself included in the writing of it! So, my son the media darling is at it again. Last Saturday we spent the day supporting our favorite Easter Seals volleyball players  here . Last year we participated in the opening ceremonies and rolled out the official game ball for the politician\u2019s match. The same ball now sits in Nik\u2019s room and bears the autographs of one of our U.S.  Senators  and our  Congressman , as well as our current  Lt.   Governor  (and gubernatorial hopeful this year). The photo on the sidebar of my blog was taken at last year\u2019s ceremonies. And was trotted out again this year for a half-page \u201cthank you\u201d ad in the largest newspaper in the state. On a side note which makes me think I should have titled this post  \u201cComing Out,\u201d  we have been active supporters-in-kind of Easter Seals since Nik began receiving services when he was about eighteen months old. We were the featured family at the 2006 annual dinner, Nik was  profiled  for both the annual dinner program and the website of  Easter Seals Delaware & Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore , and he graced the cover of the 2006 Annual Report.\n \n \n In addition \u2014and completely understandable to this  admittedly  biased mother \u2014Nik has become somewhat of the darling of the staff at both the regional office and our local center. I know some of it has to do with our active support and participation; it\u2019s difficult for many families to find the energy or desire to display their child\u2019s disabilities to the general public in such a blatant fashion. Niksdad and I feel strongly that we want to make our experience \u2014and Nik\u2019s\u2014 something to help inspire others whether it is through offering hope or supporting fundraising efforts for something we not only believe in but from which our family has benefit greatly. \n But I digress. \n The week picked up the pace right out of the gate on Monday. Sure, we had the usual routine of feeding therapy, PT, OT, et al. But we didn\u2019t count on Nik getting a nasty bout of cellulitis at his g-tube site  again . I think he never really shook the  first infection  from a couple of weeks ago. I\u2019ll spare you the graphic details and simply say this bout was messy and painful for Nik. And, of course, the requisite antibiotics have created a reasonable facsimile of  this  scenario \u2014minus the ear infection and rash. \n We had to miss swimming this week because of the infection but hope to be able to get into the pool tomorrow. Swimming \u201clessons\u201d have been an interesting experience for all of us; Mr. Tim, the very nice instructor, has struggled with knowing how to help Nik who has, in turn, struggled with his renewed fear of the water. I have been trying to strike a balance between wanting to push Nik to find his love of the water again \u2014he still loves his bath and shower time\u2014 and not wanting to traumatize him and make the situation worse. \n In speaking with the aquatic director, Donna, this week I learned that Tim feels like he isn\u2019t really contributing anything to our experience and feels bad making us pay for it. Tim wants to be able to teach Nik to swim; I want Tim to teach Nik how to love the water again. An interesting advocacy opportunity awaits in that I find I must continue to educate others about  letting go of their expectations  of what Nik\u2019s success will or should look like. We shall see how it goes; Tim has gotten the class program for the mom/tot program and will try some of the activities which involve music and games. We\u2019ll give it another week before we decide which way to go. \n Nik also got his new orthotics this week. It\u2019s a pretty big deal because they are very slim, low profile SMO\u2019s which only come up below the ankle and correct Nik\u2019s significant pronation/collapse. He has gradually gone from full-length molded supports with no articulation to an articulated ankle orthotic and now this. Within the  first  wearing, Nik\u2019s balance and stability improved dramatically. He still has a wide-based, uneven gait but his static balance (standing in one place) is better and he seems to have narrowed his stance to a slightly more typical new-walker stance instead of the  extremely  wide base he used before. Even Miss T noticed it this week during Nik\u2019s PT session. \n Nik\u2019s not yet  biting  on foods but he has progressed to  wanting  absolutely everything everyone else is eating! Nik and I went out to dinner with my parents last night \u2014Niksdad had to work \u2014and he impressed all of us with his insatiable appetite! Granted, his oral motor skill level is such that he may have only eaten an ounce of food in total but he made a concerted and eager effort to consume ravioli with meatballs (they were nice and soft, with lots of bread in them, I think), salad dressing on a cucumber slice, tastes of Nanny\u2019s stromboli, and his very own wedge of dough which he got to dip  repeatedly  in his own pasta sauce. He was a gooey, happy mess by the end of the meal \u2014and his grandparents were delighted at how social and animated he was with them. \n Animated is a great way to describe Nik lately. He\u2019s been so sing-songy and chattery  every single day . The amount of time he spends in what I call his  quiet zone  seems to be diminishing significantly \u2014with the exception of the occasional absence seizure which we still see once in a while. \n ***************************************************************************** Okay, I wrote all that mid-morning today.

Because of  Nik\u2019s  g-tube (which involves an actual hole in his abdominal wall), the  risk  of anything getting into his abdominal cavity is enough that, well, it\u2019s just one we can\u2019t take. Nik  voiced his opinion after the shower with a very loud raspberry and proceeded to play in his clean crib for forty-five minutes.   The rest of the night was spent in peaceful slumber for all.   Nik  is beginning to wake up; I can hear his sleeping singing through the monitor.  The sun is shining and a bright new day awaits.

{"date": "March 18, 2008 ", "body": "\n Gazing down on his peaceful face, I haven\u2019t got the heart to wake him but I must. This change to Daylight Savings time still has his system off kilter \u2014even with the melatonin. He wakes to play at two, three, four in the morning before going back to sleep until seven. He needs to nap but cannot fall asleep until nearly three in the afternoon; it is now after four and he needs some time awake before dinner and his meds.\n I whisper softly in my half-hearted attempt to wake him.  \u201cNiiiikolaaaaas,\u201d  I draw it out into sing-song call. He snuffles and presses his face deeper into the mattress of the crib. I know I shouldn\u2019t really do it because it\u2019s not great for my back \u2014or my wrist, which is in the midst of a carpal tunnel flare up\u2014 but I scoop him up and cradle him in my arms.  \u201cShhh,\u201d  I whisper in his ear as he begins to fuss at the indignation of being torn from his cozy lair. Tossing his head from side to side, he tries to get comfortable. I begin to hum the lullaby from  Mary Poppins  \u2014\u201cStay awake, don\u2019t rest your head. Don\u2019t lie down upon your bed\u2026\u201d  He sighs dreamily and snuggles his head in the crook of my neck. \n Continuing to hum, I make my way down the stairs with my not-so-little boy nestled in my arms like the treasure he is. Midway down the stairs, my eyes blur with unshed tears as I breathe in the childish scent of his soft skin and hair. I gently rub his back through his flannel jammies and think to myself that it won\u2019t be long before I cannot carry him like this anymore. The thought makes me sad. \n The tenderness of the moment reminds me that all the things we\u2019ve been through lately aren\u2019t really important. The bumpy patches of behavior, the loose bowels from his latest round of antibiotics, the massive amounts of laundry he has generated every single day for a week as a result of those same antibiotics, the wakefulness in the middle of the night \u2014they don\u2019t matter. \n What matters most are the moments of joyful connection we share with increasing frequency. The squeals of laughter as I blow raspberries on his neck and he pulls my head down for more and still more again. The gleam in his eyes as he holds out his arm to request a tickle with his Percy train going up and around his neck and over his shoulders. The tenderness with which he offers me his soft little lips for a kiss; the kisses he blows to me from across the playroom gate. \n Lately, I find myself being swept off my feet by this pint-sized charmer. He bangs his hand against the side of his chair and, unbidden, offers up his finger to me to kiss away the hurt. Where did he learn this? When? When did he make this tremendous cognitive leap and decide that he not only loves his mommy but he must show it at regular intervals? When did he decide that it was imperative that we take turns putting the shapes in his multitude of sorters? His little hand thrusting a block into mine then guiding it to the space it belongs; I pretend I don\u2019t know how to do it and he growls in \u2014what? disgust? \u2014and takes the shape from me as if to say  \u201cI\u2019ll show you, Mama.\u201d  Then he hands me another shape and wordlessly urges me to try again. \n I am grateful that he is always eager to give me another try. On the days when my patience is short and my voice is raised or I have, I am ashamed to admit, slapped his hand to keep him from pulling at the tube during feeding time (he is able to use that to pull the pump to him and turn it off or, worse, tip it over) \u2014in spite of all that,  he readily forgives and forgets. \n Like the days in which I can still carry him down the stairs, I know these days of easy forgiveness and unconditional love are also numbered. As he gets older and develops still greater awareness and understanding of the world around him, will he begin to remember all those moments and tote them up in a damning tally against me? Perhaps. \n But today, I bask in the glow from his laughing eyes and dimpled face as we dance and sing, tickle and sort, and find our way together. \n   \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R-AMQuSGYTI/AAAAAAAAAlI/x7SO8Ie2vMY/s1600-h/DSC02748.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/01/apparently-not-too-ill-for-her.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R-AO9-SGYWI/AAAAAAAAAlg/0AiQ8L6TzLg/s1600-h/DSC02769.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R-APXuSGYXI/AAAAAAAAAlo/qlIa2OE67p4/s1600-h/DSC02719.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R-AO9OSGYVI/AAAAAAAAAlY/InIbcj3VqBY/s1600-h/DSC02760.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/03/18/revels/", "title": "Revels"},

{"date": "March 6, 2008 ", "body": "(Subtitled:  Nikolas and the VERY BAD hair day ) In light of all the sweet comments about how well my  wild child-biker  boy  seemed to tolerate the ambulatory EEG, I must come clean. I confess to engaging in a bit of  Potemkin -izing in posting that photo. Not that the moment itself wasn\u2019t real; rather, it was only a  brief  moment of levity in a very long, tiring, frustrating day. One I wasn\u2019t quite ready to write about as it hadn\u2019t yet reached its d\u00e9nouement. If you consider the mystique of the \u201cbiker dude\u201d \u2013the  devil-may-care  attitude, the  I-do-what-I-want-when-I-want  swaggering bravado typified in biker lore \u2013well, you\u2019ll get a slight inkling as to how our day really went yesterday. To say Nik had his own agenda would be an utter understatement. His agenda? To get the hell out of the contraption on his head \u2013no matter what. Our agenda? To do whatever it took to keep it on for as long as possible. It was ill-fated from the start; someone was going to lose. The  initial  hookup went okay. Nik thrashed and cried but he did not have to be restrained or sedated; that is a major breakthrough for all of us. (Though, I must admit I might have wished to be sedated by the end of the day yesterday!). I say  initial  because we made three trips back to the EEG/Sleep Lab within the first four and a half hours to repair the damage done by little fingers and thrashing heads. The sticky paste on his head, the pressure of the little metallic cups of the electrodes, the tape, the wrap, the weight of the recorder pack \u2013which Niksdad brilliantly attached to Nik\u2019s beloved doggy backpack; all of it was a complete  sensory nightmare  for Nik. By the third visit, we had pretty much debugged the trouble areas where the tape and wrap weren\u2019t holding. We had to break down and wrap under Nik\u2019s chin, too. That made him ballistic! In the end, we brought supplies home to do our own repairs/reinforcements for bed time, knowing all too well that the electrodes wouldn\u2019t make it through the night with ol\u2019nimble fingers Nik! But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. In all, during the daytime, Nik tolerated the whole get-up quite well \u2013 as long as he was thoroughly entertained every waking moment . Both Niksdad and I spent the entire day playing with Nik, keeping his hands and mind distracted from the gooey, hard, dangling things on his scalp. We actually managed to have some fun together in the process, but boy was it exhausting! As I wrote to  Kristen  last night, hour-long shape sorting sessions aren\u2019t exactly my idea of a good time. The cool schmatta on Nik\u2019s head is actually his dad\u2019s  do-rag  which he wears under his motorcycle helmet in warm weather to help absorb perspiration. We thought it was less intimidating and less  post-brain-surgery  looking than the flesh-toned brown cling wrap on Nik\u2019s head. Nik didn\u2019t seem to agree and only kept it on long enough for a few good photo opportunities. I\u2019m telling you, the kid  knows  when he is on camera and expected to perform; that can be good and bad. In the middle of the night, Nik awoke with one of his painful episodes and freaked out because he couldn\u2019t get to his ear \u2013it was partially covered with the wrap and tape. In his feral hysteria, he managed to pull the entire wrap off in one  painful  motion \u2013along with the tape from his cheeks. As he flailed and screamed and wept, Nik kicked and glared at me. His expression vacillated between accusatory rage and pleading. My heart squeezed tight in my chest as I tried to stay calm. (Hey, I\u2019m great in a crisis but hell in the aftermath.) Niksdad and I managed to replace the leads which had come undone and I wrapped his head \u2013again. With a full day of school ahead of him, Niksdad returned to the oblivion of sleep; Nik lay in his crib, his little body wracked with angry sobs. He held onto my hand, squeezing intermittently, not quite willing to punish me in full measure and unable to let go of the comfort I offered. We stayed like that for more than an hour. I knelt by the side of the crib clinging to my composure and murmuring soothing shushing sounds as Nik began to relax. I felt like a supplicant at the altar; praying for redemption in the eyes and heart of my tiny, outraged savior. My absolution came on gentle, steady breaths as my child drifted off to a fitful, exhausted sleep. I lay on the floor and wept. A few short hours later, I awoke to the sounds of Nik laughing and clapping both his hands and his feet \u2013something he does when he is inordinately proud of some feat. Sure enough, Nik had managed to complete the job he had begun the night before \u2013the job I had interrupted with my cling wrap and tape. Nearly all the electrodes were detached and dangling from the tangled mass of his gooey hair. Cognizant of his decisive victory, Nik sat up in his crib, blowing kisses to me. We all knew it was a done deal that I was returning to the lab with Nik first thing this morning. We ended up completely disconnecting everything so they can download and analyze the information; hopefully, enough data was captured to be useful. If not, we will have to go back again this afternoon to try again for another 24 hours. I\u2019m not sure my sanity can withstand another assault so soon! **************************************************************** UPDATE: We dodged the bullet of another 24HR EEG! Whew! The doc is reviewing the data but the tech said they got a lot of good, clear recording \u2014especially at the times we noted that Nik seemed to have some type of possible seizure activity. Most of his episodes showed up during his sleep on previous EEG\u2019s so I hope they were able to get enough of the night time data in spite of Nik\u2019s \u201chat doffing\u201d exercise! Right now, Nik is in his jammies and down for quiet time; I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll sleep so I can, too!

{"date": "June 9, 2008 ", "body": "Today\u2019s CT scan got off to a slightly bumpy start.  When we discussed with the sedation doctor what specific concerns we were trying to rule out \u2014one of them being chronic mastoiditis\u2014 he told us the test that had been ordered  wouldn\u2019t  show us that.   It seems our pediatrician was under the misapprehension that a regular head CT scan would show the mastoid process and surrounding area.  The radiology team told us it is a common error made by many general pediatricians; we eventually got it straightened out and got  both  scans done. Nik was a total champ and handled things really well.  When he started to go into panic mode in the sedation room, we managed to find ways to occupy him.  Who knew that  velcro  falls into the same broad category as doors??  Yep \u2014they both  open and close .  Nik was endlessly fascinated with a small blood pressure cuff to the point that he held on to it right up until the time he went  \u201clights out!\u201d They let us stay with Nik during the scan (we had to wear our lead aprons) and it was all done pretty quickly.  The hardest part for me \u2014honestly\u2014 was trying not to cry as I watched my little guy lying so still on the bed of the scanner.  I couldn\u2019t understand why it was so emotional for me.  Then it hit me; in spite of all the surgeries and other sedated procedures Nik has been through, every other time we have simply watched him get pleasantly loopy and then handed him over to the care of strangers.  I never saw him laid out like he was today.  I must confess that it was a little unnerving. Nik came through recovery like a champ, too.  One minute he was out cold then \u2014WHAM! \u2014he was sitting straight up and wide awake.  Not exactly coordinated but awake.   Again,  velcro  came to our rescue when Nik got restless but wasn\u2019t quite ready to leave.   We were on our way home shortly after 1:30 this afternoon. On the way home we had to make some stops at places like Trader Joe\u2019s (it\u2019s the nearest one and we live an hour south of the hospital).  Nik did well and was his usual charming, chattering self.  I think our check out person wanted to take him home with her! Once home, Nik was pretty much back to normal.  Doctors do  not  believe us when we say that Nik metabolizes things incredibly quickly.  Nik\u2019s balance and coordination \u2014and personality\u2014 were back to his normal baseline within just a couple of hours after he woke up.  So we took him swimming!  Hey, why not??  It\u2019s not like he can swim unassisted and it was hot as blazes today.  My sister and her kids were out so we had the pool all to ourselves!  Almost like a mini vacation \u2014except not nearly long enough! So now, as before, we wait.

{"date": "June 10, 2008 ", "body": "In the interest of full disclosure \u2014and trying to be a responsible parent and blogger\u2014 I do need to clarify something about  yesterday\u2019s post . What Niksdad and I chose to do in taking Nik swimming was  not  wise and  definitely  not recommended practice.  In fact, someone \u2014 whose opinion I value  and who has professional experience with things of this nature\u2014 did contact me offline to remind me why it is generally  not  a good idea to take a child swimming after they\u2019ve been sedated.  This person reminded me of the lower muscle tone often found in autistics and the sometimes barely noticeable muscle weakness and sedation which can continue to have an effect up to 24 hours later. I am not posting this information for the purpose of self-flagellation; at the time we made the decision it did  seem  like Nik was fine and we  were  extremely cautious with him.  He never left our grasp and we didn\u2019t let him get too rambunctious; we focused more on the pressure of the water and its soothing sensory effects. However, my blog friend\u2019s  very sage advice  also reminded me that anything can happen in an instant.  I like to think that I am careful and diligent but you just never know  what can happen .  So, the next time I want to take Nik swimming after sedation, maybe I\u2019ll just sit in the bath tub with him.  He\u2019s too precious to risk.

{"date": "June 14, 2008 ", "body": "We finally heard from  Dr. Mary  late Friday afternoon; she called to discuss the results of  Nik\u2019s CT scan.   Frankly, we\u2019re not really sure what it all means.  They found  something  \u2014which could be something  quite serious  or it could be something  not so serious .  I suppose it all depends on what the ENT has to say when we get to see him.  I have to call first thing Monday to get an emergency appointment (my wording, not Dr. Mary\u2019s).  The scan \u2014specifically, the extra view we had to really push for\u2014 provided some surprises for us.  First of all, the right side \u2014the one which has given Nik so much trouble and which swells on a daily basis\u2014 appeared  completely normal!   The left side, however, showed significant signs of possible  mastoiditis  (of the chronic or \u201cmasked\u201d variety, meaning it won\u2019t manifest with sudden onset, fever, redness, etc,) along with some more indication of some sort of infection or as yet unidentified opacification of the  ethmoid bone . Mores simply put, it  could  be that Nik has a super-wicked sinus infection \u2014in spite of having  no  outward manifestation which would lead to that conclusion\u2014 or he has some serious damage to the mastoid process and part of the ethmoid bone.  It could be the result of his chronic, persistent ear infections which have never had any accompanying drainage.  It is  possible  that \u2014in spite of his having repeated courses of antibiotics, a tympanostomy, and ear tubes already\u2014 all the fluid actually drained into those bony areas and became trapped in all the little sponge-like air cells.   Highly undesirable conditions with potential long-term effects. As I said, we won\u2019t know until we\u2019ve seen the ENT and possibly done some more testing.  Meanwhile, as a matter of precaution, Nik is on a new antibiotic; rather, one he\u2019s never had before and one which is reserved for  \u201cserious infections\u201d  as the patient information pamphlet so ominously states.  If it  is  mastoiditis and it\u2019s left untreated it could rapidly become something worse which I won\u2019t get into; it\u2019s not worth my getting upset and scaring people when we don\u2019t know anything yet. This new drug is used for things like MRSA\u2019s and is  extremely  harsh  on the gastrointestinal system; I anticipate Nik will be a bit uncomfortable within 24 hours. I, on the other hand, will be extremely uncomfortable until we see the damned ENT.   This is another one of those instances where we have voiced suspicions and asked the question  \u201cCould this be some sort of chronic, sub clinical mastoiditis?\u201d  and been told  \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t have any of the symptoms; you\u2019d know if it were mastoiditis\u201d   by so-called specialists.

{"date": "April 2, 2008 ", "body": "I\u2019m still  stewing  on my thoughts and reaction to  Autism: The Musical  and hope to share them with you soon. Meanwhile, here\u2019s a rambling update on life in Nik\u2019s house lately\u2026 I am thrilled to report that the  duct tape experiment  has been a  rousing  success! Not only has Nik  not  tried to wiggle his way out of the tape (and, therefore, his pajamas), he\u2019s become quite enamored of the process! I can\u2019t help but wonder if the slight snugness of the tape around his upper torso provides some proprioceptive input that is comforting to him. By the third day of taping him into his pajamas, Nik began to willingly put his hands up in the air to assist in the process! It\u2019s really very cute to watch. I won\u2019t question the  whys  and  wherefores ; I will simply say that  my washing machine  no longer feels abused on a daily basis! Of course, to every  yin  there is a  yang , to every  up  a  down . Though we\u2019ve managed to quell the  Houdini  and  Poocasso  behavior, there has been an  increase  once again in Nik\u2019s  mysterious pain episodes  which seem to strike without warning. There have been nights when the only thing I could do was hold Nik in my arms in the aftermath of some pretty horrific head-banging, face-punching, writhing episodes. One night, through his tears, Nik started to hum his favorite song from  Mary Poppins ; the poor dear was  trying to soothe himself  and asking me to help! Niksdad and I are absolutely  certain  it is not seizure activity; we see  the neurologist  this Friday and will discuss other possibilities to explore. I still think it has something to do with some type of cluster headache or other vascular activity. Nik gets this odd swelling of the area over his right mastoid process \u2014almost as if his skull is swelling but it isn\u2019t.  Mastoiditis  has been ruled out \u2014the symptoms are too erratic and they just don\u2019t quite seem to fit \u2014though no CT scan or x-ray has been done to  definitively  eliminate the possibility. Niksdad and I wonder if it could have something to do with his  lymphatic system  as he\u2019s been getting so many infections, too. The search for signs of  intelligent medical life  to aid us in solving the mystery continues\u2026 In spite of the ups and downs of these sudden pain attacks, Nik is  thriving . Each day brings some new and highly amusing thing. Lately, it has been an  impressive  display of his age-appropriate evasive tactics when it is time to get in his chair for a meal (and at bed time, too). Well, that and some  highly  impressive (and rather unorthodox) motor planning and  following instructions . See for yourself in the video below. (Sorry, it\u2019s kind of long but I cannot edit QuickTime videos in Windows.) \n\n Now, please bear in mind that this is the same child who just  started walking  last August, at the age of 3 and three-quarters years. The same child who is considered legally blind in one eye. The same child who was once labeled as having  diminished mental capacity . When I look at this video, I  marvel  at the progress Nik has made and I am reminded of the  miracles  that can happen with love, determination, and faith. There are some things  no one  can ever know or predict; parents who simply swallow whole the dire pronouncements of doctors about the future of their children are, in my opinion, only serving to  ensure  that bleak future comes to pass. In a related vein, there\u2019s lots of advocacy-related stress going on behind the scenes here the past week or two; continuing to negotiate with Medicaid to provide coverage for Nik\u2019s therapies \u2014as well as pushing for an increase to help boost some emerging skills and develop some critical new ones, finding the right medical avenues to explore for answers to the mysterious episodic pain, and \u2014as of Monday \u2014a struggle to get Nik\u2019s communication devices. It feels like we\u2019ve gone from cruise control on the open road to stop and go traffic in rush hour \u2014 say on I-5 or the beltway!  Days which once seemed wonderfully smooth and easy are suddenly filled with mountains of paper work, follow up phone calls, more paper work, more phone calls, and efforts to keep my cool in the face of idiotic bureaucracy. But I\u2019ll save that for another post \u2014one which may require a bit of a preface. There\u2019s more  good stuff  going on\u2026but I\u2019m going to have to write that in yet  another  post. LOTS to catch up on\u2026 ************************************************************************************* ETA: Oops, thanks  Kristen  for asking  \u201cHow you doin\u2019?\u201d * I forgot to mention that my fall down the stairs last week seems to have left me none the worse for wear.

{"date": "April 5, 2008 ", "body": "Can someone  please  explain to me how it is that insurance case managers think they know diddly squat about things like augmentative/alternative communication (AAC or AugComm) devices?  Seriously.  Now, I\u2019m not talking about the rare one who may actually  BE  a user of AAC his/herself, or who may have a background in speech and language pathology, or who may,  possibly , be a nurse who has worked with individuals who use AAC. No, I\u2019m talking about your  run-of-the-mill  case manager. \n \n \n \n \n \n But I\u2019ll get back to her shortly\u2026 \n When Nik had his  AAC evaluation  in January, we \u2014the team, which consisted of an AAC specialist who\u2019s been doing this for roughly fifteen or more years, an occupational therapist, Nik\u2019s speech therapist, and me \u2014agreed upon certain points of information and technology; the first, and foremost, being that Nik is still very much in the  \u201cpre-emerging\u201d  communication stage. He does not yet have a consistent method of communicating his wants and needs; he relies on random use of grunts, claps, joint referencing, and dragging a person toward whatever it is he wants. In some cases, Nik will resort to extreme behavior such as crying, thrashing, hitting his head on the floor \u2014but only in what he might consider dire circumstances. Nik, being the independent spirit that he is, is pretty self-sufficient; if no one is around to get what he wants he either finds an alternate means of getting it himself or he simply changes his mind and moves on to something else. \n In some ways Nik\u2019s self-sufficiency is a good thing; in other ways, it works to his detriment. Where everyone \u2014Niksdad and I included \u2014sees it as a wonderful thing that our son is so easy going and happily entertains himself, it has actually kept us from recognizing that  Nik doesn\u2019t understand how to communicate.  He knows that he  wants  to communicate and he  tries ; but his scatter shot method is not terribly effective. As long as someone is constantly with him we can interpret his body language or eye gazes. But when he is left to his own devices, Nik cannot effectively communicate. That is, it goes without saying, something that is vital to get along in the world outside our tiny little home. \n Out of the AAC evaluation, we determined that Nik needs to be taught  intentional  communication; he needs to understand that there is a dance, a give and take which he can initiate and elicit responses which can give him a  tremendous  amount of power and autonomy. The question Niksdad and I \u2014and even Miss M, his wonderful speech therapist \u2014didn\u2019t know how to answer was  How? How do we teach Nik to communicate besides simply modeling it for him? How do we take our highly intelligent and resourceful child and open up a whole new world to him in a way that makes sense and works for him? \n While he was in school, Nik\u2019s therapists and teachers diligently tried to use some variant of a picture exchange communication system ( PECS ) to help him express himself. The problem, or so everyone assumed, was Nik\u2019s visual impairment; no one really knew what he could see with his right eye \u2014we still don\u2019t. When PECS was clearly  not  successful, they moved on to what I call  enhanced   PECS ; the staff simply added some sort of tactile bits to the picture cards.  \n \n I remember the teacher giving me a moderately large wooden letter P which someone had painted with dots of green textured paint. The green was because that seemed to be the color Nik either preferred or could see best (we still don\u2019t\u2019 really know as Nik can now pretty much sort and identify colors of blocks at will), while the textured, bumpy  paint was, ostensibly, to assist Nik in realizing that the wooden object in his hand  meant something.  He was supposed to carry this letter P with him when he was outside the classroom. There was a mate to this letter P on the wall outside the classroom door.  In theory , Nik was supposed to be able to match the two letters and know that this was where he was supposed to go. Quite a tall order for a child who still does not know his letters and who, at the time, was unable to match shapes or colors. \n Needless to say, the experiment was not a success and they simply gave up. I mean, really, it was somewhat akin to handing a two year old your car keys in the kitchen and expecting them to find their way out to the car, open it up and insert the key in the ignition. The child may know that they are holding keys, and they may have some vague understanding of what a car does (takes them \u201czoom-zoom\u201d with Mommy or Daddy), but the concept of  the relationship  between the two is a long way off. The objects are simply that \u2014objects. They are concrete; the child does not yet understand what they represent. \n \n Once I understood that, I finally understood why PECS and the large, green, bumpy letter P didn\u2019t work. Nik was not yet \u2014 is not quite yet \u2014 at a point where he understands symbols. To him, that large lumpy letter P wasn\u2019t even the letter P. It was just a bumpy shiny thing that felt kind of neat in his mouth. The PECS cards? Perfectly sized, shiny things to tear off a chart and throw as he listened to the  rrrriiippp  of the Velcro. \n This brings us back to the AAC evaluation and the question of  how  to bridge Nik\u2019s specific communication gap. \n I know I\u2019ve said it before that the evaluator was incredible. Truly, this man had  near-mystic  insights into my child that I thought only Niksdad or I might have. He recognized Nik\u2019s strong connection to music and sound and his need to control things through cause and effect type mechanisms \u2014 and then figured out how to put them to work in Nik\u2019s favor . The perfect solution \u2014I thought this at the time when it was still an abstract to me and I think it even more now that it has become a concrete reality \u2014is a programmable switch which can be used to record multiple messages which Nik can then activate by a simple touch.  \n \n The actual device is called a  Little Step by Step 75 . I can set up multiple sequences of things such as getting dressed, getting ready to go out in the car, getting ready for bed, and many others. I simply introduce the button to Nik and have him press it once for the first step in the sequence.  \u201cTime to get ready for bed! Let\u2019s get my pajamas.\u201d  Then we do that step. He touches the button again  \u201cLet\u2019s take off my shoes and socks.\u201d  We do it. And so on. Or, I can program every other line of a song we might sing together so he can sing a line and then I sing a line. The idea is to teach him the give and take, the cause and effect of intent. He communicates \u201cX\u201d and then we actually do \u201cX\u201d and so on. \n At first it was very haphazard; it took us a while to figure out some set routines and to teach Nik to wait; this isn\u2019t a toy for him to play with. It\u2019s not perfect by any stretch yet, but we are seeing some remarkable progress. Where Nik once wanted to press the button repeatedly and didn\u2019t really pay attention to the words, he now waits and even looks from the button to us as if he knows he\u2019s supposed to push the button before we do the next step in a sequence. \n The second part of what we learned from the AAC evaluation is how to help Nik learn to make  conscious  choices. At the time, his only method of making choices was to simply grab at whichever of two objects we presented. Often, he would grab at the one closest to him and it wasn\u2019t always the one he really wanted. So another device, similar to the Step by Step, was introduced. The  iTalk2  is a nifty two-button device which allows us to record a single message for each button. We can use it for teaching things like  \u201cNik\u2019s turn; Mommy\u2019s turn\u201d  or for giving him choices between two toys or objects (shapes, colors, etc.). We record the message for each button and then reinforce it with a photograph of the toy, or the object being offered. Once the choices are made, we can switch the pictures and messages to reinforce the need for Nik to both  look and listen  as he presses the desired button.  \n For example, we offer Nik a choice between his  \u201ckitty cat piano\u201d  and  \u201cnumber train;\u201d  whichever button he presses we give him the  corresponding object. If he rejects it, we swap the buttons and try again. It\u2019s not yet consistent but Nik is definitely beginning to catch on to the whole choice concept. \n Now, let me interject here that  these are by no means long term solutions.  They are a first step to help Nik make some cognitive connections about  how  to communicate. Once he\u2019s doing fairly well with these devices we will go back for a follow-up session with the AAC evaluator and look at additional ways to use these devices and/or what is next. \n The wonderful thing about the button devices is that they are  simple  \u2014both in operation and visual presentation. This is  critical  right now where Nik cannot tolerate a lot of \u201cvisual clutter\u201d and does not yet have strong visual scanning skills; when he gets too much visual input, Nik tunes  all  of it out. I sometimes think this is why Nik doesn\u2019t have a lot of interest in books; they require too much effort for him to be able to discriminate what he sees on the pages. The simpler and cleaner the page, the better he tolerates it \u2014even better if the pictures are actual photographs instead of illustrations. \n Another great thing about these particular devices is that they aren\u2019t terribly expensive; if you\u2019ve had any experience with AAC then you can appreciate how expensive even the \u201centry level\u201d technology can be for certain types of speech generating devices. These two devices cost in the  low hundreds  versus the  thousands . And, because they are deemed medically necessary, state Medicaid regulations mandate that this expense be borne by Nik\u2019s insurance. That\u2019s a blessing for us right now as we are squeaking by while Niksdad is in nursing school and I am not able to work. \n Thus, we come full circle to the case manager. \n Because I knew there would be a significant processing time for all the paperwork to be completed by the pediatrician and then the authorizations and vendor quotes, etcetera, I arranged to borrow both devices from our state assistive technology group ( DATI ). Once I finally gathered together all the requisite forms and information, I contacted the vendor to arrange the quote and finalize purchase arrangements. \n SCREEEECH \u2026(the sound of the brakes being slammed on!) It seems this vendor, the only one in our region who handles these specific devices, will  not  do business with our managed care organization (MCO) because they have been burned in previous transactions.  Swell . \n So, I placed a call to our  marginally  helpful, marginally  less supportive  case manager, to find out how to proceed. Her response underwhelmed me.  \n \n In spite of the fact that she and I had already discussed these devices, and the fact that no other manufacturer has anything like them, she told me to call another manufacturer to see if they had something like it! It seems Nik\u2019s MCO  doesn\u2019t actually have  any AAC providers they work with; I\u2019m guessing for the same reason we\u2019ve encountered. They do have a moderate relationship with  DynaVox  \u2014perhaps because it\u2019s a large enough company to have a national sales team and can cut out the distributors? None of which matters since  DynaVox doesn\u2019t have a comparable device! \n I contacted the evaluator for some assistance; he\u2019s been doing this so long that he is the  go to guy  for all things AugComm in our area and knows all the manufacturers and their product lines. He told me that  none  of the providers he knows want to work with Nik\u2019s MCO. So, here we are caught between a rock and a hard place. I\u2019ve got devices that we are using and seeing actual progress with but I have to return them on April 14th. I\u2019ve got a vendor that has the devices we need and an MCO that has, essentially, tossed the whole mess back into my lap to solve. \n Oh, and the case manager took it upon herself to call  DynaVox*  and  thinks  she has found a device which would \u201cwork well for Nik\u201d and she\u2019s getting a quote and working on authorizations. Wow.  And to think I wasted all that time going to the most highly respected specialist in the state for an evaluation and recommendation?  Who knew I could simply call the MCO case manager \u2014because she obviously knows so much about AAC and thinks that  this   is at all similar to  this  and  this . And the whole  inability to understand symbols and visual scanning for choices , etc? Obviously not a problem in her mind. \n I wonder if she does open heart surgery, too. Or prescribes eyeglasses and seizure meds.  \n ****************************************************************************** *  I also called DynaVox and spoke with a very helpful sales person. When I described where we are in the process of teaching Nik how to communicate, she agreed that the device they have for \u201cemerging communicators\u201d was probably a bit advanced for Nik right now. She did offer to have the regional sales rep come to our home and show us the device so we could be absolutely certain; we  may  do that just so we have crossed the T\u2019s and dotted the I\u2019s. \n Sigh. Another waste of our already limited time\u2026 \n Stay tuned as the saga continues. \n ****************************************************************************** ETA: Thank you for some of the comments specifically about some steps to take. In my haste to post this, I neglected to note that I  have  spoken with the Executive Director of DATI (which is also the key assistive technology advocacy organization in our state). She has already begun a dialogue with the top people at Medicaid \u2014 the ones responsible for  selecting  the MCO\u2019s and determining policy, etc. They are working to resolve our specific problem as of Friday. In the longer term, they are looking into whether this is a more systemic issue and how to resolve it for all their stakeholders. I suspect it  is  systemic and needs to be addressed.  \n We have also been advised that we should not purchase the devices ourselves because that starts us on a slippery slope which may bite us in the rear later. I anticipate that we will go through several iterations of AAC devices for Nik before we are through, so getting this resolved quickly is a top priority. \n I\u2019ll keep you all posted on the progress. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/01/he-leads-us-merry-dance.html", "http://www.pecs.com/whatispecs.htm", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R_eVZsDAj4I/AAAAAAAAAnk/lZJf8adRnYQ/s1600-h/Letter+P.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R_eM1cDAjyI/AAAAAAAAAm0/JHGjBSZgPFQ/s1600-h/AAC_Step.jpg", "http://www.ablenetinc.com/item_detail.aspx?ItemCode=10000403", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R_eNH8DAjzI/AAAAAAAAAm8/wF9BGZ2HpMQ/s1600-h/AAC_iTalk2.jpg", "http://www.ablenetinc.com/item_detail.aspx?ItemCode=10001200", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R_ePi8DAj2I/AAAAAAAAAnU/C6-6akSdScg/s1600-h/kitty+piano.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R_eP7sDAj3I/AAAAAAAAAnc/q3CYkWvDimc/s1600-h/Train_Number.jpg", "http://www.dati.org/", "http://www.dynavoxtech.com/", "http://www.dynavoxtech.com/", "http://www.dynavoxtech.com/products/m3.aspx", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R_eOQsDAj1I/AAAAAAAAAnM/5aJKRRINoqU/s1600-h/AAC_M3.jpg", "http://www.ablenetinc.com/item_detail.aspx?ItemCode=10000403", "http://www.ablenetinc.com/item_detail.aspx?ItemCode=10001200"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/04/05/communique-revised/", "title": "Communiqu\u00e9 (revised)"},

My sister and I go to the gym together at least four mornings a week; last night, not quite certain why I felt it so strongly, I sent my sister a text message to preempt our daily workout. Niksdad started a new job today \u2014 his first as an LPN \u2014 but didn\u2019t need to leave until well after I would normally be home and showered. Nik has had a couple of bumpy days since we\u2019ve begun to increase his Lamictal in preparation for weaning him from the Depakene for his seizures. (You may recall  my recent revelations  about the 18-month long saga of Nik\u2019s  mysterious, debilitating pain ?) We\u2019ve seen a recurrence of  some  of the disorientation and ataxia, as well as a marked decrease both in his appetite and his ability to cope with sudden, unexpected change. Little did I know when I listened to the voice in my head last night that I would wake this morning to a very sick little boy. His usual happy morning singing and chirping were notably absent \u2014replaced by whimpering and moaning instead. When I picked him up, Nik was burning up and his eyes were glassy. I\u2019m fairly certain he has  another  ear infection \u2014a whopper this time. His fever spiked to 103.7 degrees Fahrenheit and the poor little guy has passed out in the middle of the floor while playing with one of his favorite toys. We see our pal,  Dr. Mary , this afternoon. Meanwhile, since I am not out racing around to Nik\u2019s various appointments and such, I have time to catch up on a few blogging related things. You know, making lemonade and all that\u2026 If you aren\u2019t familiar with  Alltop  go check it out!

I am honored to share the  stage  page with the likes of  Kristina Chew ,  Vicki Forman , and a  host of others . Just goes to show, there\u2019s a little something for everyone out there! Kind of makes up for my feeling like the kid who\u2019s grounded while all her friends get to go to the  prom   BlogHer . I am  so  down that I cannot make the trip to meet up with some of my absolute favorite bloggers this side of the universe.

{"date": "May 14, 2008 ", "body": "It is difficult for me to write these days; I struggle to find both the time and the words to express all that is going on.  Rather than giving snippets out of context, I simply don\u2019t write.  And yet, I feel like I have left people hanging, wondering what else is going on, why I am so quiet lately. This post  is a pretty accurate depiction of events which are now occurring multiple times daily; Nik\u2019s  mysterious pain episodes  seem to be changing, taking on a demeanor that, frankly, I don\u2019t like.  The frequency has diminished, that\u2019s true, but the duration and intensity have both been ratcheted up significantly.  And the aftermath \u2014the cursed aftermath \u2014now leaves Nik limp and lethargic for a while.  Whereas he used to simply shrug it off and bounce right back, Nik now needs a good twenty minutes or so of very quiet, low-key activity before he can resume his normal hijinks. [NB:  We have an appointment with  the neurologist  tomorrow morning to discuss this again.  Also, we have finally gotten  our pediatrician  to order a CT scan and numerous blood tests to rule out any number of possible \u2014but \u201cstatistically unlikely\u201d\u2014 causes for these awful episodes.] The disturbed sleep patterns also continue; their frequency seems to escalate as the intensity of the daytime episodes increases.  As I joked with my mother on the phone today, Nik and I are both sporting such dark circles under our eyes that it\u2019s in danger of becoming a permanent family characteristic.  I joke, I laugh and make light because it is how I have dealt with such things most of my life. I don\u2019t have to tell you how I  truly  feel; if you have read my blog for even a short while \u2014and if you have children of your own, be they with or without special challenges or circumstances \u2014you know the pain and frustration I am feeling.  So, instead of dwelling on it, I choose to shine the spotlight on the positive and wonderful things that are happening with Nik.  That, too, is my coping mechanism \u2014deflecting the attention away from the things I don\u2019t want to think about or deal with.  But know that for every  wonderful ,  glowing   post  I write \u2014about Nik\u2019s  learning a new sign , making some tremendous cognitive or social/emotional connection, or some funny thing he\u2019s done recently \u2014there are just as many I could write about the sleepless nights, the pain of not being able to help my child, or my utter frustration with a medical system which places disparate faith in a parent\u2019s intuition, insights, and observations. Sometimes, when I feel too full of the emotions, too raw from the continuum of pain-filled days, sometimes I can find the words to share it and I do.  In the sharing of my pain, my burden is temporarily eased; I can feel the weight shifting onto the shoulders or into the outstretched hands of my sisters \u2014and brothers\u2014 on this shared yet unique journey.  When I have regained my strength and my perspective \u2014my pluck\u2014I reach out my hands to hold you, in turn. Lately, I have felt like a bad blogging friend; my thoughts are often scattered as I read a post so I bookmark it to go back to and then forget to do so for days on end.  I\u2019ve been remiss in following up on comments left on my blog or memes and awards.  It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care, truly!  It\u2019s just that these latest weeks of escalation have just kicked my ass around the block and back again.  So, I beg of you dear friends, don\u2019t let go of that lifeline you\u2019ve been holding for me.  I\u2019m struggling and may be down, but I\u2019m not entirely out\u2026and I\u2019ll be back.

It could be from the antibiotic \u2014unlikely as he\u2019s taken this one many times with no side effects, but you never know. It could be \u2014waaaay scarier \u2014a  rash  caused by one of his seizure meds. We talked to our  awesome neurologist  this evening (he even gave us his cell phone number!) and he told us to  stop the medication entirely . Not something that is normally recommended with this kind of med but he wanted to err on the side of caution as the alternative could be, um,  potentially permanent . Then again, it could be something viral like  roseola . Or, possibly, something else entirely.

In spite of the long drive \u2014an hour up and  two and a half hours back  courtesy of summer traffic to the DE and MD beaches\u2014 we got a diagnosis  and some reassurance . Basically, Nik has (had?) something called  Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP)  which, though I\u2019d never heard of it until today, is apparently moderately common; especially in kids Nik\u2019s age.  It\u2019s some kind of vasculitis caused by either a viral or bacterial infection \u2014or sometimes from reactions certain meds.  Fortunately, for us, Nik does not appear to be allergic to either his current antibiotic \u2014a good thing since we\u2019re already pretty limited in what he can take\u2014 or to his seizure medication. At this point, there\u2019s nothing we can do, really, except manage the symptoms; he can only have Tylenol for the next few weeks because of his upcoming surgery (ear tubes put in and adenoids removed on the 30th).  We just have to keep an eye on the rash and call the doc if it gets worse.  Otherwise, things should resolve in a matter of a week or two \u2014or six. When we finally made it home, I had a raging headache and needed a nap.  Niksdad took Nik out for a while to burn off some pent up energy from our long car ride.  When they returned and I awoke \u2014much refreshed \u2014we took our little fish to my sister\u2019s house for a swim.  Forty-five minutes in the water was just what the doctor ordered for all of us! Too pooped to care about nutrition, we had take out from Applebee\u2019s.

{"date": "August 7, 2008 ", "body": "They say that those who can\u2019t do teach; I suppose it follows, then, that those who don\u2019t have live vicariously. ~ Anonymous Sometimes crises have a way of showing us the spaces in our lives which are empty; whether by design or lack of attention \u2014or fear. Whenever I find myself feeling things too deeply, my natural inclination is to hide myself away from the world.  I withdraw \u2014not into myself, that\u2019s the last place I want to be then \u2014into the realm of fiction and fantasy, books and movies.  These past couple of weeks I\u2019ve practically been holding a one-woman film festival! Really.  I\u2019ve seen  Mamma Mia  (twice!).  The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants , watched several mediocre comedies with my husband, watched a few videos at home  by myself (including some of the Jane Austen series which aired on PBS);  I\u2019ve even seen one of the latest summer \u201cblockbusters\u201d with  my husband \u2014 in the theater , the week it came out!  I\u2019ve read six romantic novels and still find myself yearning for a trip to the library.  The emotions I\u2019m avoiding are just too much; I fear feeling them all at once so I let myself feel nothing \u2014unless it relates to a fictional character. With a few exceptions, nearly all of the books and movies I\u2019ve immersed myself in celebrate relationships between women.  Oh sure, on the surface the romance novels are about romantic heterosexual love but each strong heroine shares a  deep bond of friendship  \u2014sisterhood \u2014with other strong women.  And some of those matinees?  They were attended by groups of women who shared the experience \u2014the laughter and the tears, exclaiming  \u201cWe need to do this again!\u201d  as they walked out of the theater hugging. Once upon a time,  I was one of those women.   I used to live and work (in various parts of the country) where I always had a moderate but intimate circle of female friends \u2014women I could call upon when the world felt as though it were about to come crashing down.  Women who were there to share the joys and laughter along the way.  Women who were up for the adventures of jello shots or tequila shooters in SoHo, dim sum in Chinatown, a night at the Met, endless coffees at Starbucks; you name it and we probably tried it \u2014or  at least  thought about it! I\u2019ve never been very good at maintaining relationships through time and distance (though I think I could be better  now ).  I know it takes to two tango and all that but it has nearly always been the case that when geography separated me from my friends the relationships withered and blew away like so much dust; the truth is that I hated to be so vulnerable and it was easier to let go \u2014to move on and find new friends.  When Nik was born geography was no longer the factor which kept me out of touch; it was the medically imposed restrictions on limiting Nik\u2019s exposure \u2014at first.  Then, it became awkward with even my closest friends.  They didn\u2019t know what to say; they were caught somewhere in the snare of feeling helpless to make things better for us and of feeling relieved that it was us not them facing the tremendous challenges we all knew lay ahead for my family.  After a while, it simply became easier and easier for me to pull back from social interactions which might have nothing to do with my son or with being the mother to a child with special needs.  Sure, I still have a couple of really close friends but they are far away. The me I used to know \u2014the one who had deep, rich meaningful relationships with other women \u2014vanished.   After all, I had more important matters to take care of; there was no time for \u201cmy selfish needs.\u201d   Lately, though, I find myself  yearning  for those friendships again;  Evan\u2019s death  provided the catalyst.  The walls I so carefully constructed after Nik was born were shattered in a heartbeat; the dam holding back my fears \u2014my deepest, rawest emotions \u2014burst forth in  a torrent I cannot control.   The outpourings of love and support for  Vicki  \u2014for her entire family \u2014made me stop and wonder:  What if it had been Nik?  Would I have those relationships to sustain me?  Who would hold me up when I could not stand for the burden of my grief?  Who would be there to laugh with me in those early days and to tell me it was okay \u2014that laughter is cleansing and healing.  Who would be there to celebrate the life he lived, the gifts he gave?  To tell me it is okay to continue living? The answer has been sobering \u2014and a little frightening.

I feel  compelled  to mention that, though I live in my hometown, we only recently moved back here; as soon as Nik came off of his supplemental oxygen in April 2005, we packed up and moved across country to be closer to our families and the support system they might offer.

Also, since we moved back here, Niksdad has immersed himself in school \u2014striving to create a better life for us.  It is demanding and exhausting for him and, sometimes, lonely for me.  Anyone who has supported a spouse going through school will understand, I think.  There are no problems, per se, just not an awful lot of energy left to go around.  We are both depleted. While he has been off for the summer, Niksdad and I have helped each other recharge, reconnect, and regroup.  We\u2019ve functioned as the great team that we are \u2014we always have been \u2014and he has been highly supportive of me taking time just for myself; for a while I\u2019ve been content to wander alone.  Yet, as the start of the school year approaches \u2014the final and most challenging of Niksdad\u2019s program \u2014I realize how much I need from others to help me feel recharged \u2014to be able to keep going when it\u2019s grueling and I\u2019m tired and want to lie down and sleep through it all.  It\u2019s been a wake up call for me. I am so incredibly blessed to have found blogging not only as an outlet for self-expression but as a means of making some deep, meaningful connections \u2014connections I want to nurture as I never have in the past and create real friendships.  Those connections are important \u2014vital \u2014to me; in fact, they have helped me reconnect with parts of myself that have little to do with being Niksmom and more to do with simply being a woman. Still, one must admit, there is nothing quite the same as the warmth of a friend\u2019s embrace be it in greeting, in celebration, or in sorrow.  That is the thing which I lack and which I must now begin to find again.

Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt. ~Lao Tzu \n \n Step one \u2014 make room: \n Dear People-I-Have-Come-to-Honor-and-Respect, I want to let you all know that I will no longer be participating with the [names of groups here]. As you know, circumstances change; taking care of my family is a top priority. When I undertook each of those commitments my family was in a very different place; Nik was in school and Niksdad was just embarking upon his new career path. Now, I am home schooling Nik and coordinating his many therapies \u2014to which he is responding very well \u2014and Niksdad\u2019s school and work schedule are quite demanding. He begins his last year of the RN program on August 25th and will be in a combination of classes and clinical rotations Monday through Friday (both days and evenings) in addition to his LPN job on weekends. As Nik gets more and more active and has significant developmental bursts, I need to create some more specific structure for him so that he continues to progress; he is not the sort of child one can expect to sit and play quietly in a conference room while Mommy is in a meeting down the hall. Our childcare experiment back in April was what helped me to realize that Nik needs something different right now. I do think that some sort of on-site childcare may work for some families and should be offered as an option to encourage more parents to participate. I did not make this decision lightly; I believe in the work we are doing and I hate to feel I amletting other people down. The truth of the matter, though, is that I would be letting my family down if I made any other choice right now. I firmly believe that advocacy must begin at home and there is much that demands my attention here now; both of my guys need my full support to be successful. Thank you for all the opportunities you have provided for me to learn and grow as a leader, and to contribute to the success of children and families in our state.

{"date": "July 1, 2008 ", "body": "How much time do I spend in turmoil, wailing and gnashing my teeth, and wondering\u2014 \u201cWill he ever\u2026?\u201d \u201cCan he even\u2026?\u201d \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he\u2026?\u201d If I stop to remind myself that Nik does things in his own time, I am able to let go of the anxiety; Nik has shown me countless times that he is capable but he must find his own pace, his own rhythm. And when he finds that groove \u2014that perfect chemistry that only Nik can know \u2014magic happens. **************************************************************** So many babies who have some sort of special medical needs from birth or shortly after \u2014be it from extreme prematurity, genetic anomaly, or some sort of trauma or insult surrounding gestation or birth\u2014 end up being given so many medications;  this   one  to stave off infection,  that one  to keep the heart from stopping periodically,  another one  to help with digestion, seizures, blood clotting \u2014and so on. The longer term ramifications of these medications can not ever truly be known though  reasonably  logical conclusions can be drawn from years of accumulated data. Still, when a parent is faced with life and death choices, it can be more than difficult to weigh and measure the long-term effects of a particular drug against the permanence of losing one\u2019s child. One is forced to make imperfect choices with little objectivity. **************************************************************** Nik began having  absence seizures   when he was roughly fifteen months old. At first, we thought they were simple staring spells \u2014Nik\u2019s little way of finding respite from the bombardment of sensory input which accompanied the revolving door of therapists and visiting nurses to our home and frequent trips to one or another doctor in the cadre of specialists for all of his  -isms, -itises,  and  \u2013oses.  It wasn\u2019t until he was two that Nik finally got an official diagnosis and began yet another medication. We went through a few different meds before we found the one which seemed to be the most effective with the least negative side effects. Little did we realize that the cure would also bring about a new problem. Apparently, as we gradually ramped up to the appropriate maintenance dose, Nik began to experience a marked sense of disorientation and dissociation. He felt funny; his balance and coordination \u2014already grossly delayed\u2014were significantly impaired. Because we had no basis for comparison, Niksdad and I did not realize it. With each incremental increase in the medication Nik felt the fuzziness invading his head. Because he couldn\u2019t tell us with words or signs, he told us in the only way he could;  he began waking with screams and howls as he shook and swatted at his head in his attempts to make the sensation go away.  We never made the connection between the medications Nik received at dinner with the behavior which occurred hours later. The onset was  so gradual  that we thought there must be some underlying physical issue; something else had to be causing our son\u2019s  horrific discomfort . A month after Nik\u2019s third birthday, another medication was prescribed for the headaches we all\u2014 the doctors included\u2014 were certain were from some other source. The second medicine  enhanced  the effects of the first; a vicious cycle ensued. As we continued to  increase  the dose of the first medicine, the second one  magnified the intensity of its effects  on Nik. Nik\u2019s once rapid progress with gross and fine motor skills seemed to stall; his previously voracious appetite completely disappeared. The smiling, laughing child I knew wasn\u2019t replaced with something or someone else but his attention span began to dwindle greatly. Nik\u2019s autistic characteristics became more pronounced; they were there all along but they became the first thing we saw more and more. Can I  prove  any of this beyond a shadow of a doubt? Unfortunately, no. **************************************************************** Though he loves to brush his teeth at home \u2014sitting on my lap as we sing a song about brushing \u2014 Nik has always  hated  our trips to the dentist. I don\u2019t blame him; he has to be restrained by strangers who don\u2019t want to take the time necessary to allow him to explore and find his comfort level. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a choice about dentists right now so we try to make the best of it; I still have to argue though to be allowed to hold Nik on my lap instead of sacrificing him to their care. Having discussed the issue with the neurologist and the pediatrician, we recently decided to try a low dose of  diazepam  (valium) to help Nik relax a bit; if he\u2019s not anxious about it he won\u2019t fight, right? Wrong, wrong, wrong.  WRONG. You know how some doctors tell parents  not  to give their kids Benadryl or cold medicine before flying because it can have the opposite of its intended effect? That\u2019s called a paradox response. Yeah, that\u2019s what happened to Nik when he got the drug in his system. To say it wasn\u2019t pretty would be a gross understatement.  Picture your sweet little child strung out on  PCP (Angel Dust) ; you\u2019ll get the picture. I tell you this not to garner sympathy but to illustrate a point. At the peak of his medically induced rampage, all of Nik\u2019s previous behaviors relating to his  episodic pain  returned in full blossom \u2014 and then some.  It was one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever witnessed; doubly so because I knew that I had caused it. I knew that it was simply Nik\u2019s mind and body reacting to the horrible, disorienting sensations caused by the drug; the knowledge brought no comfort. Sobbing as I drove the 54 miles home with my feral child, I had a flash of insight. **************************************************************** When we tried to increase Nik\u2019s second seizure medication a few months ago, in preparation for weaning off the first one \u2014the one we worried was causing headaches\u2014 Nik\u2019s  episodes of horrifying pain and related behaviors  drastically increased; his temperament became more volatile and his meltdowns more frequent and more intense. As soon as we realized this and we reverted to the  status quo  Nik began to improve. After numerous discussions with the neurologist, we decided we should try to wean Nik off of the  second  medication instead; it has more long-term negative effects on cognition and liver function. The change was not instantaneous but it  was  rapid. As we gradually decreased Nik\u2019s daily dose of the medication, we began to see marked shifts in Nik\u2019s attention span, his interest in social interaction, and  his desire and ability to initiate play . With each decrease in dose it seems we have witnessed a blossoming of Nik\u2019s personality and intellect; his keen problem solving skills have reached new heights. Nik\u2019s  motor skills  and  communication  have been catapulted to a level we had not expected to see for quite a while longer. But the best and most important change we have seen? The complete cessation of Nik\u2019s episodic, debilitating pain.  (Knock wood!) Can I prove this theory beyond a shadow of a doubt? No, again. But the  explosion  of cognition, motor skills, and rich social interaction that I see in Nik on a daily basis tells me all I need to know. Sometimes magic happens all on its own. Sometimes it needs a helping hand.

In the midst of a teary blue funk this evening, God spoke to me through the simple actions of my son.  As I sat on the floor with Nik between my legs so I could give him some medicine through his g-tube, I hummed \u201cYou are my Sunshine\u201d to Nik as I choked back tears.

Seems reasonable enough. Without getting into Nik\u2019s very involved history, I will say that he was born 3 months early and weighed little more than a pound. Nik spent a long time in the hospital and has gone through multiple surgeries on various systems. He has CP to a lesser degree which affects his strength and coordination mostly on the left side. He has absence seizures, intestinal malrotation with reflux and has a g-tube. He is visually impaired in his right eye and he has recently been diagnosed with autism. We\u2019ve had three different developmental evaluations over the past calendar year. Each one shows Nik roughly in the 6-9 month range for expressive language, 12 months for receptive language, 10 months for fine motor, and 12 months for gross motor. All the evaluators, Nik\u2019s teacher, and his therapists all agree that he has skills scattered to roughly 18-24 months. We all sort of agree that Nik doesn\u2019t test well in strange environments or with unfamiliar objects. Nik is incredibly curious about how things work. He\u2019s obsessed with things that open and close (doors, drawers, boxes), cannot sit still for more than a moment or two, loves music and toys that light up. He\u2019s big into cause and effect toys. Nik tends to throw things for entertainment (as opposed to a negative response to something). He has a completely ludicrous sense of humor and will dot hings like stick his fingers in his throat to gag himself and laugh hysterically. He finds velcro highly amusing, and he mouths and chews nearly everything EXCEPT food. He has a REALLY tough time with unexpected change and transitions. Nik responds well to musical cues versus spoken ones. He is mastering a lot of gross motor skills quickly; he\u2019s on the verge of walking and climbs like a monkey! He definitely has some sensory issues but we haven\u2019t yet identified what they are exactly. He likes things that vibrate, loves to swing, loves to roll and clap and kick. In spite of some of his attention and motor skill deficits, Nik has figured out things like how to fasten and unfasten the clasp on his lapbelt in his seating system. He\u2019s learning One person mentioned not wanting to overwhelm me with information but I believe that information leads to knowledge and understanding. Nik has been receiving early intervention of some sort pretty much since he came home from the hospital (at 7 months) so the idea of therapies and such is not new to us. Frankly, I\u2019d rather try SOMETHING than do nothing. Thanks to everyone who has reached out to me. On an intellectual level, I know that we are not the only family going through this. On an emotional level, it really helps to connect with all of you.

{"date": "January 24, 2008 ", "body": "\u2026otherwise known as an update on Nik\u2019s friend N and his family.\n I am happy to report that N\u2019s mother, M, has shaken off the  deer-in-the-headlights  demeanor which was in full force on  Saturday night . Apparently, my mentioning that there was still no speech therapist at her son\u2019s school \u2014Nik\u2019s old school \u2014was the  first  she had been informed of the fact. It took a few days for her to digest the information, formulate a plan, and take action. \n While she was simmering, stewing, and plotting her moves, I took the liberty of speaking to Miss K, the speech therapist at the place where Nik has his OT, PT, and playgroup; she is the former school SLP who knows N very well. She was quite disturbed to hear that the school administration hadn\u2019t  at least  informed the families that there was no SLP or made any arrangements for per diem coverage or anything. She told me to tell M that she should contact the school principal and ask him to arrange compensatory services immediately. \n I called M today to pass along this information; my timing couldn\u2019t have been better! M was, in fact, on her way to the school to corner the highly elusive principal. It seems she\u2019s been getting the runaround about an appointment and had enough. Can\u2019t say I blame her; Niksdad and my experience with the \u201cnew\u201d principal left a bad taste in our mouths and I have heard from multiple sources both inside and outside the school that he has shown his true colors as a  \u201cmaster manipulator\u201d  and politician who doesn\u2019t spend much time actually  in the trenches  of the classrooms and satellite sites. We\u2019re not talking a large operation here, folks; there are four sites total and fewer than one hundred students involved. It makes me sad and angry but there is little I can do about it except file away the knowledge for future dealings with him, if necessary. \n Anyway, M was on her way to the school and ready to spit nails in the form of going to the school board, filing grievances, etc. The only fly in the ointment as far as she could see was the fact that she had her daughter, S, with he and was concerned about how to stay focused on the issues at hand. Turns out her husband had to attend a  chemical warfare training  in preparation for his upcoming deployment; just hearing the phrase \u201cchemical warfare\u201d made my heart skip a beat \u2014 not in a good way . I immediately offered to take S for her; I didn\u2019t know what it would look like or how Nik would handle it but I knew I needed to do that for her \u2014and for N. \n So for a couple hours early this afternoon I got a small taste of what it would be like to have two kids in the house! Now, I know that when you have a second child there is all sorts of adjusting that happens  gradually ; I\u2019ve not yet heard of any child emerging from the womb already walking, climbing, and eating Cheerios or Goldfish crackers! None the less, it was a fascinating and daunting experience for me. \n Nik was in his chair having his lunchtime tube feeding when they arrived. S was content to sit on the floor and play with Nik\u2019s toys while  Mary Poppins  played in the background. Nik, by and large, wasn\u2019t terribly interested in what this pint-sized carrot top was up to \u2014 until she climbed aboard his beloved musical scooter.  Um, I guess I need to work a bit on his sharing skills; he responded by shaking his head and saying a very emphatic  \u201cNG-NG-NG-NG-NG!\u201d  and having a near meltdown over it. S, is apparently  well-versed  in the art of tormenting her older sibling and merely giggled as she rode away. Poor Nik.  \n \n (Disclaimer: I do have to acknowledge that S graciously shared her Cheerios with Nik more than once. Thus proving she has mastered the art of negotiation using her feminine wiles!)\n But he got his own in kind once his lunch was done and he was out of his seat; he kept taking S\u2019s beloved pink sippy cup. Being the  pampered  girly girl she is, S responded by shrieking, tears, and a quivering lip as she raised her arms to me to pick her up. Yes, she walks all over her docile big brother, N, but she\u2019d never last a day with Nik! Nik wanted to clap her hands together and she got scared. She pulled the same shrieking,  \u201cSave me!\u201d  behavior. She\u2019s adorable but, man, she needs to get a bit tougher! \n (Yes, I admit it, I am grateful for my rough and tumble son \u2014even when he discovers  fishing in the toilet  as a new way to entertain himself while Mommy is at the gym and Daddy is trying to study! Of course, perhaps my daughter would be just as rough and tumble, too? A point not worth pondering as it will never come to pass. Truly, it won\u2019t \u2014we\u2019ve taken care of that!)) \n When M returned from her meeting, she was fairly pleased with the way things went. She received promises of immediate action and authorization for compensatory speech services (as well as some other things they discussed having to do with the physical conditions of the bathroom in her son\u2019s classroom). I told her to make sure she  puts everything in writing  and to not trust blindly that school will do what the principal says will be done without committing it to the record. (What can I say? I am a  tad  jaded after our experience with the same school and same principal!) \n So there you have the update on N and his family. By the way, M asked me to pass along her thanks for the prayers and good thoughts for both the school situation and for her husband\u2019s upcoming deployment.

I really appreciate knowing I am not alone and NOT the first to face this challenge.  The diversity of suggestions and comments gave me a lot to sleep on last night (and even more to digest today).  When I awoke this morning, I can\u2019t say I had any tremendous epiphany but I did have a greater sense of calm about the whole issue.  No lesser urgency, just more calm. It struck me somewhere during my frenetic day that I have spent so long now having to be nurse, doctor, therapist, diagnostician, feeding specialist, sensory evaluator, interpreter, etc. for Nik that \u2014along the way, I\u2019ve not made enough room to simply BE HIS MOTHER.  When I read the comments from several parents about just sitting and snuggling together, my first thought was that Nik is so hyper active that he won\u2019t sit still long enough to do those things.  But, that doesn\u2019t mean I cannot find our equivalent of those \u201cbeing together\u201d moments and capitalize on them and try to expand upon them.  I simply need to recognize when they happen. Another good reminder I got was that PLAY is learning at this age.  I often feel really guilty about letting Nik play with certain toys that I know feed into his perseverations (is that the right word?) \u2014especially his musical toys that he will sit and play with for 20 minutes at a time or more.  But as one mom commented, as long as it\u2019s an educational toy \u2014teaching letters, numbers, shapes, colors \u2014it\u2019s not so bad.  And I do have to admit that Nik has a decidedly musical inclination.  He doesn\u2019t speak but he can hum numerous songs in perfect tune and/or rhythm.  I tell myself that music and logical aptitude go hand in hand \u2014and he sure is analytical even at the tender age of three! Nik went to school this morning; I was ecstatic and looking forward to time at the gym, a leisurely lunch, maybe even shopping for some new clothes (I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight but that\u2019s another topic for another time).  FAT CHANCE!  On my way home from the gym, I got a semi-frantic phone call from the substitute school nurse.  Nik was having an extreme coping challenge, and had been since pretty much the minute I left him at school.  Interesting point here \u2014this is the first time Nik has ever shown any sort of separation anxiety EVER.  So, while it sucks that he had a rotten morning at school, I do love the fact that he missed his mama! But I digress.  When I dropped Nik at school today, I managed to run into some of his therapists and his teacher from the deaf-blind program.  The DB teacher spent some time talking with me about what was going on with Nik in terms of progress with signing and PECS.  She also gave me some pointers on how to implement a PECS-type system at home in \u201cbaby steps.\u201d  Finally, something I can sink my teeth into! What was most interesting to me though about our conversation was her comment to me about Nik and moving him into the autism program.  She assured me that the program was great and that she really thought it would be good for Nik because most of the kids were \u201chigher functioning\u201d than those he is currently with.  She said \u201cNik is so smart!  He really needs to be challenged more than he is right now.\u201d  I was FLOORED!  To be clear, this woman does NOT work for the school district; she works for a state program and goes to all the schools in the state to work with kids who are classified as deaf-blind.  (We really like her a lot and she\u2019s done wonders with Nik.  Boy, are we going to miss her when Nik transitions out of the program since his hearing problem seems to be resolved and he seems to hear ok.)  I mentioned that I was concerned that Nik wasn\u2019t ready for that class because he is so much smaller, younger, orthopedically impaired.  She laughed and said he was \u201cmore than ready!\u201d So, in my long-winded way, I guess another lesson learned is that I may not always have the clearest perspective on my son\u2019s abilities and potential.  I guess sometimes I need to step back a bit and see him from a different perspective and recognize that he IS growing and developing.   All in his own time.

{"date": "May 19, 2007 ", "body": "I wrote this on Mother\u2019s Day and don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t post it. Must be more of that sleep-deprived brain fog\u2026 Anyway, this is for all the moms I\u2019ve met in this crazy blogging world. You are inspiring. Thanks for letting me in \u201cthe club.\u201d ********************************************************************************* I thought of you all today as I was at the park with my family. I wondered if you were having a good day with your respective families \u2014creating memories to tuck away in the recesses of your hearts or, perhaps, to share with your blogging friends. As I watched Nik play on the toddler slide with great, enthusiastic abandon, I thought of you and felt your invisible presence with me. I noticed some mothers with older kids watching Nik as he scooted and climbed and crawled in his little crooked hermit crab way that he does without really using his left knee on the ground. I watched them watching him as he babbled and hummed his joyful little tunes as he played. At first, I felt defensive. Protective. I wanted to yell at them to stop staring and to leave my boy alone. I thought of you all there with me and felt your protective circle around us \u2014 me, Nik, Niksdad\u2014 as we reveled in the sunshine. One of you must have whispered something in my ear \u2014a suggestion that, perhaps, they weren\u2019t watching and thinking judgmental thoughts about my differently-abled child. Perhaps they were like the  mother at the swings  which Vicki Forman so eloquently writes about. Wondering but afraid to ask. Wanting to understand but uncomfortable about intruding. I let go of my defensiveness and tuned them out. Instead, I focused on watching my little boy blossom in the sun like a flower kept dormant in the ground for too many seasons. Through all the winters of isolating Nik from exposure to illness \u2014especially from other kids \u2014 and the long months spent with visiting home therapists, pushing pulling, poking, cajoling, encouraging Nik. To bear weight on his hands, to sit at the age of two, to pull to stand at 2 \u00bd. Through it all, the gut-level knowledge that it would, one day in the future, lead to this moment today. I watched my boy fearlessly climb the play structure\u2019s steps with his awkward gate until he was \u201cking of the mountain\u201d at the topmost level. The pure joy radiating from his pores as he clambered down to the short, broad slope of the slide warmed my heart. As I reached out my hands to help Nik slide down, he giggled and catapulted himself down the incline without as much as a brush against my fingertips. Anxiously, I watched as Nik struggled to right himself \u2014he cannot stand on his own yet. If desire and determination could make a thing so, Nik would jump and run and dance in the wind. I see it in his eyes, in the set of his jaw as he struggles to rise. His sense of triumph is evident in his laugh as he manages to turn himself around so he can pull himself up using Daddy\u2019s pant leg. Nik has figured out how to get himself up and down the structure all by himself. Climb, climb, scamper, slide. Roll over, push up, cruise to the right or crawl to the left. One way takes him around the outside while the other takes him under the steps. I worry when he goes underneath because he is little and some of the other kids are so much bigger than he is. Two boys, who must be about ten, are playing at soldiers or spies; they are hunkered down on their bellies and sneaking through the openings under the slide. They must sense something in Nik that causes them to feel protective. I watch in awe as, wordlessly, they stop to yield the right of way to my little dynamo. Not once, not twice, but repeatedly. I watch the leader\u2019s face each time they approach Nik, who is happily oblivious to their presence and the fact that they could just have easily run him over. I wonder, just for a moment, if the bigger boy knows that Nik is more vulnerable. Is this what it will always be like as Nik\u2019s mother? The tremendous awe and pride I feel as I watch my child grow and change intermingled with the sadness that he no longer needs me to do certain things, and the fear that others will not see how vulnerable he is. Or worse, that they will and will take advantage of him or hurt him in some irreparable way? Today, though, I silently smile and share my joy \u2014my tremendous pride \u2014with you all. I know that you share my joy as I have surely felt the swell of pride, and often the sting of tears (both of joy and indignation) as I read about your children\u2019s triumphs and struggles. Your experiences so often mirror mine or paint vivid pictures of the possibilities which may await our family. The riches of raising our special child, of learning to love deeper with each passing day, of learning to stand strong in the face of ignorance, fear, frustration, and exhaustion. Learning to appreciate each individual moment as it happens and being able to look back at the intricate and inspiring tapestry being woven. Thank you, my new-found friends for the gifts you bring to my life. You make me a better mother and a richer human being for the depths of emotion I allow myself to tap into and the fears I am learning to conquer. Troubles shared are troubles halved but joys shared are doubled. Today, I feel doubly blessed.

{"date": "October 14, 2007 ", "body": "\n \n From the dew-soaked hedge creeps a crawly caterpillar, When the dawn begins to crack. It\u2019s all part of my autumn almanac. Breeze blows leaves of a musty-colored yellow, So I sweep them in my sack. Yes, yes, yes, it\u2019s my autumn almanac.\n \u201cAutumn Almanac\u201d by Ray Davies, The Kinks \n \n \n Yesterday, the sun rose brightly on a crisp, dew-sparkled morning. The call of early geese carried on the wind. Leaves swirled from the large maple in the neighbors\u2019 yard, drifting down to grace our late summer garden with a scattering of golden yellow, flecked with brown and red. The cats lazed on the window sills in the dappled morning light as our household awakened lazily without the aid of alarm clocks or a crying child in the dawn hour. Seven o\u2019clock. Blissful awakening. \n It felt like a good morning for a family adventure. So off we went in the picture perfect autumn weather to the Fall Festival held by the same folks that hosted the  Peach Festival  in August. It was busy in a small town sort of way \u2014just enough to entertain but not too much to overwhelm.  \n \n \n There were children\u2019s mazes made of hay bales, a giant maze cut through the corn fields, pumpkin painting (which we skipped as Nik isn\u2019t quite into that yet), a petting zoo, hayrides and pick-your-own-apples and pumpkins, as well as corn and soybean \u201csandboxes\u201d and fresh pressed apple cider.  \n Nik exhausted himself in the fresh air and sunshine. His favorite things were the sandboxes \u2014total sensory delight, and the animals.  \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n Nik made fast friends with Paddy, a five week old calf. It was a mutual affection, apparently. It was so wonderful for us to watch Nik really engage with Paddy; we actually had to keep him from climbing on top of the poor calf!  \n \n The change we saw from the last time we were here was phenomenal! Nik was so much more aware of his surroundings and of the other children. \n And he even managed to bring home about a quarter cup of beans; imagine \u201cThe Princess and the Pea\u201d \u2014in his shoes! They somehow got up under his pant leg and down between his orthotics and his foot. OUCH. Poor kid. No wonder he didn\u2019t want to walk or stand after he got out of the beans. And here we thought he was just tired. But that wasn\u2019t as bad as another kid who I watched end up with a diaper full of beans! \n And, reminiscent of the  peach ice cream encounter  in August, Nik managed to surprise us by tasting and actually enjoying fresh pressed, mulled apple cider. Ordinarily, Nik won\u2019t drink anything but water. If he has a single sip of juice or milk he pushes the cup away and makes a face as if I poisoned him. My drama child! Not only did he  not  push the cup away, Nik actually kept pulling my hand back to give him more. Needless to day, there\u2019s a half gallon container of the stuff in my fridge right now. \n I love the autumn; it always feels like a fresh start to me. And after  all we\u2019ve   been through  recently, we\u2019re certainly ready to  put it behind us  and move on. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RxKGe27NjdI/AAAAAAAAAPY/79n7iEugqdM/s1600-h/maple+tree.jpg", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/idyll-moments-everythings-peachy.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RxKDmW7NjZI/AAAAAAAAAO4/wXNddjyOcbk/s1600-h/DSC01275.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RxKDI27NjYI/AAAAAAAAAOw/aLknSO3ofjs/s1600-h/Examining+Corn.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RxKD-m7NjaI/AAAAAAAAAPA/Ndm5-096zgw/s1600-h/New+Best+Friends.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RxKDH27NjXI/AAAAAAAAAOo/_lLkuzhav7s/s1600-h/Manly+Farmers.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/idyll-moments-everythings-peachy.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RxKFCW7NjcI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/gzEbW1yCBys/s1600-h/Sleepy+Boy.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/barely-standing.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/feeling-little-hollow.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/you-can-do-it-all-you-need-is-hand.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RxKFCW7NjcI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/gzEbW1yCBys/s1600-h/Sleepy+Boy.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/niks-autumn-almanac/", "title": "Nik\u2019s Autumn Almanac"},
{"date": "October 8, 2007 ", "body": "You feel like a candle in a hurricane Just like a picture with a broken frame Alone and helpless, like you\u2019ve lost your fight\u2026 \n Rascal  Flatts It\u2019s been a rough go lately. Between  Nik \u2019s lingering non-specific illness, sleepless nights,  Niksdad \u2019s demanding nursing school and clinical practicum schedule, and the specter of school not yet completely eradicated, I can honestly say that I have indeed felt helpless and like I have lost my fight. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I won\u2019t stop fighting for  Nik , for my family, for myself. Well, if I\u2019m completely honest, maybe myself a little \u2014it\u2019s always easier to put myself last when there are big challenges in our life and it feels like something has to give.   But I am tired \u2014too tired to stand today.  (Forgive the self-indulgence which follows.) On so many levels  Nik  is doing great. He\u2019s recovered from our  Texasinine   dining experience and he\u2019s still the same happy-go-lucky little boy he\u2019s always been. The play and laughter are still present, though the eating anything by mouth still is not. He\u2019s doing so much better now that he\u2019s not in school. Except\u2026 I know I\u2019 ve  written about it a few times before so forgive me if I repeat myself \u2014I\u2019m too lazy to find the posts to link to.  Nik \u2019s been battling this odd \u201caffliction\u201d that no one can seem to identify. The lymph glands behind his right ear are chronically swollen \u2014some days worse than others and some days causing more discomfort than others; the two are not necessarily mutual.  Nik  also has multiple nights of interrupted sleep from this same \u201caffliction;\u201d he will wake screaming in pain and hitting his head or biting his hand really hard. When this happens he is usually inconsolable. Advil given through his g-tube usually mitigates the worst of the pain after a while and he is able to go back to sleep for, oh, another hour or so. Then it all starts over again. This behavior is not limited to overnights; it happens sometimes in the middle of a play or therapy session. This morning, Miss M got to witness it firsthand during feeding therapy. I thought she was going to cry because she was so upset for  Nik . As quickly as it comes on, sometimes it can go just as quickly. Throw in the lingering low-grade fever  Nik \u2019s been running nearly every day now since mid-September \u2014in conjunction with the upper respiratory gunk, the ear infection, followed by the GI bug. Well, you might imagine that we are all a bit frazzled and concerned. Something is going on but no one seems to be able to tell us what. Then, there\u2019s the ugly specter of our school experience which  isn \u2019t quite over. You see, though we\u2019 ve  had him home from school since September 17 th , we haven\u2019t yet officially removed  Nik  from school. I guess, technically, they can\u2019t cite us for truancy since he\u2019s not legally required to be in school. Still, the district might be able to argue that we are interfering with their ability to provide  Nik \u2019s free, appropriate public education ( FAPE ). The only reason this might be important is if we need to keep them in the picture after all. Though, one could argue that  Nik \u2019s  IEP  as it stands right now \u2014still missing a speech/language/communication section with any evaluation of present levels of functioning as well as no stated goals and objectives, PT and OT goals which do not presume competence and do not address  Nik \u2019s significant sensory needs \u2014could hardly be construed as a promise to deliver  FAPE  even if  Nik  were in school seven days a week! I am still waiting for answers from Legal Aid. Meanwhile, school has scheduled an  IEP  meeting on the 15 th  for us to officially remove  Nik  and to \u201creview the educational services for which Nikolas will no longer have access.\u201d Ordinarily that  wouldn \u2019t make me anxious except I know that Medicaid now has a copy of the letter of medical necessity from  Nik \u2019s doctor. You know, the one that says he  shouldn \u2019t be in school due to his health? Yeah, that one. I am worried that they are going to try to use that as leverage to keep school in the picture and maintain responsibility for providing services. If that happens, we are back at square one as far as  IEP \u2019s go. I can hear the old Clash song in my head, \u201cShould I stay or should I go now? If I stay there will be trouble. If I go it will be double\u2026\u201d  ARGH ! Why can\u2019t it ever just be a simple, cut and dried situation? And worse, why do I feel like the floor is constantly shifting under my feet? I need to take some time to write out the pros and cons of each decision but I feel like I don\u2019t have complete information for either case. On one hand, having school involved will mean slugging it out for an appropriate  IEP ; I already know that will involve due process and, possibly, litigation. Still, it would resolve the issue once and for all \u2014hopefully in favor of increased and more appropriate services and supports for  Nik . There are so many unknowns and the process can take so long. It could, possibly take us a year or more to get things sorted out. On the other hand, if we simply cut school out of the picture, we run the risk that Medicaid won\u2019t or can\u2019t cover what  Nik  needs. Can we muddle our way through to cobble together some homemade program for  Nik ? Quite possibly, but it\u2019s daunting and could have some pretty significant gaps in it \u2014especially regarding speech/language/communication. Why can\u2019t I make a decision and stick with it and trust myself implicitly? Why am I so afraid of making a significant misstep? Why am I feeling so weak right now? Why are you all so  damned   far away  that I can\u2019t come over and cry on your shoulder or drink tea (or something stronger) in the warmth of your living room or sit in the dappled sunshine in your back yard and recharge? It feels so hard to pick myself up and brush myself off right now but I know I must. But it\u2019s lonely. Very lonely. Even this  doesn \u2019t seem to help me today.

{"date": "August 2, 2007 ", "body": "(UPDATED 1:48 pm  \u2013 see note at bottom of post) Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later. After the RC2 company recall of millions of Thomas the Tank Engine toys contaminated by lead-based paint, today Fisher-Price announced a massive recall of nearly one million toys tainted by the same toxin. The toys are Sesame Street and Nickelodeon themed toys ranging from \u201cgiggle grabbers\u201d to character figures and many more. To see if you own any of these toys, go  HERE .  Allow some time for the site to load; I imagine it\u2019s getting lots of traffic right now. There are some screens to show the toys and then links to see if yours might be affected. You have to indicate if you bought the toys before or after May 1, 2007. I am not sure I trust the resulting pop-up. The articles I have read indicate the affected toys were sold in the U.S. between May and August. However, the RC2 toys affected were manufactured between January 200 and April 2006. That\u2019s an  awfully large window . Who or what is to guarantee that the Mattel/Fisher-Price toys dating farther back are not impacted? Given that we own  five  of the toys listed on the  FP  web site, regardless of the date of purchase, it is not a chance I am willing to take.  Nik  chews on absolutely all of his toys. Constantly.  Especially the Sesame Street character figures . Maybe I am being a panicky mother; I am totally fine with that. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m talking about a splinter that might get infected.  Nik  already has enough challenges, I am not willing to add possible lead poisoning to the mix. Since we will be at the hospital for lab work on Friday already, I think I will ask the pediatrician to order a lead screening\u2026just in case. Check it out for yourself. UPDATE:  I talked to the pediatrician\u2019s office; they told me that they\u2019ve gotten a lot of calls like mine and have put in orders for lead screenings for tons of kids already.  Nik gets his done tomorrow morning. Fingers crossed!

When the \u201csomething else\u201d is so all consuming \u2014and, rightfully, important \u2014the perspective is gone.  Poof.  Until something innocuous brings back clarity and perspective returns. The forest  can  be seen for the trees after all. \n Nik \u2019s most recent bout of the ongoing mystery illness \u2014which may in fact have just been his first ever really,  really  bad cold \u2014threw me into such a panic. I mean, the seriously high fever, the rash, the chest x-rays and talk of multiple infections \u2014all take on a slightly different meaning when our entire history of parenting has been in crisis or near-crisis mode. It is so hard to shake the blinders of fear which block out the bigger picture. Yet, now that the crisis seems to have passed, I can see a little more clearly today. \n Nik  is  still  not sleeping through the night but his bouts of panicky wakefulness are getting shorter and are spaced a little farther apart. He\u2019s still got a bad cough and I think his throat bothers him; when he wakes in the middle of the night coughing and congested he gets panicky and we have to  nebulize  him to give him a bit of relief, though his lungs sound clear and his chest x-ray was normal. But, we do what  works , right? \n Today is a better day;  Niksdad  left at the crack of dawn for his student nursing shift at the local hospital while  Nik  and I slept in until nearly nine o\u2019clock. Pure heaven! The fever is nearly gone and  Nik \u2019s color is a bit better. More importantly, his activity level is far greater than it has been in a week. For the better part of the past week,  Nik  has done a lot of lying on the floor playing quietly with some favorite toys and clearing off the sofa cushions and pillows. Nothing terribly productive \u2014so I thought. \n Somehow \u2014when I  wasn \u2019t looking, or perhaps looking but not really  seeing  \u2014 Nik  managed to  continue to grow and make progress. Proof, yet again, to this forgetful mama that he may have been down \u2014but never  out . In all his quiet play this week,  Nik  took his mastery of the zipper to a whole new level. Not just the pincer grasp required to hold the pull, but the  whole  magilla . The up, the down, the pinch, the pull, and knowing to hold the two sides together. The  understanding  of the concept ; mastery of the zipper means freedom. Another giddy step toward independence. \n Wait!  Wasn \u2019t that one of the OT goals for him to master \u2014 over the course of the   entire school year?  Never underestimate the skills of a motivated and determined child! \n And the diaper-removal technique has  definitely  been mastered. I am waiting for the day I turn to see him butt-naked \u2014having not only unzipped and removed his pants with his newly refined motor skills, but then also having removed his diaper. Sorry, I won\u2019t be posting photos of  that  feat. When it happens, you\u2019ll have to take my word for it. \n And the ability to sip from a straw \u2014once a tentative endeavor at best?  Nik \u2019s recent bout of fever made him thirsty enough to simply DO IT. And that one  wasn \u2019t even on the horizon yet as far as school was concerned. This opens up a whole wealth of possibilities for advances in oral motor skills for both feeding and, hopefully, speech. \n And he\u2019s really started to use some clear and specific vocalizations for expressing displeasure, anxiety, and disdainful rebukes.  Ok , it\u2019s not always  pleasant  but it  is  progress! \n And social skills \u2014you want social skills?  We\u2019 ve  got \u2018em.  Well,  some  anyway where there were none before. From the appropriateness of kicking the nurse at the hospital (I stand by that one!), to the new found cooperation he\u2019s been exhibiting with his pediatrician (I\u2019m not sure who adores whom more!),  Nik  has been responding mostly appropriately around other people. Showing curiosity about familiar voices in unfamiliar contexts (his teacher for the visually impaired came to our house yesterday \u2014a first and the start of new services.  Yay !), to adapting his method of play between Mommy, Daddy, Nanny, and Granddaddy. To consistently wrapping his arms around my neck in the middle of the night as I picked him up from his crib; I used to have to try to keep him from leaning backwards and tumbling out of my grasp. Now, he clings and gives forehead kisses. Once in a while, I\u2019ll even get a kiss with his lips. Sheer bliss He is  clearly   communicating  his  love  for me and  Niksdad . That has to be the best gift of all. \n Every day happenings in a  \u201cnormal\u201d  family. More wondrous advances for us. Just imagine what he would have done if he  hadn \u2019t been ill! \n The boy is super, indeed.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RyoaNGkS0xI/AAAAAAAAASc/Tr5ozFGwBJc/s1600-h/Zippity+Doo+Dah.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RyoZ52kS0wI/AAAAAAAAASU/6DmabnPJddw/s1600-h/Zippity+Doo+Dah.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/small-gifts/", "title": "Small Gifts"},

We\u2019ve gone from  this \n   \n \n to  this \n     \n \n in what seems like the blink of an eye!\n To celebrate today, we took a special trip on the Santa Claus Express Train run by  this outfit . It was cold and sleeting when we arrived and Nik wanted to walk, walk, walk. Brrr! But walk he did\u2026with Daddy while Mommy got some \u201csupplies\u201d to keep him occupied during the  ninety minute  train ride through the scenic Red Clay Valley. \n \n We weren\u2019t sure how Nik would handle the potential sensory overload. He amazed us by being a very happy little railroader until almost the end of the trip.  As long as the train was in motion, Nik seemed to be very relaxed and content to sit on one of our laps. That doesn\u2019t surprise me as Nik has always been a very good car traveler and seems to enjoy looking out the window on our journeys. In fact, he was probably less ram bunctious than some of the other four year old boys on the same train! Of course, that may have been because they were all eagerly awaiting the arrival of Santa Claus in our rail car; Nik hasn\u2019t yet figured out who the fat guy with the beard and red suit are. Maybe next year? In any event, he seemed to really enjoy himself. We did too. \n \n By the time we arrived home, Nik was pretty tired and took a short nap before we had to head down the street to his Nanny and Granddaddy\u2019s house for a special birthday dinner. It was really special this year because his Aunt J and (maybe one day Uncle) W, joined us for dinner. So did Nik\u2019s cousin, E, and her boyfriend T. It was a small gathering but felt festive. And it was wonderful to watch my sister and my niece both really play with Nik. It\u2019s been a long road for them to get comfortable with simply  being  with Nik \u2014a sign that they\u2019ve  all  three grown tremendously over the last year!\n \n \n Nik sat in his booster and took tastes of Mommy and Daddy\u2019s food through the entire meal. He even had some of the cake and yummy homemade peppermint ice cream \u2014made just for him by his doting Nanny! There were gifts aplenty (more on that in another post later) and smiles all the way around.\n \n \n Nik tumbled into bed and was sound asleep within minutes of getting home. Niksdad and I reflected over the last four years and how far we\u2019ve come \u2014both as parents and as a family. \n \n My heart is so full that it\u2019s overflowing through my eyes.  \n **************************************************************************** \n Here\u2019s Nik\u2019s first-ever train ride\u2026\n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1N8a_2abiI/AAAAAAAAAXU/2Hi1iX-0Mx0/s1600-R/DSC01890.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1MwFP2abeI/AAAAAAAAAW0/lSiqF3Nwu6E/s1600-R/Birth.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1N78f2abgI/AAAAAAAAAXE/RdAgDU5R024/s1600-R/Nik+and+St.+Nick.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1N78_2abhI/AAAAAAAAAXM/hqVMyykH3GE/s1600-R/DSC01793.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1N9Nv2abjI/AAAAAAAAAXc/sQWIgdqdI3Y/s1600-R/DSC01865.JPG", "http://www.wwrr.com/about/index.htm", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1N-R_2abkI/AAAAAAAAAXk/XhwLoNvv3kk/s1600-R/DSC01808.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1N-pf2ablI/AAAAAAAAAXs/pZRA_hAa4PM/s1600-R/DSC01848.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/12/02/happy-birthday-baby/", "title": "Happy Birthday, Baby!"},

{"date": "August 16, 2007 ", "body": "I thought I\u2019d better check in and give an update on the  school situation  before time slips away and my already overloaded brain forgets \u2026that\u2019s a small window of time these days! Let\u2019s see, we\u2019ve found out that \u2014for right now\u2014 we cannot pull Nik out of school and get his therapies covered by Medicaid. On the surface, that really sucks; but there\u2019s a  glimmer of silver  in this cloud somewhere. I\u2019ve been having lots of conversations with lots of people who have volunteered to help us. One is the \u201chigh muckity-muck\u201d from Medicaid who is responsible for authorizations and works right under the Medical Director. She also happens to be the person who was Nik\u2019s first case manager when we moved to DE in 2005; she has more than a passing acquaintance with Nik\u2019s case. She basically told me that the school needs to step up and deliver the necessary services. We need to go through the IEP meeting and then look at what school hasn\u2019t delivered on and whether Medicaid can bridge the gaps. A prime example would be feeding therapy; school does not do this so Medicaid will automatically approve it. (Um, wouldn\u2019t it have been wonderful if the SLP at school had bothered to mention this like, oh I don\u2019t know \u2014A YEAR AGO so we could have done something about it sooner?!) But\u2026 Ms. Muckity-Muck has agreed to come to the IEP meeting  to help do a little pushing back on the \u201cOh, no, that\u2019s medical not educational\u201d bull that\u2019s been shoveled at us for the past year. Did I mention that Ms. D \u2014 the world\u2019s greatest OT  \u2014is also coming to the IEP? She\u2019s basically going to tell the IEP team exactly what she sees and the amazing progress Nik is making with the right level of services. (He currently gets a total of 2 hours per week in 30 minute sessions.) She said to me today, \u201cYou know, Nik is  so   smart  that if we can just get past all this sensory junk he\u2019s got going on, he could really take off!\u201d Did I mention we think she\u2019s terrific? (She even called us tonight to give us some tips to help Nik after  surgery  tomorrow! Never would have gotten that from school, for sure!) So let\u2019s see\u2026Duck #1 (Medicaid); check. Duck #2 (OT); check. Duck #3 just happens to be one of the most highly respected women in the local and state-level disability advocacy circles \u2014and a woman I\u2019ve know casually (very) for two years; she thinks Nik is a living doll, too. She\u2019s the one I mentioned in my  other  post (I think?) who is an educational advocate for kids in the child welfare services system. Been playing this game for many years. She\u2019s given us some good coaching so far.  She will be at Nik\u2019s IEP. Finally, Duck #4 \u2014 the one we will keep in reserve in case we really need her \u2014 a legal aid attorney who does \u2014 ta da! \u2014special education work. We haven\u2019t made contact with her yet but she is a friend of a friend so we have an \u201cin\u201d with her when we need it. So, while we aren\u2019t thrilled with the idea of Nik having to be in school, we have greater hope that school will either deliver the goods directly or they will be backed up against that old proverbial wall and will have to provide funding for additional services. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about some of the suggestions that commenters made on my  recent post  \u2014especially about reduced hours. Since we still have the OT and PT authorization for a set number of sessions through early November \u2014I checked it with Ms. Muckity Muck just to be sure \u2014we are scheduling sessions two days each week in the early afternoon. This means I will take Nik out of school just before lunch, take him home to feed him, then go to see our  beloved  Ms. D and Ms. T. That leaves us a reasonable window of time to be able to go to the park, or my sister\u2019s pool while the weather is warm enough, before Nik has to be home for dinner. I am sure school is going to have a complete cow about this but I plan on pushing for that to be his daily schedule \u2014leaving school at 11:30 each day. They\u2019ve already lengthened the school day by 20 minutes on each end \u2014making it a 6 hour 40 minute day. The change is just enough that it may impact Nik\u2019s overall feeding and sleep schedule. He already doesn\u2019t nap consistently at school \u2014too much sensory input to be able to tune it out and relax \u2014so his bed time ends up being earlier than \u201cnormal.\u201d I won\u2019t get into the whole complicated schedule we have to keep \u2014what with meds before meals, meds with meals, separating one seizure med from the other, etc. Suffice to say, a seemingly small shift can have a domino effect that can have undesirable results. When Nik\u2019s seizure meds are given too close together he is like a drunken sailor for hours afterward and is very lethargic and unresponsive in terms of interacting with other people or his environment. Great way to send a kid to school, eh?\n \n Never mind the fact that he is  3 1/2 and shouldn\u2019t be \u201cparked\u201d in a seat  for the better part of the school day because they do not have sufficient staffing levels to handle his needs!\n Anyway, I am rambling now but the gist is this \u2014 Niksdad and I feel like we are pulling together a more concrete plan and have some more objective eyes than ours watching over the process. We hope that they can help us prevail in getting Nik what he needs.  \n   \n \n I forget which one of you said it, maybe Joey\u2019s mom, about squeaking loudly enough to get the grease. That\u2019ll be us.  \n May we make the Tin Man sound like an amateur.  \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/courage-under-fire.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/moveable-feast.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/ear-ye-ear-ye.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/courage-under-fire.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/courage-under-fire.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RsT2L34JarI/AAAAAAAAAHE/ujn69HHP-J0/s1600-h/TinMan.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RsT1nn4JaqI/AAAAAAAAAG8/KlMsGXSyQY0/s1600-h/TinMan.jpg"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/08/16/school-daze-school-daze/", "title": "School Daze, School\u00a0Daze"},

Don\u2019t ask me  how  but Nik\u2019s actual tube \u2014the part that goes into his stomach and to which I attach an extension tube for each meal \u2014broke. Uh huh. Literally came unglued. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself\u2026 \n \n Oh tidings of comfort and joy, Comfort and joy! Oh tidings of comfort and joy! \n God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen (author unknown) Tuesday morning was our last play group until after New Year\u2019s; it was a  warm and fuzzy  morning in which Nik played and laughed and made a Christmas ornament which  moved me to tears.  Well, I suppose I should say he lent his assistance (cooperation?) to the process. The end result is something that only a parent or grandparent would ever appreciate and think was worth ten times more than any gold-plated la-di-dah from a swanky store. But it is  incredibly special  to me. The  herculean  effort I know it took for Nik to allow his hands and foot to be traced \u2014the sensory processing, the cooperation and sitting still \u2014 along with the monumental feat of Miss D actually getting a picture of Nik (almost) sitting still? Let\u2019s just say the heavens must have lent a little help in this case. I cried not only for the fact that my son helped make it, or that Miss D and Miss T are so thoughtful as to have even come up with the idea in the first place. No, I cried because it reminded me of how  tiny  Nik was when he was born; he was so tiny and in such distress that we  never  got his footprints on his hospital birth certificate. The closest thing we have is a set of footprints taken when he was one month old. The prints are still minuscule but they aren\u2019t the same. Somehow the hand and footprints done Tuesday represent a  birth  of sorts and I\u2019m happy to have something to mark the passage.  *********************************************************************************** \n \n \u201cChristmas is a necessity. There has to be at least one day of the year to remind us that we\u2019re here for something else besides ourselves.\u201d  \n \n ~ Eric Sevareid (1912-1992), American newscaster. \n \n Wednesday was the  antithesis  to Tuesday\u2019s warm fuzzies. Nik\u2019s evaluation didn\u2019t go as well as I had hoped. The team was wonderful and I like and respect each of the professionals., but Nik was simply all over the place and almost completely unable to maintain any sort of focus for more than a few seconds at a time. Nik\u2019s balance was really off kilter, he didn\u2019t cooperate even when I sang the transition or cue-songs we usually use, and Nik didn\u2019t respond to his name at all. The door perseveration was working overtime and Nik kept trying to run out into the hallway \u2014clad only in a shirt and his pull-up diaper! Each member of the team spent some one-on-one time with Nik and then talked with me at length about what I hoped to have happen as a result of the evaluation. I suppose from  that  standpoint, the fact that I wanted them to recommend an increase in Nik\u2019s therapies, we may have achieved one of our objectives; their report will be finished early next week and then the developmental pediatrician will call us to discuss it with us. Until then it\u2019s a waiting game. The hardest part for me was watching Nik struggle so badly. I realize now that he had not had sufficient time to acclimate to the environment. Nor had I taken the time to do any brushing, joint compression, or firm pressure and rocking \u2014all of which I  know  helps Nik calm and center a bit more. Hindsight being what it is, I can see now that I should have simply asked the team for a few minutes to do that before they started. The lesson here is for me to stay focused on  Nik\u2019s  needs and not worry about the other people; they\u2019ll take care of themselves just fine. By the time the team was finished, it had started to snow and Nik and I still had a little more than two hours to wait until his afternoon appointment with the advanced practice nurse in the GI clinic. It was not part of the original plan to have Nik\u2019s g-tube changed but it  broke  on Tuesday! I didn\u2019t think it was even  possible  \u2014but this  is  Nik we\u2019re talking about. We did stop to see if she could see Nik sooner but the part she needed hadn\u2019t arrived yet; she expected it just after noon. So off we went, dashing through the snow, to the nearby mall to visit  Santa . My first clue that Nik wasn\u2019t feeling well should have been in his refusal to walk more than a few steps at a time. I finally ended up carrying  all 32 pounds  of him, along with our coats, nearly the entire length of the mall and back\u2014having missed the fact that Santa was actually tucked away in an alcove near the center of the mall. By the time we got to the Clauses, Nik and I were both spent. It pretty much shows in Nik\u2019s face in  the photo . We returned to the hospital and managed to get Nik\u2019s tube changed earlier than scheduled. Yay! Someone remind me next time to take a change of clothes for Nik; apparently he hadn\u2019t finished digesting his breakfast from several hours before and it got more than a bit  messy . Poor little guy had to suffer insult on top of injury when he came home in a  hospital gown  instead of his big boy clothes. *********************************************************************************** Thursday was pretty low key \u2014if you don\u2019t count  the faucet  which began running from his little nose, followed by  the coughing ,  the facial rash , and finally  the fever . All this wrapped up in a pretty package of multiple  episodes of unexplained pain  which has morphed yet again into something slightly different and slightly more intense than it was before. We\u2019d actually gone a few days without any significant episodes so I guess we were due. And, I\u2019m finally over my tracheitis and Niksdad is healthy, so I guess it was Nik\u2019s turn again. *********************************************************************************** \n \u201cChristmas gift suggestions: To your enemy, forgiveness. To an opponent, tolerance. To a friend, your heart. To a customer, service. To all, charity. To every child, a good example. To yourself, respect.\u201d ~ Oren Arnold  \n Yesterday was one of a few bright spots in the week as we saw the  good Doctor Mary . In spite of not feeling well, Nik was very good for Doctor Mary. Except for \u201cthe snots,\u201d he actually got a clean bill of health \u2014and  two shots  which we weren\u2019t expecting \u2014the Chicken Pox vaccine and a Polio booster. We got off the hook for the MMR and DTaP shots as Nik has had both of those \u2014albeit before his fourth birthday\u2014 as part of some immunology testing a few months back. Since he\u2019s not currently in school we can let those shots slide for a while. Whew! Fortunately, Nik has (knock wood!) never had an adverse reaction to any of his shots. This was probably the longest appointment we\u2019ve  ever  had with any doctor and it was incredible. Both Niksdad and I really,  really  like Doctor Mary; she\u2019s very personable and has a great \u201cbedside manner.\u201d She\u2019s also wise enough to know her limitations and recognizes when a change in tactic is in order. It\u2019s disappointing \u2014 yet oddly reassuring \u2014 that the  \u201cfabulously brilliant neurologist\u201d  never returned her calls either. We are seeing the  new  neurologist on the 30th of this month; Doctor Mary says she has met him and has also heard  lots  of good stuff from some of her patients\u2019 parents about how approachable and accessible he is. I am encouraged. We also got the inside scoop \u2014 highly favorable \u2014 about the  diagnostician  we are seeing on the 21st. Doctor Mary knows him personally and told us he is incredibly thorough and thoughtful and  open-minded . Niksdad and I are eager to meet him. She warned us that he doesn\u2019t say a lot; he listens and processes and ruminates. Sounds  just  like Dr. House \u2014 without  the drug habit and the surly \u201ceverybody lies\u201d attitude. Which,  I must confess , I think is very sexy and entertaining on TV. But when it comes to my kid?  NOT A CHANCE IN HELL. We\u2019re still investigating the issue of intermittent increases in  intracranial pressure  \u2014including one highly unusual potential cause which was brought to my attention by a reader who emailed me with some  very useful  information. We\u2019ve gotten used to having some of our ideas and theories dismissed by so many doctors \u2014often to discover that we were, in fact, on the right track if not necessarily entirely correct\u2014 that it is refreshing to find Doctor Mary listening and asking for our opinions. As she acknowledged yesterday, some of the things we\u2019re wondering about may seem highly unlikely. But all those  rare  conditions which something like six people in the world have? Well,  someone\u2019s  got them so it  is  possible. We just want to rule out every possible cause before we simply accept that Nik\u2019s recurring and increasing pain is behavioral or something we  can\u2019t  fix. After seeing the video of some of Nik\u2019s more recent episodes, Doctor Mary agrees that there  has  to be a physiological root. Let\u2019s hope the  diagnostician  can unearth those roots. So, I guess it\u2019s really been a mixed bag around here this week. In  spite  of the illness and trips to the hospital in the snow, I\u2019ve managed to get some holiday baking and candy making done \u2014in those  brief  windows between Nik\u2019s bedtime and mine, while Niksdad studies for his exams next week. That has helped to provide me with  some  creative outlet and a bit of  zen  feeling from the actions of cooking which have always soothed me. I\u2019ve made literally  dozens and dozens  of cookies \u2014of the chocolate and nut, chocolate and butterscotch, and mint chocolate variety\u2014 and my \u201cfamous\u201d (ha ha) chocolate covered almond clusters. I\u2019ve ventured into new territory and made some yummy pumpkin-cranberry mini loaves and star-shaped muffins. Today, I\u2019m actually going to make my easiest and most favorite holiday treat to make \u2014 peppermint bark . If Nik is having a good day, I may even make my microwave toffee\u2026 Then, I will divvy it up, package it, and write my holiday letters to mail to the hospitals where Nik spent  so much   of his first year. Though we no longer see them, the doctors and nurses, social workers and chaplains are firmly woven into the fabric of our family. To not send them something would be like forgetting to give my mother a gift! \n Friendship is a precious gift to give at Christmas time. A Cherished gift, a treasured gift that lasts through all time. ~ Unknown ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1rR7EN-ItI/AAAAAAAAAX8/w87EhjFJNNo/s1600-h/DSC02051.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1rR70N-IuI/AAAAAAAAAYE/YOmZ9LPWyog/s1600-h/DSC02053.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/12/claus-and-effect.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/12/claus-and-effect.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/paging-doctor-house.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-doctor.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/same-as-it-ever-was.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/paging-doctor-house.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/cookies-and-progress.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/paging-doctor-house.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/04/ramblings-of-neophyte-orig-posted-422.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/12/08/thoughts-of-the-season/", "title": "Thoughts of the\u00a0Season"},
{"date": "August 5, 2007 ", "body": "In case anyone\u2019s been worrying about my absence over the past few days \u2014all is well in Niksworld. In fact, you could almost say it\u2019s been  idyllic . It is kind of amazing \u2014when I let myself remember to do it \u2014 that when I put something out to the universe, God, my subconscious \u2014or whatever one believes in\u2014 things do have an uncanny way of unfolding. My recent posts about my brief  existential crisis , and the outpouring of support and warmth from so many readers, really helped to crack me open a bit. I don\u2019t think I even realized how guarded I was being \u2014with my time, my energy, and especially with my heart. Perhaps it was simply fatigue, or perhaps it was a phase of a larger, natural cycle which is occurring in my life and I couldn\u2019t see it. Whatever it was, it feels like it\u2019s on the upswing now! These past few days have been absolutely phenomenal in every single way I could possibly describe; perhaps I should go buy lottery tickets tonight? (Only half kidding\u2026) I\u2019m not even sure where to begin to relate all the things that have happened over the past week; forgive me if I ramble in a somewhat disjointed fashion from topic to topic. First of all, things with Niksdad have been peaceful and relaxing. We\u2019ve spent some great time together working on some household things both big and small, catching up on a bit of sleep, and simply spending time together both with and without Nik. My sixteen year old niece even volunteered to babysit last night \u2014 FOR FREE!  Yes,   we had a date ! An honest to goodness date. Niksdad shaved and I even wore makeup and did my hair! Not that we don\u2019t do those things on a fairly regular basis \u2014just not always for each other or with such intention. We got tickets to see  The Bourne Ultimatum  and planned on dinner before hand. Nothing fancy because of the time constraints, but it was out and it was without Nik! I won\u2019t spoil the movie for anyone but I can tell you that we loved it! From the minute it started, we were clutching each other (well, maybe me a little more than him and maybe him for different reasons?) and the adrenaline was pumping.  AWESOME . Oh, yeah, Matt Damon is sexy, too! Anyway, it was a wonderful night and it felt \u201cnormal.\u201d I don\u2019t mean normal in the sense that our daily lives feel abnormal; I mean \u201clike the rest of the world\u201d kind of normal. As in, \u201cHo hum, isn\u2019t this so UN-extraordinary that it\u2019s almost boring\u201d kind of normal.  We didn\u2019t even talk about Nik! It\u2019s been sort of like that all week, though; like the spark has been rekindled a bit and the subtler expressions of affection are surfacing more. Even when we are together as a family \u2014which we\u2019ve been a lot this week \u2014the feeling is present. We haven\u2019t made it to the  beach  but we have gone to the pool several times. Friday we went to the  \u201cCan Do\u201d playground  before going to the hospital for appointments, and Saturday we went to the peach festival. (Each of the latter two events merits its own post\u2026coming soon!) Niksdad even turned down a chance to work this weekend \u201cJust because;\u201d it felt great to have him put us first again. Like I said, it\u2019s been a full week for us here. Nik, too, has been having his own momentous happenings. The kind of things that parents of \u201ctypical\u201d kids might miss because they seem so \u201cnormal,\u201d so expected. We had someone come to the house this week to do an evaluation of Nik\u2019s eligibility for services through the Division for the Visually Impaired now that he has been discharged from the \u201cDeaf-Blind\u201d program. When the woman, Ms. S, arrived Nik was playing by himself in the family room. As soon as Ms. S. walked into the room,  Nik\u2019s attention was riveted . He actually stopped playing, scooted over to her and pulled himself to stand using her legs. He looked up at her with a big smile and reached for her hands to play \u201cclap hands\u201d as he does with Nanny. Ms. S was a good sport and played along. I was surprised to see Nik take an active interest in someone besides the little boy in the mirror! What happened next floored me. Nik, still standing \u2014he is getting a bit steadier with each passing day \u2014reached out to take Ms. S\u2019s hand in his and led her to the sofa to sit down. Such the gracious host! He then proceeded to climb up on the sofa and sit next to her to continue their play. Ms. S did not realize it but she had been given a signal honor! Nik has  never  done that before. That same afternoon, when we went to the pool, Nik was very aware of other children nearby as he cruised along the edge of the toddler pool or sat splashing happily in the water. Though he didn\u2019t actively seek them out, he watched and seemed to perk up when one approached him. He even flirted with another mother! I wonder if he could sense her friendly curiosity about this happy-go-lucky child splashing and singing. She wasn\u2019t simply another  mother at the swings ; this woman was \u2014is \u2014a kindred spirit. She proudly introduced her beautiful 10 month old son with Down Syndrome and we bonded quickly. We shared an understanding that the path we have been placed upon in mothering our different children is not one easily accepted and understood in our smallish community. We lamented about the school system and some other shared frustrations, but mostly we talked about the special joys of our children and the moments we never want to take for granted. The whole time, Nikolas climbed all over this woman, playing with her sunglasses, her son\u2019s float, her daughter\u2019s goggles. The woman not only did not mind but encouraged him and praised him for being so smart and engaging. It felt like the hand of God had reached down to touch my heart. I didn\u2019t get the woman\u2019s name or phone number and I may never see her again, but I will remember her for a long, long time. Thursday was a very eventful day. We started the day with a  four hour eye appointment  \u2014ugh! I had a session with my trainer at the Y so Niksdad took Nik to the eye clinic. It\u2019s not an ideal set up; you have to arrive by a certain time and be prepared to wait with lots of other families. Still, the doctor is wonderful and she\u2019s the same one we would see if we drove an hour each way to her private office. So we trade off the hours in the car for the hours in an office; at least in the office, Nik is able to move around and engage with his environment in a way he cannot in back seat of the car. Anyway, it turns out that Nik did great at the clinic \u2014in spite of having to be restrained to have his eyes dilated. He was very social and incredibly patient! That afternoon, after the already too long eye appointment and  no nap , Nik had OT and PT. I worried that it would be too much and that Nik would simply fall apart. Oh contraire! Nik probably had the best session ever.  Ever.  As Miss D, the OT, brushed Nik and sang silly songs to distract him, Nik gazed adoringly at her! I was rather jealous, I must confess! Nik was putty in her hands as she did joint compressions and deep pressure. When Miss D put Nik in the ball pit, he not only grinned but he initiated a game of \u201cyou hand me the ball and I\u2019ll throw it out of the pit and laugh myself silly\u201d with her. Oh, the stabbing pain in my heart as I watched my son flirt and giggle and interact with Miss D; I don\u2019t know if it was from envy or pride but it ached. As if that weren\u2019t enough, the entire session was filled with my exclamations of, \u201cMiss D, he\u2019s never done that before!\u201d Even Miss D was surprised at how well Nik did with the swinging, the ball pit, crawling through the tube, pushing the cart, etc. He even let her put him in the big yellow gigaball \u2014TWICE \u2014without complaining. He hates the texture of smooth, sticky, inflatable plastic but he did it for her! He even graced her with a few independent steps. I am not sure if I want to hurt Miss D or adopt her! It was amazing, simply amazing. Miss D handed Nik off to Miss T, the PT, for their session. It wasn\u2019t quite stellar but Nik did some pretty good stuff. I can tell that he kind of falls apart after about 15 minutes with Miss T. I cant\u2019 tell yet if it\u2019s something about the dynamic with Miss T or if Nik is simply mentally fatigued by then. I think it\u2019s the latter; there\u2019s nothing about Miss T that Nik seems to object to \u2014 except for the fact that she\u2019s not Miss D! In the midst of all this wonderful-ness, I got a call from my husband telling me that my father had been in a car accident; he didn\u2019t know more but was on his way to the scene with my mother. My heart lurched and my heart raced at the idea of my Daddy, Nik\u2019s Granddaddy, in some mangled, broken state. I calmly told Miss T that I might need to go; Niksdad was going to call me with more information as soon as he got there.  DAD IS FINE . Whew! To make along story short, he misjudged some distance for a turn and got hit broadside by a truck. God must not want my Dad yet, because the circumstances of the accident are pretty freakin\u2019 miraculous. The trucker was near his home and knew that it was a bad stretch of road so he wasn\u2019t going very fast (about 40) \u2014the local cops and EMS call the area \u201cHelicopter Corner\u201d because they are always having to Life Flight someone out of there. Amazingly, the point of impact was exactly on the door post behind the driver\u2019s door. Another four to six inches toward the front and it would have been a very different outcome. Dad, we think, must not have seen the truck until just before impact. That is the only way I can explain the fact that he walked away from a totaled car without so much as a single twinge of discomfort.  None.  He\u2019s been checked over from head to toe by doctors and there is no sign of any injury whatsoever \u2014unless you count the wounded pride. 3 days later and Dad still has NO PAIN. Amazing! So we\u2019re living life in the fast lane here (ha ha). Big stuff. Good stuff. And it just keeps coming! I feel like I should put up a sign on my blog that says \u201cWatch This Space\u201d as I have more to share! Niksdad is working tomorrow night (yeah, his schedule got changed again) so I\u2019ll have more time to write.

{"date": "August 9, 2007 ", "body": "Today\u2019s post is from a special guest blogger, Samtra K. Devard. I have the privilege of knowing Samtra through some work we have done (and continue to do) to help make the family voice, perspective, and experience a part of everything we do in our state to educate the service providers, current and future educators, and medical professionals who care for our children with special needs. Samtra has been a tremendous inspiration to not only me but to a large number of parents. She is a passionate advocate for children, including her own three beautiful kids \u2014one of whom has Down Syndrome, and she works tirelessly to create greater opportunities for inclusion for all our children. I am proud to know her and to call her friend. ************************************************************************************* Everybody knows the commercials featuring the Maytag repairman. This is the guy who has nothing to fix. Of the millions of washers, dryers and dishwashers that are sold \u2013 the guy who was hired to fix any problems that Maytag appliances may have, has nothing to fix. Surely there is something that he can fix. Yes, only if something is broken! Just like the Maytag repairman has nothing to fix, Mom\u2019s of children with disabilities have nothing to fix. We are in essence Maytag Moms. Many of us are given a diagnosis for our kids and a laundry list of all the things that are wrong. We are presented with scenario after scenario of circumstances too bleak to contemplate. The problems that face children with disabilities and their families sometimes seem endless. And for many who are faced with a problem \u2013 the natural tendency is to fix it. A wise woman whom I love and respect once told me it took her a long time to figure out that her role in her daughter\u2019s life was to NOT to \u201cfix\u201d her daughter, because she wasn\u2019t broken. Once she learned that, she was able to come into acceptance of what is \u2013 and find peace with that. To function in a mindset that is about maximizing potential and life chances, rather than fixing the problems of a \u201cbroken\u201d child or family situation is so much more meaningful. The Maytag Mom is expending valuable energy trying to fix something that isn\u2019t really broken. Broken means out of order, not working, damaged, ruined, destroyed, defeated, dejected, crushed, dispirited \u2013 without hope. Our children are anything but broken. The sooner we stop trying to fix the situation or our children, the sooner we can begin the healing process and begin to function in a positive, less energy draining way. I have learned I am a Maytag Mom. I having been doing all I can to fix things. Acknowledging this has been so profound for me. It\u2019s taken a lot of soul searching in a short period of time to realize that no matter what \u2013 we have some circumstances that just are what they are. Nothing\u2019s broken. The good news is Maytag Moms are good at what they do and can redirect their energies to things that are about building and growing and uplifting. We can do with our lives what was intended \u2013 to live and love to the fullest. Love our children and the joy they bring. Resist any temptation to fear the unknown about what lies ahead. Certainly, what the Moms of children with disabilities face can be different than if our children didn\u2019t have a disability \u2013 but guess what there would still be something to deal with; just a different something. But I believe wholeheartedly that the heart, energy and passion of the Maytag Mom is why God blessed our lives in such a great way. Reminding ourselves of the blessings during times of turmoil all around us becomes the challenge. Maytag Moms \u2013 there is a great future ahead!

{"date": "August 7, 2007 ", "body": "Thank you to so many of you who sent good wishes for  Nik\u2019s  lead screening in the wake of the  recent toy recall .  I am pleased to report that  Nik\u2019s  lead levels are extremely LOW.  In fact, they are way under any  of  the typical  thresholds  for concern.  YIPPEE!!! Also, for those who have been following along,  Nik\u2019s  recent  immunology testing  came back good, as well!  The doctor called this afternoon to tell us that  Nik\u2019s  system \u201cmounted a robust response\u201d to the vaccines.  He\u2019ll still need to be checked every six months or so because of the  IgG  deficiencies  (two subclasses \u20141 and 3) and/or if he starts to get lots of illnesses or infections. That was wonderful to hear today since we had to take  Nik  for an EEG this afternoon.  Too soon to know any results \u2014this one was to check the status of his seizure activity.   Nik  has had  absence seizures  (like staring spells but not) for more than a year and has been on a few different  meds .  His new neurologist is hoping to take him off one of the  meds  because it can have some developmental impacts.  The technician entered lots of \u201ccomments\u201d on the screen as the EEG was running but I couldn\u2019t see what they were \u2014they were in numeric code , darn it!  I think  Nik  is still having seizures and worry about him as he becomes more mobile; he has already had a few episodes of \u201cdropping\u201d at school and at home.  That\u2019s where his head quite literally just drops \u2014slams, really \u2014to the floor (or desk or whatever is closest to stop it) and then he resumes his activity.  It\u2019s disconcerting that school won\u2019t consider a one on one for him; they want to educate the entire staff on what his seizures look like.  Been there, done that;  Nik\u2019s  got the bruises to prove how well  that one  worked. Anyway, that\u2019s the health report.

{"date": "August 6, 2007 ", "body": "As my little hometown grows up and becomes overrun with new housing developments and shopping centers, it is becoming increasingly rare to find celebrations of the old ways, the agrarian culture, and the simpler times. Sigh. As Rascal Flatts sings, \u201cI miss Mayberry\u2026\u201d One of the neighboring towns hosted their annual peach festival this weekend to commemorate the town\u2019s once rich agricultural history. You see, Delaware was one of the top peach producing states in the union until the dreaded peach blight of eighteen-something. Seriously. Nonetheless, there are a few large farms around doing a booming business; one of them always hosts a huge customer appreciation event complete with music, hayrides, a small petting zoo, and free peach ice cream cones all day long. So, Saturday morning found NiksFamily heading out in the sweltering, muggy air to embark upon an adventure \u2014to expand our cultural horizons. It was, I think, the start of a new family tradition. We ventured into the town center \u2014all two blocks of it \u2014to check out the official peach festival (which is separate from the event hosted by the orchard). The town\u2019s single train station \u2014long ago converted to the town hall \u2014doubled as the main stage on Saturday. Heck, it was the  only  stage! We wandered the street along the edge of the railroad tracks, perusing the offerings of myriad vendors. The local high school drum corps playing in the background, Niksdad and I held hands as we wandered and sweat. Nik wanted to walk a bit so we took turns holding his hand for support. When the heat became too much to bear, Niksdad hoisted Nik onto his shoulders. Now, I have been to many \u201cstreet fairs\u201d when I lived in NYC and near San Francisco \u2014the kinds with a gazillion different vendors and umpty-ump musical acts (some big names) and an air of highly organized chaos about them. Saturday\u2019s festival was  nothing like it . There were tables of crafts and clothing, jewelry and hand-sewn handbags, potpourri and wood art. And the baked goods. Oh, the baked goods. None of the slick, mass produced bakery fare here. No sir, each and every pie, cookie, loaf of bread and you-name-it \u2014all home baked by the ladies of the XYZ church auxiliary. Such a fierce competition between them, too! I found myself getting teary as we wandered; I suppose I could claim it was from the heat or the sun in my eyes. The truth is, I felt an odd connection to another time; I felt nostalgic for a life I\u2019ve never known but always dreamed about. I felt like time must have stood still for this one day, just for me. And that was just the beginning\u2026 After melting under the morning sun, we got in the car and headed up the road to the farm for the customer appreciation event. Now, my mother swears she use to take me to this farm as a kid \u2014to pick out pumpkins; I have no recollection of this whatsoever. I am sure I would have remembered such a beautiful farmstead; their event was so much nicer than the festival we had just left. There were huge tents \u2014set up under gigantic shade trees which have to date back well over 150 years \u2014with volunteers serving up refreshing ice cream full of thick chunks of yummy peaches. Mmmmm\u2026There were hayride tours of the orchards, a small petting zoo \u2014kind of a rag-tag collection of family pets and farm animals \u2014and a musician playing wonderful background music that you could sing along to. Perfect. I don\u2019t think words can do justice to the fun we had. Nik wanted to walk around holding onto one of our hands or he wanted to scoot along on the ground. Knowing how much Nik thinks he wants to eat versus how much he actually does (rather, DOESN\u2019T) eat, I decided to see if Nik would deign to take a lick from my ice cream cone. He\u2019s never really cared for ice cream before; it\u2019s too cold and too wet for his liking.\n \n \n \n Apparently,  the secret is all in the cone!  Not only did Nik enjoy the ice cream, he wanted to have his  very own cone  and \u201cyelled\u201d at me when I tried to share with him. He actually looked me in the eye, pushed my hand away and said \u201cNg, ng, ng, ng!\u201d which is how he says \u201cno.\u201d  Nik didn\u2019t really want the whole cone, he just wanted the control. But the fact that he ate numerous bites \u2014licks, really \u2014of peach ice cream was pretty monumental. Especially because he sat on the ground next to me the whole time and even tried to feed me a time or two. New stuff. A big deal.\n Ice cream finished, we wandered a bit and ran into some people we know including one of the para\u2019s from summer school. She was pleased to see Nik; he actually acknowledged her presence and held her hand for a moment. It was a sweet moment for all of us. \n From there, we found the petting zoo. Nik didn\u2019t seem to really recognize that there were animals there; perhaps it is because he hasn\u2019t had much exposure up to this point? There was a two-day old calf, some baby bunnies, a couple of pygmy goats, and a dog. An interesting collection to be sure, but it was just enough to captivate the smaller kids. Once Niksdad helped him pet the calf, Nik seemed to catch on a bit.   \n \n \n \n \n By lunchtime, it was clear that Nik was beginning to fade. We gathered up our dirty little ragamuffin \u2014with his dusty shorts and his dirt-smeared face he looked like the most typical three and a half year old boy \u2014and began to head to the car. When I heard the song that was paying, I had to stop and dance with Nik. How could I possibly resist the lure of \u201cAmerican Pie?\u201d I scooped Nik up and whirled him around as I sang to him \u2014and  he looked me in the eyes, threw his little head back and laughed! The more I sang and whirled, the more he looked right at me, smiling and laughing and clapping his hands. I could have died on the spot and gone with a smile on my face!\n Yes, definitely an occasion to be repeated every year! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RrfI0VkANRI/AAAAAAAAAF0/2lQ9oKujAfY/s1600-h/DSC01009.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RrfK81kANUI/AAAAAAAAAGM/vKkPYkzdZVs/s1600-h/DSC01030.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RrfI01kANSI/AAAAAAAAAF8/izGbISgZr-Y/s1600-h/DSC01021.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RrfK8VkANTI/AAAAAAAAAGE/m9boQYls2s0/s1600-h/DSC01012.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RrfNEVkANVI/AAAAAAAAAGU/dJPsHswWn-E/s1600-h/DSC01032.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RrfNE1kANWI/AAAAAAAAAGc/M_-cxPkfh6M/s1600-h/DSC01036.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RrfOOlkANXI/AAAAAAAAAGk/FAcXKHlHAlc/s1600-h/DSC01027.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RrfPG1kANYI/AAAAAAAAAGs/EuE5dnZ7wRY/s1600-h/DSC01045.JPG"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/08/06/idyll-moments-%e2%80%94-everything%e2%80%99s-peachy/", "title": "Idyll Moments \u2014 Everything\u2019s\u00a0Peachy"},
{"date": "August 9, 2007 ", "body": "The sun will rise as sure as there\u2019s a day time Don\u2019t worry \u2019bout a thing\u2026.in time you\u2019re gonna see Your life is everything you make it The hard times never last Trust in your heart and don\u2019t look back \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Be Alright\u201d (The Cheetah Girls) As summer begins to wind down and the start of the school year is around the corner, my heart has been heavy at the prospect of  Nik \u2019s upcoming  IEP .  Niksdad  and I already know that school is  not willing to budge  on some things \u2014most notably a one-on-one paraprofessional for  Nik . Their stance is that  Nik  is at an age where he needs to be able to generalize his learning and not rely strictly on one individual. The concern they raised, in our  non- IEP  meeting  in July, is that  Nik  is smart enough that he may find ways to not pay attention to the actual teacher but look to his para for validation instead. In addition, the principal feels very strongly about educating the entire staff about  Nik \u2019s subtle seizure activity and promises that there will always be eyes on  Nik . The principal is new to the school as of early July so I have to cut him some slack for his  incredible  naivet\u00e9 . I know from first-hand experience that there are not always eyes on  Nik  and that there are times he has been virtually ignored by \u201cseasoned\u201d paras who were sitting right next to him in circle time \u2014singing and gesturing their hearts out as  Nik  sat between them,  ignored and not participating . I know that my son has some very significant educational challenges and that the teacher really believes  Nik  has incredible potential; she just  doesn \u2019t have a clue how to  \u201cunlock it\u201d  (her words). I have tried my best to be helpful in relating my own observations and insights about what has worked with  Nik . I\u2019 ve  had countless conversations with the OT about my suspicions about  Nik \u2019s sensory issues being at the root of his extreme attention and regulation challenges. For whatever reason, my words seem to fall on deaf ears. This has often been the case with medical professionals as well;  Niksdad  and I persist and persist until, finally,  Nik  reaches such an extreme state that the doctors give in and investigate the things we\u2019 ve  asked them to. Many, many times we have been proven right. Righteous vindication  doesn \u2019t feel very good when you are watching your child suffer.  Or regress in skills or fall further and further behind his peers when he once made such rapid progress that therapists were amazed at how quickly he learned. With those things in mind and with the rapid and marked progress  Nik  has made in just a couple weeks of intensive work with his  new OT and PT ,  Niksdad  and I have decided it is time to pull  Nik  out of school. I\u2019 ve  checked all the legalities with the Department of Ed (DOE);  Nik   isn \u2019t required to be in school until he is five. Even then, it  doesn \u2019t have to be a public school, just \u201can educational program.\u201d Our situation is such that  Nik  qualifies for  significantly  increased services through his Medicaid so we don\u2019t have to worry about too many out of pocket expenses for therapies. As it is, the insurance has already authorized a  100% increase in his OT (from one session to two per week), a 200% increase in his  SLP , and a 300% increase in OT . This means that  Nik  will now be getting the level of services which were recommended by multiple independent evaluations done over the past 12 months. Sure, we could keep  Nik  in school and add the therapies on top of that, but we have to weigh the cost of that against the quality of life for  Nik  and for us as a family. He is simply too young to be spending every waking hour in some sort of rigidly structured activity. Seven hours of school each day \u201420% of that spent confined to a chair for tube feedings, plus another two hours of therapy daily (including travel time) \u2014home just in time for dinner then bed (since  Nik   doesn \u2019t nap much at school and cannot stay up much past 7p). Then throw in the time missed from school for doctor\u2019s appointments\u2026It\u2019s just not realistic to expect ANY 3 \u00bd year old child to tolerate that much without some serious PLAY \u2014let alone my little Energizer Bunny to the Nth Degree. The more we thought about it and talked about, the easier the decision was to make. To say that  Niksdad  and I are excited at the prospect of  Nik \u2019s inevitable progress would be a gross understatement. Plus, the idea of not having to wrangle with school over every last little thing \u2014the classroom staff about feeding, nap, and communication about  Nik \u2019s day, the school nurse over every last little tweak to  Nik \u2019s tube feedings, finding out the hard way that they ran out of diapers or some other supply for  Nik , etc \u2014feels like another headache mitigated. I know it will be a challenging transition for us \u2014 Niksdad  begins his nursing  clinicals  in another couple of weeks and will have very little free time (especially after putting in hours at Home Depot, too!) and I may feel slightly (a lot?) overwhelmed at first. But it also feels a bit like I finally get a shot at the \u201cnew mother bonding\u201d that I  didn \u2019t get when  Nik  was born. By that I mean that he and I will sort of feel our way through it together. We\u2019ll figure out a new schedule, new activities and adventures. I have already begun to set up a regular therapy schedule for  Nik  \u2014 the same time each day for OT and PT \u2014and we\u2019 ve  gotten insurance approval for the developmental playgroups, too! Imagine \u2014built-in play dates! I have visions of finally being able to do the things that \u201cthe other moms\u201d get to do \u2014Mommy and Tot swimming, music class, toddler story hour at the public library. Walks in the park with other moms, the occasional shopping trip with a friend and her kids \u2014  things we  couldn \u2019t even dream about doing  before because of  Nik \u2019s school schedule. And it\u2019s not like I will get  another chance  at this gig\u2026 I think I may become less angst-ridden about my own future as well.  Niksdad  and I had a long discussion about him being the sole income earner; he finally gave me \u201cpermission\u201d to let go of my guilt about not contributing financially. I no longer have to think about rushing out to get a job \u2014any old job for income \u2014 unless or until the time comes when  Nik  is ready to go back to school and I have an idea of what will make me happy. Have I mentioned how much  I love and appreciate my husband ?  I DO . I will no longer have to schedule my workouts around  Niksdad \u2019s or  Nik \u2019s school/work schedule quite as rigidly. I now have the freedom to put  Nik  in the childcare area while I work out and get a little \u201cme\u201d time. What a concept! I know my own mother is anxious that I will become more  overwhelmed  and  exhausted , but I truly feel this is the right decision for us. We will figure it out and find a new equilibrium. Just as we did in those awkward and terrifying first days at home after our 209-day  NICU  stay. I think we\u2019 ve  done fine so far. In fact, I\u2019d say we\u2019 ve  done very fine, indeed.

{"date": "August 14, 2007 ", "body": "\u201cI think we all feel like that, sometimes: forgetting that we have exactly what we need already within ourselves, if we can just believe in it.\u201d \n Those words, about courage, from Jennifer\u2019s  post today  on  Pinwheels  really struck a chord with me tonight. It\u2019s been a very trying few days here in NiksHouse. I feel like the  dang centipede  is tossing its shoes again. The up and down, back and forth of emotions and activities is exhausting. In spite of my working out regularly and trying to eat healthfully, I just feel like Dorothy must have felt in the poppy field. I simply want to lie down and sleep and let it all go on without me. \n But I cannot. I guess that\u2019s the cost of trying to be a good mother \u2014no, of BEING a good mother. There isn\u2019t much rest or respite and we have to take it where and when we can find it. I find mine online with you all. I\u2019ve been jonesing to write for the past couple of days but haven\u2019t been able to find the time. Now, it feels like I need to cram a lifetime into one post. Sigh\u2026 Did I mention that there are some incredible moms out there who simply must have ESP? I\u2019ve gotten some wonderful emails from a few of you\u2026just checking up on me. It means the world to me. More than you know right now. I may not answer each comment or email but PLEASE know that they have all touched me in the heart. \n So I\u2019ll start with the easy stuff first \u2014 Nik is having surgery Friday to remove the tube from his  right ear . We have no idea if it will make any difference but we sure hope so! The  episodes  of rubbing and crying are increasing in frequency. Poor guy took THREE HOURS last night to cry himself to sleep. Nothing Niksdad or I did seemed to help at all. It was the tug-of-war with our hearts \u2014the frantic cries and clutching at us for comfort, coupled with the pushing away because Nik was so tired and just wanted to sleep. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t give him any Advil to help him make it through the night \u2014too close to surgery. (Anti-inflammatories thin the blood\u2026not good before surgery!) \n We survived the bumpy night and made it through the way-longer-than-it-ever-should-have-been pre-op appointment today. Nik must have remembered last weeks\u2019 EEG (I didn\u2019t write about it\u2026it was awful!) where he had to be strapped onto a papoose board and restrained for nearly an hour. (I cried when he finally passed out from exhaustion.) He had THREE major meltdowns in a two hour span while we were at the appointment today. Nothing I could do to help him except try to distract him from the nurses in their scrubs. Who knew \u201c white coat syndrome \u201d could start so young? \n Back home for lunch, the rest of the day went great. Off to see Miss D and Miss T \u2014 our new favorite therapists . Nik is doing so much better and really making some wonderful progress. I could probably write several posts about that by itself. Suffice to say; lots of good things are happening in terms of his attention span, starting to play appropriately with some toys (instead of throwing everything), more social interactions, generally a bit calmer. You know, only Energizer Bunny to the 3rd degree or so.! Nik is communicating a bit more using some hand-over-hand gestures to put our hands where he wants them. For example, he is a smarty-pants and can buckle the lap belt on his chair, his stroller, you name it\u2026but he cannot always open them. His new favorite game is \u201cI buckle, Mommy unbuckles;\u201d he clues me in to the fact it\u2019s time to play by guiding my hands to the buckle \u2014and wont\u2019 let go until I\u2019ve done my part, repeatedly! He is beginning to respond appropriately to things like laughter. He has the greatest little giggle. \n So I\u2019ve been having such a wonderful time thinking of all the fun Nik and I are going to have when he\u2019s  not in school  this fall. Not that I had any specific things planned, mind you. It\u2019s just the sense of freedom and relief since we made the decision to take Nik out of school. I was in the craft store the other day and walked past all kinds of finger paint supplies and fat crayons and play dough\u2026and I had to stop myself from buying it all on the spot! I realized that being able to work with Nik at home will help fill some of my own need to do creative things. It might not look quite like I imagined, but \u2014really \u2014it\u2019s the act of creating that is so crucial and that I have missed so much lately. I was getting really excited about  home schooling . \n Then the shoe dropped. Without getting into the details, Nik\u2019s only insurance is Medicaid. For which we have been incredibly grateful; they\u2019ve covered everything that we\u2019ve needed so far.  Until now .  \n Miss K, the admin at our therapists\u2019 office, told me yesterday that they had gotten approval for only a limited number of weeks. Not a big deal; it\u2019s easy enough to get new prescriptions/referrals every so often. The kicker, though, was the note on the bottom of the authorization form \u201c\u2026then transition to school.\u201d I felt like someone had kicked me in the gut with steel-toed boots. Not the sharp stab of immediate pain, but the dull ache which builds and builds. By the time I got home with Nik, I was in a state of near hysteria. I held it together long enough to give Nik his lunch and get him down for a nap. Then. I. Lost. It.  \n I pulled myself together after Niksdad and I talked about it. We decided not to get too upset \u2014well, a little is good \u2014until we checked it out with the insurance. Maybe we misunderstood. Uh, no, apparently not. I talked to someone from Medicaid today and explained the situation and that we had not intended for Nik to return to school because he had not made any progress. The response I got was \u201cOnce a child turns three, it is the school district\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Ohhhhhh Kaaaaaaayyyyy.  \n So here I am with a 3 \u00bd year old who functions, for the most part, like a 9-15 month old \u2014with some amazingly age- or near-age-appropriate scatter skills \u2014with concomitant medical issues whom no one wants to take responsibility for providing the necessary and appropriate services. School says it medical; Medicaid says it\u2019s educational.  Mama says its bullshit!   \n Niksdad and I both agree that school is not the place for Nik. In the year he has been there \u2014receiving his \u201c30 sessions per year\u2026minimum 15 minutes group, consultative, or individual\u2026\u201d in each of his services \u2014 Nik has made  NO MEASURABLE PROGRESS . Now, I don\u2019t say that to be dramatic. We have evaluations done by different professionals at different times throughout the year \u2014including the recent evaluations done by the new OT, PT, and SLP. Every single one of them puts Nik at exactly the same age equivalent as the other reports.  NO MEASURABLE PROGRESS.   \n Now, Nik has certainly made some progress, most of it very recently, but he continues to fall further and further behind his peers. This child whom every professional that has worked with him acknowledges is  \u201cincredibly smart,\u201d \u201cVery determined,\u201d \u201ca great problem solver\u201d  among many other things. How is it possible that this child then has not progressed? I guarantee it\u2019s not for want of Nik\u2019s trying!  \n So now we are in a holding pattern. In some bizarre turn of serendipity, I did not send the letter to school yet to withdraw Nik. Whew! I\u2019ve gotten past the feeling of being kicked in the gut but not past the anger or frustration; I will need both to fuel me when I want to quit because I am tired.  \n I\u2019ve reached out to some parents I know in my area who are very good advocates. Both have children with special needs who are significantly older \u2014 18 and 22 \u2014 and both advocate for other children through advisory councils and through the child welfare system. I am hopeful that one or both of them can give us some guidance about our next steps. I am also looking in to finding an attorney should the need arise.  \n So here I sit, preparing for yet another of Nik\u2019s surgeries. Oddly enough, it\u2019s barely even registering on the anxiety scale. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because we are truly relaxed and know that Nik will come through with flying colors, or if it\u2019s because I am so wound up about the school/insurance conflict. Whichever it is, we\u2019ll take all the prayers, good karma, love, hugs, and laughter we could get about now. Our well feels a little dry.  \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jennifergrafgroneberg.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/funny-most-days-i-feel-about-as-brave-as-a-jelly-donut/", "http://jennifergrafgroneberg.wordpress.com/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/keep-on-keepin-on.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/ear-ye-ear-ye.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/ear-ye-ear-ye.html", "http://mens-health.health-cares.net/white-coat-syndrome.php", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/moveable-feast.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/closer-to-home.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/closer-to-home.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/courage-under-fire/", "title": "Courage Under Fire"},

After a multi-year delay and lots of fits and starts, I think I can safely declare Nik is walking!  Not well and not very far at one time, but walking without a doubt! Lately, Nik has been taking a few steps here and there before quickly falling on his bottom and looking perplexed. Today, it took a moment for it to register what I was witnessing \u2014 my son striding confidently (and fairly well balanced, too!) across the family room. Yup. No cruising, no hand-holding, no hurtling toward an object he could hold on to. And he did it several times. My heart burst with pride in my chest!

After a rocky night last night and a rushed morning in which we had to starve Nik (just kidding\u2026he couldn\u2019t have anything to eat before surgery), we made it to the hospital with time to spare. Our little Energizer Bunny did so great; he really is a trooper. During the whole waiting period before surgery, he walked the halls with Mommy & Daddy. ACTUALLY WALKING! Woo Hoo! He freaked out a little bit when they took him back for the anesthesia. The anesthesiologist was really great though; I warned her that Nik is autistic and has a lot of sensory issues and instead of letting the nurses strap him to a gurney, the doctor scooped him up and carried him \u2014talking to him and laughing.  She made him so comfortable. Yeah, I got a little teary\u2026 The surgery was very fast; the recovery was bumpy but we finally made it home early this afternoon.

{"date": "August 23, 2007 ", "body": "\n \n Last night I was feeling a bit like I\u2019d been through a mini-hurricane. These past few days have been so out of sync and disjointed what with the  new floor  going in the family room, the rain which squelched all my fine ideas for what to do with Nik to keep him out of the way of my husband and father as they installed the flooring, the start of  school  yesterday\u2026I am feeling like I have been tumbled around by wind and waves and am not quite sure which end is up right now. Oh, and the ear\u2026always the  damned ear \u2026 \n In keeping with the yin-yang of life with Nik \u2014the frequent trips to  shoe the centipede  \u2014there is a rich amalgam of  incredible progress  and  triumphs  right alongside a heaping helping of  school-crap-du-jour  and a side order of  existential mini-crisis  thrown in for good measure. Roughly translated\u2026same shit different day! But that\u2019s a constant lately so I just need to keep breathing and keep moving\u2026and blogging! One story at a time\u2026 \n The floor. The floor. THE FLOOR\u2026is gorgeous! \n Technically, it\u2019s not yet finished; there\u2019s all the little cosmetic stuff like replacing the molding and placing the thresholds where the flooring transitions back to either carpet or vinyl. When I say replacing the molding, I mean it; we went to repaint the old stuff and parts of it were just cruddy with old water damage. I mean, we knew it had been there but it was kind of a non-issue \u2014nothing a little  KILZ  and paint couldn\u2019t cover. Until we pried it off the wall and saw a layer of black gunk on the backside of the boards thick enough to scrape off with a knife. And the mold spots that we found on the carpet padding when we tore all that out?  Ah-Ah-Ah-CHOO!  I don\u2019t even want to think about the amount of time Nik spent on that nasty old carpet! Eeeew! \n   \n The lovely dangling cable that had been jerry-rigged?  BURIED under the floor like Hoffa\u2019s body (wherever the hell the poor guy is, may he rest in peace)!  No more temptation for little fingers to pull and swing.  Whew!  Just in time, too. \n Niksdad and Granddaddy did a wonderful job; it went pretty smoothly from start to finish. They got to play with power tools and swing hammers (well, tapping, really), confer and kibbutz, and were spoiled rotten by my mother who brought them a homemade lunch each of the days they worked. Me? I changed diapers, ran useless errands designed to kill time, did tube feedings, herded cats (well, figuratively), and got my own lunch! Hmm\u2026I think I need a better negotiator next time. And there  will  be a next time. The terrible white carpet in the living room/dining room area? Its days are numbered for sure! \n Our little, oddly shaped family room looks and feels so much larger and friendlier now. The natural light from the back of the house reflects wonderfully off the maple flooring, brightening everything even on cloudy days such as today. But you want to know the  best  part about the new floor? The sound of little sneaker-clad feet  clomp-clomp-clomping  their way back and forth and back again! \n   \n The sight of Nik traversing our little family room over and over again makes all the crap I had to put up with this weekend completely worth it!

{"date": "August 18, 2007 ", "body": "Some people might say we\u2019re crazy\u2026 and they\u2019d be absolutely right.   Niksdad  and I are embarking upon a home-improvement extravaganza beginning tomorrow; we are replacing the carpeting in our family room with wood laminate flooring. Well, let me be a little more precise\u2026 Niksdad  and  Niks  Granddaddy are embarking upon said extravaganza while I take  Nik  away from the house and keep him occupied. We are doing this crazy project now because Niksdad goes back to school next week. When we moved into our little townhouse two and a half years ago, we knew we would eventually upgrade some of the flooring; the carpet is not in the greatest shape and, no matter how many times we steam clean it, it\u2019s always dirty! I\u2019m sorry, did I forget to mention that this is in the room where  Nik  spends nearly  all  of his indoor play time? It\u2019s also the room where I attempt to  feed  him; thus the carpet takes an especially hard beating \u2014what with the flinging of  spoonfuls  (and sometimes  bowls ) of pureed fruits, macaroni and beef, etc. It\u2019s not exactly an environment conducive to letting my son be the toddler he is while he plays with food and such. Unfortunately, the  kitchen  is too small \u2014 for anything  \u2014and the dining room has off-white carpeting. Yes, the previous owners were \u201c dink\u2019s \u201d (dual-income-no-kids) and had no idea that their poor decorating choices would be our nightmare! Unfortunately, it\u2019s not going to be quite as cut and dried as simply ripping up the carpeting and laying down the flooring. Let\u2019s just say the previous owners weren\u2019t exactly savvy when it came to things like figuring out where to place cable outlets and stuff. The only cable outlet in this room is on the diagonally opposite side from the only logical placement for a television. We\u2019ve had the cable company out to talk about installing a new jack; the way the wire would have to be run requires an electrician and a permit! Not happening. Therefore, we\u2019ve had to do some  very   creative  running of cable through the room\u2026tacked along the baseboard, running behind the baby gate, back along the baseboard, up the wall to hang from hooks suspended on the ceiling to run across the top of the doorway and then run back down the wall to the TV. All this to keep a very rascally little boy from playing with the cable. Side note, here \u2014someone ought to develop a gross/fine motor skill test that doesn\u2019t look for things like you find on the Bailey Scales. This one should include things like the ability to manipulate the clasps on one\u2019s stroller, the ability to extricate oneself from a  car seat  while parents are hurtling at life-threatening speeds down the highway, how to remove protective gauze pads from around one\u2019s feeding tube\u2026while said gauze  remains  completely in tact! Oh, and the ability to insert a 60  mL  catheter-tip syringe into the end of one\u2019s feeding tube\u2026all far more useful measures of development and cognition than stacking stupid blocks and putting pegs in a board  dontchaknow ? Back to the extravaganza\u2026while the baseboards are off,  Niksdad  is going to have to cut the drywall some to create a sort of channel for the cable to fit into. In the places where it has to go across a doorway,  Niksdad  will have to chisel a channel \u2014using some kind of tool (I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called, it\u2019s like a mini-jackhammer) \u2014 into the concrete slab so there\u2019s room to lay the flooring on top of it. We  think  the process will take two days start-to-finish. My job is to entertain the rambunctious boy  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE  while maintaining his  meds  and feeding schedule, his nap schedule, and  MY  sanity. Somehow, I think  Nikdsad  is getting the easier end of this project! If I\u2019m not back in three days\u2026send a search party. (When I return, I\u2019ll post before and after pictures, too!)

It could just be a habit now that we need to help him break. There does seem to be a lot less actual pain \u2014which is a very good thing!  We\u2019ve managed to make it through 48 hours without using  any  Tylenol or Advil.  Let me tell you that is a  major coup  in this household!  We used to go through a bottle of the stuff every other week! Also, Nik has not woken in the middle of the night for a few nights either.  Mommy likes that a lot!

{"date": "August 23, 2007 ", "body": "So much to catch up on and no idea where to start so I\u2019ll simply \u201cdump\u201d\u2026 First,  the Good \u2014 Nik has been doing amazing things since he\u2019s been getting regular PT and OT for the past month now. We\u2019ve seen a tremendous developmental surge just in the past two weeks \u2014more than could simply be attributable to the passage of time or the \u201cnormal course\u201d of development. I\u2019d almost be willing to test it by stopping therapy for a few weeks to see what happens when we re-start. I said  ALMOST . You\u2019ve already seen the  evidence  of Nik\u2019s walking; it just gets steadier and faster with each passing day! Today, Nik actually RAN a short distance in the hallway at school. RAN. I\u2019m telling you, this kid is on the move and I hope I can keep up with him! If I can figure out how to upload audio clips to Blogger, I\u2019ll share Nik\u2019s chattering, babbling, singing, and laughter \u2014it\u2019s all been on the upswing these past few days. Eating \u2014well, we\u2019re not giving up, but Nik still isn\u2019t eating at all right now. He\u2019s really interested and even likes a variety of flavors when we offer him \u201clicks\u201d and tastes of things. He pulls on our shirts and practically climbs out of his chair to get to what we have. This kid wants to eat so badly. Now we just have to figure out the means to the end. Medicaid has said they will authorize feeding therapy and we have one lined up; now it\u2019s simply a matter of paperwork being processed. I feel like there may be some forward momentum developing \u2014 I hope . Even Miss D and Miss T \u2014 our favorite OT and PT  \u2014are amazed at how quickly Nik is not only learning and integrating new skills, but at how he is suddenly figuring other things out on his own. Like how to work the \u201cSit \u2018n\u2019 Spin\u201d or how to sequence the game of getting in the ball pit, tossing the balls out and then getting out getting them to put them back in. He\u2019s showing fearlessness about one of the swings that used to completely freak him out; yesterday he climbed into it all by himself, unprompted! I thought Miss D was going to cry she was so excited! Me? I just smiled. I knew he had it in him all the time \u2014we just needed someone to help him organize his overwhelmed senses and frenetic energy. His \u201csocial\u201d skills are still lagging significantly, but Nik is now responding to songs and games and laughter in ways he hasn\u2019t before. He\u2019s making eye contact in more consistent \u2014even if somewhat short \u2014bursts. He\u2019s actually making a connection that\u2019s not just visual. He smiles and laughs or smirks in his impish way that lets you know he \u201cgets\u201d it. Miss J,  Nik\u2019s teacher  at school, sent home a note after the first day of school yesterday: \u201cGood day\u2026Played really nice w/shape sorter (ind.) and around peers. Nik was cooperative during coloring activity. Did try to escape about 4 times.  Independently put self in chair for circle time.\u201d To many of the moms of Nik\u2019s classmates (he\u2019s in an integrated preschool even though it\u2019s in a special needs school), that wouldn\u2019t merit any response. To Niksdad and me it was cause for celebration. Just a few short weeks ago, Nik didn\u2019t even notice his classmates were there unless they were in his way. Even then he didn\u2019t interact with them, merely plowed right over them. I heard from the school secretary, that her grandson came home from his first day in preschool yesterday and announced he had made two new friends \u2014and named Nik as one of them! I like this new little guy already! Even today, when I picked up Nik for lunch, Miss J, remarked at the changes she sees in him and the rapid development in his mobility \u2014 just since yesterday ! Yes, we had OT/PT yesterday after school and I did the brushing and joint compressions with Nik this morning before school. It helps, it really does! I\u2019ve also noticed that Nik is now playing in a more focused, purposeful manner. Whereas he used to flit from thing to thing to thing all in the span of mere seconds, Nik now spends minutes playing with the same item and really exploring all the aspects of whatever happens to have his attention at the time. He is following some more simple instructions and is trying to help with putting on his socks and shoes. Well, he holds them to the right locations anyway! But the fact that I can now say, \u201cOK, Nikolas, time for shoes and socks\u201d and he comes to sit in front of me and tries to help\u2026it seems like such a trivial thing yet I know from whence he\u2019s come and I can honestly say, \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, Baby!\u201d The Bad \u2014 School started yesterday with a mixed bag of emotions. On one hand I resent that I even have to  take him to school  at all. On the other hand is the fact that I genuinely like some of the staff at school and think Nik\u2019s teacher, Miss J. is wonderful. I can only imagine how frustrated she must get working in an environment where there is always a lack of something \u2014funding, equipment, human capital, concerned and involved parents. I think it gets very difficult because there aren\u2019t a lot of parents who either are willing to be \u201csqueaky wheels\u201d or who have the courage to stand firm and fight for what they know their children deserve. I think that makes it all too easy for the administrators to justify short-changing programs. But I digress. The staff at school was dumbfounded to see Nik  walk  into school yesterday morning. I wish I had videotaped his arrival. Jaws, quite literally, gaped. It was priceless! As we pulled away from the school, I said to Niksdad, \u201cDo you think they can handle him anymore?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cMe either!\u201d We laughed \u2014hard! Sure enough, when I picked Nik up before lunchtime, I heard numerous comments from staff about how Nik was walking off down the halls and how they tried to take him for a walk and ended up running to keep up with him. While I was walking down the hallway with Nik \u2014pushing the stroller with one hand and holding Nik\u2019s hand with the other \u2014Nik took off in the blink of an eye. He darted to a nearby door which was closed, grabbed the door handle and turned. The door was open and Nik was inside  quicker than I could even react ! The frightening thing for me is that the door he went through was the janitor\u2019s closet where there are chemicals and all kinds of stuff he could get into serious trouble with. It didn\u2019t even faze Nik that the closet was dark. Of course, I am documenting this and will keep tabs on all his \u201cescape\u201d attempts. I also made sure I told both the teacher and the school nurse about my fear of Nik\u2019s getting out one of the exterior doors. In light of all this, I think I\u2019ll leave him in school  ALL  day a couple of days next week so they have to deal with lunchtime and nap time, too. Let\u2019s see.  Lunch  THEN  \u2014 Nik used to sit moderately quietly in his chair as the feeding pump ran its course. He would be wheeled out to the playground to sit and watch his peers climb and run and jump around while he sat.  Lunch  NOW  \u2014Nik will need constant supervision because he knows how to take the tray off of his Rifton chair and can undo the lap belt and the ankle straps. Now that he\u2019s walking, he can walk off dragging the chair and feeding pump behind him \u2014quite literally! Nap time  THEN   \u2014Nik would play quietly in his portable play yard, content to be ignored or to strip himself and play naked. Sometimes he would actually sleep quite soundly.  Nap time  NOW   \u2014 Nik is too busy and too nosy to nap if others are around. He can flip the play yard over even with the weighted sandbags they\u2019ve put on it. Besides which, they are using the play yard for another, smaller child who actually needs to be protected from kids accidentally knocking into her while they play after lunch. Um, did I mention Nik won\u2019t lie still on a cot? Instead, he rolls out of it and then goes to explore. Oh, and then there\u2019s the whole \u201c Poocasso \u201d thing now that he\u2019s started to have BM\u2019s at school (so far). Combine that with the \u201cDid try to escape four times\u201d which was only in a three hour period, throw in the fact that Nik is obsessed with doors and not only knows where all the exterior doors are but also how to open them \u2014 even the automated ones with the push buttons . I give school  TWO WEEKS  before they are offering that one on one para they refused in our  non-IEP meeting ! At the very least, I\u2019d be surprised if they aren\u2019t a tad more open to the idea! The Ugly \u2014 So, it turns out that this really  is  a small town after all. I mean, I knew it but hadn\u2019t really experienced it first-hand until this week. Turns out that the PT at school, Miss B, knows the PT we\u2019ve been seeing over the summer (Miss T), my next door neighbor knows both Miss D and Miss T, and the SLP from school, Miss K, is getting ready to start working with Miss D and Miss T, oh and with Miss C who was the \u201cold\u201d SLP at school before Miss K. Confused? Yeah, I need a scorecard myself sometimes. Anyway, it\u2019s just a really good reminder to me of why I have been approaching everything as diplomatically as possible on all fronts. I save most of my furious ranting for you guys! Lucky you, eh? Actually, I am  really pissed  about the fact that Miss K is leaving school (though they don\u2019t know it yet; I got insider information! Woo Hoo!).  NOT  because I think so highly of her; I\u2019m pissed because this means yet another new SLP to work with Nik. Another slow learning curve, evaluate and prognosticate, postpone and \u2014possibly \u2014prevaricate. (Long story, but there\u2019s NO record of Nik\u2019s ever actually being evaluated by the first SLP when he started school; nothing, nad, zilch. Not.on.file.) Can you tell I\u2019m a  tad  jaded about the luck we\u2019ve had with SLP\u2019s at school? I mean, this is the same school and same SLP staff that didn\u2019t bother to tell us they  don\u2019t do feeding therapy  and, therefore, couldn\u2019t come up with things to help with developing a rotary chew and bilabial seals and all that other crap.  Nope . But they\u2019re HELL with PECS\u2026 At least with Miss K \u2014as much as she annoys the poop out of me \u2014we had a plan in place before the summer started. Now? Who knows  how  long it will take to get things geared up again? Oh, and the latest from the Autism Program about the official,  written  assessment? They\u2019re \u201cworking on it.\u201d WTF?? The eval was done in late May (21st), the verbal reporting was  done to us  (and I do mean that exactly as it sounds) on July 12th.  Still no written report . We ran into the autism program psychologist yesterday who gave us some bullshit song and dance about how they are \u201cchanging some procedures and the person who was doing the reports now is not doing them and the psychologists are doing them and\u2026\u201d Tappity, tappity, tappity, tap, blah, blah, blah. Like I give a rat\u2019s ass? Where\u2019s my damned report?! But I didn\u2019t say  THAT . Instead, I very politely nodded and said, \u201cWell, I am sure that whatever you put in place will be better. However, we still need a copy of the written assessment before Nik\u2019s IEP meeting. I\u2019ll look forward to getting that soon.\u201d Uh huh. I won\u2019t hold my breath on  that  report being terribly accurate, either. On the bright side, Miss B, the school PT told me today that she could probably arrange for us to be able to continue working with Miss T, the outside PT, as well; she said she\u2019d be happy to work with Miss T to figure out how to separate the goals and write a letter of necessity for us. Don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve mentioned before how much  I really DO like Miss B . Seriously, not just because of this. She\u2019s very good and has been the one therapist at school who has made any effort whatsoever to not only communicate with us but has actually asked me to come participate in Nik\u2019s sessions from time to time so she could show me some new things to work on with Nik at home. She nearly got sent overseas for her National Guard duty; I am so grateful she didn\u2019t have to go! So, there you have it. Whew, didn\u2019t realize I had so much pent up\u2026no wonder my brain felt like it was going to implode!

{"date": "November 3, 2007 ", "body": "And now my life has changed in oh so many ways, My independence seems to vanish in the haze. But every now and then I feel so insecure, I know that I just need you like I\u2019ve never done before. Help me if you can, I\u2019m feeling down And I do appreciate you being around. Help me get my feet back on the ground, Won\u2019t you please, please help me? John Lennon/Paul McCartney There are days when I feel so utterly lost and helpless for what to do about Nik\u2019s ongoing health challenges. I\u2019m not talking about the daily routine of tube feedings and medications, the seizures, or the weekly trips to a plethora of therapies \u2014PT, OT, Speech, Feeding, and the multitude of doctors appointments. No,  those  are pretty much second nature after all this time. Days like today, after nights of interrupted or nearly nonexistent sleep  like last night  (and the night before, and the night before that, and  the night before that \u2026) \u2014when Nik is especially quixotic, going from happy to distressed and back again in mere seconds \u2014 these are the hardest for me to bear. When Nik is in the throes of battle with his  mystery   ailment  \u2014which seems to be continuously morphing with each day, adding or changing symptoms \u2014  that  is when I am at my nadir. I am exhausted and anxious, worried, frustrated, and confused. I have been so grateful thus far that Nik truly doesn\u2019t seem to have any self-injurious behaviors except when he is ill or in pain. But lately that\u2019s been a constant. When it begins, I don\u2019t know what to do to help him. He\u2019s still small enough that I can try to hold him and comfort him through the worst of it. At the very least, I am able to provide an environment where he cannot do too much harm to himself as he thrashes and writhes, kicks, and pounds his head against the floor. The floor is the one I have the  most  trouble with; it is a laminate floor over concrete slab. I am so worried that Nik will give himself a  serious concussion . He already has a permanent lump on the side of his forehead from hitting it against the side of his crib at night and a new bruise has appeared on his cheekbone \u2014about the width of the space between two slats. Whatever is causing the pain seems to respond to Advil but the kid can\u2019t live on the stuff forever! And the doctors, so far, are no help at all. Days like today are utterly exhausting to me; I cannot  imagine  what they must feel like to Nik. A string of days such as we\u2019ve had  lately  with Nik\u2019s fever, rash, cough, etcetera leaves me feeling antsy, gloomy and short tempered with the  entire  world. I need to get out for something  more  than a quick trip to the grocery store or the gym. Niksdad, bless his heart, is so busy with nursing school all week and working every weekend that even when he\u2019s home  he\u2019s spent, too.  And he helps where and when he can, he  really ,  really  does. Respite isn\u2019t an option at this point because of Nik\u2019s medical needs; they are great enough to require skilled nursing care because of his g-tube and seizures yet there is such a shortage of home health workers that we cannot find someone willing to work just a few hours a day, a few days a week. On the other hand, they are not  so  great that he qualifies for home nursing care through his insurance.  And because of Nik\u2019s autism we are reluctant to leave him in the care of just anyone. Obviously, when Nik is not sick I can take him out with me but even that\u2019s been quite a while; he\u2019s been sick off and on  for seven weeks now  \u2014the worst being the past ten days. So, what do you do when you\u2019ve reached your breaking point and there is  no relief in sight?  When you are at the end of your rope and listening to  sad  or  emotional   music  so you can cry tears of release? When you can\u2019t stay in the same room as your own child for very long because you just don\u2019t have the energy or patience to handle their behavior or to engage, stimulate, or redirect? When you feel like a bad parent but you  know  it\u2019s the devil of sleep deprivation and anxiety talking in your ear? What do  you  do?

{"date": "November 4, 2007 ", "body": "Out of the depths come strange and wonderful blessings.  This I believe.  Out of my dark time (which I shared  yesterday ) I am receiving support and input from \u201cstrangers.\u201d  I put it in quotes because you are only strangers since we have not met face to face.  I appreciate the support, the love, the compassionate understanding, and the very concrete suggestions for solutions. Today, my heart is heavy still \u2014though not as heavy as my eyelids after our worst night yet last night \u2014but it is  full  with the gift of human kindness.  In the hours between dusk and dawn, those long hours of  waiting for Nik to sleep , I managed to think about some avenues toward solutions and support.  I also managed to read an  entire  novel.  Patricia Wood\u2019s  Lottery   is the story of a young man with cognitive challenges who manages to win a twelve million dollar lottery.  The tale is rich and deftly woven \u2014told from the point of view of Perry, the delightfully grounded, big hearted and oft times gullible protagonist.  On the surface, it is a tale of his learning to cope with the sudden wealth of new found \u201cfriends\u201d and greedy relatives.  But it goes so much deeper than any of that.  Lottery tells a tale of profound and lasting love, wisdom and accomplishment beyond the expectations of others, and the struggle in each of us to have what we want most. It is a beautiful and poignant tale.  If you haven\u2019t already read it, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.  It will leave you with a smile on your face and lightness in your heart.  ************************************************************************************ As I mentioned  recently , Nik has been making some significant progress in the area of fine motor and communication skills.  I won\u2019t post any photo evidence but I will tell you that at 2:45 this morning (or is that 3:45?  My body thinks the latter!), Nik was still having trouble going back to sleep.  He awoke at midnight with a screaming, writhing, head banging frenzy \u2014jabbing at his jaw and face and trying to bite the crib slats.  After Niksdad and I managed to help him through it, he played happily with a toy in his crib.  I usually let him do this and he falls back to sleep with ease.  Sometimes it can take upwards of an hour for him to settle. Last night it took him a full two hours.  Just as I was settling in to sleep, confident that Nik would soon be on his way to Dreamland, I heard the whimpers and soft thump of Nik\u2019s head rocking against the crib \u2014his self-soothing rock versus the agitated pounding of a child in pain or distress.  I decided to wait it out thinking he would settle in a short while.  45 minutes later he was in full crying mode and calling \u201cMamamamama.\u201d  I went to soothe him yet again and cajole him into sleep. Imagine my surprise to find a scantily clad little boy standing in his crib \u2014the zipper to his sleeper completely undone and his diaper beside him in the crib.  Don\u2019t ask me how but he somehow managed to wet the bed without wetting himself or his pajamas!  Now that\u2019s talent!  As I reached to take the diaper, Nik looked right at me, put his arms in the air and said \u201cUp! Up!\u201d  His inflection makes it sound like a little puppy barking and it\u2019s awful darned cute.  Yet another moment I didn\u2019t know if I should laugh or cry. I guess we learn to take the progress whenever it comes, however awkward or inconveniently timed, right? Blessings, indeed.

{"date": "November 7, 2007 ", "body": "\n Well, I haven\u2019t wanted to say anything in case I jinxed our  very brief  run of good sleep. Unfortunately, I was right. Nik made it through two consecutive nights with only waking once before resuming the  prior pattern  of multiple interruptions. The kid has been pumped so full of Advil and Tylenol that even they aren\u2019t working now. In fact, the Advil has reached the point where it\u2019s irritating his stomach and causing tenderness around his g-tube site. So we have to go cold turkey on the Advil for a few days. Please,  please  pray for us that we make it through this week with sanity and Nik\u2019s poor little head in tact.\n ************************************************************************ At the risk of sounding a melodramatic, something is seriously wrong with my child. The flashes of debilitating pain that seem to strike out of nowhere and bring Nik to his knees, quite literally, are increasing in frequency and intensity. Where they used to only happen in the middle of the night, Nik\u2019s \u201cepisodes\u201d are now occurring at random times and frequencies throughout the day. He will be happily playing or singing one moment and  a mass of screaming, writhing, head slamming, face-punching pain the next.  Thirty to sixty seconds later and my happy child is back \u2014until the next one strikes. And, yes, they are  still  occurring in the middle of the night, too. I hear rumor that sleep is good for you; I\u2019ll let you know the next time I can confirm that one! \n Sometimes the episodes are as frequent as four or more an hour; at last count we were up to about fifteen episodes in a twenty-four hour period. When they occur, they are explosive and startling \u2014especially if you haven\u2019t seen it before. Poor Miss D, our wonderful OT, was beside herself yesterday when Nik had four episodes during his therapy session and playgroup. I think more than a couple of the mothers were frightened by the intensity and by Nik\u2019s need to find a hard surface against which to slam his head. (For the record, we  didn\u2019t  let him; we kept him on a mat for his safety.) \n Niksdad and I have been videotaping and taking copious, detailed notes about these episodes and any other potentially relevant information. We aren\u2019t seeing any discernible patterns yet but we  are  starting to see some evidence of early warning signals shortly before a full-blown episode hits. \n Reviewing the tapes and cataloguing information has been the most heart- and gut-wrenching experience. Worse, almost, than any of our  209 days in the NICU  or any of Nik\u2019s surgeries. Back then we were in the safe cocoon of the hospital environment with doctors and nurses at our beck and call. Whatever we couldn\u2019t figure out or soothe someone else was there to help us weather the storm. Now, it\u2019s just us on our own trying as best we can to get the doctors and nurses to listen to us. It\u2019s been an ongoing struggle for  more than a year  and \u2014at the risk of stating the obvious \u2014it\u2019s getting really,  really  old. \n However,  never  underestimate the power and fury of the sleep depraved, er uh, deprived.  Or the desperation of a frightened mother. \n After watching Nik\u2019s symptoms change yet again and the intensity of his pain ramp up even more over the weekend, I called the pediatrician, \u201cDr. Mary,\u201d on Monday morning and demanded an appointment. Fortunately, we are (too) well known there and it wasn\u2019t a problem. Of course, Nik is usually  fine  by the time we get to the office so I prepared a CD containing video of several of Nik\u2019s most recent episodes and gave it to Dr. Mary along with a two page typed list of all the various data we\u2019ve collected. Dr. Mary agreed that it is time to bypass all the individual sub specialists who, for the past year, have kept pointing the finger at some area  other than their own  as a possible root cause of Nik\u2019s distress or, worse, simply dismissing the episodes as \u201cjust behavioral.\u201d \n Dr. Mary is arranging for us to see the \u201cbig guns\u201d in the diagnostic referral group at the children\u2019s hospital we already attend; this group isn\u2019t nearly as photogenic as  Hugh Laurie and his gang , alas. They are, however, the ones to turn to when no one can find a specific single diagnosis. And one might presume that, also unlike  House\u2019s gang , they won\u2019t misdiagnose and treat for half a dozen things before they find the right answer. Jeez, if I\u2019d known a year ago that this group exists I would have pushed to see them sooner! \n So, we are now waiting for an appointment \u2014hopefully sometime within the month of November. Dr. Mary said if they cannot see Nik sooner then she will begin to order things like an MRI, another round of comprehensive blood work, and any other possibly useful diagnostic tools at her disposal. \n Meanwhile, we wait. And hope. And  pray  that it is none of the things that have been mentioned in passing as \u201cthings we need to rule out.\u201d Scary things.  Life altering things.  Yes, potentially more so than even autism. \n I wrote in a recent email to another mom that I wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing there yet.\u201d That was  before  the bottom dropped out this weekend. Somehow, I\u2019ve landed \u201cthere\u201d and it\u2019s dark and scary and lonely. Watching Nik struggle and suffer so feels like watching an accident in slow motion and not being able to do anything to stop it. I have good moments when Nik does and not so good moments when he\u2019s in the throes of pain. Then I take myself off to another room and fall apart. Then I pick myself up and carry on;  I have no other choice. \n I\u2019ve taken to heart much of the support I received in response to my  previous post . I\u2019ve begun to carve out time for me where I can; I\u2019ve resumed my twice weekly sessions with a trainer at the Y and set some goals to help me stay on track with taking care of my body. That helps with the mind as well. I\u2019ve even let my mother do my laundry! \n I\u2019ve  actively  taken the advice of  Redhead Momma  and started to reevaluate  everything  in my life \u2014to weed out the things that just don\u2019t work. It\u2019s been so hard to do but I have stepped back from some of the activities I\u2019ve been involved in having to do with advocacy and helping to create a network of family services in my state. I\u2019ve been working with a very dedicated group of parents for over a year now; we co-teach university courses in education, do professional in-service trainings for teachers, therapists, medical professionals, social workers and anyone in our state who may impact the life of a child with disabilities. It has been richly rewarding work and I have grown tremendously as a result. However, when I began the work Nik was in a much different and better place with respect to his health. Now it is time for me to take that outward flowing energy and refocus it inward on my immediate family. \n It is difficult to let go of the \u201cshoulds\u201d in my head which make me think I am letting people down. I wonder how many of us live our lives out of those places within, fearful of not being \u201cenough\u201d if we don\u2019t put ourselves out there in a bigger way. I have to remind myself that there will always be a time for me to jump back into the fray. That taking care of my family,  especially my strong yet still-fragile child,  is the most important thing I can do right now. It is  my way  of making a difference in this world.

My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick. Excerpts from  Hippocratic Oath\u2014Modern Version \n \n (Written in 1964 by Louis Lasagna, Academic Dean of the School of Medicine at Tufts University, and used in many medical schools today.) \n I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and love in response to  yesterday\u2019s post  about our  latest challenge . I have gone back to read and re-read your comments many times today as I wait for the phone to ring with word of an appointment with the diagnostic team. \n Mea culpa  for unwittingly leading you astray on one point \u2014 Dr. Mary is one of the \u201cgood guys.\u201d  Nik\u2019s  former  pediatrician, whom we loved dearly (but who did not tell us about the diagnostic referral group), retired over the summer. Dr. Mary took over her practice in July and saw Nik for the first time then. Fast forward to September and Dr. Mary has become a loved and respected member of Nik\u2019s medical team. \n Dr. Mary is one of very few doctors on our team \u2014which includes no fewer than six doctors \u2014who has taken the time to listen to our concerns and questions and honor them. She is  genuinely  interested in our theories, believing that we truly do know Nik best and understand his communication like no one else does. She has shown us time and again over these past couple of months that  she trusts our judgment about our own child  and doesn\u2019t think we are imagining phantom illnesses and symptoms. \n She supported us in our fight to take Nik out of school, and has acknowledged to us that some of the specialists at the hospital  are  difficult to work with. She thinks that we are seeing the most brilliant neurologist in the  entire  state, but agrees with us that the brilliance is useless if we cannot access it when we need it because the doctor is so in demand.  She truly understands the importance of the doctor-patient/doctor-parent relationship. Another point in Dr. Mary\u2019s favor \u2014and it is no mean thing\u2014 she  ADORES  Nik. It is mutual. Only for Dr. Mary will Nik lift his shirt in anticipation of the stethoscope. Only for her will he sit placidly and turn his head, reaching to assist with the otoscope.  For no one else  will my son even  think  about opening his mouth to allow the quickest peek at his throat. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the fact that she is a mother of three small children or if it\u2019s just because she is a genuinely good and caring soul, but  Nik trusts her as much as he trusts his Daddy and me.  Niksdad and I respect Nik\u2019s instincts tremendously. \n Upon  my  oath, she is a gem without compare. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RzNbH2ofE7I/AAAAAAAAATM/8u3ArvJN_08/s1600-h/Norman-Rockwell_Doctor_Doll.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RzNZsGofE6I/AAAAAAAAATE/5_yWwdOKFYk/s1600-h/Norman-Rockwell_Doctor_Doll.jpg", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/paging-doctor-house.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/11/paging-doctor-house.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/the-good-doctor/", "title": "The Good Doctor"},
{"date": "November 12, 2007 ", "body": "Because I don\u2019t believe it is possible to live in a constant state of despair or euphoria \u2014whether by Divine design or the laws of physics, nature, or what have you \u2014 I am pleased to report that we had a  good   night  last night! Nik slept through the night \u2014mostly. He really only stirred a few times and I didn\u2019t actually have to get out of bed to go to him. Wow. \n I  absolutely  attribute that progress to the  power of prayer and positive thinking  which has flowed forth from all of you in the past few days. Yesterday wasn\u2019t any better than previous days and yet Nik  slept like a rock last night . I even took some time yesterday afternoon, while the rest of the household was sleeping (Nik and both cats \u2014all nestled in their respective places) to do something  utterly   mundane  and completely normal. I  baked  cookies !  Did I have any special occasion which required them? No. Did I want to eat them? Well,  duh , of course \u2014but that wasn\u2019t my motivation. I just needed to feel  normal  for a while.  \n This is  close  to the time of year when I start baking and creating goodies to send to the army of doctors, nurses, therapists and social workers back in California and here in Delaware who helped pull our family through those many dark months after Nik was born and who have so impacted our lives since then. Such a simple thing really \u2014the baking and making of goodies \u2014and yet it is the only thing I feel I can do that is from my heart and my hands to say \u201cthank you\u201d no matter that it seems trivial and inadequate.

It doesn\u2019t exactly address the root cause but it puts all of Nik\u2019s symptoms into a context which makes so much sense and points to some possible avenues for further exploration. I am going to talk to Dr. Mary about it at some point today. She called Friday night and we are going to start scheduling some testing for Nik while she waits to get something scheduled with the diagnostic group. \n It\u2019s not answers and resolution \u2014 yet . But I feel more hopeful and so much less alone in this than I have in a very long time. Thank you for your kind words of support, your prayers, your personal emails. They really do make a difference. \n Today, my heart feels lighter. I\u2019m going to revel in the feeling and use it to continue the forward momentum.   \u2026or maybe  just revel.

{"date": "November 8, 2007 ", "body": "It\u2019s been a  tough road  for us lately in NiksHouse but somehow we keep getting up in the morning (or, in some cases, staying up all night) and putting one foot in front of the other. I give full credit for that feat to my little miracle man, Nik. It\u2019s as if he doesn\u2019t realize or remember the  excruciating pain  he experiences multiple times each day; somehow it\u2019s new each time it hits him. Baffling. Amazing. Inspiring. A constant reminder to me of why I do the things I do. (Like I really need one?) As I\u2019ve  written , I recently stepped down from some community advocacy and activism activities (try saying  THAT  ten times really fast!). It\u2019s been difficult not only from the standpoint of feeling like I \u201cshould\u201d do something to give back or to help other families; it\u2019s been more personal. Not only am I highly motivated and inspired by my own sweet boy, but also by the struggles of a dear friend who\u2019s daughter has Down Syndrome. She recently shared an experience with me that just  broke my heart.  She\u2019s given me permission to share it with my readers: (emphasis added is mine) \n \n I am writing to share my personal testimony with all of you who stand with me in my quest to positively impact the world of children with disabilities and their families. \n My heart is breaking right now because my daughter\u2019s regular education classroom went on a class trip without a thought of including her on the trip. My child integrates in a regular general education classroom for at least half of her day. The remainder of her time is spent with a special educator in a self-contained setting. \n How do you explain not even considering a child you know is with you everyday? How do you reconcile leaving out any child? How can anyone possibly hold any hope for a child you don\u2019t even consider? \n How soon will this change? I recognize that my advocacy efforts won\u2019t help my child today, but  when will what I do begin to matter for my child? When will children with disabilities count as much as children without? \n I cry \u2013 because I don\u2019t know the answers. I really don\u2019t. How can we begin to impact learning if we are still trying to figure where a child belongs? \u2026I only want you to know how important it is for you to keep fighting for families. Keep fighting for children.  \n \n ALL  Children. Please. \n I don\u2019t share her story lightly \u2014it was a very real and painful experience for her sweet and loving child. I share it because I want you to know that  whatever  you do \u2014however you choose to do it \u2014to take a stand for our children with disabilities of all stripes is important. It may be simply that you are raising a child with a greater awareness of differences and acceptance. Or perhaps you are at the forefront of a larger movement \u2014be it local, national, or international. Perhaps you advocate through your writing and speaking, your teaching, or your church activities. It doesn\u2019t matter  what  you do; what matters is  that you do it . For my son, for her daughter, for your own children or grandchildren.  For children you will never know.

I\u2019ve spoken to  the pediatrician  and we are formulating a concrete plan of action to try to find some answers. Meanwhile, though, the situation is  not  improving and it is taking a  significant toll  on our entire family \u2014but most especially on Nikolas. He is flagging and I am  very concerned  for him.\n I am a firm believer in the wonders of science and medicine but I also know that there is tremendous power in faith and prayer as well. I don\u2019t ordinarily ask people to pray for something specific but I am asking you all to say a prayer \u2014to whatever deity or higher power you choose to believe in and to ask the people in your church, synagogue, or mosque to lift their voices in prayer \u2014for healing for my son. \n Please, please pray for healing and peace for my little boy. For God to guide the hands and hearts of those entrusted with his care that they may find answers which will allow them to ease Nik\u2019s discomfort and which may lift the burden of fear and uncertainty for our family. \n My personal relationship with God is just that, so I don\u2019t talk about it much with others. But I  do  believe that God brought Nikolas to this world for some great purpose as yet unknown. I am humbled daily at the prospect of God\u2019s unwavering faith in me and in my husband to guide our special child through this journey of great trials. I am fearful that I will falter on the path and will not do what is right and good for my son, for our family. I am constantly amazed and touched \u2014 and humbled yet again \u2014 by the loving goodness of humanity, that strangers reach out to me and become friends in my hour of need.  Truly, this is the message of God\u2019s love in action. I take comfort in knowing that we \u2014Nik, Niksdad and I \u2014are enfolded in the hearts of so many and can rest peacefully, for however short a time each night. That the love we put forth comes back to us manifold in blessings we cannot envision.

{"date": "December 16, 2007 ", "body": "Were I to measure what I perceive to be the quality of life for my child and my family this past year \u2014of my Nik\u2019s progress \u2014based on the past few months, I might indeed feel as dreary as the cold winter rain outside my window today. Nikolas has  been ill   a lot  this autumn; he\u2019s faced struggles which resulted in our  removing him from school . He is  still  battling with the mysterious  episodic pain  which stops him in his tracks and makes my heart feel like it will shatter from frustration over my inability to make it stop \u2014to find the cause to rid him of it  once and for all . I might also be depressed by the fact that my child cannot talk and doesn\u2019t point to make his needs and desires known to those around him. Or the fact that he still doesn\u2019t take any of his nutrition by mouth; he is completely dependent on his g-tube. I might be anxious about his sensory issues or his still being in diapers or any  host  of other things he can\u2019t do right now. Those are the things which throw themselves in my face each and every day. I can understand how some might feel they or their child are being held hostage \u2014that there is some  ransom  which, if only they could come up with it, if only they could pay it would release their child and their family from the frustrations and heartaches faced each day. But those people who cannot see the child in front of them are missing the boat so broadly that they are in danger of drowning in the morass of their own self-pity, tears, and hand wringing. I will be the first to admit that I  occasionally  indulge in all of those activities; sometimes I must simply for the  release of emotions  that threaten to pull me under. I must lighten my burden so I can rise above and keep moving for the sake of my child. Not some changeling who has replaced my stolen child in the dead of night \u2014 MY  child who is right here with me in all his myriad moods, with his multiplicity of quirks, characteristics and disabilities each and every day. In looking back at the year that\u2019s passed \u2014preparing for the newness and  potential wonder  of the coming year, I have been reminded of the  amazing progress  my son has made, the challenges he has faced and conquered, and the depth and richness he has brought to the lives of countless people each and every day. Even when I cannot see it, it is happening. All this with the help of,  and sometimes in spite of , all the intervention we can afford to provide for him. In our case, that\u2019s not a lot right now; if I won the lottery I would find a way to provide as much as possible for Nik. Alas, we have to pretty much take what his Medicaid is willing to pay for and cobble together makeshift solutions where we can. It isn\u2019t always easy but  is  vastly rewarding. If I blinked \u2013if I didn\u2019t take the time to review \u2013I would have  missed  or taken for granted my son\u2019s learning to walk and to stand, to sip from a straw, to remove his clothes, to zip his jacket and unsnap his pajamas. I would have missed him climbing out of his crib and ignored the  marvel  of motor planning and balance, coordination and sheer confidence that feat had to take. I would have  missed  picking up on his uncanny ability learn the tune of songs he\u2019s heard only a handful of times. His ability to use some of those same tunes to communicate things to a savvy listener \u2014 I need to wash my hands, I need clean pants, it\u2019s time to brush my teeth, it\u2019s time for medicine . I would have missed the transition of my son going from complete sensory overload \u2014 to the point of near catatonic state at the end of the school day \u2014 to my home schooled child who now knows and can tell me \u2013using his body \u2013what he wants. Who takes my hand in his and leads me to the armoire where he can  see  his shape sorter on top; he tugs my hand upward to ask for it. When I take it down and ask \u201cIs this what you want, sweetie?\u201d he grins and sits down on the floor to play with it \u2014 with me . It is something we  always  play with together and he  knows  it. I would have  missed the complexity of his asking me to play  masked in the simplicity of requesting a toy. Or the beginning of him  trying to communicate  his hunger; he screams and cries and throws himself on the floor as if he is simply going to expire. It\u2019s taken a while for me to catch on but now I can ask, \u201cAre you hungry? Do you want to eat?\u201d and he will growl a funny little guttural sound and lift his shirt to expose his belly \u2014where he  knows  his feeding tube gets inserted and then he gets filled up. I would have missed the opportunity to teach him that he can say  \u201cMamamamama!\u201d  when he is hungry and to know that I will come to him; he doesn\u2019t have to thrash and fight for everything he wants. It is slow but it  is  progressing. I would have missed the opportunity to see that my child has come so very,  very  far from mindlessly pushing buttons and keys to hear lights and music without purpose \u2014or flitting from toy to toy to toy in a matter of mere seconds, unable to focus on any one thing long enough to understand what he can do with it, let alone complete a task \u2014to watching with pride as he sits and plays,  engrossed , in a musical book as he turns the pages and explores what the different sounds and pictures tell him. Or the ability to grasp a crayon and scribble a few lines on a page. I would have  missed the significance  of that development; the ability coupled with the  desire to communicate  something \u2014even if it is purely for or to himself. He  is  communicating \u2013a thought, a feeling, a sensation, a vision. Or his wordless  declarations of independence  \u2013of moving from diapers to pull-ups, from his special seating system to a regular booster seat all on  his terms  not mine.. His  determination  to walk or crawl up the stairs at nap and bed times with as little assistance as possible. His ability to communicate clear-cut choices of toys or activities. His  unbridled enthusiasm  about going for a ride in the car. His  unfettered joy  at playing with each of his amazing therapists. I would have missed the increasing frequency of sly smirks or mischievous gleams in his eye. Or the need to drop everything to clap hands with Nanny or Granddaddy when he hears them come into the room. The way he rubs his cheek and forehead against my husband\u2019s chin, feeling the reassuring scruffiness of Daddy. Or the squinty-eyed grin he gives me  every single morning  before he gets out of bed. My son communicates in  so many ways  if I can but slow down enough to hear him \u2013take the time to learn  his  language. I might have missed him learning to tolerate new textures, tastes, and sensations; he is gradually increasing his tolerance for things that I once took for granted like the feel of warm sand beneath my feet as I walk on the beach. Or the cool feel of water splashing on my face on a warm summer day. Had I not looked in the mirror at the reflection of this year, I would have missed those  subtle  shifts for Nik which have the potential to open up new vistas for our  entire  family. My child is certainly  not a hostage  being held by anyone or anything; there is no need to ransom him from anything or for any reason. He shows me  every single day  that he is ready \u2014 and able  with my help \u2013to fight his own way out of whatever box anyone tries to constrain him in. He is my  fearless ,  determined  boy who will prevail because of the strength of his spirit and his capacity to inspire love, loyalty and commitment in those around him. Woe betide his so-called captors of  any  ilk \u2014medical conditions, neurological impairments, bad educational systems, and  well-intentioned but misguided professionals  \u2014 even his parents  if they get mired in fear and limiting thoughts.  Nik will kick ass and take names later as he saunters out the door to his life.  His very  full , very  rich , and  increasingly present  life. If one lives each day wearing only the blinders of fear, limits, gloom and doom about whatever challenges their child faces, they will miss the child who has been right in front of them all along. The  real  hostage in this case is their sense of perspective. I am grateful that Nik keeps mine in constant, if delicate, balance.  *********************************************************************************** In case you have been in seclusion lately, you are most likely aware of the  Ransom Notes  campaign recently begun by the NYU Child Studies Center.

We had our final IEP meeting today to withdraw Nik from school. It went better than we anticipated it would; Niksdad was convinced they were going to try to throw a wrench in the works. I was sure they wouldn\u2019t. After all, they got the better end of the deal financially; they got funding for Nik because he was enrolled through October 1  and  they are no longer legally responsible for providing services to him. We had to hash out a few finer details such as the fact that the IEP signed under duress a month ago is not, in our opinion, a valid legal document. But, in the event that hell freezes over and we send Nik back to school before next September, he is entitled to receive the services outlined in that IEP. I won\u2019t say \u201cnever\u201d because that will only come back to bite me in the arse. However, Niksdad and I are very clear and very much in synch on the point that Nik will  not  return to school until the law says he has to. We took Nik with us to the meeting; he was a great ice breaker. Miss J, his former teacher (\u201cformer\u201d \u2014I like the sound of that!), was a little stand-offish until after the meeting. I think she truly thought that we were taking Nik out of school because of the  bad IEP meeting  in September. In truth, that was only the final straw. After the meeting, J came over to say goodbye and to see Nik. We made it  nearly  idiot-proof for the school and they seemed to appreciate it. One or two of the team members actually made it clear to us,  after  the meeting of course, that they thought we were doing the right thing. Miss D, the school OT (not to be confused with Miss D our new OT) told me she saw a difference in Nik since he\u2019s been away from school and that she thinks he would be so much better off after a year at home. She told me to call her so she could go over the sensory evaluation and help us get that information to the new OT. So, it\u2019s over. Done.

{"date": "October 16, 2007 ", "body": "Will you pick up the phone so millions of kids can go to a doctor? I\u2019ve already expressed  my opinion  about President Bush\u2019s recent veto of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).  But now it\u2019s time for action from all of us who can make a difference in the lives of children \u2014many of whom have no other alternative.\n \n The President and Congressional opponents of SCHIP have put out a steady diet of misinformation about SCHIP. According to a recent study done by the  Urban Institute , at least 70 percent of the children who will gain health coverage through SCHIP are in families with incomes below twice the poverty level ($41,600 for a family of four; $34,340 for a family of three).\n SCHIP has made it possible for millions of children to receive health coverage at a time when fewer and fewer parents are able to cover their children through their employer\u2019s insurance programs. However, the number of uninsured children has  risen  again in the last two years; this is due in part to the dwindling funds for the SCHIP program. The new bill is expected to  reverse  this disturbing trend while the President\u2019s proposal would cover 800,000  fewer  children than are currently insured through the SCHIP program. (Read more about this critical topic  here .)\n On  Thursday, October 18 , the U.S. House will vote on overriding the President\u2019s veto so these millions of children can get care. The President\u2019s veto stands in the way of providing health coverage to nearly  4 million uninsured children . That veto would stop them from joining the millions of children currently enrolled in SCHIP. Rejecting the veto takes a two-thirds vote. It will be close, but  your call can make a difference . Please call your Representative(s) on Wednesday, October 17th using this toll-free number: 1-800-965-4701 Provided courtesy of American Friends Service Committee(AFSC) Ask for your Representative\u2019s office* \u2013 Urge him/her to vote to provide health coverage to millions of uninsured children by overriding the veto of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (officially designated as H.R. 976).\n *If you don\u2019t know your Representative\u2019s name you can find it  here . To see how your Representative voted on final passage of the children\u2019s health bill go  here . \n If your Representative voted  no , or  didn\u2019t vote , your call is  especially  important \u2013 some of the no votes or absences must be turned around in order to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. Even if you\u2019re sure your Representative will vote in favor of the bill, please call anyway.   An extremely high call volume will let your Representative know that you are watching this important issue and that you  want  children to have health care.  Encourage them to keep on fighting for this bill.  We can get there if you call! \n Please  encourage everyone you know  who cares about children to take the time to make this important call. \n ******************************************************************************** NOTE: AFSC welcomes groups to circulate and use the toll-free number in support of non-partisan federal goals and without linking the alert to a website soliciting donations or actions which may be used to support partisan lobbying or work.

{"date": "October 18, 2007 ", "body": "\n In the life of every parent, regardless of age, gender, socio-economic status or political beliefs, there comes the first of many moments which define you beyond the mere biology which has led you to a  point non plus . When is it acceptable, nay  encouraged , to reward or celebrate bad behavior? This is the cross-road at which I found myself this morning.\n Nik and I had a very busy morning today. We woke before dawn \u2014Nik\u2019s bedtime dose of Advil having worn off around 4:30 a.m. \u2014to greet the day with squeals and cries of delight (his, not mine) interspersed with sporadic head banging (mostly Nik). After a spot of breakfast, we packed up our gear and headed off to our morning workouts. Nik\u2019s first \u2014an hour spent in the delightful company of Miss D and Miss T for both OT and PT \u2014followed by my session with my trainer at the Y. \n Nik was in fine form this morning. Happy and highly interactive, he greeted Miss D with a big smile then promptly giggled and ran across the room; it\u2019s a delightful new game he\u2019s begun to play, called  \u201cCatch me if you can.\u201d  The adventures continued through the dual session as Nik  independently  climbed up the ladder (!!) to the platform above the slide and ball pit. The first time around he waited for Miss D to hold his hands and then he jumped into the ball pit. \n \n \n The next time through he waited for Miss T to encourage him to do it again \u2014then veered at the last second to slide  head first  down the sliding board. It is a hoot to watch; Nik points one toe straight out behind him and flexes the other foot to rub the toes along the inside of the slide as a tension-type braking mechanism. All the while he holds onto the outside of the slide with his hands. The result is a perfectly controlled, danger-free sensory delight!\n Now, you may be wondering where the bad behavior comes in to play, yes? Apparently, it only happens when Mommy\u2019s not around! \n Energized and feeling fine (God bless the wonders of Advil and Tylenol to control the persistent pain and inflammation Nik is still experiencing in his right ear \u2014but it\u2019s  not an ear infection !), we took off for the Y. Nik has been doing really well in the child care area as I work out. He pretty much keeps to himself \u2014finding familiar toys with which to entertain himself between bouts of tipping over chairs and laughing hysterically. (Side note, the last time he did this he actually then picked the chairs back up! Progress.) I left Nik in the care of the staff and a very busy group of children. I\u2019m not even certain Nik noticed my departure. Sigh\u2026 \n Fast forward an hour. Sweaty Mommy comes to get Nik so we can go home. The supervisor begins to tell me how Nik\u2019s been for the past hour; she knows he has autism and other delays and she\u2019s always quick to point out when he\u2019s either having a rough day or doing something really cool. She tells me, \u201cOh, he\u2019s been having a grand old time exploring the underside of the furniture, tipping the chairs, playing with toys\u2026 and stealing snacks from other kids !\u201d \n REWIND!! \u2026Did she say  stealing snacks ? From  other   kids ? She must not know who my child is. My happy loner who doesn\u2019t eat a morsel of food by mouth. Obviously, she\u2019s got him confused with some other cute little boy, right? My face must have said it all. She laughed and said, \u201cYes, Nik was stealing snacks. He stood and watched the other kids and, when they\u2019d look away, he snuck right in and grabbed some off the table.\u201d Apparently, he even made an attempt \u2014lip service if you will \u2014at  eating  one. Once he realized it was  actual food  and not a toy, he spit it out immediately. Apparently, licking food is OK, eating it is another matter entirely. \n I nearly fell over from the dizzying rush of shock and pride.  \n \n \n Attention to other children around him? \n Stealth? \n Food? I think I\u2019m going on vacation; clearly, my work here is done. \n \n   \n   \n   \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/Rxekv27NjjI/AAAAAAAAAQE/iil3lz3I3TY/s1600-h/stealthy_ninja.jpg"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/10/18/to-catch-a-thief/", "title": "To Catch a\u00a0Thief"},

Niksdad  graciously took his tour of duty this afternoon so I could get out for a much needed sanity break. That, and caffeine to counteract the effects of near-hourly  awakenings  through the night last night. \n The massage was heavenly; it wasn\u2019t nearly long enough but I guess it takes more than thirty minutes to undo the pretzels of tension which permanently line my back and shoulders. The product of too many months crouched over a tiny crib in the hospital followed by too many months spent lugging an oxygen tank while wheeling a small child around our old, hilly neighborhood. This, followed by more months of late nights hunched over a squalling infant, enraged at the injustice of yet another tube stuffed into his little body as I re-threaded his nasal feeding tube for the fourth time in twice as many hours. And countless times since the day he was born; the burdens of love I gladly carry for my child. \n So I guess I shouldn\u2019t expect miracles.

{"date": "September 13, 2007 ", "body": "A quick update on the school situation \u2014 \n I spoke with the case manager on Tuesday afternoon. While she seemed to be sympathetic to our situation, her official stance was \u201cLet\u2019s go through the IEP and see what school comes up with before we look at what\u2019s next.\u201d Toeing the party line, for sure. Needless to say, I got off the phone feeling very frustrated and a bit down-hearted. As I related the story to my husband Tuesday night, he reminded me \u2014being so much more pragmatic and less emotional than I am on any given day \u2014that to the larger entities involved (those being school and Medicaid), this is as much about a business negotiation as it is about the best interests of a small child who needs much in the way of supports and services. \n In other words, my son costs money and they want to see who gets stuck with the largest portion of the bill. Ultimately, they will come around to doing something close to the right thing;  I have to believe that or else I would give up the fight before I even begin.  In the meantime, they will haggle and dicker like two old-world merchants transacting a complex ritual in the marketplace. Sigh\u2026it is so hard not to take it personally and even harder still to wait it out. \n The good news, though, is that our advocate is worth a gazillion times her weight in gold. Seriously, I cannot say enough about the way she is helping us \u2014and it\u2019s not just in terms of the specifics of this IEP. She is a very passionate advocate for children; having spent the past 18 years doing the same for her child with disabilities, she has been tested in the fiercest battles and has emerged with an iron will which doesn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer without first trying every avenue to \u201cyes.\u201d \n It was at her urging that I delved into the  murky depths  of Nik\u2019s past. It has also been with her assistance that I made a significant connection today with someone who has the ear of one of the top people with Medicaid\u2019s Managed Care programs for our state. If someone can help push our case through, she may just be the one to do it. Of course, she warned me that she must first talk with our case manager and see where they stand on things so she doesn\u2019t step on too many toes indiscriminately. Ah, yes, the wondrous joys of state bureaucracy; no agency is immune to the politics and the red tape. Ugh. \n The other gift our advocate has given me is the constant reminder that, since we currently  do  have outside services for Nik \u2014already authorized by Medicaid \u2014we actually do have the power. I am not 100% convinced yet, but she keeps insisting that we will see in the end. I hope she\u2019s truly right; I am anxious about getting my hopes up but they are definitely a bit higher than they were a few days ago! \n Meanwhile, there is still no SLP at school to replace the one that left. When I spoke with the principal this morning, he told me that he\u2019d made an offer to someone but she took another offer; I\u2019m guessing it was in private practice or a non-school setting and infinitely more lucrative from both a financial and professional perspective. I feel terrible for the speech therapists at school; right now there are only two to handle 96 kids spread out over four locations and one of them is, I believe, only part-time. I can\u2019t fault the previous therapist for leaving; she felt like she couldn\u2019t make a difference for a single child given what she had to work with in terms of time constraints, limited resources, uninvolved families and administration\u2026it\u2019s a sad commentary. \n What makes it even more frustrating is the fact that many of the new therapists at school are just that \u2014 new  therapists. They don\u2019t have the background and the experience to draw upon to handle many of the more complex needs of some of the children like Nik. So those kids are left with nothing substantial in the way of help. I haven\u2019t seen or heard from too many other parents at school who either know that they can fight for more/better for their child or who have shown an interest in fighting for it. Sadly, many just accept whatever their child gets and figures \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d Obviously, I disagree. I almost think the little bit they get can be worse because parents make some assumptions about the consistency of what gets carried out in the classroom and don\u2019t follow it up with effort at home. \n I don\u2019t mean to imply that I think every child\u2019s parents thinks, feels, or acts this cavalierly; but they do at my son\u2019s school. The demographics are such that many of the children come from single-parent homes, are being raised by grandparents, live in foster care or\u2014 worse \u2014are homeless. There are some middle class families at school but they aren\u2019t highly visible in their involvement. I\u2019d like to try to change that; not only would I like to see those families get more involved, but I\u2019d like to see the district provide training to all families about advocacy, IEP\u2019s, planning for our children\u2019s financial futures, etc. \n I can see myself as an active, more deeply involved parent at some point. But that time is  not  now. Now, I want to focus on Nik and getting him the right supports to continue to flourish as he has begun to do\u2026at home. \n \n ************************************************************************************ \n Tonight, though, I am a quivering mass of nerves and anxiousness. We have decided that the line we are going to take is simple \u2014  no school for Nik until he is 5 . Sounds so simple, right? I know with every fiber of my being that this is the right decision. Yet, I am terrified of \u201cthem\u201d taking away his services and leaving him, us, with nothing. \n If you believe in the power of collective prayer or visions, please say one for us tonight and tomorrow? Pray, wish, envision, that Nik gets to spend the next year happily learning the things that most toddlers learn at home with their families. Envision that Nik stays healthy and grows stronger with each day. Envision that he continues to learn the fundamental life skills he will need when the day comes that we must send him out into the world. Envision that we can put that particular day off at least for another year. \n \n *********************************************************************************** \n In the midst of all the bleak feelings of frustration and near-despair, there have been some really sweet moments with Nik lately which have made me smile. Some of them have been visuals. \n       Others have been complete sensory experiences\u2014like this morning. Nik awoke at 4:30 am \u2014 all sing-songy and chirpy. I lay in bed listening for a bit and smiled. Dragging myself out of bed, I went to scoop him up to go downstairs. When I picked him up, Nik wrapped his arms around my neck, looked me in the eye and then tossed his head back and laughed as if we had just shared the greatest joke. This was followed by a light touch of his forehead to my lips \u2014our customary good morning kiss. \n The merriment continued as he played in the family room while I made coffee and got the pump ready for his breakfast. I stood for a moment and watched him play. He was the embodiment of the most exuberant, unbridled joy. There was no one thing I could see that was making him happy \u2014he just was. At one point, he was laughing so hard, he leaned against the TV, panting like a winded long-distance runner, then he doubled over and just crumbled to the floor in a heap of giggles. My face hurt from smiling so broadly. \n If only we adults could start each day that way; wouldn\u2019t the world be so much brighter?

{"date": "September 14, 2007 ", "body": "Dante counted wrong. That\u2019s all I can say about today\u2019s IEP meeting. It was, to put it mildly, the longest and most unpleasantly unproductive meeting I have been to in a long, long time. The actual content of the meeting was pretty predictable; we let school start to go through their spiel and, when the opportunity presented itself, we brought up the issue of whether school was appropriate for Nik at this point in time. \n Now, I must rewind a tad and tell you that one of the attendees of today\u2019s meeting was the district psychologist. Not an unusual happenstance at an IEP for a multiply disabled child who has been identified as being somewhere on the autism spectrum and having behavioral challenges to address. However, this guy not only didn\u2019t know jack about my son, he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to try to remember anyone\u2019s name. Instead of \u201cMrs. Niksmom,\u201d I became \u201cMOTHER\u201d \u2014usually said in a very condescending tone and followed by the phrase \u201cI\u2019m going to say something you won\u2019t like.\u201d Yup, by the time this jerk was finished, I didn\u2019t like ANYTHING he had to say; just the sound of his voice made me want to poke him in the eye. Lucky for him he was a few seats away and my arms aren\u2019t that long! \n Seriously, this guy must have taken a course in how to piss off absolutely everyone in an IEP meeting! He \u201cMother\u201d-ed me until I wanted to scream; he ignored my husband completely. Nope, did not address him ONCE. And the school OT? \u201cThat young lady there at the end of the table\u2026\u201d Somewhere along the line after I had voiced significant concerns over the fact that there is no SLP yet and my son has a documented regression and loss of previous skills, Bobo (the sarcastic name our advocate came up with for him when we talked after the meeting) made an assumption that I was threatening litigation and got all snotty and condescending about the law says this and the law says that. Guess he missed the fact that I knew what the hell I was actually talking about. GRRRRRRR.\n Bobo continued to be overbearing and condescending. I suppose I must take comfort in the fact that it wasn\u2019t personal; the guy is just an ass, plain and simple. He interrupted everyone; he talked over people as they were trying to talk. I finally shouted at him to let me finish what I was saying. Did he? Nope. Our advocate is actually going to complain to the district about his unprofessional conduct. \n So, when all is said and done? The meeting sucked and Bobo strong-armed us into signing off on something \u201cto insure your son\u2019s services since his previous IEP has expired.\u201d We indicated we were doing so under protest; we didn\u2019t receive any copies of anything to take home with us \u2014not even the attendance sheet! We are actually considering filing a due process complaint. Niksdad and I left the meeting \u2014two and a half hours later\u2014 feeling like all the goodwill we had for the school staff \u2014and theirs for us\u2014 been trampled and spat upon by this one individual.. In the end, we had nothing to show for it except wounds oozing frustration and anger. \n Nik is not returning to school. \n I don\u2019t know what it will look like in terms of who will be responsible for services. Our advocate, whom I trust implicitly, assures us we will not be left high and dry. She\u2019s already coaching me on working \u201cthe angles\u201d (all legitimate by the way!) with Medicaid and the state DOE. As I may have mentioned before, she\u2019s fairly well connected and has been doing this sort of stuff for many years. She has also lived through it with her own child who is now attending the local community college with accommodations and an attendant. Like I said \u2014I trust her implicitly. \n The hardest part for Niksdad and me has been in letting go and trusting that we are doing the right thing for Nik and for our family unit. We do. It is scary, I won\u2019t lie. But I figure after the 209 days in the NICU, all the surgeries and the repeated scares and daunting diagnoses \u2014well it\u2019s just another day in the life. As long as we weather it together, we\u2019ll make it through the storm. \n Thanks so much to everybody for all the love and support and prayers. I guess, I forgot to ask for those prayers to include EASE! LOL. Oh well. The vision I put out there is going to come to pass. In that I do have faith. \n Now, it\u2019s off for a celebratory dish of B&J\u2019s Karmel Sutra ice cream to celebrate and toast the great unknown.

{"date": "September 15, 2007 ", "body": "If you haven\u2019t read about our IEP experience, I suggest you start  HERE  first so the rest of this makes sense. Some comments on my IEP post brought to light a critical irony which I forgot to include in the post: I INVITED BOBO! (Shaking head in disbelief and shame\u2026) I had suggested he be invited b/c Nik was not going into the autism program but has definite behavioral components which needed to be part of his IEP. Logic told me that the district psych, the one who would be helping to put those things in place, might be a good person to include. HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO WRONG!? As far as the rest goes, we had actually asked for copies of all the evals and materials in advance so we would go in with an idea of what school was proposing and be prepared with questions, arguments, what have you. I only got anything from the PT. Since the meeting ran so long, our advocate had to leave to take care of her own child. When we asked for the weekend to think on things and \u201cdigest\u201d Bobo struck again. When we asked for copies we were told \u201coh, well it\u2019s all in rough, draft form. We\u2019ll get a copy to you as soon as possible.\u201d Had I not been so shell shocked from the gross rudeness of Bobo, I would have said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll wait while you make photo copies.\u201d Duh\u2026but I felt like the deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming semi (truck). So, in the harsh light of day brought on by ingesting reasonable amounts of ice cream (wink), Niksdad and I have come to some clarity about a few things. First, we will keep Nik in school for one more week. Why? Because we need to get copies of all those documents (even if they are handwritten) so we have something for legal records. Second, we need to get some very important information from the school OT \u2013the results of Nik\u2019s sensory evaluation and her recommendations for specific activities. (Though, I suppose, we could simply get another outside eval done through the hospital.) And finally, we do not want to cause an irreparable rift between us and the school district\u2026we may need them one day. Sometimes you\u2019ve gotta think with your head not your heart\u2026and it\u2019s hard to do. Hopefully, we will also get a letter of support (\u201cmedical necessity\u201d) from our pediatrician which will eliminate the need for any struggles with the insurance over Nik\u2019s services. Even without it, we will still be able to get services; I will simply have to request home nursing care (which we are eligible for since Nik has a feeding tube and seizures). Our advocate tells me \u201cWatch how fast they jump to authorize his outside therapies! It\u2019s waaay cheaper than providing a nurse!\u201d Hmmm, who knew?! We have decided that we are going to file a procedural complaint with the DOE. There are too many things which were mishandled for us to simply turn a blind eye because we are leaving. It won\u2019t cost us anything to write a letter and it may help another family who\u2019s been intimidated by Bobo or others of his ilk. We haven\u2019t yet contacted a lawyer but I imagine we will at some point in the near future. Sigh\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t have to be this hard just to be able to give your child a \u201cnormal\u201d experience before he\u2019s required to go through the educational mill.

{"date": "September 22, 2007 ", "body": "For some reason known only to them, Nik\u2019s  IEP team  at school thought we were bluffing.  When we mentioned that we wondered if school was the best place for Nik right now due to health concerns, I think they imagined we were trying to bluff our way into more or better services for Nik.  While I will not deny that we want far more than school is willing to provide \u2013in fact, we truly believe that Nik needs far more than school thinks he needs\u2014we truly are extremely concerned for his overall health and well being.  I mentioned this in a previous post  here . I think we need to remind school that Nik is not a \u201ctypically healthy\u201d preschooler who just happens to have significant developmental delays.  No, Nik is a child who has, in the worst of times, had a tenuous hold on life and, in the best of times, been able to remain healthy for as long as 2 consecutive months.  His immune system is very weak.  Perhaps his system is not as weak as a child fighting a life-threatening cancer, still Nik\u2019s little body has been subjected to more antibiotics and surgical interventions and mechanical assistance than most of us will ever experience in our family lifespan.  When Nik gets ill it takes him down hard and keeps him down.  It takes Nik several weeks to regain his strength and return to balance, if you will.  When he is in school and has maximum exposure to things that wouldn\u2019t ordinarily level your average three or four year old, Nik barely seems to get his health back into balance when  something else fells him . We are fortunate that our pediatrician agrees with us and is in the process of crafting a thorough letter of medical necessity to support our removing Nik from school.  We should have that sometime early next week.  The good news is that it will allow us to remove Nik from an environment where he is exposed to every illness that comes along.  It is also where he is bombarded with such intensely overwhelming sensory input that he shuts down after a short time each day.  By the time he comes home from school, Nik is overloaded and out of control. But, this new development also has a down side.  Because we are not in a financial position to be able to take Nik out of school and pay for services on our own, and because Medicaid refuses now to pay for services that they say school is obligated to provide, we are going to be forced to deal with the school district after all.  By law, if a child identified as needing an IEP is removed from school for medical reasons \u2013versus simple personal choice\u2013 regardless of compulsory attendance laws (age 5 and over required to attend school; under 5 is optional) school is legally obliged to provide services to the child.  This means that we will still need to agree upon an IEP which will dictate the level of services, etcetera which Nik will receive.  The only difference is that he will not have to go to the school to receive them. So, here we are again.  Still frustrated and angry at the way the  last IEP  meeting went and having to crank it up all over again to find something we can agree upon.  It is challenging, to say the least, as Niksdad would like nothing better than to cut  Bobo  (and therefore all of the school community) off at the knees; I mean that quite literally.  Now, Niksdad is not normally a man prone to violent expressions of emotion or frustration so I know he\u2019s beyond P.O.\u2019d.  Truth is so am I, but I know that we have to maintain some semblance of a working relationship with school as long as they are legally in the picture.  If we thought moving to another school district was financially feasible right now, we\u2019d begin packing our boxes! So I\u2019ve been mulling all this over for the past week \u2013 gathering data, evaluating the importance of certain goals and objectives, talking to our private therapists (whom we still have access to through November, I think), and so on and so forth.  I\u2019ve gotten names and contact information for people with the state autism society and the parent information center who might be able to assist us with wording of some letters of complaint and goals and objectives which will be put forth at our next IEP meeting \u2013whenever that may be.  I suppose in some ways, I am getting a great opportunity for a \u201cdo over\u201d and a crash course in splitting hairs and balancing on the legal edge.  It\u2019s exhausting and confusing.  And yes, our next step is actually to contact a lawyer from legal aid who can guide us through the process and, hopefully, avoid any need for serious legal intervention. There are so many fine points I could enumerate about all the things wrong with Nik\u2019s IEP, but it will just get me more riled up \u2013to the point where I will not be able to function effectively.  So I won\u2019t go there today.  Besides which, I have \u201cgone there\u201d so many times this week it\u2019s not pretty.  Of course, as Nik has gotten me up at 4:00 a.m. the  last few days , I\u2019ve had plenty of extra time for the journey! I will say though that it amazes, and depresses, me to see how ridiculously low school staff sets the bar for our kids with disabilities.  When \u201cJohnny\u201d is known to be a gifted student the expectations are stringent and sometimes set too high \u2013I know from personal experience as \u201cJane\u201d in grade school.  Yet, when the child is identified as having any sort of challenge the expectations are so low as to be nearly insulting.  (Point of fact here: Nik\u2019s PT at school suggested it should take a year for him to learn to stand independently without pulling up on anything.  Guess what Mr. Independent started doing all by himself this week?  You betcha!)  The goals are set so low and then school gets to be righteous in proclaiming, \u201cWhat great progress your child has made!  He met his objectives and, therefore doesn\u2019t need increased services at all!  In fact\u2026\u201d I guess it all boils down to who, in the eyes of school, has to do the greater portion of the hard work \u2013the student or school?  Seems like when school is expected to put forth a little extra effort, well\u2026 So, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to look like as we move forward \u2013at least not in terms of therapies and educational supports for Nik.  I do know that Niksdad and I have to weigh all choices in terms of what supports Nik in the longer term.  Our greatest responsibility is, first and foremost, to ensure his physical health, safety, and well being.  Without that, no amount of learning will ever be enough.  I imagine it\u2019s no more than any other parent would choose.  But the very fact that we are forced to choose, well, as the Bard put it best. \u201cAy, there\u2019s the rub.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/dantes-obviously-not-cpa.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/school-dazed-and-confused.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/following-up-on-wordless-wednesdaytoo.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/dantes-obviously-not-cpa.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/dantes-addendum.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/in-which-niksmom-tries-her-hand-at.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/09/22/rubbed-the-wrong-way/", "title": "Rubbed the wrong\u00a0way"},
{"date": "September 15, 2007 ", "body": "When I think of home I think of a place where there\u2019s love overflowing I wish I was home I wish I was back there with the things I been knowing \u2014   The Wiz \n Well, if I was on the fence about our decision to pull Nik out of school immediately, instead of next week as I  wrote last night , I fell off today with a resounding crash. Nik had a very challenging day. We had a big storm in the wee hours and the barometric pressure dropped like crazy and then jumped up again a few hours later. It was enough to make Nik\u2019s vestibular system haywire this morning. The glands behind  Nik\u2019s ear  were extremely swollen and tender today. It seems to get worse with bad weather and fatigue. He slept a full eleven hours last night and woke up in a pretty good mood. But once he was awake and active, his balance was really off and he fell a lot. He would be happy and singing or playing with a toy one moment and then would fall back on the floor arching and screaming and tossing his head violently from side to side. If he was near a wall or one of the gates he would bang his head against that. He bruised himself by banging against the gate before breakfast even started. I\u2019m not talking little tumbles either; Nik fell several times and slammed his forehead into furniture and walls. My poor little guy. He\u2019s not a snuggler but, every time he fell and started to cry, Nik would come climb into my lap and cling to me sobbing until I thought my heart would just shatter. I discovered if I sang \u201cWheels on the bus\u201d really softly \u2014especially the verse about the moms on the bus going \u201cshh shh shh\u201d\u2014and rocked gently side to side, Nik calmed down and relaxed against me for a few minutes. After which, he would spring out of my lap humming like nothing had ever been the matter. Niksdad and I finally realized that Nik was trying to regulate his vestibular system with all the rocking. As soon as he felt \u201cnormal\u201d he was ready to go again. During breakfast \u2014in fact, now that I think about it, every time he was stationary today \u2014he was fine. But he fell so much today that it just broke my heart. During his lunch at noon, Nik fell asleep in his chair. Passed out cold within 15 minutes. Niksdad stopped the pump and disconnected the tube and carried him up to bed. He slept 2 hours straight without even moving. Throughout the morning, I kept thinking about what it would have been like for Nik if he had been going through this at school. I have a strong hunch the staff would have simply pushed Nik right on through the activities on the schedule \u2014forcing him to participate\u2014 and chalked it up to Nik \u201cjust being fussy\u201d or \u201cwanting his way.\u201d That was when I realized that we are  done .  Done with school completely until such time as the law forces us to go back. In his moments of dazzling happiness \u2014which really were numerous today in spite of the discomfort \u2014my little one happily warbled his extensive repertoire of nursery songs. (Look for his greatest hits disc around Christmas time\u2026wink!) He played with toys in a very appropriate manner for the most part, and he even played some \u201cgames\u201d with me. We worked on some OT and PT but it was all in fun \u2014giving and taking coins to put in his singing piggy bank toy, placing puzzle pieces in the puzzle on the sofa after leaning over to pick them up from the floor. Fun stuff. And, believe it or not with all the kaka going on lately about school, Nik has been making some more incredible progress in so many areas. Nik\u2019s been experimenting with sounds some more. He\u2019s using something that sounds remarkably like the word \u201cup\u201d as he sings entire verses of songs using that sound. Then he\u2019ll change the volume or the inflection, or even the rhythm by using a variety of sounds. He\u2019s even making a sound that the OT, Miss D, says sounds like he\u2019s saying \u201cBam!\u201d With my kid, it\u2019s entirely possible! He\u2019s no longer just throwing a toy to the floor after he\u2019s finished playing with it during a meal. Now, he turns and looks to see if someone is there, turns the toy off and holds it out in the general direction of the person (me or Niksdad) and waits for us to take it. OMG! And the letters\u2026Nik is starting to show the tiniest bit of discrimination with letters. He has a leapfrog toy \u2014the spinning alphabet ball on a stand \u2014that he loves to play with; it\u2019s his current favorite toy these days in spite of the fact that it doesn\u2019t have ANY lights! That\u2019s amazing in and of itself. Anyway, Nik has been pressing \u201cW\u201d a lot lately so I started asking him to \u201cshow me the letter W.\u201d First, I\u2019ll spin the ball so it\u2019s not right on the W. Sure enough, Nik consistently turns the ball until he finds and presses that W! Today, though, he started working on \u201cM\u201d which I find interesting since it is an inverted W. I am not sure if it\u2019s a case of confusion or if he\u2019s truly noticing that the two letters look similar. And the  kisses  and  looks  and lap  snuggles  \u2014brief as they may be \u2014 are all increasing with each passing day. Today, Niksdad came to talk to Nik and say good bye before going to work. Without  any  prompting, Nik smacked his lips together twice then took Daddy\u2019s chin in his hands and leaned his forehead in to Daddy\u2019s lips for kisses.  He\u2019s making a distinction between giving and receiving kisses! And with me, he\u2019s made the  enormous connection  that giving Mommy kisses when she hasn\u2019t asked for them is valuable currency. He actually had the audacity to do that tonight after he deliberately threw a toy after being told not to. The fact that he threw the toy is not unusual; I expected that anyway. It was the fact that he looked at me, smiled from ear to ear then smacked his lips together and gave me a kiss on the mouth! I nearly fainted on the spot! I swear, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s telling me, \u201cSee, Mama, I just want to be home with you. I\u2019ll show you all the wonderful things I can do if you teach me. It\u2019ll be wonderful won\u2019t it Mama?\u201d Oh yes indeed, my child.  Yes indeed.

{"date": "October 9, 2007 ", "body": "\n Life isn\u2019t about waiting for the storm to end; It\u2019s about learning to dance in the rain. Jennifer over at  Pinwheels  commented by email on my last post (the  fun video post , not the  pathetic self-indulgent post ) that \u201cit\u2019s just as it should be\u2026sunlight always comes after the storm.\u201d So why do I constantly feel like I am searching for the rainbows and somehow missing them? I mean, it rains then it shines and it rains again. Then the sun peeks out and the clouds roll in and \u2026crazy emotional weather in my world these days! Long story short, the \u201c affliction \u201d I mentioned before continues to rear its ugly head. Nik\u2019s fever continues; he woke with a temp of 100.5 at 4:45 this morning. And today it was the fabulous Miss D (our favorite OT) who was treated to Nik\u2019s frightening manifestation of mysterious pain. One moment he was playing happily with a shape sorter, the next minute he was screaming and writhing on the floor in abject distress. NOT behavioral. This happened a few times toward the end of our session and right before our weekly playgroup. While Miss D and Miss T set up for the group, Nik played independently for a bit, happily pulling balls from the ball pit and tossing them. He\u2019d toddle off to chase the balls and the return them to the pit, laughing hysterically the whole time. Except for the time he tripped and slammed face first to the floor. Needless to say, the morning was no longer much fun for either of us. My poor battered baby sobbed and wailed in my arms, bleeding from his mouth. My throat felt like a boa constrictor\u2019s prey as I fought back my own tears and tried to calm Nik enough to verify that his teeth were in tact. Thank God for small mercies. He does, however, have bruises from his chin all the way up the center of his face to the bridge of his nose. They are a nice complement to the ones on each side of his forehead from banging his head against the sides of the crib each night. You know it\u2019s bad when you have the pediatrician on speed dial on your cell phone. Off we went for the fourth visit in as many weeks. The prize for using our frequent visitor points? More antibiotics for the dual ear infections, the second round in a month. Sigh\u2026 Well, at least it explains the nocturnal waking, the low-grade fever that wouldn\u2019t quit, and the screaming head-banging\u2026for now. Until we see the ENT tomorrow and are told \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t have an infection; those pediatricians always jump the gun.\u201d I kid you not, we\u2019ve been told that before. But the good news is that the immunologist moved Nik\u2019s appointment up to this Friday and has ordered some blood work. Well, the appointment is good. Bloodwork? Not so much. And yet, through it all we keep finding the  tiny pockets   of joy  (like  Susan  mentions  here ) and savor them like forbidden sweets filched from Grandma\u2019s candy dish when the adults weren\u2019t looking. They are all the richer for their hard-earned and unexpected sweetness. And, truth, in poetic irony\u2026it has indeed started to rain tonight. The thunder is booming in the distance and the rain has just started to pelt down on the skylights. (I love a good storm!) Perhaps tomorrow will bring the rainbow after all.

So could someone puhleeeeze tell me why my child is still running a fever, still not sleeping through the night, still can\u2019t make it through the day without a 2-3 hour nap (no, the nap is not keeping him from falling asleep; he wakes in the midle of the night screaming in pain), and why the lymph glands behind each of his ears are now swollen\u2026yet he has no ear infection??? Oh, and the blood work\u2026one word. Traumatic.  And did I mention the failed hearing test IN SPITE OF NO EAR INFECTION?? (Sorry, I just felt like yelling.)  Yup.

Today feels fresh, clean, crisp and new; The world is the same yet the view is altered. Autumn temps leave me feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, renewed\u2013 hopeful and excited as a child on the first day of school in my youth. I wonder, \u201cWhat will the year bring for me?  For us?\u201d There is a world of new knowledge to be gained, old friends to spend time with; the comforts of warm blankets on cold nights, hot tea with honey, the breeze ruffling my hair as I walk, leaves crinkling under foot. The world is changing yet the same. This I can count on. No longer the feeling of the hot pavement beneath bare feet; the burning sensation which causes me to run and skitter awkwardly just to get over it as quickly as possible. The autumn coolness invites me to linger and take my time; to explore and appreciate all the nuances of nature as I watch the earth shed it\u2019s summer skin. Instead, you get yet another dose of my incessant frustration, my despairing rants.  Sorry, this is how the day went\u2026 \u201cnot with a bang but a whimper.\u201d (With abject apologies to T.S.

{"date": "October 13, 2007 ", "body": "The one and only Drama Mama, who writes  Like a Shark , has tagged me for a  meme about writing . Frankly, I am mystified as I don\u2019t consider myself a true \u201cwriter,\u201d and was rather intimidated at the idea of outing myself. After all, there are so many other writers out there whose style I really admire and wouldn\u2019t even name myself as a \u201cwriter\u201d in the same sentence with them. I won\u2019t embarrass them by naming them but if you surf some of the links on my blog roll you\u2019ll discover them for yourself. And, really, you should. So this meme is about  my writing . Gulp. I think the  original intent  was to highlight five things about my writing which make me proud \u2014what I might consider strengths. It seems to have morphed as the meme gets passed around so I feel comfortable taking some liberties of my own. I\u2019m going to share some things I am proud of and some things that I am not so thrilled with. In some cases, they are one and the same. 1. I consider myself more of a chronicler than a writer. My background, my education and early (like prehistoric) work history, is broadcast journalism. I tend to like to lay out the facts or the story in the order of events and pepper it with conversational side commentary. This can be both good and bad \u2014depending on what I am trying to convey. Sometimes I get bogged down in the sequential minutia and take too long to get to the point behind it all. Other times, the minutia IS the story and I am, I hope, able to capture and convey the nuances so that you feel like you were there. 2. My grammar stinks. Sucko. I use split infinitives, incorrect punctuation; I can never remember the correct use of punctuation within quotation marks. I think I might be a copy editor\u2019s worst nightmare \u2014or close to it! 3. On the other hand, I write very conversationally (for the most part). I hope that makes readers comfortable. (It sure as heck makes it easier for me!) Again, I blame (credit?) all this on my broadcast training. 4. I am extremely honest in what I write. I am not afraid to \u201clet it all hang out\u201d and show my weaknesses as well as my joys and triumphs. I learned a long, long time ago that at the heart of the matter, we are all alike in our struggles. Sure, they may have different trappings or circumstances, but underneath it all we all feel fear, inadequacy, envy, self-doubt, slightly narcissistic (c\u2019mon, be honest\u2026sometimes you feel a teensy weensy bit narcissistic \u2014even if you won\u2019t admit it to anyone else?). I feel the same love, pride, joy, sadness, anxiety. In sharing those parts of ourselves we can connect on a level that far surpasses our socio-economic status, the way we look, what we do for a living, etc. 5. I am still very self-conscious about my writing. I read other writers and think, \u201cWow, what an incredible turn of phrase.\u201d Or, \u201csuch imagery she uses; exquisite!\u201d Still others I admire for their ability to convey so much in so few words. I fear being judged and found lacking. Of course, I have no aspirations to ascend to some literary Pantheon, but I do wish to be respected and to find an audience for my story. I struggle to find my \u201cvoice.\u201d 6. I like to think of my writing style as something like a cup of tea. Rather than jolt you with a strong, sharp gulp of energy \u2014like a cup of coffee, I want to enfold you in a warm, slow, comfortable embrace. Feel you relax into a comfy chair and kick off your shoes as you listen to my tales. If you leave feeling your heart is slightly more open than when first you sat down, or that you have been moved to feel more deeply then I have done well. It doesn\u2019t matter what, specifically, you feel; the important thing is that you feel something. If you can translate that feeling into action so much the better. 7. Again, from my training as a broadcast journalist where one has to edit as you go, remaining focused on \u201cjust the facts,\u201d I struggle with self-editing as I am in the midst of writing. In the world of news radio, you don\u2019t have the luxury of too many drafts. You write and edit as you go, you put it out there and then you hope it worked. If not, then you edit for the next broadcast. I am working on letting it go and embracing the concept of multiple drafts. I am especially intrigued about trying  Mom-NOS\u2019s   \u201cspotlight\u201d  assignment she gives in her writing class. 8. I have lots of really great ideas throughout the day \u2014things I want to write about and share with my readers. But my memory is getting worse and worse with each passing year. I\u2019ll have an idea first thing in the morning and I\u2019ll even compose something in my head \u2014more along the lines of an imaginary conversation with someone. By the time I am able to sit at the computer, either the entire thought or conversation have disappeared or I have already moved on to something else. I am not a note-maker; I have really bad carpal tunnel and can barely write on some days. Guess I should carry around a little digital recorder to actually capture my \u201cconversations.\u201d Some of them are interesting. No, really. So there you have it. More information about me and my writing than you may have ever wanted. I am not going to tag anyone else but I will invite whoever wishes to join in to please do so. And come back here to post your link in the comments! *********************************************************************** 10/15/2007 \u2014 E.T.A.: This NYT editorial  caught my eye today. This could have been written about me, or rather about my writing. Enough so that I thought it was worth sharing. I wonder how many of us who feel like we aren\u2019t  truly  \u201cwriters\u201d feel that way because of our own social bias about and expectations of ourselves? Food for thought.

{"date": "December 1, 2007 ", "body": "\n \n \n It was high noon and The Kid was ambling along in the corral. He was fidgety after a tough morning busting toys and, occasionally, his own head. He was feeling hemmed in and the urge to break free was irresistible. He was itching for a showdown and he knew just when and where he was going to make his stand. He bided his time until he heard the familiar rumblings.\n The lunch train was due in from the dining room \u2014accommodations for one. But The Kid had other plans which Ma was not privy to. When the corral gate opened, The Kid made a break for it. Ma had no choice but to follow as he dashed from the safety of the corral toward the Town Square. \n Ma tried hard to slow him down by the special chair she\u2019d had rigged out just for him. The Kid wouldn\u2019t take the bait. In a spurt of sure-footedness, he darted past Ma, making a break for\u2026 \n The Booster. The two tussled near  The Chair . Ma tried valiantly to redirect and cajole him to it but The Kid wanted no part of it and laid himself down in the middle of the town square. He was willing to risk looking like a tantrumming toddler to prove his point;  he\u2019d outgrown The Chair and it was high time Ma accepted that fact.  Ma knew she\u2019d met her match and had to think fast. In the end, she relented and let The Kid have his way. \n The Kid rose from the dirt to help Ma with The Booster as she dragged it (still attached to the dining room chair) into The Corral. Not wanting to wait another moment for the blessed union of his posterior with the smooth plastic of The Booster, the Kid impatiently yanked off the tray and climbed up with a self-assuredness Ma had not seen before. Suddenly, she realized what The Kid had been trying to tell her all along; he\u2019d grown \u2014from the tiny stripling she saw in her mind\u2019s eye for so long \u2014into a strapping boy ready to take on the world on his own terms. Sure, he\u2019d need her around for a little while longer but Ma knew her days as the center of The Kid\u2019s universe were numbered. \n The Kid proceeded to eat with gusto as if he\u2019d been on a three day Tonka drive without Cheerios. He wasn\u2019t the neatest cowboy she\u2019d ever had at her table but Ma let him be. The hearty feast of salad dressing and pretzels, peanut butter, and apricots which Ma had prepared especially for him was a hit. He made her proud by coming back for seconds and thirds. He even remembered his manners and took a few sips of water to clear his gullet. \n The sound of the beeping pump broke their quiet repast. As The Kid slurped down the last of his dressing, Ma smiled wistfully. The Kid applauded her culinary efforts and they both burst into joyous song. \n \n   \n   \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1HXX_2abbI/AAAAAAAAAWc/A2inlZj-CXM/s1600-R/cowboy+kid.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/R1HXFP2abaI/AAAAAAAAAWU/Ik89L9kBYOo/s1600-R/cowboy+kid.jpg"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/saturday-showdown-a-brief-dramedy/", "title": "Saturday Showdown \u2026a Brief \"Dramedy\""},
{"date": "September 1, 2007 ", "body": "Time check. 3:30 a.m. Nik\u2019s been awake for an hour \u2014alternately playing and crying in his crib. The kind of cries that let me know he is not in any real  distress . Just enough to keep him awake \u2014and me, too. Well, that and the toilet which has chosen tonight to run incessantly. My only secret,  sadistic  pleasure has been waking Niksdad to fix it. I have already thrust my hands into the tank to fix the valve no less than three attempts in 20 minutes only to crawl back in bed and hear the tank draining and refilling again. I am not sure which of Dante\u2019s circles this is. Crying child, running toilet, and a spouse who can sleep through the arrival of the second coming! Having been in Nik\u2019s room once in the past hour to comfort and console \u2014and provide a quiet toy to distract him from thoughts of climbing out of the crib \u2014I am waiting this one out. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a change in barometric pressure, or what, but his  ear  is acting up again. Not in an ear-infection-kind-of-way; rather, more of the same indeterminate pressure which causes him to rub and flick at his ear and which brings him some sort of intermittent pain. There is swelling around the lymph glad and, so help me I am not crazy, around the mastoid. It comes and goes and never seems to be present when we are visiting one of the myriad doctors Nik sees. I guess the  surgery  wasn\u2019t the magic answer we were looking for. 3:40a.m. I listen to my son\u2019s cries escalate to a wail of pain and frustration (is he crying for both of us, I wonder), as I can do nothing to ease his discomfort. The toy has long lost its appeal and Nik is simply tired and in need of that elusive balm of sleep. I cannot even go in to console him and  rub his back  as I used to do. Now, he wants to stand up and cling to me, begging me to release him from the prison of his crib. I am no longer na\u00efve and hopeful that he wants the comfort and safety of Mama\u2019s embrace. Alas, he has grown wily and I have become jaded. Unless I am prepared to take him downstairs to start our day, I dare not lift him. Instead, I sit here at my keyboard feeling supremely guilty and more than a little frustrated as I listen to the wailing and thrashing which signals his discomfort, his frustration. His utter exhaustion. At 4:00 a.m. I cave. When I enter his room, he is happy to see me. I feel guilty for raising the false hope of release. He begins to clap my hands together \u2014one of the ways he requests play time. Instead, I smooth his hair, rumpled from his rolling to and fro in the crib. I whisper gentle soothing words to encourage sleep and relaxation. Failure ensues. As I leave his room, the wailing and thrashing begins anew, this time with the tenor of extreme frustration. I know that if I wait it out he will eventually fall back to sleep. If only I could do the same. I look in on my husband. He is sleeping blissfully \u2014ignorant of the drama playing out down the hall. The struggle of maternal instinct versus parental control. Sleep versus play. Damn those ears anyway. Nik\u2019s for causing him such distress and disruption. Mine for being unable to ignore the primitive pleas of my child. My husband\u2019s for being able to sleep through it all. I m not even sure he opened his eyes when he fixed the toilet! Never before have love and resentment balanced on so fine a hair. I am torn between my need for sleep and caffeine. Two roads\u2026which shall I choose? The choice truly can make all the difference in my day. 4:25 now. It sounds like Nik is settling back in. The wailing is reduced to quiet moans and sporadic whimpers. Quiet. Then the sound of music from his toy. Damn. The boy is so tired. I go in to take the toy away so he won\u2019t roll over on it and activate it as he is drifting off to sleep. He sits up and leans his head against the side of the crib. I can see the shadowy outline of his little form begin to droop and slump as he fights the pull of slumber. \u201cPlease, God, let him sleep\u201d I pray. I am so weary at this point; I want to climb into the crib myself. Caffeine is looking like the only way I will ever make it through this day. 4:35 \u2014Is he out? Taking a leap of faith, I stagger the few feet down the hall toward my beckoning bed. Whimper. Moan. Wa-ai-ai-ai-il! Followed by more whimpers. Followed by whines.  SHIT! 4:45 a.m. \u2014Clutching the monitor in my hand, I stumble down stairs to start the coffee.  The faint blue glow of the light on the coffee pot lures me like a siren. Looks like caffeine wins out after all. The monitor is eerily silent so I check the volume. He\u2019s out. Asleep. Joyous reprieve! Coffee forgotten, I stumble back upstairs and crawl into bed. I awaken briefly an hour later to tell Niksdad that he is to let Nik sleep until he wakes on his own and to wake me\u2026well, never! He gently kisses my forehead as I drift off again. I awaken three hours later to find my son awake, dressed and fed, and fresh coffee in the pot.   I am in love once again.

I can tell, wait and see. There\u2019s the bell! Follow me! And nothing\u2019s gonna stop us \u2019til we\u2019re through! Honey, everything\u2019s coming up roses and daffodils! Everything\u2019s coming up sunshine and Santa Claus! Everything\u2019s gonna be bright lights and lollipops! Everything\u2019s coming up roses for me and for you! (\u201cEverything\u2019s Coming up Roses\u201d from  GYPSY) Woo Hoo! Time for a happy post and a  happy dance ! As you know, I\u2019ve been in that  nasty ol\u2019 rabbit hole  lately and trying my darnedest to  claw my way out . Of course, all the cyber ice cream probably didn\u2019t help! Just makes my butt bigger\u2026but I digress from the H A P P I N E S S I want to share with you all. We had our appointment with the  immunologist  today; I\u2019ve been really worried about this one since Nik\u2019s been so sick for the last year and it doesn\u2019t seem to be improving. Both Niksdad and I have been imagining the worst-case scenarios; it\u2019s not a difficult leap to make for either of us, given what we have been through  since Nik was born . Well, the doctor gave us some wonderful news today \u2014Nik\u2019s immune system has done significant catching up! While his immunoglobulin levels are still slightly low, they are at least I the normal range for his age group. This is very good news, indeed.  It means Nik\u2019s immune system has been developing the proper antibodies in response to illnesses and from the booster shots he\u2019s received. In fact, the doctor said he didn\u2019t think we needed to worry about having Nik around lots of kids (as in a school/daycare setting) anymore. He thinks that Nik may have been so ill this past year because it was Nik\u2019s first full-scale exposure to lots of stuff \u2014 ever . Until Nik made it safely through his first two winters at home, we had to be super-cautious about exposing him to illnesses which could cause major respiratory setbacks. Since Nik\u2019s first winter was spent in the NICU, his first real exposure wasn\u2019t until the spring of 2006. He started school in June 2006 and has been sick off and on ever since. Most likely, he simply hadn\u2019t had the time most toddlers have to build up antibodies before getting bombarded in a school setting. (Hmm, yet another affirmation of our  decision to remove Nik from school  this year; he\u2019ll have a chance to develop greater immunity at a more normal pace.) There\u2019s a bonus. Not only is this good news from a health perspective; it means that Medicaid cannot force us to use the  letter of medical necessity  from the pediatrician which states that Nik shouldn\u2019t be in school due to concerns about his health. The issue has become moot. \u201cWhy is this good news,\u201d you may wonder? Well\u2026 It means we can proceed with our plan to cut school out of the picture entirely and not have to worry about Medicaid trying to force them back into it. That would just be a  legal quagmire  at this point and we are not prepared to go there; we\u2019d much prefer to spend our time and energy living our already too full life and working with Nik \u2014playing, teaching, encouraging in the ways we know he thrives. Plus, with Niksdad in the clinical phase of his nursing school experience, I\u2019d pretty much have to shoulder the burden of preparing for a legal fight all on my own. Um, no thanks. But wait, there\u2019s more! (\u201cYes, if you act right now, you\u2019ll get this amazing set of Ginsu knives free\u2026\u201d) While I was out getting my shaggy mane cut, colored, fluffed and puffed this afternoon, Niksdad called the case manager at Medicaid to tell her about the immunologist\u2019s report. We felt we had to be fair so she didn\u2019t waste time trying to work an angle that would only lead to heartache for her. OK, that and the fact that we would be opening ourselves up to a potential charge of fraud (by the school district) if we proceeded to present the letter of medical necessity to school \u2014thereby forcing them into providing services \u2014and withheld the knowledge we gained this morning. As you might imagine, Miss Case Manager wasn\u2019t thrilled about it but she certainly understood. She\u2019s actually a very lovely person and also a mother of two small boys so she completely understood the relief we felt; she also appreciated the medical expenses that were neatly avoided in Nik\u2019s not having some sort of autoimmune disease! Miss C.M. has assured me all along that Nik\u2019s best interests were being considered and that he would indeed be taken care of;  I was afraid to trust her . Today, I humbly admit I was wrong . Apparently, this week while I was wallowing in the rabbit hole (well, it  was  dark and cozy down there), Miss C.M. was diligently following up with her supervisor, their compliance department,  and  the state director of Medicaid this week. They all agreed to authorize services for Nik in all areas \u2014PT, OT, Speech, and Feeding therapies \u2014for another TWELVE WEEKS, once per week in each area through the end of January. When Niksdad told me this, I cried tears of relief and joy. I then promptly called Miss C.M. to thank her profusely. See, piss me off or \u2014worse \u2014screw with my kid and you\u2019re on my black list; it  will  come back to bite you some day. Take good care of those I care about? You have my sincere gratitude and willingness to make sure you are recognized for your good deeds. Miss C.M. told me that once the therapists are nearing the end of the twelve weeks, they just need to submit for more authorizations; she said it most likely wouldn\u2019t be a problem to extend them. Whew! Miss C.M. earned her place in my heart today. While the 30 minute sessions per week aren\u2019t necessarily as much as I think Nik could really benefit from, it is significantly more than he would be getting through school. I also know that I will attend and participate in each session and learn what to do at home. The value of the carry-over at home is significant; it is not something we ever got from school in spite of our asking numerous times. Besides which, I can now stack appointments on just a couple of days a week, leaving time available to do things like go to the park to meet  Mom2Rebels , drive north to meet  Irene , take Nik to the zoo, go swimming, take a music class, play in the leaves outside, nap on the floor of Nik\u2019s room \u2014whatever our hearts, mine and Nik\u2019s together, desire. Tonight, I feel like a tremendous weight has been lifted from my heart. I am filled with hope and  joyful anticipation  again. There are still hills to climb and unknown challenges ahead, I know. But for now the road ahead looks clear and smooth and I see a glimmer of a rainbow in the distance.        \n Image  Courtesy of  WallpaperDave.com ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76HcLEunsws", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/feeling-little-hollow.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/reclaiming-perspective.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/04/storms-orig-posted-42707-on-voxcom.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/05/little-bit-about-nik.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/theres-no-place-like-home.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/rubbed-wrong-way.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/wordless-wednesday.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/rubbed-wrong-way.html", "http://raisingrebels.blogspot.com/", "http://randomirene.blogspot.com/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/closer-to-home.html", "http://www.wallpaperdave.com/wrnbw010.jpg", "http://www.wallpaperdave.com/"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/10/12/another-good-stuff-post/", "title": "Another Good Stuff\u00a0Post"},
{"date": "September 3, 2007 ", "body": "Be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it all you just might get it all  and then some you don\u2019t want   \n Daughtry  \n Today was a wonderfully peaceful day for me. Nik slept through the night \u2014second night in a row \u2014and I awoke feeling rested and refreshed. No special plans today; Niksdad ended up having tons of studying to do for school so we opted to stick close to home. I had a leisurely start to the day and went to work out while Nik and Daddy went to the park. I even managed to get out to a matinee all by myself. God bless Niksdad! The movie was wonderful \u2014bittersweet with no chance of a happy ending as it is loosely based on presumed history. None the less, it was a couple of hours of delightful entertainment which tugged at my heartstrings. I had a good time. Niksdad? Not such a good time. I called home after the movie to find out if Nik had slept. \u201cOh, no,\u201d Niksdad said in a cryptic tone. \u201cUm, OK, did he poop and you\u2019re cleaning up after  Poocasso ?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cEverything OK?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about it when you get home,\u201d he replied in that odd tone that said no one was hurt but something serious had transpired in my absence. Breaking a few local speed laws, I made it home to find my son playing happily in the family room; his father sat at the dining room table with a worn, weary expression on his face. In the moment our eyes met and he started to laugh quietly, I knew exactly what had happened. \u201cI put Nik down for his nap and was in the loft studying. He was really quiet for a while,\u201d he told me. \u201cAfter about 45 minutes, I thought I heard what sounded like the armoire door opening and closing; I went to investigate.\u201d My jaw dropped in disbelief. \u201cI opened the door and saw this little body come walking toward me in the dark. I looked in the crib; sure enough, Nik was not there!\u201d \u201cUm, honey, if a small body was walking toward you in the dark, I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t one of the cats or any of Nik\u2019s stuffed animals,\u201d I said in that tone one reserves for people who are in a deep state of shock. Clearly, Niksdad was a tad traumatized by the events of the preceding hours. \u201cAny idea how he did it,\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, you didn\u2019t hear the thump or anything?\u201d Niksdad wearily shook his head. \u201cI was dumbfounded,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI put him back in and went to get the net from his closet. If I hadn\u2019t turned around when I did, I would have missed the second time, too.\u201d Apparently, my son \u2014whom one doctor once described as having  \u201cdiminished mental capacity,\u201d  and who cannot talk and does not eat but is rapidly perfecting his new skill of walking \u2014cogitated, analyzed, visualized and what-have-you his way to figuring out how to get out of his crib  without making a sound . That\u2019s right \u2014my stealthy monkey figured out a masterful bit of advanced motor planning which would make  Miss D  exceedingly proud. But I\u2019ll let Niksdad tell the rest. \u201cThe whole thing took maybe a full minute. He threw one leg over the side and then, somehow, hoisted himself up so he was actually sitting on the rail.\u201d \u201cYou mean, both legs dangling over one side?\u201d I asked incredulously. \u201cNo, more like he was straddling a fence. But what amazed me was the balance; he wasn\u2019t wobbly at all and it wasn\u2019t like he was clinging with his legs very much at all\u2014like he\u2019s done it a few times.\u201d Uh-oh. \u201cThen he held on, swung his other leg over so he was facing the crib and shinnied down to the floor. Never made a sound.\u201d I know it\u2019s not a very loving and wifely sentiment, but damn I\u2019m glad Nik did this on his daddy\u2019s watch and not mine! Whew! We both kind of knew it was coming but thought we might have a  little  while longer before Nik made the cognitive leap to realize he already has the physical skill to get out of the crib. It\u2019s amazing to me this incredible spurt that Nik seems to be going through. In the past few weeks he\u2019s just made amazing progress in so many areas. More on that in another post. I\u2019m going to go pour myself a big glass of wine and recover from the shock\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/06/my-butt-ing-artist.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/04/ramblings-of-neophyte-orig-posted-422.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/brain-dump-73.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/09/03/stealth-monkey/", "title": "Stealth Monkey"},
{"date": "September 6, 2007 ", "body": "\n \n \n It\u2019s felt like a long week for some reason. Could be the long holiday weekend in which Nik exhibited the balance of a Zen master in his  escape from the crib . Or the frequent  interrupted nights of sleep  which have been randomly sprinkled throughout the week. Or, perhaps, it\u2019s just the emotions I have roiling inside my head and heart lately. I have been deeply affected by both the utter joys of some of my friends\u2019 blog posts, and sunk low by the pain, worry, or despair in still others. I have been feeling things very acutely lately. I guess it takes a toll after a while.\n Well, that\u2019s my long-winded explanation for how I got Niksdad to take us out to dinner tonight. Not a date, though we have one coming to us soon I think. Rather, a nice family outing \u2014something we haven\u2019t done in a very long time. In the past, such outings were not very enjoyable for any of us; Niksdad and I spent the entire time marshalling the toys Nik would propel halfway across the aisle \u2014oblivious to the glares of other diners. Or Nik would get fussy and squirmy from the lights, the noise, the time of day\u2026 \n Since  we\u2019ve been on a roll lately , we decided to chance it. We planned our outing with military precision. Pump? Check. Syringe and tube? Check. Meds? Check. Sippy cup? Check. Mesh feeders? Check. Toys? Check. Forward march! And off we went\u2026to Applebee\u2019s for an early dinner. And it was a  pleasant  experience! OK, except for the part where I smashed the tip of my finger under the seat cushion of my broken chair. No blood; I\u2019m fine (sniff, sniff\u2026rolls eyes dolefully). \n Nik was amazing throughout the entire dinner! He was alert and fully engaged in the environment and with us. That is not something I have ever been able to say about previous dining experiences. I did brush Nik and do joint compressions before we left the house; maybe the sensory input helped him regulate himself better? Or, just maybe, Nik has made another developmental spurt. \n In any event, Nik sat much like any other 3 or 4 year old in a restaurant. He was very well behaved \u2014only threw one thing and that was a teething biscuit that he decided didn\u2019t have enough flavor to suit him! He \u201cnibbled\u201d (ha! Ok, licked) the teething biscuit alternately dipped in salsa and in the horseradish sauce from our onion rings. (Yeah, it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m going to the gym tomorrow morning!)  \n \n \n Nik\u2019s favorite thing, the thing which held his attention throughout most of the meal was a pineapple wedge.  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n Between the pineapple and the balloon the waitress brought for Nik to play with, we never had to pull out a toy.  Not once!  \n \n \n \n Nik slurped and licked and laughed and played at taking turns feeding Mommy and Daddy. He tugged and batted at his balloon \u2014laughing hysterically each time it bopped him in the face. Niksdad and I laughed right along with him.  \n \n \n It was the first time I can remember in a very long time that we simply laughed together and took such unadulterated joy in a moment that included our son\u2019s active participation. Frequently we will watch Nik and laugh at his antics, but this was different.  \n \n \n This was a shared moment \u2014a  relationship . \n \n And while I am bragging, I must report that Nik was very clear in his communications tonight. When I offered him something in the  mesh feeder  (I brought three with us!) that he didn\u2019t care for he simply pushed it away and reached for the one he wanted \u2014or for the pineapple wedge. Poor wedge, suffered nearly the same fate as our friend the  peach slice !\n \n And Nik colored! Ok, I don\u2019t mean in a coloring book with pretty pictures kind of way. I mean in the manner of a child who has just begin to learn about holding a crayon; chubby sticky fingers clamped awkwardly around the too-thin waxy stick, Nik jabbed at the page and actually moved his hand back an forth a time or two. (The picture on the right is cropped bit of the kid\u2019s menu.  If you open the pic in a new window, you can see the oragne crayon marks!)  He even showed his hand preference \u2014finally!  Turns out my son is a lefty! \n Yeah, we got some odd stares from people around us. Not so much disdainful looks. More like curiosity about the little boy with the tube running under his shirt. The boy who was so obviously having a grand time with his parents. Wondering, perhaps, what is \u201cwrong\u201d with him? Wondering perhaps what is wrong with his mother that she keeps talking to him like he\u2019s done advanced calculus on the back of his napkin? Who knows? Tonight we couldn\u2019t have cared less what the rest of the world thought. \n Tonight, we were  \u201cjust another family\u201d  and it felt grand. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/stealth-monkey.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/in-still-of-night.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/belated-monthiversary.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RuCrAX4JbAI/AAAAAAAAAKA/M0OVtGPcIWA/s1600-h/Picture011.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RuCqmH4Ja_I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/hEuI8hga16U/s1600-h/Picture020.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RuCrU34JbBI/AAAAAAAAAKI/Tcg03BPVVGo/s1600-h/Picture007.jpg", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/meshy-eater.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/meshy-eater.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RuCsGn4JbCI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/boiLAEUnuSo/s1600-h/20070906_Niks+coloring.bmp"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/eatin%e2%80%99-good-in-the-neighborhood/", "title": "Eatin\u2019 Good in the\u00a0Neighborhood"},

{"date": "September 11, 2007 ", "body": "I love the internet and the communities we create with one another. One of my favorite moms \u2014and a thoughtful, thought provoking blogger \u2014emailed me tonight. Her radar must have been up because she asked how I was. Nothing unusual about that, right? I dunno, call it weird vibes but I thought I could sense \u201cyou\u2019ve been kind of quiet, are you ok?\u201d  behind  the question. I\u2019ve been wrestling with a situation \u2014it\u2019s not a problem, but it  is  something which requires resolution \u2014and it\u2019s been my own personal Deatheater all weekend long, just sucking the life and soul out of me. I\u2019ve been thinking all day long about what I wanted to write tonight. My response to her email follows: \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026ok\u2026sort of. Long story short\u2013 we have a chance to fight to take Nik out of school but it requires building a pretty significant case to convince Medicaid that they should pay for Nik\u2019s therapies and stuff. I\u2019ve spent the better part of the last 4 days combing through records and drafting \u201ctalking points\u201d for a conversation with the case manager. I\u2019m angry that I even have to do this. I\u2019m depressed to see the realities of Nik\u2019s *minimal* progress over the course of the last calendar year. And I am concerned at the concrete evidence that Nik is also far more susceptible to illness than I had perceived. \n BTW, don\u2019t be surprised if you read some of these very same words on my blog later\u2026I\u2019ve been wrestling with a post about this issue. In light of how all consuming it feels, I\u2019d say it\u2019s appropriate. Plus, Nik\u2019s IEP is Friday. \n Plus\u2026Nik fell again Friday and hit his head really hard. More seizures in the hour following. He\u2019s been falling more lately and hitting his head. Tonight he pitched face-first onto the hard floor. Nice goose egg on the left side to match the cut he got at school this morning on the right\u2026\u201d So, I guess you could say my plate feels a tad overloaded and I\u2019ve had my fill and then some! Lori at  Spinning Yellow  has a  post  up today about looking at her life in terms of time looking backward and time looking forward. That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve been doing all weekend long with respect to Nik\u2019s life as it relates to medicine and education. Here is some of what I discovered: In a full calendar year, Nik made  nominal  progress in OT and PT skills \u2014as indicated by three assessments done over the course of the year (school intake last July, outside professionals in Feb, and his current private therapists this July). Over that time, he made roughly a three month gain; he had been making more significant progress with individualized services through early intervention. Speech is even uglier\u2026 Based on where he was when he started school, Nik has actually  regressed  to the functional communication of a 6 month old \u2014courtesy, in my opinion, of the utter lack of stability in our school\u2019s SLP staffing. Nik\u2019s first speech therapist met him evaluated him, and left two weeks later. The next one lasted the school year but did very little. We spent a lot of time addressing the feeding issues \u2014which it took Medicaid to tell me \u201cOh, no, schools don\u2019t handle that stuff at all,\u201d before we realized we had wasted an entire year for nothing. The actual communication issues? Not a whole lot of progress. But \u2014 and forgive me if I sound bitter here \u2014 it\u2019s awfully damn tough to make any progress when you spend roughly fifteen minutes a week with a child. Even that wasn\u2019t always one on one. How do I know, you ask? I requested the records from the SLP  before she left school last Friday . Yeah, the revolving door of speech therapists strikes again.  So, let me put it this way \u2014all things remaining the same as they were over the past school year, at his current rate of progress, my now nearly four year old will be functioning at the level of a two year old by the time he starts first grade. Now, I know there are many, many children for whom this would be remarkable progress. I also know that Nik started life with the deck stacked not exactly in his favor. But my son is  so smart  and keenly analytical. He\u2019s the kid who mapped out how to get out of his crib without ever actually making practice attempts first. The kid who can watch me work a deadbolt a few times and then figure out how it works \u2014again, on his first attempt.  He is also the same kid who makes remarkable, steady progress when he is given the right level of services. Bear in mind, this is all based on testing and evaluations up to \u2014but not including\u2014 the arrival of Miss D and Miss T into our lives this July. Since then\u2026nothing but progress and rapid gains, baby! Makes sense since he\u2019s all of a sudden receiving roughly four times the amount of therapy he got all last school year. I forgot to mention, all of this mayhem is the result of a great conversation with a very savvy advocate \u2014the same one who is coming to the IEP on Friday! It is at her urging that I embarked upon this tedious and frustrating (albeit highly edifying) endeavor which I hope will pay huge dividends! Maybe that\u2019s why it has been so difficult for me? Not so much compiling the evidence of things I already know, but the need to paint a picture of my son in such a light that we have a shot at prevailing in our quest. I am leery of getting my hopes up again only to be dashed upon the rocks once and for all.  So, this conversation with the case manager has not yet taken place; I wanted to make sure I had all my \u201cducks\u201d in a row. I need to present a compelling argument to convince her that it is not only in Nik\u2019s best interest for us to take him out of school, but that it is also a sound financial decision for Medicaid. I\u2019ve compiled charts of data, lists of arguments, evidence to support the evidence. You name it.  I guess I can\u2019t say it\u2019s all been bad; I mean I did have a realization about Nik\u2019s health which had not been so clear to me before.  Since I\u2019ve been mired in depressing health statistics today I will share them with you. Lucky you! In the past 15 months \u2014which is the time frame since he began school at the age of two and a half \u2014Nik has:  \n \u2014 missed 32 days of school (more than 6 weeks). Of that time, more than 70% has been due to illness, including a week-long stay in the hospital in January.  \u2014 been on antibiotics 14 times in 15 months. \u2014 lost an average of two hours sleep for every school day because we have to wake him early enough to get his tube feeding in to fit the school schedule. \u2014 lost and gained and lost roughly the same three pounds \u2014right now he\u2019s holding steady. \u2014 been diagnosed with an immune deficiency and now needs to be on antibiotics every time he is ill so he can fight off any secondary infection. The constant use of antibiotics puts Nik at significantly increased risk of developing resistance to the few drugs he can take; he is allergic to all \u201c-cillin\u201d drugs (Penicillin, Amoxicillin, 4 generations of cephalosporin drugs, etc.). In addition to all that, there are numerous developmental reasons why school is not right for Nik at this point. Nik requires significant one on one attention and direction simply to engage him in a desired activity. He also requires highly focused, individualized attention to practice and retain new and emerging skills.  To date, despite numerous conversations about the need to do so, there has not been any effort made by school to address Nik\u2019s perseverative behaviors \u2014specifically doors and drawers. Nik doesn\u2019t respond to a simple reprimand/rebuke. He needs active redirection until he has the cognition to understand either it is not something to play with or that he may do so as a \u201creward\u201d for doing \u201cx.\u201d There is not a consistent manner established at school to address this \u201c interfering \u201d behavior. Their word choice.  It is becoming clearer and clearer to us that Nik is unable to process the bombardment of sensory input he receives during the school day. He does significantly better in a quieter, smaller environment. He does have moments of shining splendor during the school day but by the time he comes home from school, Nik is so dysregulated that he cannot function. He cannot make eye contact, he cannot sit still, he does not respond to attempts to engage him in anything; he simply likes to play on his own and on his own terms. This usually involves a lot of throwing toys and laughing maniacally! By dinner time, Nik is so exhausted from the day that he cannot pull himself together to function without the risk of injury (like tonight\u2019s \u201cfacer\u201d). Often, he is nearly passed out from exhaustion before his dinner is even finished. Then, too, we have concerns about Nik\u2019s physical safety at school during his period of being a \u201cnew walker\u201d combined with his visual deficits. Of particular concern is his depth perception in an environment that is visually very flat and composed of cinder blocks and hard tile floors, lots of counter tops at eye height, etc. Nik has already had two episodes in two weeks of falling and hitting his head hard enough to cause clusters of increased and changed seizure activity immediately following. There is talk of trying a soft helmet but we have very strong doubts that Nik will comply due to sensory issues he has with things on his head. School is the only place Nik has this problem with any consistency.  As I re-read what I have written, I can understand my mood of late. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have the greatest of hopes for Nikolas \u2014I absolutely do! It just frustrates me to no end to realize how much harder he \u2014and we \u2014have to work just to provide opportunities for him to make the progress he is capable of making. It galls me that we as a nation spend so damned much time, energy and money on a war we didn\u2019t ask for and have nothing left to nurture and educate our greatest resources of all. And it makes me sad that I have to paint a less-than-flattering (though wholly accurate) picture of my son in order to help him.  Wish me luck, I think I\u2019ll be talking to that case manager soon.

{"date": "October 2, 2007 ", "body": "Day 18 of Nik\u2019s being mildly to moderately ill with\u2026something or other.  First it was the  upper respiratory gunk  that required resuming his nebulizer treatments daily.  Then, as the worst of that was clearing up, up popped another  ear infection  and a round of  antibiotics .  We were blessed with a whole two days in which Nik had no fever and only a slightly runny nose before yesterday\u2019s, um,  explosion  of new symptoms.  Let\u2019s just say it hasn\u2019t exactly been a bed of roses around here the past 48 hours. Nik\u2019s worst symptoms are gone now, thank goodness, but he has had this lingering low-grade fever that waxes and wanes; it has been the one constant over the past two and a half weeks.  I\u2019m getting a little worried about this one.  It seems so early in the season for Nik to be catching every last little bug so, of course, I fear something awful.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing terrible but my mind cannot rest until I know for sure.  It plays into all my worst fears about his  immune system . Nik\u2019s been mostly himself lately but he\u2019s been sleeping more \u2013particularly napping longer than he has ever done.  Yesterday I had to wake him after three hours; he still slept ten hours overnight!  He has been in a cheery,  sing-songy  mood most of the day; we even went to the park this morning just to get out of the house.  We weren\u2019t there for very long when Nik took my hand and walked me to the car.  He\u2019s been a little more subdued \u2013meaning he\u2019s not racing back and forth across the room every ten seconds and laughing hysterically.  He\u2019s enough \u201chimself\u201d that most people wouldn\u2019t notice anything but NOT enough of his normal self that Niksdad and I are concerned. We see the pediatrician tomorrow afternoon; I\u2019m sure Nik will have no fever and be perfectly normal as far as they are concerned.  Fortunately, I know the doctor doesn\u2019t think we are over reactive hypochondriacs and she usually takes our concerns pretty seriously.  Something tells me there\u2019s  more blood work  in Nik\u2019s near future. In other news, I had a long conversation with the paralegal from  Legal Aid  yesterday afternoon.  She is going to discuss our issues with the lawyer and determine what our options may be.  She indicated that, based on the things I told her (and I didn\u2019t even touch on everything!), it sounds like there\u2019s an awful lot school is doing that is not quite on the up and up.  Basically, though, they (Legal Aid) are going to help us find the answer to the question of how we get Nik\u2019s services if we keep him out of school.  I should have some concrete answers later this week. Meanwhile, I got a very formal email from the case manager at school today; she is arranging an IEP meeting for us to \u201creview the educational services for which Nikolas will no longer have access.\u201d  I was going to email back that I would let her know of the date and time were convenient for us after I heard back from our legal counsel; but I didn\u2019t want to make her crap in her pants.  Sorry, crass of me to say such a thing.  The  situation with school  just makes me so angry.  In fact, after talking with the paralegal yesterday I was even angrier when she told me that she really thought we had a potentially strong case if we decided to pursue options with school. Here are a few lessons learned from yesterday\u2019s conversation with Legal Aid: NEVER NEVER NEVER  sign anything you don\u2019t agree with or that you are told you may not have a copy of the entire document to take with you \u2013 no matter what !  If they threaten that your child\u2019s prior IEP will not be in effect because it\u2019s expired \u2013 they are wrong .  You can amend it to state that it shall remain in effect for 30 days (while you work out the new IEP).  You can even write that right on the IEP!  In fact, you can go through item by item and indicate whether you agree with it or not.  Yes, you can write on the IEP \u2013ANYWHERE YOU WANT.  They\u2019ll tell you you can\u2019t\u2019;  they\u2019re wrong and hoping you won\u2019t know it . And those standard lines schools usually put in the IEP about \u201cX number of sessions, a minimum of Y minutes, in a group, consultative, or individual setting\u201d \u2013also crap.  It violates the intent of IDEA/IDEA 2004 which is that students receive the necessary services in a regular and timely fashion.  The way Nik\u2019s school words it leaves too much leeway for them to \u201cconsult\u201d with staff as many times as they want and it could all be put toward that \u201cX\u201d amount.  According to the paralegal, they are supposed to indicate a specific number and frequency of services in each area \u2013for example \u201c15 individual sessions, a minimum of 15 minutes each, no less than once every month.\u201d The way Nik\u2019s IEP is written also leaves open the possibility that school could wait until the last month of school and provide services on a daily basis to \u201cmake it up.\u201d  While this may seem highly unlikely, it could happen; to date, Nik\u2019s school still has no speech therapist to replace the one that left a month ago.  The principal refused to provide compensatory speech services for Nik (meaning the district pays for him to go somewhere else until they have someone on staff) based on the argument that once they hire someone they could \u201cmake it up.\u201d  Definitely not in keeping with the spirit of the law. And those outside evaluations which indicate your child needs significantly more than school is providing?  You aren\u2019t required to request in writing that they be made part of the IEP.  Your giving them to the school implies said request.  They need to tell you in writing why they aren\u2019t changing the IEP to include the increased services. Record meetings \u2013and you don\u2019t have to tell them until you show up with a tape recorder.  Oh, and the notes the case manager (or whomever) takes during the meeting?  You can ask that those be made part of the IEP, too.  Uh-huh. So, if we do have to scrap it out with school \u2013it\u2019s going to be a whole new game! No matter how things go, though, you know what really chaps my hide?  The fact that  not one single person  at school has bothered to call us to find out what they could do to make things right.  The devotion they espoused, the love and concern for Nikolas?  All crap.  Lip service.  What makes me sad for the other kids at school is that the staff doesn\u2019t even have a clue that they are doing something significantly out of integrity with the intent of the laws. Maybe I have a fever\u2026I\u2019m ranting now.

{"date": "September 7, 2007 ", "body": "\n \n We all sing with the same voice The same song, the same voice We all sing with the same voice And we sing in harmony\n Sesame Street \n \n Some recent comments on some of my posts, coupled with some email exchanges, have been on my mind lately. Some of you have commented to me how I have or my family has \u201cbeen through so much worse than we have,\u201d or \u201cI know my situation is nothing like what you\u2019ve been through,\u201d and things of that nature. I wanted to respond to those well-intentioned, self-effacing, sometimes self deprecating words. (No, wait, don\u2019t leave\u2026it\u2019s good stuff, honest!)\n I suppose to someone looking on from the outside, yes it is true; my family, my child especially, has been through very much. On one hand we have the fact of Nik\u2019s extreme prematurity and all its inherent health-related issues. Educators and health care professional are often surprised to meet Nik for the first time; the child they read about on paper is  frail and sickly \u2014potentially a child to be pitied for his immense challenges in his short little life. The child they meet is a dynamo \u2014uncomprehending of the word \u201cdisabled\u201d or the fact that he isn\u2019t like his typical peers. \n On the other hand, I think, in many ways, parenting my child with his myriad needs and diagnoses has been easier for me than parenting your child may be for many of you \u2014my very special friends. While it\u2019s true that our daily life with Nik is often an intricate contredanse in which we must weave threads both medical and developmental, Niksdad and I have had the benefit of being hit with the worst case scenario from before Nik was born. \n We already knew that our child may not be \u201cnormal\u201d based on ultrasounds showing how small he was for his gestational age. And, certainly, we hoped and prayed for the most normal of possible outcomes. Yet, when it didn\u2019t turnout the way we would have preferred, we made a very conscious decision that our child would be loved and encouraged and believed in \u2014no matter what. We had to throw our expectations out the window from the moment Nik took his first breath with the help of the respirator. \n Many of you, my wonderful friends, had what I might call the storybook experience of pregnancy and childbirth. Though there may be some cases where there were some prenatal complications, by and large you had your robust, healthy child who went home from the hospital the same day you did \u2014again, with some few exceptions. You joyfully announced your child\u2019s birth, shared photos, breastfed, and generally raised your completely normal child. \n Then you were blindsided by this thing called autism. However it came, whenever it came you were not prepared. You didn\u2019t have the luxury of being able to \u201cgird your loins\u201d as Niksdad and I did. In an instant, everything you knew about your life with your child was changed \u2014radically. I cannot even fathom the shock and overwhelming grief this must have caused. At least, with Nik, I have some idea of the cause(s) of many of his underlying disabilities. I wish that you each could have that for your child. I know that there are many things I cannot undo or fix for my child \u2014things that simply are what they are. I sense, in so many of your writings, the pain of the search for answers, reasons, and understanding\u2014for something you can identify over which you may be able to exert some measure of control. \n I recently wrote to one of my  dear  online friends (and I do consider you to be a dear, dear friend \u2014a kindred spirit \u2014though we\u2019ve not yet met) that I sometimes think the issues our children face in school must be more difficult for a her child than for mine. Whereas my son is more obviously disabled \u2014and has the medical dossier to support him in the face of those who might wish to deny him access and acceptance \u2014her child appears to be just like every other child at school. My son is in a segregated school with dozens of other children like him to varying degrees; the school staff is trained to deal with all kinds of variations on the theme of disability. Her son must make his way in a school where \u201cSpecial Ed\u201d may still have the negative connotations of previous generations. In some ways, we really haven\u2019t come as far as we think we have. \n Indeed, I read a  recent post  on  Redhead Momma\u2019s blog  in which she relates a conversation with a principal of a neighboring school \u2014in which the principal expresses her ignorance of autism and how autistic children can benefit from a variety of teaching and therapeutic techniques and measures. I was absolutely floored to read that until I took a step back and realized how fortunate we have been to have a school like Nik\u2019s \u2014imperfections and all. There, he is completely accepted and loved for who he is where he is \u2014right here, right now. \n In the final analysis, I must confess, there are times I stand (well, sit actually) in awe of my fellow special needs mamas. To me, you have had it rougher \u2014tumbled like a trailer in an unexpected hurricane \u2014and have risen so beautifully to the occasion. I learn much from the things you write on your own blogs and in comments on mine. I think that is what I love best about this cyber  kaffe-klatch  we\u2019ve got going here \u2014the recognition that we are all the same in our differences yet different in our sameness. \n \u201cWe all sing with the same voice\u201d and the song we sing is that of a mother\u2019s love for her child. The notes and harmonies we create together are powerful and breathtaking. Let them be sung from the mountaintops.

{"date": "October 4, 2007 ", "body": "I\u2019m happy to report that Nik is feeling much better today. He\u2019s been back to his normal self since yesterday afternoon. As Murphy\u2019s Law would have it, by the time we got to the pediatrician\u2019s office, Nik was fever free and rarin\u2019 to go. I have to say, Since we\u2019ve removed Nik from school, every day just gets a bit better. Not so much that Nik is making miraculous progress overnight. More so that we are establishing a rhythm and a pattern to our days that suits us so much better than the frenetic pace we were keeping with school. Nik goes to bed a bit later now but then he can sleep a bit later in the mornings \u2013except on the days we have a date at the YMCA (um, that would be me with my trainer and Nik with the childcare folks). For the most part, Nik\u2019s been cheerful and chipper; even when he was really sick, he still had his moments of raucous laughter and singing. In fact, one particularly funny thing happened yesterday. I\u2019ve noticed an interesting behavior lately; Nik will put a finger in one of his ears and make a high-pitched \u201cBah\u201d sound. He does this a couple of times, switching ears \u2013sometimes doing both ears at once. I\u2019ve thought, \u201cHuh, Nik must be experiementing with sound somehow.\u201d Pretty cool, yes? So, yesterday afternoon in the doctor\u2019s office, Nik cooperated so nicely as he helped Dr. M with her stethoscope and such. He even picked up the otoscope (the ear-thingie) and put it to his ear to help her look in his ears. As he did this, I heard the same \u201cBah\u201d I\u2019ve been hearing for the past week or so. Then, it hit me. Nik wasn\u2019t experiementing with sound after all; he was imitating the sound of the thermometer beeping in his ear every time I take his temperature (I use the ear kind as it\u2019s the only one he will tolerate). I about fell over I was laughing so hard. Well, I  have  had to take his temp a lot lately\u2026still do, but that\u2019s another story. As for me, I feel a sense of peace these past few days; it seems to have settled over me only recently. Whether it is because things seem to have shifted since I spoke with Legal Aid (no new information yet) or if it\u2019s simply because I have realized that we really  are  fine \u2014 with or without school or outside services. Yes, there will be issues to resolve \u2013most notably in the areas of speech and autism supports \u2013but each day Nik and I connect in new ways and find our way together. I think, too, I am taking great comfort in the writings of some other bloggers \u2013reports of new  milestones ,  fun adventures ,  following dreams ,  settling in  to a new home and home school,  more than one mom  deciding to  take kids out of school . It seems we are all finding our way on this path of mothering our children and it feels like a sense of peace is indeed settling in for more than just me. Is that what happens when we follow our instincts in spite of the fears? I am amused by Nik\u2019s antics lately; laughter is so good for the soul. I don\u2019t think I realized how little we\u2019ve been laughing over the past couple of months; we\u2019ve been so consumed by the struggles with Nik\u2019s school. Lately, however, it\u2019s as if Nik can sense the change in the air \u2013the release of the tension \u2013and he\u2019s letting loose, too. Today, we invented a new game together. Nik likes to do a lot of things hand-under-hand \u2013meaning he manipulates my hands to do things. This has recently carried over into his using his hands to manipulate things like my mouth. Yeah, I\u2019m not crazy about it but he thinks it\u2019s the funniest thing since a Three Stooges marathon. Blame the feeding therapist, Miss M. She is trying to get him to imitate certain sounds so she had him put his hand on her mouth as she made the sounds. Well, Miss M doesn\u2019t live here so I get to do this over and over. I don\u2019t mind telling you it gets a smidge annoying. So, today, just to be silly \u2013and because I am taking  Jonathan Levy\u2019s advice  to heart bout making more eye contact and joining in the stims\u2013 I played this little game but threw in a twist. Instead of making the M, B, or P sounds like Miss M, every time Nik pried my mouth open I made an animal sound. At first, Nik shook his head as if to admonish me, \u201cNo, Mommy, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201d After a few times of me making my best Donald Duck (and other animals) sounds, Nik caught on and began to play with great fervor. The more I made animal sounds, but most particularly the duck sound, the harder he laughed \u2013a deep, jiggly, crinkly-eyed belly laugh. The harder Nik laughed the more I laughed. The more I laughed\u2026 the more Nik looked at me! We both laughed so hard we were giddy and teary-eyed. I love having that kid home with me.

{"date": "September 4, 2007 ", "body": "\n Yeah, I\u2019m gonna take that mountain.  Ain\u2019t nothing gonna slow me down. And there ain\u2019t no way around it. Gonna leave it level with the ground. Ain\u2019t just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it: I\u2019m gonna take that mountain.\n I was born a stubborn soul; This is just a stumblin\u2019 block; I\u2019m gonna take that mountain. \u2014Reba McEntire I had hoped to post this on the 2nd. But, wow, life keeps coming at me faster than I can duck and dodge lately, it seems. This post has been \u201cin progress\u201d for a couple of days now. Had a few things keeping us on our toes recently, as you may recall!\n What, you may ask, is the significance of the 2nd? It was Nik\u2019s 45-monthiversary. Yeah, I know, you don\u2019t usually count the months after they reach a certain age. But since Nik was born, on the second of every month I stop to celebrate the miracle that is my son. (For those of you trying to count right now, Nik was born on December 2nd.) \n Last night, after Niksdad and I finished filling out a sensory profile for school (yay, they are finally taking us seriously about the sensory issues!), I sat down and typed out a quick list of some of Nik\u2019s accomplishments over the past couple of weeks. I also did some serious reflecting on where we\u2019ve come together as a family and what Nik has been through as a human being. I got so overwhelmed that I couldn\u2019t write anything \n Try as I might, I still cannot bring myself to write in any coherent fashion about the events leading up to Nik\u2019s delivery by emergency C-section or of the 209 day s we spent in the NICU. Sure, I can share the specific statistics of Nik\u2019s weight, length, Apgars (which were 9 and 7), his diagnoses, and his surgeries. I can share funny anecdotes about my son and interactions with other people. What I cannot yet write about \u2014not even for myself \u2014 is what I went through. The emotions are too raw. Too real. Too close, still. \n How can you capture the essence of one\u2019s personal experience in the aftermath of being told not to plan or celebrate your child\u2019s birth yet beacsue he may not even make it through the night? The implications of receiving such advice are staggering still. There are some things which one cannot write about until many, many years after the fact; I guess this must be one such for now. \n In any event, I can \u2014and do joyfully \u2014share the incredible growth of my miracle child. Unlike the  last party  I threw, this one is full of joy and laughter \u2014and overflowing with love and pride. I hope you\u2019ll join in the festivities! \n At one month old, Nik\u2019s feet were a mere 1 \u00be inches long \u2014smaller than the bowl of a common table spoon (not to be confused with a Tablespoon for measuring). His limbs were so small and fragile. Nik\u2019s entire arm was the size of my index finger; my husband\u2019s wedding band fit all the way to Nik\u2019s elbow. He had gone through the first of his numerous surgeries at the tender young age of 19 days. Nik hated to have a wet diaper; one of the first things he learned to do was curl his foot to confuse the oxygen sensor attached to it. When he needed a diaper change, Nik would curl his toes and the nurses would come running to see what the alarms were all about. Even then, Nik was exhibiting some pretty amazing smarts! \n Fast forward to today. Nik has been through numerous surgeries and spent way more time in the hospital than any person ever should. To date, he has spent 18.9 percent of his life in a hospital \u2014most of it in one continuous stretch. That doesn\u2019t include outpatient visits or ER trips. Do the math for your own life; if you had spent that much time in the hospital, what would your outlook on life be like? I am continually in awe of my child\u2019s inherent sunny disposition and his utter confidence that he can do absolutely anything. And he can; the boy is unstoppable! \n If you\u2019ve been reading my blog for a while, you know that Nik has made some amazing strides recently \u2014just surf my recent archives for plenty of examples! Here are the latest in what I hope will be a long, continuous line of \u201camazing and death-defying feats\u201d from my little monkey: \n Nik walks. Perhaps not with elegance or grace but certainly with verve and enthusiasm to spare. He climbs like a monkey! The sofa,  the crib , the window sill\u2026 \n We play so much more than ever before. The joy and laughter are no longer one-sided; when I can engage him, Nik participates fully and joyfully.  \n Feeding is becoming enjoyable for both of us again. Nik\u2019s still not eating but he is making great progress with chewing things he wouldn\u2019t chew before \u2014wash cloths, chewy tubes, Nuk brushes \u2014I think because I am making a game out of it. He is trying so many new tastes and textures, still only licking, but without fighting. If I can encourage his enjoyment of many things, I have confidence that he will actually eat them one day.  \n Nik is now making so much more eye contact more consistently. He laughs appropriately (sometimes not) and is beginning to initiate contact and communication in his own way. Lately, it seems there has been a communication explosion. Nik takes my hands to guide them down to his tray when he wants to get out of his chair. To his lap belt when he wants out of the stroller. To the gate when he wants to go through.\n Nik is beginning to communicate more with his voice. While the words aren\u2019t there, he makes sounds that are the tonal equivalent of \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cMo-om!\u201d \u2014you know, in that admonishing tone. Same thing for \u201cup\u201d and \u201cout\u201d, both sound similar but he uses them in the correct context quite often He will approach Niksdad and make a \u201craspberry\u201d when he wants to play with him (the \u201cfart\u201d song I mentioned  here ). He will hum the tune of \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d when he scoots over to be brushed, \u201cRow, Row, Row your boat\u201d when it\u2019s time to brush teeth. He gives kisses now with a smacking of his lips to the air before he tips his forehead to my lips.  \n Nik is wearing his glasses more; it\u2019s still a battle sometimes but when he is engaged in an activity he forgets he has them on and will wear them for up to 40 minutes at a time. And speaking of being engaged\u2026Nik will stay with an activity for anywhere from 20-40 minutes now (with prompting and interaction w/someone). It used to be less than one minute!  \n My once fragile and sickly little child has become strong, strong, strong. He goes on and on like the Energizer Bunny on steroids! The other day, he tipped over his Kimba seating system. The thing weighs roughly 50 pounds! Slow is not in his vocabulary; he\u2019s got things to do and \u201clost time\u201d to make up.\n And did I mention how smart he is? Seriously. Nik isn\u2019t terribly interested in playing with things \u201cappropriately\u201d but if you give him leeway to explore and examine something? He will figure out how it works in the blink of an eye. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t seem to realize that he has all the information to put his skills to work and then\u2026BAM! Just like  climbing out of the crib . And he knows the deadbolt on the front door is the thing that keeps him from getting out. \u2014for now anyway! I am already trying to think two steps ahead to solutions for the day \u2014coming very soon\u2014 when he realizes he can open that door to a great big world. \n I hope the world is ready for Nik.  \n Ready or not, here he comes!  \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/Rt3OTn4Ja7I/AAAAAAAAAJY/bqTvHX5-x4g/s1600-h/Nik+and+Daddy+%26+Mommy1.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/08/high-anxiety.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/Rt3OT34Ja8I/AAAAAAAAAJg/8yCgw1oQKDo/s1600-h/Niks+big+feet.JPG", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/stealth-monkey.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/spoonful-of-sugar.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/09/stealth-monkey.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/Rt3PA34Ja9I/AAAAAAAAAJo/RMr9LMklla4/s1600-h/Cruisin+the+playgound.jpg"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/09/04/belated-monthiversary/", "title": "Belated Monthiversary"},

{"date": "June 4, 2007 ", "body": "Aw Hell.  I tried to take  Kristen\u2019s  advice (left on one of my  previous posts ) and do something fun for myself tonight.  My options were limited since Niksdad is at work and I have no babysitter.  I thought I would take a nice little trip down Memory Lane and put together a video montage of Nik to share with you all. Well, I only have about 3000 pictures to go through (all digital, thank goodness!) to edit down to something anyone besides me would be willing to sit through.  Having done some of that \u2014I made it through Nik\u2019s first year, the toughest one due to all the hospital time and surgeries \u2014and my program crapped out! Argh! Even worse, as I went through those early pictures, I could see photo evidence of things which were only hazy recollections before.  So hazy, in fact, that I wasn\u2019t even sure I remembered at all.  There in the midst of all the sweet photos of Nik sleeping (well, he did sleep quite a lot, like most babies do), Nik\u2019s incredibly long eye lashes, Nik\u2019s baptism in the hospital (the night before open heart surgery at the age of 3 1/2 months), and the myriad medical professionals who became honorary family members after our seven-month stay \u2014there it was.  Pixellated proof that Nik HAD been more social and made eye contact.  Evidence that Nik DID have appropriate facial expressions and reciprocal smiles and laughter.  Proof positive that Nik even had the ability to raise a spoon to his mouth when he was a year old.  OK, granted, on that front he didn\u2019t make much progress with intake, but the skill was emerging long before it disappeared again. And that was all in the first year of his life.  Oddly enough, rather than being upset by the loss, I find that I am comforted in the knowledge that Nik DID those things and I have faith that he will do them again. Of course, it makes me wonder what events or circumstances may have led to the changes.  I am fairly certain that it WASN\u2019T VACCINES.  Nik never had an adverse reaction to any of his shots. Besides which, there are actually other medications I am more concerned about than those.  Reglan, for example, which helps with motility, has been suggested as having significant neurological side effects after prolonged use, especially in small children.  (Um, gee, do you think two years on the stuff during a critical time of development could count as \u201cprolonged use?\u201d)  Or there may be some effects from repeated doses of steroids which Nik required to help him get off the ventilator in those early months.  Or the anesthesia from his numerous surgeries, or the antibiotics he\u2019s had pumped into him nearly every month since he was born.  Oh, wait, those were all the things we had to do to KEEP HIM ALIVE. Would I change a thing if I could? Darned tootin\u2019.  But we did what we had to do to keep our precious miracle child alive; Nik was the most wanted child on the face of the planet.  We\u2019d tried and tried and lost a couple in early stages.  If I had known then what I know now, would I have done everything the same?  YOUBETCHA. So, here I sit strangely comforted by what WAS, cloaked in the possibility of WHAT CAN BE.  It\u2019s an interesting dichotomy.

{"date": "October 5, 2007 ", "body": "NOT ME. Tonight we went to dinner at a local restaurant \u2014a new place for us that we\u2019ve heard some mixed reviews about. We figured it was early enough in the evening that we would be ahead of the crowds and Nik could have an enjoyable time with us \u2014licking foods from our fingers and utensils and feeling like he was completely a part of the \u201cnormal\u201d family dining experience. What a freaking disaster! As soon as we walked in the door, I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be the stellar experience we were hoping for. The hostess didn\u2019t seem to quite grasp the concept of two adults plus a wheelchair. Yes, that\u2019s right, I said a wheelchair. When we dine out we have to take Nik\u2019s special seating system which can be a bit cumbersome. For some reason all the dumbass high school girls working the hostess duties at every restaurant we go to assume that Nik will sit in a high chair \u2014this despite the fact that he is being pushed in a pseudo-stroller the size of a freaking Cadillac El Dorado and I say \u201cNo high chair; he won\u2019t sit in one and we need room for his wheelchair.\u201d So, here we are tonight at the Texas Roadhouse, with Nik and all his gear in tow and the hostess wants to stop and tell us all about how we can pick our own steaks from the display or order from the menu. Nik is practically climbing over Niksdad\u2019s head at this point and I just said, perhaps a little more curtly than I should have, \u201cWe just want to get settled in at a table.\u201d So little miss hostess huffs and walks on, leading us to the very back of the restaurant.. She gives us a table in the middle of the small, cramped room \u2014the perfect location for Nik to do the most damage possible as people are walking past. OK. As Niksdad and I start to settle in and unpack Nik\u2019s pump and feeding stuff, Nik decides to be Super Baby and  tips the table over . Yes, that\u2019s right. I caught it just before the plates went crashing to the floor. Not a single server lifted a finger to help. Yes, indeed, I\u2019m loving this restaurant experience. But back to the mother of the year thing\u2014 Here Nik\u2019s been ill for weeks and we finally start to get a handle on things; that should have been our first clue that it was a bad decision. We decided to try tonight because Nik was having a pretty good day. Until we got to the restaurant; the noise and the music and the lights are just so overwhelming. Up to this point, Nik has been playing happily and placidly most of the day. Toy throwing has been almost non-existent and he\u2019s been very engaged and making lots of eye contact with me. As soon as we got settled in and Nik tipped the table, it was all down hill from there. The toy we brought tonight which normally can keep him enthralled for 20-30 minutes? Tossed within the first 3o seconds. Ditto everything he could possibly reach on the table. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t much, but he sure tried! Sitting across from Nik, I watched him get all \u201cspectrummy\u201d as I call it; he was in his own little world, grunting, squeaking, waving his hands and turning his head back and forth very rapidly. Little response or acknowedgment of anyone else around him and no eye contact at all. All the things he used to do so consistently just a few weeks ago. Before we took him out of school, Nik would come home so overwhelmed and sensory-overloaded that he couldn\u2019t function. That is what I saw tonight and it broke my heart. It took every ounce of strength I had to not break down and cry in the middle of the restaurant. It didn\u2019t help that we were surrounded by other tables with couples looking on. Every once in a while I glanced up and could see some odd looks directed Nik\u2019s way. I\u2019m sure the people didn\u2019t realize they were being rude or hurtful but goddammit it got under my skin in a way it hasn\u2019t in a very long time. Maybe it was my own projection, but it felt like they were judging Nik and finding him lacking or odd or weird. It hurts and it makes me angry and sad. I\u2019m trying so hard to work with Nik every single day now; to spend time getting down on the floor with him and engaging him as much as possible. And it\u2019s been working pretty well. But tonight reminded me of how fragile it all feels. How quickly the thread can unravel from the tapestry we are weaving together. I am anxious that tomorrow will be a challenging day for us both \u2014me because I will be watching for telltale signs of regression or detachment; Nik because he may be exhausted after tonight\u2019s overload. I truly haven\u2019t seen him like this in so many weeks. Possibly since the end of summer school in late July. To add insult to injury \u2014the food was mediocre and over priced.

{"date": "June 9, 2007 ", "body": "Ok, time for a little summertime entertainment!  One March Day  had  this fun post  about an interview and I decided to join in. Man, she sent me some doozy questions! It\u2019s taken me nearly two weeks to come up with my answers. Thanks for the challenge, OMD! With no further ado, here\u2019s a little something about me: 1) What is your favorite movie? Why? I think I would have to say \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d This is probably one of the few movies I could watch over and over. Of course, I\u2019m a sucker for Jimmy Stewart anyway. He kind of reminds me of my late grandfather\u2026a little bit. I am also a sucker for the sappy, love-conquers-all, goodness-wins-in-the-end kind of story. And when George finds Zuzu\u2019s rose petals in his pocket\u2026aw, man I cry EVERY time. Other favorites are some of the old Shirley Temple classics. Yeah, I\u2019m a sap, I admit it proudly! 2) If you had to be represented by an object in your home, what would you choose? Hopefully I would NOT be represented by the gobs of cat hair accumulating on my furniture! LOL. Ok, seriously, this is really hard. I love my house even though it\u2019s not my ideal. It\u2019s a small, old townhouse in a gorgeous setting (I look out onto state forest land and a creek in back) and it\u2019s filled with lots of old family heirloom type knick-knacks and various sorts of sentimental stuff. Well, that and tons of Nik\u2019s toys, too. I think though, the thing that I would choose to represent me is my Nana\u2019s violin bow \u2014which is framed in a beautiful shadow box style gold frame and hangs where I can see it every time I come through my front door. To everyone else it is just a violin bow. To me though, it is the embodiment of things I loved about my Nana and which, I hope, I embody as well. A passion for music and learning \u2014Nana was a concert violinist and spoke seven languages! Honoring family and tradition, simplicity (well, ok, maybe I don\u2019t  quite  embody that one!), and finding time to appreciate nature and the peacefulness of the woods. Just the sight of that bow can evoke powerful memories for me of times spent with my Nana and Granddaddy in their log cabin in the mountains. Peaceful, easy times. 3) What was your most memorable childhood experience and how has it impacted your outlook on life? Oh boy, this is super tough. I\u2019m not sure I have one specific memory. Rather, a collection of emotional remembrances of time spent with my grandparents \u2014especially with my mother\u2019s parents (Nana and Granddaddy). I have memories of my own home being full of turmoil at times. Trips to stay with my grandparents would always leave me feeling peaceful and safe. Memories of walking through the woods or up the mountain to visit a neighbor. Skinny dipping in the pond in the early morning light \u2014something Nana did every day. Fields of black-eyed Susan\u2019s and clusters of white birch trees. The sounds of Nana\u2019s violin echoing through the quiet wilderness. Time spent with adults who treated me with a respect usually reserved for other adults. The poets, writers, artists, and farmers who were all a part of the quiet mountain community. I guess the way all that has impacted my outlook on life is that I have always had a strong sense of the need for and importance of creativity. The ability to find the lessons in life, the beauty in wherever I am \u2014I\u2019m not sure. But it definitely provided an anchor for me at a time when it was sorely needed. Maybe that\u2019s the impact \u2014a greater appreciation of the importance of family and community connection. 4) If you could have lunch with anyone in the world, who would you pick and why? Um, can I pick a group of people? I\u2019m going to \u201ccheat\u201d and say my great-grand parents on both sides of my family. I\u2019d love to know more about them and what their lives were like because their backgrounds are so incredibly diverse. I want to know how their paths crossed and what forces drove them to join destinies. My paternal grandfather\u2019s family traveled the Oregon Trail in a wagon and settled in Colorado, Iowa and Washington. My paternal grandmother\u2019s is descended from passengers on the Mayflower; they became bedrocks of the communities they helped to settle. On my mother\u2019s side, there are Scottish-born English loyalists run out of the colonies, Native Americans who wed Portuguese settlers, and Italian immigrants who came through Ellis Island \u2014 all embodied by her grandparents. I think their histories must be so incredibly fascinating yet they are, with few exceptions, lost forever as no one thought to record them. 5) If you could make one fairytale or fable come true with yourself in it, which would you pick? Ok, I have to confess to a horrible memory for fairy tales \u2014it\u2019s been a few decades since I\u2019ve read any. Nik will not sit still long enough for me to read to him either. L So, I did a little research and came up with this one \u2014 Ricky of the Tuft . In this particular tale, I would be the fairy bestowing the \u201cgifts\u201d upon Ricky and the princesses. Ricky, of course, would be Nik and in the end would have the life and love he always wanted, complete with a beautiful princess to help bring out the beauty within him. Oh, to have the magical powers of the fairy to be able to grant one\u2019s child ease and grace\u2026 So, there you have it \u2014the \u201cinside scoop\u201d as it were, on me \u2014 Niksmom! If you\u2019d like to participate, here\u2019s what to do: 1. Leave a comment requesting to be interviewed. 2. I will respond by emailing you five questions of my choice. 3. Post your answers to my questions on your blog. 4. Include this explanation and offer to interview anyone who asks. 5. When someone asks to be interviewed, you will email them five questions of your choosing and they will answer on their blog.

{"date": "June 7, 2007 ", "body": "Peaceful. That\u2019s how I am feeling in this precise moment. Niksdad is at work, Nik is asleep, and I am online with my cup of iced coffee at my side and our two cats nestled onto their respective perches. There\u2019s a quiet in the air outside; the calmness of an early summer afternoon stirred only occasionally by the hum of a lawn mower in the distance. It is as close to being alone as I will come for a very long time so I revel in it. For the first time in a few days I actually have time to sort out the muddle of things that have been swirling through my brain. Perhaps now I can begin to make some sense out of some of them and begin to articulate thoughts and feelings. Nik\u2019s last day of school was Tuesday. That means we got his year-end report card. It still cracks me up to think about report cards for preschool. Well, after reviewing Nik\u2019s report card, I am definitely not cracking up any more. At first glance, the things that stood out to me most were all of Nik\u2019s unmet goals and objectives. Only one of his goals was met and the rest were nowhere close. My gut reaction was outrage and then fear of what it might mean. These unmet goals, were they evidence of my son\u2019s failure or incapability? The school\u2019s failure to effectively teach my child? My failure as a parent to push harder, sooner? I let myself dwell in that icky, upset space for a couple of days as I tried to find answers as to what to do next. I\u2019ve decided that, in this case, there are some opportunities for \u201cdo-overs\u201d and I fully intend to take advantage of each one I can. Today, I can look at Nik\u2019s IEP and see the glaring evidence of what we didn\u2019t know we didn\u2019t know back in September. It was Nik\u2019s first time at school and, I strongly suspect, the school\u2019s first encounter with a child as involved or complex as Nik. In a combination of or ignorance and an effort to give Nik and school time to figure each other out, Niksdad and I blindly agreed to what school put forth for Nik\u2019s goals and objectives. In all fairness to the school, I have to say that \u2014though Niksdad and I already suspected Nik has autism, there was no clear-cut diagnosis upon which school could build. There were too many other variables still in play \u2014the multiple physical impairments, the prematurity, and the seizures\u2014 to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were. It doesn\u2019t make me much happier but it does make me  wiser . Today, I am grateful for the clarity of hindsight and the continuing trust I have in my own intuition about my child. The current picture of Nik has become somewhat clearer to everyone and I think we can move ahead with some more concrete, appropriate goals for the coming year. Specifically, they will all have some greater degree of concrete measurability built into them so that we can see progress (or lack) sooner and can adapt and build more consistently. That is a definite frustration I faced with this year\u2019s IEP \u2014but I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if this will include a placement in the autism classroom or leaving Nik in the integrated preschool class. There are pros and cons on each side. If only I could find the way to elicit Nik\u2019s input on what he needs. Boy that would make me the \u201cAutism Whisperer\u201d wouldn\u2019t it! The teacher of the autism program, which is fairly new in our district, has already voiced some hesitations to me about Nik\u2019s orthopedic and visual impairments; she\u2019s never had a student like Nik and isn\u2019t sure how to handle some of those issues. As jarring as it was to hear at first, I appreciated her honesty. The flip side to the autism program, though, is the structure and the emphasis on communication which is not as keenly reinforced in the preschool classroom. I don\u2019t know enough about the autism program and the philosophy or teaching methodology to be able to make a thorough enough assessment of whether it\u2019s a good fit for Nik. I have \u201cheard\u201d that the focus is on the TEACHH method and not ABA or Floortime/RDI. My initial reservation to this approach is an understanding that this methodology doesn\u2019t really take into consideration \u201crecoverability\u201d or the possibility that Nik would, with appropriate supports, be able to learn to overcome \u2014or at the least, work with \u2014some of the skill deficits he currently has. I hope that I have  misunderstood  the premise behind TEACHH. If not, it sounds like an approach I cannot embrace for my child (nor should I be asked to do). The other major stumbling block for me in considering whether Nik should be in the autism class has to do not so much with the program as with Nik\u2019s ability to transition into it. The autism program is at the opposite end of the hall from the preschool class with which Nik has become not only familiar but very comfortable. I fear that taking away absolutely everything and everyone familiar to him all at once while remaining in the same building to see them all every day might be akin to taking a favorite toy, turning it on so he can hear the sounds and placing it where he can see it but cannot have it. A setup for a complete and utter coping failure of the greatest magnitude. The preschool isn\u2019t exactly an ideal fit either, though. Yes, Nik has made some great gains in some areas \u2014most notably gross motor skills. However, he\u2019s not made any progress toward eating, communication, overall ability to attend and focus, and he still doesn\u2019t have anything even resembling a sensory diet in place. This, despite numerous conversations with the teacher and OT about it. (Lesson learned: if it isn\u2019t in writing, it\u2019s not happening!) I think the greatest problem in the preschool is that there is a reliance upon Nik\u2019s ability or desire to learn from the modeling of his NT peers. Well, if Nik were just a garden-variety orthopedically impaired kid, sure that would make sense. Nik clearly needs 1:1 support full-time and that just doesn\u2019t happen in the preschool. But, based on my conversation with the school case manager, that could change. I hope so. Meanwhile, the things that are great about the current classroom placement include Nik\u2019s teacher, Miss J. She adores Nik and totally \u201cgets\u201d him. She\u2019s said to me so many times, \u201cI know there\u2019s a key to unlock him somehow and I\u2019m going to keep trying to find it.\u201d Her co-teacher, Miss D., I think would be very happy to not have Nik in the classroom; he is a lot of work and I don\u2019t get that she likes to work that hard. (To which I say, \u201cTough luck for you, lady!\u201d) Other pluses in the preschool are the exposure to more music \u2014a tremendous motivator for Nik\u2014 and exposure to not only NT kids but other kids with disabilities, too. The staff, overall, is much more comfortable with the orthopedic aspects of Nik\u2019s challenges. And Miss J. is trained to work with visually impaired children. So, my gut says that Nik would be better off in this preschool with some significant changes or additions. Definitely a 1:1 paraprofessional. Specific sensory activities along with a more predictable schedule, a more focused oral-motor program, some sort of intensive communication support (possibly augmentative technology) to help Nik with self-expression, and a behavior-based program of some sort. I know that it\u2019s never easy to give feedback on someone else\u2019s child whom you\u2019ve never met, but I\u2019d sure love feedback from any readers with information on TEACHH, or tips on how to successfully navigate our way toward a better IEP for Nik.

{"date": "June 3, 2007 ", "body": "This has been a weekend of extremes for me. Extreme heat on Friday, extreme rain today; preschool graduation on Friday, high school graduation on Saturday. I\u2019ve been elated and proud and I\u2019ve been sad and fearful. Funny, the weather almost mirrors my mood swing \u2014or is it the other way around? Is it the weather driving my mood swing instead? Whichever it is, I feel like a human yo-yo. Nik\u2019s preschool class graduation ceremony was on Friday morning. No, Nik wasn\u2019t graduating; we have at least one, possibly two, more years to go. But, I wanted to go see what it was all about. I am so glad I did. It was a wonderful ceremony full of music and dancing and celebration. Five children graduated to go on to Kindergarten in the fall. Some will go to whatever school is closest to their home; others, kids like my son, will go to a satellite program at another school in our district. There, they will be integrated wherever and whenever possible into general education programs. I have mixed feelings about it but don\u2019t know enough information to really dissect it yet. What I wanted to share from Friday\u2019s ceremony was the profound sense of pride I felt for each of the kids. Most especially, though, for the differently-abled kids; in the year Nik has been at school, I have seen some tremendous changes in each of them. Each one of them has brought something special to Nik as well \u2014a shared love of music, a gift of friendship and affection in spite of Nik\u2019s lack of reciprocity. A special connection that only they and Nik may understand it exists nonetheless and I saw it in action on Friday. I watched my little boy \u2014so often lost in some feeling or thought or sensation which totally captivates his attention\u2014 clap and \u201csing\u201d and dance (with assistance) and smile like there was no tomorrow. Yes, of course, music is a magical facilitator for Nik, but there was a connection with those kids that I haven\u2019t seen before. Nik even has learned how to use a \u201cBig Mac\u201d button during a particular song which helps him learn his name. I don\u2019t know if he actually knows his name yet but he sure knows when in the song to hit the button! I don\u2019t mind confessing \u2014I cried. A lot. Tears of joy and hope. Fast forward to Saturday. My eldest niece, J, graduated from high school. How could this be? Wasn\u2019t it just yesterday that she was my little lovey-lamb and I was her live-in nanny? I remember so vividly that period of now seemingly-ancient history when she was a gurgling baby then a curious toddler. I had the pleasure of living with my other sister (#2; I am the youngest of 3) and her husband and helping them out. They had both started new careers in the hospitality industry and were working crazy hours. I had just dropped out of grad school and was looking for a change, a new start and a chance to figure out who I was. Helping to raise J for a full year changed my life. I knew, from then on, that I wanted to be a mother. A singer, yes, and perhaps a writer, too. But a mother \u2014that was my ideal. I don\u2019t think I ever told anyone for fear they would call me stupid or old-fashioned. Little did I know then what a supremely wonderful and important job it is. Nik, Niksdad, and I sat in the bleachers, sweating under the warm June sun. It felt like a slice of small-town Americana brought to life. The ROTC color guard marching the flags onto the field, the slightly out of tune band playing the Star Spangled Banner, the sight of those fresh-faced young men and women in their crisp caps and gowns. It all brought tears to my eyes. I let them fall. I felt proud of this lovely young woman \u2014my little \u201clovey-lamb\u201d \u2014 all grown up and ready to take on the world. She\u2019s turned out to be such an amazing person; I can\u2019t wait to see the shape her life takes on as she grows and matures. The speakers, as I imagine they might at any small-town high school graduation ceremony, rambled on. The sound system wasn\u2019t the greatest so it was extremely challenging to hear everything they said. It didn\u2019t really matter as most of it was reminiscences of their years together at school. I allowed my mind to wander to another graduation ceremony \u2014one many years in the future. I looked at Nik sitting so placidly in his stroller (wheelchair, really) with the pump running to deliver his dinner. He played quietly with his current favorite toy and clapped along with the crowd at most of the appropriate places \u2014using both his hands and feet as he loves to do. (Nik doesn\u2019t do anything in half measures!) He even crowed and squealed a bit, too. I wondered if he made some people around us a little uncomfortable. I got annoyed at myself for even allowing the thought to creep in. I couldn\u2019t help it. \n I tried to picture Nik in his cap and gown, walking proudly to the podium to accept his diploma. I couldn\u2019t see it clearly and I panicked in my heart. The tears started to flow quietly and I squeezed Niksdad\u2019s hand tightly. Try as I might to dam the tide of thoughts, they swept me away. I was drowning under my fears. Will Nik graduate on time and through the fruits of his efforts and studies or will he merely be graduated because it is time, because he has aged-out of the system?\n \n \n \n My rational mind knows that Nik is only three and a half years old. He is incredibly smart and curious and has responded well to nearly all interventions thus far. I have no logical, reality-based reason to fear for his future. And yet, I do. I hate the duality of thought and feeling with which I constantly struggle. The exhaustion of trying to stay in the moment, of focusing on the here and now and making sure Nik gets every opportunity possible to discover, express, and reach his greatest potential \u2014whatever that may be. The corollary to that daily reality though is the constant need to look many steps ahead, to constantly think of the future. Am I doing enough to prepare Nik for the day that will come when Niksdad and I are no longer here or no loner able to advocate for him, to teach him, to support him and cheer him on? It is not a place I can linger, this future world of shadows and inevitability; it is too draining, too scary, and too painful to imagine the day I am no longer around to love my miraculous child. I cannot linger yet I can\u2019t stay away. Sitting in the hot June sun, I cry. A lot. Tears of fear and frustration.\n My self-indulgent reverie is broken by the sound of the crowd applauding. I feel a small hand brush against my arm, seeking attention. Nik is humming \u201cItsy Bitsy Spider\u201d which is his favorite song to sing with Mommy; he wants me to play. The request itself is a major milestone. I look into Nik\u2019s innocent face \u2014the face of my future \u2014and bravely smile. I square my shoulders and quietly start to sing. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RmNbcIVzRLI/AAAAAAAAAA8/YnspPJZL37Y/s1600-h/J_babypic.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RmNbcIVzRMI/AAAAAAAAABE/vFGcyWHw2Gs/s1600-h/J_grad.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RmNczIVzROI/AAAAAAAAABU/IiL0KcBKx1s/s1600-h/My+flower+child.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RmNe94VzRPI/AAAAAAAAABc/KzmJrpcNqKM/s1600-h/DSC00730.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RmNczIVzROI/AAAAAAAAABU/IiL0KcBKx1s/s1600-h/My+flower+child.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J6SpAkHs-Xw/RmNczIVzROI/AAAAAAAAABU/IiL0KcBKx1s/s1600-h/My+flower+child.jpg"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/06/03/duality/", "title": "Duality"},
{"date": "May 19, 2007 ", "body": "Many Hands Make Light Work or so the old saw goes, right? I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank the many moms who reached out to me recently \u2014not only through my blog (and through Autism Vox) but through email. I cannot tell you how many wonderful insights people shared and tips and resources, too. Since then, I\u2019ve been running a bit ragged as Nik hasn\u2019t been sleeping through the nights lately. EMBARASSING CONFESSION ALERT  \u2014 I sometimes snore so terribly that Niksdad wears earplugs to bed each night! Thus, guess who\u2019s been sleeping like a stone while Nik and I have been having our little visits in the wee hours?! I\u2019ve been doing lots of lurking on other blogs this week and have posted some comments but haven\u2019t felt like I had much to offer to the blogosphere that would be of any great moment. Nor do I have any great burning issue I feel the need to kvetch about \u2014so, I\u2019ve stayed quiet for the most part. But there have been moments throughout the week that I\u2019ve been spurred to reflection by several blogs and have gone so far as to compose my own post in my head (you know, somewhere in the middle of Acme, Wal-Mart or while at the gym. I think all these fabulous, insightful, and \u2014I daresay, pithy thoughts. Thing is, by the time I get around to my computer, said thoughts? Gone, gone, and gone. Guess that means I\u2019m not meant to share them just yet? \u2026Or some such karmic crap. Could also mean that I am seriously sleep-deprived mom with way too much on my mind and can\u2019t remember for a hill of beans? Nah, I\u2019ll go with the karma bit. So, in case anyone is interested (besides me, I mean), here\u2019s the latest on my boy wonder:\n NIK ROCKS!!! In the week since he\u2019s returned to school, there\u2019s been a really interesting dynamic happening between both Nik and me and Nik and his dad. It\u2019s like someone flipped a switch and our distant child is finding his way to us. I can\u2019t say for sure if there\u2019s a cause or trigger \u2014frankly, I\u2019m not sure I care. I am just thrilled that my little boy is making more eye contact with us, that he misses me when I leave him at school now, that he gets excited when he hears his daddy\u2019s voice or when I go to get him from his crib in the morning. I love that he\u2019s beginning to show signs of using the concept of \u201cyes\u201d correctly. As in, \u201cNik, do you want your drum?\u201d (signed in rudimentary fashion by Niksmom/Niksdad) and, at least fifty percent of the time, he will respond with a sign for \u201cyes!\u201d The sign, for those who are not conversant in ASL (Amer. Sign Lang.), is a closed fist rocking up and down from the wrist as if you were nodding your head. Nik, not having tremendous voluntary motor control in some areas, signs by waving his arm in a jerky, slightly side-to-side manner. It\u2019s pretty funny how Nik responds sometimes. He will reach for the toy in question without signing; my mister independent! We hold the toy out of his reach and encourage him to tell us \u201cyes\u201d by either hand-over-hand or tapping his arm to prompt him. He won\u2019t respond for a bit so we put the toy aside and tell him if he wants the toy he needs to tell us. He usually giggles and reaches for the toy as if he\u2019s not heard a word we\u2019ve said. This goes on a few times. Finally, as we are getting ready to put the toy away, Nik will begin waving BOTH arms. I often wonder what words he would be using if he had them at this point. Probably \u201cDuh, yeah, of course I want the toy. Did you even have to ask?\u201d Yep, I love that he\u2019s catching on to the concept of \u201cyes.\u201d Every time I turn around lately, it seems like Nik is making quantum leaps forward. My little  wunderkind  has gone from the child who wouldn\u2019t even bear weight on his own legs  one year ago  (except in the pool, but I think it\u2019s because he really,  really  liked Miss Katie!) to the fearless child at the park, cruising from area to area. Even sliding headfirst down the toddler slide and all by himself on the \u201cbig kid\u201d slide. Never mind the kid doesn\u2019t stand on his own, much less walk! Nik is fearless and curious. I watch him beginning to pay attention to things he\u2019s never seemed interested in before \u2014our two cats, the birds outside the window, the flowers growing in our front garden, people around him. It really does feel like a major shift all of a sudden. He\u2019s losing some of his aversions to certain textures of things such as the shredded wood mulch at the park. Six weeks ago, he couldn\u2019t stand the feeling of it on his hands. In the past week, Nik\u2019s been actively seeking it out and running his hands through piles of the stuff. He\u2019s even tried to put some in his mouth (and nearly choked on Mother\u2019s Day! I aged ten years in that one moment!). Nik has  never before  wanted to put anything in his mouth that wasn\u2019t a hard plastic toy to bite down on! The irony here is that I am worried now that Nik\u2019s newfound connections and curiosity will give the ADOS evaluators reason to deem him ineligible for the autism program  yet again . Last fall, it was agreed that Nik should stay in his preschool class and see how he did with \u201cintensive intervention.\u201d Well, we didn\u2019t know what we didn\u2019t know then and never thought to ask them to not only clarify what they meant but to  put it in writing . Won\u2019t make that mistake again! The challenge we are up against is that the evaluator is fairly new and somehow operating on the assumption that, if Nik makes \u201cprogress across all spectrums\u2026it is counter indicative of autism.\u201d Sheesh, that\u2019s like saying that a kid with autism cannot ever make progress or adapt. (It\u2019s  this  kind of thinking that keeps parents from being able to embrace their neurodiverse child/ren and nurture them to their greatest potential!) Anyway, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind tonight. The brain just shut down so I guess I\u2019m done\u2026for now.

{"date": "June 10, 2007 ", "body": "You know, with all the technology which exists in our society today, I feel a little cheated. There are a few items which I think need to be on the market ASAP. See if you don\u2019t agree with the desperate need for these:    The Meltdown Meter . Useful in many situations to help non-primary caregivers (non-PC\u2019s \u2014such as most Dads, teachers and school staff, and nosy bystanders in public places). This handy device would give either an audible or visual warning indicator (depending on one\u2019s sensory needs, of course) when your child\u2019s meltdown \u201cthreat\u201d level is escalating, thereby enabling non-PC\u2019s to evacuate or take some other preventive action. Primary caregivers may find this device useful, too, though most already can sense when junior is on the verge. The Going Poop Early Warning (GPEW) system . Comes in two versions\u2014one for home use and another for travel. Home version provides early warning (through \u201chazardous vapor\u201d identification) by means of audible alert GPEW can tell you the precise moment junior is \u201cdoing business\u201d so you can time preemptive diaper changes to avoid \u201cPoocasso\u201d or \u201cTaster\u2019s Choice\u201d syndromes. Intra-Cranial Digital Imaging (ICDI) . This cutting-edge technology allows parents to have micro-cameras implanted into their foreheads. Make \u201cI wish I had a camera right now!\u201d a thing of the past. Capture all those heart-warming memories and those so-awful-nobody\u2019s-going-to-believe-this-without-proof moments in the blink of an eye\u2014literally. Yes, I could have used each one of these devices over the past couple of days (most of them today, in fact!). That ol\u2019 Meltdown Meter would have come in super handy as I was trying to explain to Nik that the driveway he wanted so desperately to go down was NOT Nanny & Granddaddy\u2019s. Or, when we finally got to Nanny and Granddaddy\u2019s, why we couldn\u2019t go inside because they are out of town. Yes, the MM would have been nice. Would have saved me lugging a 30-pound kicking kangaroo down the street for the neighbors\u2019 Sunday morning viewing pleasure, too. The GPEW, well, kind of speaks for itself doesn\u2019t it?? We call Nik \u201cPoocasso\u201d as he seems to derive great sensory pleasure from mushing and gushing and smearing. Fortunately (??), he doesn\u2019t do it on the walls\u2014just himself! And finally, my favorite device \u2014 the ICDI. Man, did I ever need that this weekend! My sister and her husband were in town in preparation for the (rest of) the family\u2019s annual trek to the Outer Banks. My parents, sister #1 and hubby, sister #2 and kids and current boyfriend. We went the first year we had moved back to the east coast\u2014Nik\u2019s first summer off oxygen. It was a nightmare of monumental proportions. We\u2019ll try it again sometime. But I digress\u2026 Sister #2 lives here in town and has lovely home with a swimming pool; perfect for gathering for family dinners and such. We did just that on Friday and Nik was in rare form! First of all, Nik ADORES the water. He is almost dangerously fearless of it and loves to splash and kick up quite a ruckus, laughing all the while. My father, Nik\u2019s Granddaddy, is in his mid-70\u2019s and not exactly an overtly warm-fuzzy kind of guy; but he practically worships his grandson! Dad has always been convinced that Nik only pays attention to him because he\u2019s someone \u201cnew\u201d not because Nik could possibly know or sense that he is a special person in Nik\u2019s life. Yeah, for a retired M.D., my Dad\u2019s a little obtuse sometimes! So there we were in the pool, Nik clinging to my suit like a screeching monkey in his own private bath. Dad gets in and puts his arms out to Nik. Not only did Nik go right to his Granddaddy, but he \u201ckissed\u201d him (by bowing his forehead to Dad\u2019s lips) and proceeded to have an all-out \u201clove fest\u201d with him! Dad\u2019s face lit up like I\u2019ve never seen and Nik had a grand time hugging and touching Dad\u2019s face and chest. Yep, ICDI would have been great about then! Actually, it would be great a lot lately; we\u2019ve been seeing subtle, wonderful shifts in Nik\u2019s awareness of things and people and interactions with them. My little explorer now must examine every last leaf and petal and bit of mulch between the front door and the driveway. It literally takes about 3 minutes to walk 10 feet from the door to the car these days! It\u2019s annoying as all get out\u2014but I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world right now! So, if anyone out there is of a mind to develop these technologies \u2014 let me know when they hit the market! In fact, I\u2019d be happy to do some product testing\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/06/10/my-technology-wish-list/", "title": "My Technology Wish\u00a0List"},
{"date": "July 16, 2007 ", "body": "I am procrastinating \u2014one of my favorite and most accomplished pastimes. My head is swimming with  non- IEP   details and paranoia about tomorrow\u2019s meeting.  Niksdad   didn \u2019t help last night when he started getting snippy about the school nurse, Nurse J, and whether she was going to challenge every last little thing we bring to the table. Probably. But I\u2019m not going there just now, thank you. Instead, I\u2019 ve  been perusing all my bookmarked blogger friends and discovering some new ones, too.  Hmmm , that reminds me that I really need to update my links on my page to reflect ALL the wonderful blogs I read, not just the first ones which drew me into this fabulous world. ************************************************************************************* I\u2019 ve  been thinking a lot this morning about the future and about friends \u2014again. I\u2019 ve  written about some friends  here  and  here , but today I have different one on my mind. Possibly my dearest friend in the entire world, C. First some background \u2014C,  Calvin , and I all lived together in our \u201csalad days\u201d in Boston many years ago. Well, actually, it was in  Melrose  and we really  didn \u2019t eat much salad. Lots of macaroni and cheese and iced coffee as I recall. Anyway, we were thick as thieves but different as night from day; there was a deep bond and nearly psychic connection between us but our paths in life were vastly divergent. C was the former-beauty-queen-turned-banker (really, she participated in pageants in her home state as a teen. And she is still beautiful.), Calvin the spitfire, gamine with a quick wit and talent for writing (especially plays for stage and screen; she had a tremendous knack for storytelling and great dialogue). I was the musician who wanted to be an educator. Somehow, life took us in directions we never quite envisioned and we went our separate ways to marriages, new jobs, and new efforts to reinvent ourselves. C and I have always been close. Our birthdays fall in close proximity, our mothers shared the same birthday (though her wonderful mother passed away some years ago now), C and her husband, Doc, even share the same anniversary as my parents. Their son shares my husband\u2019s birthday. C even had a child with special needs; Angelic little N had a very rare genetic anomaly which proved to be fatal and she died at the age of 18 months after a very valiant fight. The experience brought dear C to her knees. Remarkably, she found the grace and strength to keep moving and living. I admire her so much; I\u2019m not even sure she knows it. It has been many years since C\u2019s angel passed away but she is with me constantly. I sometimes talk to  Nik  in the quiet of evening and name the angels I believe are watching over him; N is always one of them. I haven\u2019t seen C in a while but she and Doc came to town yesterday \u2014passing through on their way home from a conference in Maine. They could have flown home to VA but it was important enough to them that they get to see us that they rented a car and drove down and spent the night in town. Doc has never met  Nik  as he was on a National Guard assignment the year we had  Nik \u2019s second birthday party and C came alone. Yesterday was special for all of us. C is still a financial whiz and very successful; Doc is (duh!) a doctor and also very successful. They have a nearly idyllic life with their handsome son (who is now turning into a \u201ctween\u201d  heart breaker , I hear!), their large home on many acres in the countryside, family vacations, summer camp, etc. One could say they are living a \u201ccharmed\u201d life \u2014depending on your perspective, I suppose. They live each day with the memory of their beautiful daughter and the terrible loss. They use it to fuel them to doing good things for not only themselves but for others. They are wonderful people and I love them dearly. We had dinner with C and Doc last night;  Nik  was asleep and my mother came to babysit. It was a beautiful evening with good food, wine, and conversation with intelligent, funny, caring adults who understand what our lives are like in every possible way. The joy and fear, the grief and pain, the hope, the stress, the sleepless nights, the strain on relationships \u2014warts and all. I\u2019m tap dancing around what I want to say because it\u2019s raw and overwhelming and it\u2019s been on my mind for so long. Deep breath\u2026 Last night we asked them to be  Nik \u2019s guardians should something happen to us. It was emotional and scary and so uncomfortable. I mean, who are we to ask them to take on the burden of a child who may need support and services for the rest of his life? A child who has significant medical needs and may spend more time in the hospital where their angel fought so valiantly. How could I ask them to risk the pain of loving and losing another child? For I have no doubt whatsoever that  Nik  would be utterly loved by them and by their son, D. Granted, it\u2019s not like we are planning on handing  Nik  over and saying \u201cHere you go, please raise our son for us!\u201d Of course not; we\u2019re talking in case of catastrophic events here. None the less, it felt strange. I told C that the reason we wanted them to consider this is that we felt that they would not only be able to care for  Nik  financially (well, one does need to be practical here), but that they would try to instill in  Nik  a strong sense of ethics and the value of working hard for one\u2019s rewards. They have what I would call relatively mainstream family values and place a high premium on intellect and creativity. I don\u2019t\u2019 mean book-learning, but one\u2019s innate intellect; I think they would value  Nik  for exactly who he is without trying to make him fit an ideal of who he \u201cshould\u201d be. And they would do it all joyfully and without an ounce of pity for \u201cpoor Nikolas.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I can say that about many other people I know. C and Doc obviously need to think about it and talk it over; it is, after all, a tremendous responsibility. I hope they can find their way to \u201cyes.\u201d I simply cannot see  Nik  being raised by either of my sisters, nor by  Niksdad \u2019s sister. I won\u2019t go into the reasons here but will say that I don\u2019t think any of them would put  Nik \u2019s best interests first if push came to shove and they had to choose between  Nik  and themselves. I think C and Doc could, would do that; they\u2019 ve  already proven it with their own children. Kristina recently wrote about doing  \u201cthe right thing \u201d and planning for our children\u2019s futures. It is something that no parent ever really wants to have to think about yet it is crucial.

{"date": "July 18, 2007 ", "body": "ARGH!!!! I just  knew better  than to tempt the parenting gods. In my  last post  I bragged about the loss of a doctor and going to bed early. Sure\u2026 I was up most of the night with Nik and another \u201c mystery ailment .\u201d There\u2019s been something weird going on with one of his ears but it\u2019s not an infection. Ever since Nik had his tubes placed (last September), he\u2019s had some kind of weird sensory thing that wakes him from a sound sleep and causes him extreme discomfort. I know it\u2019s the ear because we\u2019ve had darned near every conceivable test to rule out everything from reflux to seizures to tumors. I am not exaggerating. I am convinced the doctor\u2019s must think \u201cHmmm, classic Munchhausen by Proxy here.\u201d But there really IS something wrong! Lately, Nik\u2019s been rubbing absolutely everything on his right ear\u2026and  ONLY  his right ear. If he\u2019s in the stroller and we\u2019re in a store where a stranger is innocently shopping, minding their own business, Nik will reach out and grab hold of their shirt, pants, purse, bag, whatever and rub it against his right ear. He is constantly flicking at the back of the ear (actually just a tad behind the ear) and has managed to abrade the skin something terrible. We\u2019ve seen all kinds of doctors and tried creams, antibiotics, you name it.  Nothing  works. The worst part is that it does not seem to be a joyful, comforting sensation to Nik \u2014  quite the opposite . Sometimes he flicks and rubs so hard then gets very agitated and cries or whimpers. It is heartbreaking. Last night, he not only did those things but he arched and flailed and hit his head\u2026something he hasn\u2019t done a  very long time . Clearly he is trying to communicate something to us about what\u2019s going on but we haven\u2019t yet debugged it. The only thing I can think of is that this started up  AFTER  he got the tubes. That was when all the weird nocturnal waking and arching, screaming, head hitting began. That is when the ear flicking began in earnest. Before that, Nik only flicked his ears when he was sick; that used to be a clear indication that an ear infection was brewing. Somewhere along the line, the rules changed. Nik never really had much trouble with his right ear; it was always the left that was infected or we couldn\u2019t get a clear hearing test (leading to his  temporary classification  as Deaf-Blind this past school year). The right ear\u2026\u201dpractically perfect in every way,\u201d as  Mary Poppins  would say. I wonder if there\u2019s some sort of auditory or nerve sensation that Nik now has from the tube in his right ear and if the flicking and head banging is his attempt at making it go away. I am tempted to ask the ENT to remove the tube from the right ear and see if it helps. I wish he could talk and tell me what it is. This not being able to figure it out and having to watch him suffer is painful for me. I can only begin to imagine how it is for Nik.

Those who are tagged should post these rules and their 8 random facts. 4. Players should tag 8 other people and notify them they have been tagged. So\u2026whaddaya wanna know about l\u2019il ol me?? 1. I\u2019ve lived in eight different states but have returned to my hometown. I\u2019ve lived in DE, NJ, PA, NY, MA, OH, LA, and CA\u2026only ONE of those was exclusively for college. The rest I actually lived and worked. My favorites? CA, NY, MA. 2. I am a classically trained singer. I lived in NYC for a while and tried my hand (er, um, voice) at Broadway and got as far as some call-backs for touring shows. I\u2019ve sung in non-professional opera companies, community theaters, cabarets, and done recitals at the NY Public Library. I learned all my music by ear\u2026couldn\u2019t read music well-enough to save my life\u2026until AFTER I left NYC! Now, my primary audience is a 3 1/2 year old critic who HATES when I sing anything but kids\u2019 songs or stuff from Mary Poppins! (Hey kid, people used to pay money to hear your mama sing you know\u2026) 3. I am hopelessly, shamelessly addicted to Regency-era romance novels (think Stephanie Laurens, Georgette Hyer, etc.). Hey, my life is stressful enough every day \u2014 when I want to get away from it all I want to get as  far away as possible ! 4. I went to a Quaker school in high school. I was the fifth generation in my family to do so. I am not a practicing Quaker. 5. When I was 15 I went to Italy as part of a national youth chorus. We sang for the Pope. 6. I have a degree in broadcast journalism and even won a few awards in college for my reporting. I\u2019ve never worked a day in my life as a PAID journalist! LOL 7. Since I was a high school student, I always wanted to work with disabled kids. It took me along time to get there \u2014I even took some early childhood ed courses toward a second degree while living in CA (didn\u2019t finish b/c I got pregnant w/Nik). Be careful what you wish for, it has a funny way of coming true \u2014just not in the way you envisioned! 8. In spite of my outspokenness on topics about which I am passionate, and my willingness to make a fool of myself in front of total strangers (see #2 & #5), I hate large gatherings of people. I can address my state senate but cannot make small-talk at a cocktail party. In fact, I hate talking about myself at all! This was a hard meme for me to do\u2026which is why I did it. Every once in a while it\u2019s good to stretch outside my comfort zone. Some people I\u2019d like to know more about: 1. TJ\u2019s Mom over at  One March Day . She always has good stuff at her place. Sometimes it is funny and entertaining, sometimes poignant and very moving. Always a good read. 2. Mom to JBG from  Hoop Dee Doo and PDD . I only recently discovered her blog and am in awe of the fact that she has three small kids, two with autism, and she not only manages to write but she keeps it very real! 3. Gretchen, Henry\u2019s mom, writes on her  eponymous blog  (I\u2019ve been longing to use that word!). I feel like she could be the mom down the street that I\u2019d like to get to know better and hang out with. 4. Jennifer Graf Groneberg, writes about life with her beautiful family on  Pinwheels  with such exquisite coloring that I find myself feeling things much more keenly after reading her posts. I usually read her blog last in the day because it is so wonderful. Truly. Do yourself a favor and go there now. 5. I first found  Vicki Forman  through a  link  on  Mom-NOS .\u2019 site I was hooked and can\u2019t wait to see what she\u2019s written each month in her  Special Needs Mama  column on  Literary Mama . I am jealous that another of my favorites, Kristen ( From Here to There and Back ), got to meet her in person today. 6. That would be  Kristen , mentioned above. We\u2019ve been emailing a bit and I wish we loved close enough to get together for coffee. She is a very talented writer with a gift for thoughtful expression and warmth. 7. Christine, at  Day Sixty-Seven . I found her blog recently and have been following closely the exploits of her sons, her recent embarking upon a new teaching (ad)venture with her son, Oliver, and waiting to read about her new career choice. She writes with raw honesty and lots of humor. And she doesn\u2019t have a  brain tumor ! 8. My final choice is selfish \u2014I miss reading her posts lately \u2014 the ubiquitous  Mom-NOS ! I mean, I know she loves Palmer Cartney, mows a mean lawn, and breaks for music\u2026but I want more! (Please??)

{"date": "July 14, 2007 ", "body": "I\u2019 ve  been thinking a lot today about Susan\u2019s  post  on  The Family Room  today.  She really captured the essence of where we are in our lives right now \u2014sort of.  We are very far along the acceptance curve but are still somewhat in \u201csiege\u201d mode, too.  It\u2019s a strange and uncomfortable place to be.  I so often find myself teetering on the brink of full-on acceptance and being able to simply adopt new routines and adapt when and where we need to.  I\u2019 ve  been able to work out regularly and have managed to lose 40 pounds \u2014nearly half of the weight I\u2019 ve  put on over the years since  Nik \u2019s birth.  Stress is a horrible, horrible thing if you don\u2019t create healthy outlets for it \u2014but that\u2019s a post for another day or perhaps even another blog altogether. Then, there are days like today when my adrenaline flows and I am in my battle regalia. Today  Nik  woke up very congested AND runny, coughing, feverish.  In short, a sick little boy.  Well, at least we think he\u2019s sick.  It might possibly be a strong reaction to the  DTaP  booster he had to get on Thursday.  It is part of the ongoing evaluation of his immunodeficiency.  Yes,  Nik  the human pin-cushion has to get jabbed with needles way more than anybody should have to.  And we still don\u2019t know the extent of his immune function.  The immunologist on call today said, \u201cWell, it is most likely just a reaction to the shot\u2026but it could be an opportunistic infection trying to take hold what with his compromised immune system.\u201d   WTF \u2026thanks, I needed that like a hole in the head today. Going back to  Susan\u2019s post , I found myself nodding my head \u201cyes, yes\u201d as I re-read the bit about \u201ca simple cold can throw us all into chaos\u201d and wondering when, if ever, I will be able to stop getting anxious over every last little sniffle or cough  Nik  has. I hate that such a thing has the power to jerk me right back to the panic of all the months in the  NICU .  The times we were sure  Nik  was off the ventilator for good, or had turned some corner then\u2026 BAM !  On days like today I feel like I haven\u2019t come nearly as far as I think.  I hate that I let it distract me from other things I need to be paying attention to.   I become obsessed with finding the answer, the \u201cfix\u201d, the \u201ccure\u201d for whatever physical ailment is standing in our way.  Arrogance?  No, desperation. I really need to be focusing on something else right now \u2014getting ready for a  non- IEP   IEP  meeting on Tuesday morning.  That stirs the siege mentality/feelings, too; after a pretty mediocre school year for  Nik , it feels like we have to get this one right.  This one is a biggie; this is laying some significant ground work.  We are meeting with the  IEP  team plus the district autism coordinator and the psychologist to discuss their evaluation of  Nik .  We\u2019 ve  put in calls to both of them to ask for a private conversation before-hand but have gotten NO RESPONSE.  I would rather have some vague idea of their general thoughts so as to not be blind-sided in the middle of an  IEP  meeting.  I hate when that happens because I get caught in the emotion and get stuck there.  It is not useful or helpful for  Nik  in any way and I have learned \u2014the hard way\u2014not to operate from that place if I can help it. To that end, when the school case manager called to schedule the  IEP  \u2014at which neither PT nor Speech will be represented ( WTF , I  didn \u2019t agree to that!), I told her that she should absolutely not plan on walking away with anything vaguely resembling a signed  IEP .  I want this meeting to be a discussion about  Nik \u2019s needs and classification and placement ( possible school change  may be on the horizon.  We have very mixed feelings about that!) and that we would need to reconvene for his official  IEP  later. Just in case, though,  Niksdad  and I are preparing a list of the things we want incorporated into  Nik \u2019s  IEP , including the rationale supporting the educational necessity of each item (e.g., \u201csupports independent living,\u201d \u201cnecessary for safety,\u201d or \u201csupports  LRE \u201d\u2026those kinds of things).  For each one the school denies or  doesn \u2019t address, we will follow up in writing and ask for explanations.  I\u2019 ve  been reading  Mom Without A Manual  lately and have been taking some notes based on her  recent experiences  with her school district. I keep telling myself that if we can get through  Nik \u2019s  IEP  for next year and are able to get him the supports he needs (which includes a 1:1 paraprofessional  full time ), I can let go of the fight or siege mentality and begin to settle in and simply BE  Niksmom  and  Niksdad \u2019s wife. Pursuing my own longer-term interests will have to wait a little longer \u2014and I\u2019m OK with that.  Right now, I have two guys in school who need my unwavering support.   Nik  needs me to fight for his rights until he can do so on his own.   Niksdad  needs me to believe in him and support him in his very challenging career change from engineering to nursing.  He is working toward the ultimate goal of becoming a pediatric nurse anesthetist; it\u2019s a long road but he is brilliant and dedicated.  He is building a new future for us so I guess you could say he too must feel under siege sometimes. Lest I get stuck in the bleakness of the  ka \u2013 ka  going on today/this weekend, I have had glimpses and reminders of all the progress  Nik  has made and continues to make every single day.  The continuing  efforts to communicate  with those around him, the  easy laughter  \u2014often at appropriate moments, the  physical shifts  toward more standing and attempts at walking, the music, the kisses to the \u201cother boy\u201d each time he passes a mirror, the  sippy  cup  with the straw, etc.  Those are the things which pull me back from the brink of despair when I am besieged with  Nik \u2019s latest illness and the worry that it will turn into something bigger, the  IEP  planning, or the discovery that  Nik  has not had ANY speech therapy at school since the June 1st.  Yes, I have to take a deep breath and allow myself to focus on the here and now. Unlike some couples, we haven\u2019t yet figured out how to make time for too many dates or conversation that  doesn \u2019t revolve around  Nik , school, or work.  But we\u2019re getting there in baby steps.  Regular workouts, sitting down to dinner together, making time at least one day each week for a family outing of some sort.  Like Susan said, \u201cIt\u2019s small, but it\u2019s progress, and that makes it feel huge.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/07/ive-been-thinki.html", "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/", "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/07/ive-been-thinki.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/04/perceptions-perspectives-orig-posted.html", "http://momwithoutamanual.blogspot.com/", "http://momwithoutamanual.blogspot.com/2007/07/100th-post-what-100-means-to-me.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-good-stuff.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/spoonful-of-sugar.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/unexpected-pleasures.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/well-it-seems-that-there-must-be-some.html"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/07/14/beseiged/", "title": "Beseiged"},

After the  IEP meeting  this morning, we had to take Nik to an appointment with the geneticist, Dr. B. All Nik\u2019s tests look wonderful \u2014no identifiable anomalies, syndromes, etc. Dr. B talked to us a bit about future likelihood of disability or prematurity for another pregnancy and told us we were doing an amazing job. He was impressed with how well we handle everything Nik\u2019s been through. Niksdad and I laughed. I guess our teamwork really  does  pay off. We\u2019ve gotten much better at finding release valves in our daily lives to ease the pressures. Dr. B said, unless something comes up with Nik that we want to have him investigate from a genetics perspective, he really doesn\u2019t need to see Nik again for another  two years .

{"date": "July 17, 2007 ", "body": "We made it through our non-IEP meeting today. I guess my message must have come through loud and clear to the case worker. Today\u2019s meeting really was just about changing Nik\u2019s classification and brainstorming on strategies for the fall. His full IEP meeting will be in mid-September and Niksdad and I are OK with that. We did feel a little put on the spot this morning because the autism program coordinator and school psychologist \u2014neither of whom had returned my calls about talking before today\u2019s meeting \u2014 shared the results of their evaluation in the most rambling, round-about way. We were sitting there trying to decipher just what the psychologist was saying (do they every just speak like normal human beings!?) and trying to process the emotions. God I got so frustrated I just wanted to reach across the table and smack the crap out of the psychologist! It took them nearly twenty minutes to articulate  this : \n Nik\u2019s overlapping medical issues, combined with his long-term hospitalization may have contributed to, in fact may be the primary driving force behind, his autistic features. Because they couldn\u2019t really get an indisputably clear picture from the ADOS, they agree that he needs educational supports congruent with those a child with autism might receive. However, they feel the classification that best suits Nik right now is \u201cmultiply handicapped,\u201d which encompasses the medical (CP, seizures, GI health), the physical impairments (orthopedically & visually), and the extreme language/communication delay. OK, that\u2019s pretty straightforward. It is also the classification we wanted. Yay! The bottom line is that Nik will continue in the preschool but with some greater supports, including behavioral and intensive language/communication programs. There was a lot of talk about the potential to do a disservice to Nik in isolating him from typically developing peers; I agree right now. The autism classroom at Nik\u2019s school is not set up to accommodate the overlapping issues he presents at this point. Nik\u2019s OT, Miss D, was at the meeting this morning and backed us up on the need for a comprehensive sensory evaluation both at school and by an outside professional. I was thrilled! The outside evaluation, if I understood correctly, will cover more aspects than she can in a school setting. Miss D\u2019s feeling is that it would extremely useful information to have in structuring daily activities for Nik. The new principal, Mr. L, was in there too. It was wonderful. The old principal  never  got involved in IEPs unless there was a significant problem (thus his butt being on the line!). Mr. L had some really useful input around the issue of a 1:1 paraprofessional for Nik right now. While it doesn\u2019t give me what I thought we wanted, it makes a great deal of sense when I put it in the context of my extremely clever son. The caveat Mr. L put forth was that Nik needs to generalize his learning at this point in his education (I agree) and the danger is that, because Nik is very bright and a good problem solver, he may learn instead that he doesn\u2019t have to mind the teacher or other authority figures and that his individual para is the only one he has to mind. OK, I can see that as a highly likely scenario if I am completely honest with myself. I do still have some concerns about Nik\u2019s safety given his seizure activity. It is so subtle (they are short absence seizures \u2014like staring spells) that they can be missed. The net result is that we cannot give reliable data to the neurologist in order to adjust meds. Also, Nik has been known to have a seizure while he is climbing or crawling and the potential for significant injury frightens me. I mean,  hell , we didn\u2019t spend all these  millions of dollars  (thank you insurance and Medicaid!) to keep our son alive just to have him fall and bust his head open, right?! (I am  SO   kidding , folks! Please no admonishing comments!) Mr. L\u2019s suggested solution is to educate the entire staff on what Nik\u2019s safety issues are, as well as what we can reasonably predict they may be as Nik becomes more independently mobile. On the surface, that seems reasonable enough; we are willing to try it. But Niksdad and I made it clear that we reserve the right to reexamine the issue of a 1:1 if Nik\u2019s safety is in the least little bit compromised. Miss J, Nik\u2019s teacher, suggested that I come in at the beginning of the school year to do a little in-service with the classroom staff about some of Nik\u2019s needs. I like that idea. On a related note, I am excited about picking up prescriptions today for significantly increased therapies for Nik. Hopefully, we can get him into a good groove and making some significant progress between now and the time he goes back to school at the end of August. It would be wonderful if I could go back and show the folks at school how well Nik makes progress when he gets appropriate levels of services. In this morning\u2019s meeting, when I raised the issue of increasing frequency and duration of services, even Miss D (the OT) balked a bit. The old \u201cschool versus medical\u201d line came up. I was ready! I reminded everyone that IDEA 2004 calls for preparing a child for \u201cfurther education, employment, and independent living.\u201d Further, I brought up that FAPE also encompasses the child\u2019s ability to participate meaningfully in extra-curricular activities. The issue isn\u2019t about medicine it is about development; that is about education. ( Don\u2019t get my Italian riled up, folks! ) OK, so I may not have been all softness and acquiescence this morning. Been there, tried that and Nik got the crappy T-shirt that ran and shrank in the wash \u2014thank you very much! But I think our preparation and outspokenness made it clear that we weren\u2019t going to just settle for the \u201csame ol\u2019 same ol\u2019.\u201d I feel good about today \u2014I think.

{"date": "May 1, 2007 ", "body": "This post is written in honor of  Blogging  Against Disablism Day. To find other participating blogs, click  here . I\u2019ve been thinking \u2014obsessing really \u2014about \u201cDisablism\u201d and what it means to me. I\u2019ve been trying to find some righteous flame of resentment within myself about how someone may have treated my son because of his multiple disabilities. Countless examples have flit through my brain over the past 24 hours but none of them really aroused my ire enough to inspire any pithy, erudite pearls of insight or gems of wisdom to dispense. Not that these posts are necessarily about that at all. Instead, it\u2019s given me an opportunity to examine something a little closer to home \u2014my own thoughts about my son\u2019s disabilities. God, I hate that word \u2014 disabilities \u2014 so much! There is no less cumbersome way to describe Nik though than \u201cdisabled\u201d. He is certainly \u201cdifferently-abled,\u201d \u201cchallenged, \u201corthopedically/visually/cognitively impaired,\u201d \u2026take your pick. But I see so much more than that each time I look into my sweet toddler\u2019s long-lashed eyes or glimpse his impish, yet cherubic, smile. In my waking hours I fight tooth and nail to help my boy get what he needs to be able to do more than just survive in this world. I take him from specialist to specialist, evaluations and therapies, school, the park, the playground, and ad infinitum. All in an effort to help Nik adapt and learn, to develop and grow to his potential. My husband and I try to parent in a way that is gentle and loving, accepting and respectful of Nik and all his quirks and talents. We are, by many people\u2019s declarations, \u201cthe best parents\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe right parents\u201d for this little blessing whom God has bestowed upon this world. It\u2019s not a sham, it really is how we live and the belief we hold is that our son can do ANYTHING. But, in the stillness of night, sometimes in the quiet twilight before dawn when no one else is awake, I lie in bed and cry with the ache of the unfairness of it all. The exhaustion of grief held constantly in check so no one else can see the inner struggle to constantly rise above the emotions. I visualize the moments of my child\u2019s life which may never be. It\u2019s never a simple vision as it is juxtaposed with the current reality of the moment and inextricably twined around prayers for those moments and achievements that I hope will be. I seethe with envy over the ease with which my sister\u2019s beautiful children take for granted their ability to walk, to talk, to feed themselves \u2014while studiously avoiding their little cousin who makes them uncomfortable. If I am glaringly honest \u2014even in the stillness of those hours before sunrise when I am raw with feeling\u2014 I must confess that, perhaps, I too have a bit of the \u201cdisablist\u201d in me. How could I not? Our culture worships the super-achievers among us \u2014the great scholars and inventors, the athletes, artists, and aesthetes, the genetically superior, the richest, etc. We have come so far in creating a world that will accept our \u201calso-rans\u201d and our \u201cless-than-perfects\u201d with respect to making accommodations and provisions in the name of equal rights for all. But have we really come that far after all, when mainstream journalists still refer to special education as a \u201c social malady \u201d or when there is no representation of our disabled population in any of our entertainment media, no groundswell of community support to change our education system to ensure that EVERY child gets a real education? Are we kidding ourselves when we, as parents of children with disabilities, state so vehemently, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing about my child!\u201d? I, for one, willingly confess that there are many things I wish I could change about my son. I would gladly take away all of the physical limitations which keep my amazingly curious child from being able to experience the world to the fullest. Would that I had a magic wand to wave which would allow him to walk with ease, to eat with gusto, and to chatter his three-year old thoughts to the world. I would not change the essence of who Nik is for anything in the world; but I don\u2019t think that his being and character are necessarily shaped by his disabilities. I see many facets of myself and my husband within Nik. It does not surprise me that his means of communicating with me is music or that he tinkers with every toy to figure out how it works (not how to play with it, but how it works!) much like his scientist father. Nor does it surprise me that he is stubborn, determined, and fiercely independent. Nik\u2019s personality is not shaped by his limitations; his personality is what allows him to persevere in spite of them. As the sun rises and I slip on my mantle of unshakeable motherhood, I rise to face a new day, immensely grateful that I am not alone in my desire to make the world an easier, more welcoming place for my child and for others like him but so completely unique. So very differently-abled.

{"date": "July 19, 2007 ", "body": "I\u2019ve really got to use my imagination To think of good reasons To keep on keepin\u2019 on. Got to make the best of a bad situation.. . \n Gladys Knight & the Pips  \n \n Like a centipede doing  fan kicks , the shoes keep dropping around here\u2026 Just when I am ready to blog about some wonderful thing, something crappy happens to balance it out. I am definitely feeling the fatigue of the roller coaster that is my life these days. We still haven\u2019t ironed out the  ear mystery  \u2014that\u2019s kind of an ongoing saga for now \u2014and Nik has recovered from his summer cold OR reaction to his DTaP booster from  last week . In fact, he got rid of it so nicely\u2026by giving it to me! Yeah, life is so not fair sometimes, is it!? Yesterday was Nik\u2019s last day of summer school for an entire month. Oh boy, am I ever going to be one busy mama. There are moments I am utterly exhausted just thinking about the  things I need to do with Nik each day  in order to keep him on a relatively even keel until school starts again. I was able to get the Rx from our pediatrician for the levels of therapy recommended by the early childhood development team which evaluated Nik back in February. We\u2019ve been reluctant to push the issue with school because, frankly, they just don\u2019t have the resources \u2014the actual bodies with the actual time to give \u2014to provide the level Nik truly needs. I\u2019ve been hesitant to go through insurance though because then it\u2019s a slippery slope of school saying \u201cIf insurance is paying for it, it must be medically necessary so we won\u2019t provide these services.\u201d On the other hand would be insurance saying, \u201cNope, we\u2019re not paying for this; it\u2019s educational!\u201d Damned if we do, damned if we don\u2019t. So we simply haven\u2019t\u2026until now. Now that we\u2019re through the  IEP reclassification  and we\u2019ve set the expectation that the frequency and duration of Nik\u2019s related services needs to dramatically increase, I found a place here in town for Nik to get PT, OT, and Speech therapy during his summer break. It\u2019s run by two women (one is a PT, the other an OT) who have been working in a combination of schools and hospital settings for many years. They were smart enough to see the genuine need in our town and I am grateful. Nik, Niksdad and I went on Wednesday afternoon to tour the place (and drop off the doctor\u2019s referral). Niksdad and I were really impressed and Nik took to the two therapists right away. We go for full evaluations on Monday and Tuesday and they can start services  right away ! I am so thrilled; the idea of going an entire month with NO therapies at all just wasn\u2019t acceptable. Nik is making such tremendous progress that we really feared some regression and a significant recoupment or \u201cramp-up\u201d time when he returns to school. So here I have this rosy vision that we might go the therapies in the mornings and be home for lunch and nap, followed by afternoons spent either at the park or at my sister\u2019s pool. The idea of such a structure for the next month is daunting but exciting. I think Nik will make phenomenal progress with so much therapy \u2014 twice a week in each of the three disciplines! We\u2019ll see how close we actually come in reality! LOL Niks teacher, Miss J, told me yesterday that Nik has been making tremendous progress in wearing his glasses lately and sitting still for story time. We used to have to use arm restraints/braces to keep Nik from tearing off his glasses. It is not what we wanted to do but felt it was necessary to protect Nik\u2019s left eye (which has fairly close to normal in vision) and the remaining vision he may have in his right eye. Miss J also told me that Nik has been more actively engaging in some of the sitting/table activities lately \u2014moving from one activity to washing his hands in the sink and going back to another activity. Still a bit unfocused but much better than he has been. Of course, the day I was going to brag about all of the above, is the day that I got ill, Nik\u2019s ear flared up again, and the area around Nik\u2019s feeding tube site (called a  stoma ) became so inflamed and tender that he would cry if we even tried to touch it, let alone put the tube in. Not a good thing for a kid whose sole source of nutrition is that #$^%$ tube. Yes, I get very resentful of the power that tube has over our lives \u2014our ability to do things spontaneously (that would be none), the ease of finding a babysitter (non-existent unless the kid is already asleep!), the need to micromanage Nik\u2019s nutritional intake (especially at school), and the sheer amount of stuff we have to travel with just to go to a doctor\u2019s appointment \u2014we must be prepared for an extra meal on the go, Do we have enough formula, did we remember to bring the 60mL syringe and water to flush the tube, Nik\u2019s meds, etc. Somedays I handle it the same as breathing; I don\u2019t even give it a thought. Other days, though, it is the albatross around my neck which pulls me under the surface of despair and frustration. Yesterday (and today!) was one of those days. We ended up having to take Nik to see the GI nurse so she could check the site for infection. Fortunately, there was no sign of obvious infection but there was a large buildup of granuloma which had started. (That\u2019s an inflammation of the skin which can build up and cause a tender ridge to form around the opening where the feeding tube goes through the abdomen. In Nik\u2019s case, it\u2019s very painful.) The treatment for that is to cauterize the skin using silver nitrate sticks. Yeah, Nik had to get his tummy burned yesterday. I have sat and held my micro preemie son while neonatologists tried to insert PIC lines and watched the nurses draining my son\u2019s chest tubes after heart surgery. Those pale in comparison to watching my son writhe and scream in pain and anger (at being restrained) as the nurse jams, literally, fistfuls of silver nitrate sticks (think long skinny swabs that burn like hell) INTO and around his abdomen. I handle it because I have to but I want to cry as hard as Nik does.   My usually non-snuggly boy is a limp, clingy mass of hysteria by the time we are done.  Somehow, Niksdad always manages to be at school or work when these appointments happen\u2026 For some reason, Nik took so much longer to recover from the procedure yesterday; he usually is fine by bedtime or sooner. He cried his little heart out the entire drive home (an hour) and didn\u2019t stop when he was in Daddy\u2019s arms. We let Nik play quietly for a few minutes as we started to get his pump ready for dinner, knowing full well that he wouldn\u2019t last to his usual bedtime of 7:00 pm. Within five minutes we saw this: Yep, Nik was sound asleep  sitting up  by his \u201ccastle\u201d toy. Bless his heart, he slept through a diaper change and putting on his pajamas, Daddy carrying him upstairs to bed, AND putting in the tube to give him a feeding while he slept. We don\u2019t like to do that because of the whole reflux issue (well, that and the fact that Nik nearly strangled himself one night by getting tangled in the tubing). So I sat in his room in the dark for an hour as Nik had dinner.  It was only 4:30 in the afternoon. After a slightly bumpy early part of the night \u2014Nik woke very fussy around 6:30 pm and continued to cry and fuss for an hour and a half straight \u2014Nik eventually settled in for a solid night\u2019s sleep. Wish I could say the same. My cold made it challenging to breathe much. I am not sure if it was the cold medicine I took or the small glass of wine I had at dinner, but I had the MOST BIZARRE dreams! I dreamt I was pregnant (um, not even possible!) and that the baby was kicking me in the kidneys. Donald Trump was my OBGYN and he was trying to induce labor by doing some very unprofessional things to my breasts. EEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWW. I woke up feeling not only weirded out but even more ill! (Shudder). I gotta stop reading those trashy novels while under the influence of cold meds, apparently! So, over here at sleep-deprivation, high-frustration central, we\u2019re hanging in there\u2026and waiting for the centipede\u2019s dance number to end.

{"date": "May 1, 2007 ", "body": "It\u2019s after midnight Tuesday (or is it Wednesday??). The day is nearly over but my house is still humming with energy as I blog and Niksdad diligently studies for his final exams this week. Nik, on the other hand, went to sleep early and easily tonight. Such a relief\u2026let\u2019s hope he makes it through the night tonight! After a few really bumpy days and some even bumpier nights, my little guy seems to be back to his old self again. His wonderful, laughing, singing (well, humming actually), giggling, toy-throwing, \u201cNo-don\u2019t-help-me-I can-do-it myself\u201d independent self. J Did I mention the sun was shining and it was a totally beautiful day today? Seriously. In fact, it was so beautiful this afternoon that I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being indoors with Nik after school so I convinced Niksdad to take a one hour break from studying so we could all go to the park. I should mention that, despite all of Nik\u2019s delays and physical challenges, he has made amazing progress in his gross motor skills. The way the kid moves now, you\u2019d never know he only learned to sit up after his 2nd birthday! Nik climbs like a monkey going after the choicest bananas on the tree and his THIS CLOSE to walking and standing independently. God knows it sure isn\u2019t\u2019 for lack of trying on his part! Bless his little heart but he\u2019s a determined young man\u2026persistent as a dog with a fresh bone! Once he learns a new skill, he works at it almost methodically until he has mastered it! (He gets one quality from me and the other from Niksdad\u2026and I\u2019ll just leave it to you to figure out which is which!) So, the park today was a great place to be. There\u2019s one park in our town that has a really great play area that is rapidly becoming one of our favorite places to take Nik. Lots of toddler-friendly stairs on the play structure for Nik to climb on. Lots of cruising and sliding opportunities which are perfect for my active, curious wonder. There\u2019s also a bonus for Niksmom and Niksdad; it\u2019s one of the only places we can go as a family where we feel like we are \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cfit in.\u201d I remember the first time we went to the park; I cried tears of joy because I felt like \u201call the other moms\u201d for the FIRST TIME EVER IN NIK\u2019S LIFE. I confess I still get a little emotional sometimes as I watch Nik test his abilities and look so proud of himself. I am constantly amazed at Nik\u2019s motor planning abilities. For a child with a significant visual impairment, we were lead to expect that he might have trouble with mobility (specifically with spatial relationships). Every once in a while his depth perception is a tad off, but he only has to fall once before he figures out what he needs to do! Today, Nik climbed up and down and up and down and \u2014 you get the idea \u2014ALL BY HIMSELF! He was filthy and exhausted but it was the exhaustion born of joyful work. We gave Nik a bit of a break and put him in one of the toddler swings, uncertain of how he would react; he hasn\u2019t been wild about the swings in the past. I think it\u2019s mostly because he doesn\u2019t feel completely supported in those little bucket seats; he loves the sensation of flying through the air! Well, Nik must be getting time in the swings at school because he not only adored being in the swing and having me push him, he was trying to use his little legs to pump back and forth to move faster and farther! He had to have picked up that technique by watching some of the NT kids at school, right? I mean, I think my child is brilliant and there ARE times when people watch him figure things out and they say to us \u201cWow! He\u2019s really smart!\u201d or \u201cBoy, are you guys in trouble when he\u2019s walking!\u201d Still\u2026 We let Nik wear himself out a bit more before heading home a mere 30 minutes later; Nik is a kid in perpetual motion (even though he doesn\u2019t walk yet!). I like to tell people he has two speeds \u2014 \u201cCatch me if you can!\u201d and sound asleep! When we got home with our very tired little man, we tossed him in the tub and let him splash to his heart\u2019s content. Now, for some reason unknown to anyone but him, Nik is terrified of getting in the regular bath tub. We still use his infant tub and put it in the middle of the floor. Needless to say, we were all soaked by the time Nik finished. It was worth it to see the pure joy on his face! The icing on the cake tonight came as we were getting Nik settled in to his special seating system to start his (tube feed) dinner. The routine is usually that we get Nik\u2019s dinner going and then we offer him one of his favorite toys to play with while we make our dinner. (Once we get our dinner on the table, we wheel Nik\u2019s chair into the dining room so he can join us at the table.) Actually, we don\u2019t just offer the toy, we ask Nik if he wants \u201cX\u201d (the toy) by using both words and sign language. Nik isn\u2019t so hot at using signs but will sign a few things such as more, eat, and finished. \u201cNo\u201d is always a vigorous shake of the head \u2014 the universal toddler response! Nik has never in his life expressed \u201cYes\u201d in any manner \u2014 until tonight. When Niksdad asked Nik if he wanted his \u201cmusic\u201d (a little toy piano), Nik reached for it. I pulled his hand away and said \u201cSay \u2018yes, Daddy\u2019\u201d as I moved his hand under mine to show him the sign for yes. Much to our surprise and delight, Nik actually signed \u201cyes\u201d TWICE. This is MONUMENTAL for Nik. So, tonight \u2014as Niksdad was at the library hitting the books \u2014after Nik drifted off to sleep, I snuck into his room to peek at his angelic little face as he slept and felt my heart swell with love and pride and hope. I am so in awe of my son. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/05/01/a-walk-in-the-park/", "title": "A Walk in the\u00a0Park"},
{"date": "May 2, 2007 ", "body": "In perusing some of my favorite blogs this morning, I read a terrific post on  Autism  Vox  about the newly raised question of the role of melamine in our food supply as a potential cause of autism. I love that Kristina finds these fabulous articles and interviews and digests them into bits and pieces that people like me can digest (sorry, bad pun since I am getting ready to talk about food allergies! Oops\u2026). Her wealth of knowledge and resources (and resourcefulness!) inspires me very much. In her posts, K always includes a link back to the complete article/s she references. In today\u2019s post, she  mentioned  a study highlighted in today\u2019s Washington Post which refutes the possible connection between the conditions of autism and  celiac  disease. Since I have some food intolerance to both gluten and dairy, as do both of my siblings, and now my son with autism has shown seeming evidence of the same, I headed over  here  to check it out. Now, let me state up front that I do not purport to know the cause of my own child\u2019s autism let alone the root cause of the whole darned spectrum. Nor do I think we are anywhere near finding a \u201ccure\u201d despite a wealth of therapies and alternative measures one might choose to potentially reduce the manifestations of the disorder. I am not interested in ranting commentary on either side of the Cure vs.  Neurodiversity  issue at this point. I am simply a mother trying to raise her child to develop to his own full potential in whatever way it might look. (Don\u2019t get me started on the issue of someone else determining  another\u2019s  potential\u2026it just  gets  me angry!) But I digress\u2026 The article in the Post was interesting. Playing devils advocate here\u2026I guess one could argue that a single study using such a small sampling of kids might not be all that conclusive. It would be interesting to see some studies done in a variety of countries and cultures where the food sources may, in fact, be more highly processed and may use more chemical filler. What about a study of kids using one group on an entirely organic diet versus another eating nothing but school cafeteria food? Now we\u2019re talking! (wink) Personally, I do not think that there is a  direct  correlation between intolerance/allergies and autism. I am no scientist (that would be  Niksdad ) and I can only speak from my personal experience to say that we DO have  Nik  on a wheat/gluten-free and casein-free diet to the greatest extent possible. It\u2019s tough with a tube-fed kid because all the formulas seem to contain some form of a dairy-based protein. That said, however, we originally started  Nik  down this path because of physiological symptoms (congestion, runny nose, constant ear infections) not because of any behavioral issues. And it was a gradual process. It was only after  Nik  had been on a  GF  diet for 6-8 weeks that we began to notice subtle changes in his attention span and expressive language skills.  Hmmm . Up to this point,  Nik  never really got much dairy simply because he doesn\u2019t drink anything but water (his choice) in a cup and he gets all his needed nutrition via his feeding tube. (The whole eating issue is a complete post unto itself at a future date.) Several months after the start of the  GF  diet,  Nik\u2019s  school began to give him yogurt in attempts to get him to eat by mouth. It worked. But it also had terrible effects on  Nik\u2019s  overall demeanor and ability to focus. We noticed that  Nik  would be extremely lethargic immediately after eating the yogurt. Not just drowsy\u2026nearly catatonic. He would eat until he could eat no more \u2014 eating long past the point of satiety. My little boy who wouldn\u2019t eat much by mouth on a consistent basis could all of a sudden eat nearly EIGHT ounces of yogurt in one sitting.  Niksdad  and I noticed some new behaviors for  Nik  including significant hand-flapping and finger flicking \u2014 NEITHER OF WHICH HE EVER DID BEFORE. So, we conducted our own  experiment  and stopped the yogurt entirely. Within THREE days, the flapping and flicking were gone. Now, I\u2019d love to be able to tell you that the dietary change \u201ccured\u201d  Nik\u2019s  autism\u2026fat chance! However, as we continue to make subtle changes in  Nik\u2019s  nutrition, including putting him on a completely food-based formula which is  GF  and lactose-free (not the same as casein-free), we do see positive changes. Even so, with all that, we have to remember that  Nik  isn\u2019t your average \u201ctypically healthy\u201d toddler; he was born way too early with all his systems very immature. He\u2019s had massive amounts of surgery and mechanical and pharmaceutical interventions just to keep him alive at some points in his early life. We may never really know why ANY of these things happened. Truth is, it doesn\u2019t even matter to me anymore. I could waste time wailing and gnashing my teeth over the doctors who *may* have been able to determine that the placenta had attached somewhere without much blood flow, or that the  neonatologists  *may* have been able to determine much earlier that  Nik\u2019s   intestines /heart/eyes/lungs/whatever didn\u2019t develop quite the way they should have. None of that will change who  Nik  is and what we deal with on a daily basis. So we just move forward. I think, perhaps as I write this morning, I am beginning to define my stance on the cure/ND issue. I understand the driving need for one to feel a measure of control over this out-of-control life with autism. I also understand completely loving your child no matter  how  they are or  where  they are to the point that you may fear changing some intrinsic part of  who  they are. I\u2019m not sure you can do either in a  vacuum ; kids grow and change in spite of our best efforts to slow the march of time. I can no more tell you if  Nik\u2019s  behavior changes are due to the change in his diet, exposure at school to a variety of peers in varying stages of  development , or simply part of the normal process any more than I could tell you when my son might walk, talk, or eat\u2026or sleep through the night again! (Yes, we were up  veeeerrrryyy  early today\u2026again.) But I can tell you without hesitation that I will continue to explore any and all means available in helping  Nik  adapt, adjust, grow, thrive, surpass people\u2019s expectations\u2026you name it. As long as it will DO NO HARM. Thanks once again, Kristina, for the \u201cfood for thought\u201d you have so graciously provided for me today.

{"date": "May 9, 2007 ", "body": "So here we are on day six of Nik being home with an upper respiratory infection as well as a skin infection at his g-tube site.  We\u2019ve taken some road trips to the doctor when his breathing got a little scary and pumped him full of antibiotics to help the infection.  Poor little guy has been through the wringer.  He\u2019s rebounding fast though and I hope (no, make that PRAY) he can go to school tomorrow! I must interject here \u2014MAJOR KUDOS to the moms that home school their kids, whether with or without any disabilities!  I have thought about it but don\u2019t know that I have the metal and emotional stamina to do it effectively without a whole lot of frustration and resentments. But, my time at home with Nik this week has gotten me thinking about some important things besides the immediate health concerns.  Namely, what do I do with Nik in all those waking hours between giving meds, tube feedings, changing diapers and just plain old playing with him?  Maybe I am getting caught up in the trap of \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses\u201d as I read about moms doing their home ABA programs and RDI and such.  I\u2018m so new to the autism game that I don\u2019t know what those things really are \u2014beyond some vague theoretical understanding \u2014or how to begin to use them.  How do I begin to learn some simple things to do at home with Nik so that he\u2019s not just left to his own devices for a large part of the day? I can\u2019t shake the feeling in my gut that there is something else I should be doing with Nik/ for Nik besides encouraging and celebrating the small milestones.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I absolutely know the value of doing those things \u2014but isn\u2019t there more? How do I begin to get my son\u2019s newly increased attention span and awareness of his surroundings to work for him?  How do I begin to work on learning language and self-help skills with a child who won\u2019t look at me with any degree of regularity?  At school they are starting to work on a PECS system for Nik but I\u2019ve not gotten any instruction on how to begin at home. How do I begin to understand the sensory issues that may come into play with Nik that keep him from eating by mouth or that cause him to have complete hysterical breakdowns with no apparent cause? I\u2019ve got a call into the behavioral psychologist we\u2019ve seen in the past for some of Nik\u2019s cyclic feeding issues.  We haven\u2019t seen her since the autism diagnosis was made official.  Meanwhile, I\u2019m here with Nik and wondering if I am doing enough. This post isn\u2019t just a rhetorical rant from my psyche; it\u2019s a genuine SOS to all you moms out there who have already walked this path.  I would love some input on good resources for concrete things to try with a three year old who does not yet walk, does not talk, doesn\u2019t have the most consistent  fine motor skills, and the attention span of a, well, three year old.  Cognitively, no one really knows where Nik is yet.  Personally, I think he\u2019s a smart little guy who takes absolutely everything in and tries to figure out how it all works.

{"date": "May 5, 2007 ", "body": "It\u2019s been a tough week. Nik is ill again\u2026hopefully not anything that will result in a stay in the hospital. It\u2019s the upper respiratory gunk that has been going around. It has been building up and then just knocked the stuffing out of him on Thursday afternoon. It\u2019s trying to work its way into his lungs and we are fighting it tooth and nail with homeopathy (which we use as a family anyway, not out of biomed desperation to \u201ccure\u201d anything!) and increasing his breathing treatments. Today, anyway, it feels like \u201cit\u201d might be getting the upper hand. The toughest part \u2014the unknown, if you will \u2014is that Nik\u2019s immune system isn\u2019t functioning properly at this point. Yeah, we just found THAT out this week, too. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what the situation is except that he\u2019s not making certain antibodies and needs to be super careful about illness. Actually, the doctor we spoke with on Wednesday afternoon told us \u201cbe hyper-vigilant.\u201d Swell. Another thing to add to the growing list of parental concerns, eh? He also told us that if Nik gets sick he needs to be on antibiotics to protect him from any secondary infections. Too late\u2026Nik not only has this \u201cgunk\u201d but he\u2019s also started to show signs of a skin infection at his feeding tube site. Sigh\u2026we started the antibiotics last night. So, yes, the  hammer blow  seems imminent and Niksdad and I have been talking about the possibilities of treatment if Nik really IS immunodeficient. Of course, I pray that this is just a phase his body will outgrow, but my gut (which has seldom been wrong where Nik is concerned) tells me that we are about to embark on yet another roller coaster in this  Dutch Wonderland . While it isn\u2019t going to be a \u201cboy in the bubble\u201d sort of situation, it could mean monthly trips to the hospital for IVGR (intravenous gamma globulin replacement) to give Nik the necessary antibodies to help him fight infections and illness. As it is, he\u2019s been stuck so many times in his short life that he\u2019s got more scars than veins (so it seems sometimes) and the trauma of blood draws or IV\u2019s usually takes him several days to recover from. On Wednesday, we finally got the written report from the developmental pediatrician. She strongly recommends the state autism program as his best educational placement. Not a surprise for us but still tough to see on paper. It seems so much more defining \u2014if that makes any sense. As Niksdad and I read and digested the report (a process which is continuing even now!), it became evident that Nik\u2019s current school may not be the best place for him after all. That means potentially changing schools to the school I had some reservations about. Of course, I have great trepidation about making such a drastic change \u2014whether into the autism program at Nik\u2019s current school or to  another school entirely . I worry that the change will be so dramatic for Nik that he will regress and have even greater difficulty coping that it could be weeks or months just to regain ground to where he is now. He\u2019s been making some really nice gains lately in the area of awareness of other people and actually initiating interactions; I cringe at the thought of losing that. Of course, if the change is necessary \u2014and it seems likely that it is \u2014Niksdad and I agree that it\u2019s probably best to make a clean break of it and go to a new school. At least there wouldn\u2019t be the familiarity of place and routine to frustrate Nik. By that I mean if he stays at his current school, his classroom would be at the opposite end of the hall, he wouldn\u2019t have ANY of the same teachers or paraprofessionals but he would still see them every day. (It is a small school and they all know each other.) As it is, Nik has a complete breakdown if I even have to turn around for something once we\u2019ve started to walk out the door at the end of the school day The idea of changing schools is tough for different reasons which I have already mentioned  here . Still, I know that if Nik had some life-threatening physical ailment which could only be treated surgically I would not hesitate to have the operation. Somehow, this is so much more difficult for me to deal with. Is it that I can\u2019t see further than the next few months down the road and so I have no idea what is best for Nik\u2019s longer term future? Likely the case. So, here I sit today \u2014a sunny, beautiful spring day \u2014wanting nothing more than to take my child to the park and feel \u201c normal \u201d for a bit. Instead, I have a sick child who is too sick to go out but not so sick that he\u2019s not totally bored being indoors, Niksdad is off taking a professional course for the entire day, and I have a raging sinus headache myself. I have not the benefit of knowing thing one about ABA, Floortime, RDI \u2014or any of the other wonderful things I am just starting to read about \u2014 to help me in connecting with my child and drawing him out or going into his world or making any kind of connection beyond touch and the aching love in my heart. And in the midst of it all, I pray for the patience of Job, the strength of Hercules, and the wisdom of Solomon to guide me in knowing what to do to help my child. Like I said\u2026it\u2019s been a tough week.

{"date": "May 9, 2007 ", "body": "(Written Tues 5/8) Gardens have a funny way of surprising you.  You fertilize and cultivate and plant and water and wait.  Sometimes you see the fruits of your labor almost immediately; others it seem s like nothing is ever going to grow and you resign yourself to the fact that your plantings didn\u2019t take root.  And you wonder, \u201cDid I give enough fertilizer? Did I water it enough? Too much?  Did I plant it in the wrong place?\u201d  Eventually, autumn comes and all hope of seeing growth is rendered moot by the layer of newly fallen leaves, then frost, then snow as the seasons change and the suns light no longer warms the sweet earth.    You forget about the plants and focus on keeping warm inside, maybe some new project to carry you through the winter. Seasons change yet again and the warmth of spring beckons you outside to the garden where the miracle of rebirth and new growth awaits.  Where you once thought your special plant had withered and died, it now shows signs of soft green shoots and abundant life.  You smile and bask in the warmth of the sun\u2019s kiss upon your face. That is how I feel tonight.  The garden metaphor has been on my mind since I spent some time in the yard today, weeding, as Nik played happily inside with Daddy.  For the first time, I actually enjoyed the opportunity for quiet reflection.  Where I used to only see patches of incessant weeds to be pulled and shrubs to prune, today I saw the \u201cbones\u201d of my landscape and the possibilities they hold. It\u2019s like that with Nik, too.  I try never to take for granted how much potential he has and try to focus on all the wonderful things Nik is and does.  But sometimes, like my garden, I plant seeds and tend them so carefully and see nothing.  It\u2019s easy to let myself accept that \u201cX\u201d (whatever thing it happens to be at the time) will not happen for Nik.  Showing affection, responding to the sound of my voice \u2014those are two things that I realize tonight that I had given up on; Nik has never done them.  I\u2019ve tried all sorts of coaching and coaxing and even bribing with a favorite toy held near my face in an attempt to get Nik to look me in the eyes.  Nothing. Since Nik has been put on a new enteral formula, which is food-base AND has less dairy protein than his previous formula, Niksdad and I have noticed some changes in Nik.  His attention span seems longer and he now seems to pay more attention to his surroundings than he ever has.  The other day when I came home from the gym, Nik actually stopped what he was doing and came to greet me at the kitchen gate.  He didn\u2019t look me in the eyes but he held my hand.  I was in heaven! Tonight, Nik has been \u201cchatty\u201d \u2014babbling all sorts of spontaneous, happy sounds, as he had dinner, then afterward as he played before bed.  He\u2019s taken a few short steps over the past couple of days \u2014usually when I pull my hand away from his as he is already in motion.  Tonight, though, Nik consciously let go of my fingers and stepped away from me.  He walked three steps and sat.  He looked up at me with a glorious grin that said all that needed to be said between us.  Yup, THAT was cool! We have a bedtime routine that includes brushing teeth before holding onto Daddy\u2019s hands to walk up the stairs to bed.  I have a silly little song I sing to cue Nik that it\u2019s time to \u201cBrush, brush, brush your teeth\u201d (tune of Row, Row, Row Your Boat).  If Nik isn\u2019t ready to go upstairs yet, he will not come to me.  I tell him he has five minutes to play then it\u2019s bedtime.  Usually, Nik will scoot over to me in his little crab-like crawl (he sticks one leg out to the side and won\u2019t use his knee).  He always sits on the floor between my legs and I pick him up and put him on my lap. (It is one of the rare times I can get Nik to sit still long enough to get some \u201csnuggles\u201d in!) It\u2019s been a long few days with Nik home from school with his upper respiratory infection; we\u2019ve been with each other 24-7.  I figured he\u2019d be pretty sick of Mommy.  Apparently not. When it came time for the \u201cbrush-brush\u201d song, Nik scooted across the room so fast I thought he wasn\u2019t going to stop.  Tonight, as he settled himself in between my legs, Nik put his hand on my thigh and turned to look me right in the eye.  Then he lifted himself off the floor and climbed right up onto my lap and leaned against me.  Yeah, I couldn\u2019t see to brush his teeth after that. Soft green shoots and abundant life.  Everything feels pretty rosy tonight. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2007/05/09/how-does-your-garden-grow/", "title": "How does your garden\u00a0grow?"},
{"date": "July 1, 2007 ", "body": "Thanks everyone for all the good wishes\u2026they must have helped Nik dodge the stomach bug \u201cbullet!\u201d Seems he\u2019s fine after just a couple of days of crampy and cranky bouts. I have to wonder if the change in his enteral formula has made a big difference, too. It\u2019s got significantly less dairy and his overall GI health seems better than ever before (knock wood!). I was worried b/c the last two hospital visits (stays, really \u2014a week each time!) have been due to a GI bug that really knocked him down. WHEW! In any event, it\u2019s been a relatively uneventful few days; that\u2019s always a good thing round here! I\u2019ve been trying some of the  tips that B gave us  during the feeding eval. While I wish I could say Nik is eating like a champ, but at least he  is  eating a bit more and is not fighting me as much. Maybe he is more ready now? All I know is that, for the past few days at least, mealtimes have been much nicer. Still  godawful  long \u2014 20-30 minutes for oral feeding followed by nearly an hour for the tube feeding then the extra 20 minutes Nik has to remain upright because of his reflux. Multiply that by at least 4 meals a day and, well, you can probably figure out why I don\u2019t get out much on weekends except to the park or for walks with Nik! But it feels like we\u2019re heading in the right direction\u2026bit by bit. Or should I say bite by bite? \n  ************************************************************************************** We\u2019ve been avoiding TV in our house for a while (sort of like  Kristen\u2019s  house, too), but lately Nik has been getting very bored and restless with the usual toys he plays with while the tube feeding is going in. So I decided it was time to try a little distraction. Inspired by a couple of other families ( here  and  here ) who have been checking out our favorite nanny, I brought out our Mary Poppins DVD this weekend. I have to say, Nik is quite enamored of not only Mary Poppins herself but finds George Banks to be hysterically funny and laughs out loud when the penguins dance with Burt. Niksdad has even come up with his own lyrics to the \u201cI love to laugh\u201d song (the scene on the ceiling with Uncle Albert) which makes Nik crack up even when he\u2019s crying!  You know the one \u2014 it goes \u201cI love to laugh (ha ha ha ha), loud and long and clear.  I love to laugh (hee hee hee hee), so everybody can hear.  The more I laugh (ho ho ho ho), the more I fill with glee.  The more the glee (hee hee hee hee), the more I\u2019m a merrier me!\u201d  Nik laughs himself silly over this one!  Niksdad, being the manly-man he is, has co-opted this tune for his own silly version which makes Nik positively  HOWL  with laughter no matter the occasion! So, at the risk of  completely  destroying Niksdad\u2019s street cred (he gave me permission!!), his version goes something like this: I love to fart (thttt thttt thttt thttt), loud and long and  clear. I love to fart (phttt phttt phttt phttt) so everybody can smell. The more I fart (insert sound effects), the more I fill with glee. The more the glee (sound effects), the more I\u2019m a pew-pew-er me! Yep, gotta love my man!  (Did I mention he\u2019s a highly educated science-geek type?  No, REALLY!) So, there\u2019s our dirtly little secret.  Hee hee hee.  ************************************************************************************** Ok, on a more serious note, I had a wonderful experience at Nik\u2019s school this morning.  I took him early so I could try to wear him out on the playground before breakfast.  Um, guess which one of us needed a nap when we were done? Right! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Oh, sorry, where was I?  Right, school. I ran into the grandparents of a little boy who\u2019s new to Nik\u2019s class, J.  J reminds me a lot of Nik when he started school a year ago \u2014won\u2019t bear weight on his legs, doesn\u2019t talk, won\u2019t eat, cute as a button (well, he  is !)\u2026  He lives with his grandparents who, from what I understand, are basically raising him and his little brother with very little involvement from the mom.  I\u2019ve seen Grandma a few times and exchanged pleasantries and encouragement about J\u2019s progress.  Today, though, I met Grandpa.  The first thing Grandpa told me is that Nik is the reason J is in this school.   Huh?   Turns out when Grandpa came to tour, he was bowled over by Nik (probably literally, since he tells me he saw Nik wheeling himself about in the mobile prone stander) and the independence he saw in him.  The teacher told him that Nik wouldn\u2019t stand or walk when he first came to school.  That clinched it for Grandpa.  Grandpa is, apparently, a big fan of my son.  I was very touched. It meant more to me than I could possibly express at the moment he told me.  See, when Nik was born, and often throughout our many, many months in the NICU, Niksdad and I said we wanted to make our experience \u2014good, bad, scary, hopeful \u2014count for something bigger than just our little family.  It felt like God chose us to be Nik\u2019s parents for a reason and God brought Nik to this world in the manner he did for a reason.  I am not a hugely religious person but I do believe there is a reason for things that we may not always know or understand.  So to know that my son \u2014my family\u2014 is making a positive difference in the life of another child, another family\u2026 Well, it feels overwhelmingly good  and  like a big responsibility all at once.   I try to live and parent in ways that make me worthy of that gift.  Some days I succeed more than others, but each day brings a new opportunity. Today, life is sweet.

{"date": "July 9, 2007 ", "body": "I keep trying to write something today but my mind is whirling in so many different directions that I end up editing and  censoring  and losing my train of thought until I can\u2019t even remember what I wanted to say. Must be too many nights of interrupted sleep?  Nik\u2019s  fighting another infection \u2014a mild ear infection this time \u2014and it makes him so uncomfortable. Combine that with the \u201cnormal\u201d testing of limits and boundaries and, well, the picture really says it all. (Note: read the shirt.) I am worn through and through lately and I don\u2019t see an end in sight.  Nik  starts \u201csummer vacation\u201d in just a couple of weeks and I am trying to line up some independent therapy (which he needs regardless of the summer break) as well as keeping on top of the various medical threads we\u2019ve got going. Let\u2019s see, last week we had three appointments, this week it\u2019s four, and next week we have another couple. Eleven in all this month\u2026UGH! I have been lurking on many blogs the past few days and finding myself alternately inspired and envious. Inspired by news of amazing progress of our children ( here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  and   here ), envious at the idea of taking any time to find my \u201c long-lost  mojo \u201c, or travel to other locations for a vacation (like  Kristen ,  Gretchen ,  Susan , and  Jennifer ). Then, I\u2019ve been plain old emotional over things that really are quite  gut-wrenching , and humbled by the way some writers can share. In short, I\u2019m just not loving my own life this week. I\u2019m feeling a little ragged around the edges.  ANYBODY WANT TO TRADE FOR A LITTLE BIT?? So, the irony here is that nothing is actually wrong. In fact,  Nik  is continuing to make wonderful progress in some areas and not-so-wonderful progress in others. Welcome to parenting, right? It\u2019s just this freaking  IEP  and  possible placement  in a new school  that has me so unraveled.   The case manager from school called today to tell me the autism evaluator is ready to schedule the family meeting/IEP.  I feel like the rug is getting ready to be yanked out from under me and I feel completely unprepared for an IEP meeting within the next ten days! Somehow I deluded myself into thinking we would wait until September.  Shit, this feels like when Nik was born\u2026we planned for February but he came in December.  We weren\u2019t ready yet.  I\u2019m still not ready yet! ********************************************************************************** Niksdad  was off from work this week, courtesy of a scheduling SNAFU, so we took advantage of the time and did some projects we\u2019ve been putting off. Catching up on finances, landscaping the front yard, getting our heating and A/C system replaced. We also spent some \u201cquality\u201d time together \u2014as a couple and as a family. My parents babysat on Friday night so  Niksdad  and I could *finally* go out to dinner to celebrate  our anniversary  (yes, that was last month). It was heaven and strange all at the same time. I cannot recall the last time we were out without  Nik . Worse, I can count on ONE HAND the number of times that has happened since  Nik  was born. We made a vow to each other that we will try to get out at least once a month for \u201ccouple\u201d time. It\u2019s so challenging though with  Niksdad\u2019s  work and school schedule along with  Nik\u2019s  schedule of appointments and the timing of his feedings. It has been a real struggle for us to find both the time AND energy to do anything beyond collapse into bed with a book at night! Sigh\u2026 We did get to take  Nik  to the water park at one of the state park areas yesterday. It was fabulous and scary. It reminded me a bit of Susan\u2019s post ( here ) about the zoo. Expectations can be so funny. And they sneak up on one so quickly as they did me when we took  Nik  to the  beach  in June. Nik  did really well. He didn\u2019t seem to mind the noise. For me, it felt like we were at a really loud cocktail party with kids running around in the background. My own \u201ccrowd anxiety\u201d came up a bit but I didn\u2019t let it stop me from having fun.  Nik  splashed and cruised around the kiddie pool and even went down the slides a few times (with assistance). I was appalled at the rudeness of some of the kids. One little girl deliberately cut in front of us as we waited in line for the slide. We\u2019re talking a kiddie slide with a line of maybe half a dozen kids; it wasn\u2019t as if she had to wait hours for her turn. I got so angry that I actually said something. Usually, I would be quiet and seethe with indignation; that\u2019s usually my M.O. if it is something that affects only me. But you don\u2019t mess with my little guy! Oh, no, no, no! I told her that she was a terribly rude little girl and should learn to wait her turn. She just glared at me and motioned for her friends/siblings to join her. At that point, I wedged my size 16 butt in front of the other kids (she was already at the head of the line) and told them that they would just have to wait their turn like everyone else\u2026it was HIS ( Nik\u2019s ) turn right now. I felt like the bitchiest thing on earth but I didn\u2019t care! I mean, it\u2019s one thing if a kid can fend for him/herself or at least speak up but  Nik  can do neither so I did it for him. One of the kids actually tried this maneuver a couple more times and I finally grabbed a hold of his arm and told him he needed to just cool it, it wasn\u2019t his turn. Where the hell are the parents of these kids? Who is teaching them anything about taking turns and sharing?? Is this the kind of generation of \u201ctypical\u201d kids our society is raising? OK , end of rant. Anyway,  Nik  had a wonderful time and was oblivious to the whole turn-taking thing. Was I too sensitive? Did I do something I shouldn\u2019t have done?

{"date": "July 11, 2007 ", "body": "We have a certain pre-bedtime routine we follow with Nik. Jammies followed by some play time then brushing teeth (with sips of water, too) and (Mommy) singing our bedtime song. Then it\u2019s off to bed holding Daddy\u2019s hands as he walks up the stairs. Niksdad and I do this together every night that Niksdad isn\u2019t working. The moment we are done with the special song, Nik pops up off my lap and races to the kitchen gate to grab Daddy\u2019s hand. It\u2019s very sweet. Most nights, Nik cannot sit still for the whole bedtime song and scoots away before I\u2019m halfway through. Tonight, after brushing teeth and having one sip of water, I offered Nik more water. He kept pushing the cup away but would then scoot further into my lap and lean against me. I\u2019d offer the cup, he\u2019d push and lean. Duh\u2026took me a minute to figure out he was trying to tell me he was ready for \u201cthe song!\u201d He rested his head against my breast and snuggled back in my arms as I sang in a choked voice. Three times through. Yeah, I\u2019m a big ol\u2019 mushball when he does stuff like that \u2014 it\u2019s so uncommon for him but I see him starting to do more and more with each passing day.

{"date": "July 11, 2007 ", "body": "Yep.  The field trip to XBos that we thought was next week?  Today.  I dropped everything to go with Nik on this outing.  Niksdad and I took Nik once before on a Sunday morning when they first opened; it was relatively calm and quiet and Nik did OK as long as we stayed in the toddler area.  I was dying to see how he\u2019d do in the big, bright, noisy atmosphere of screaming kids (and chaperones!) and whether he could \u201chang with the big dogs\u201d on the larger structures.  OH YEAH!  Miss J, Niks wonderful teacher, and I double-teamed him and took him up padded climbing hills, through roller-pad gates and mesh-connected tubes suspended many, many feet in the air.  (Did I mention Niksmom has a mild fear of heights? CONQUERED FOR MY SON!)  We even ventured to the tippy-tippy-top of the structure to brave the perils of the corkscrew slide.  (Sidebar:  I think Miss J lost a little skin on her elbows as Nik was a bit wiggly going down the corkscrew.) Nik had a blast!  He was mostly oblivious to the noise and had a wonderful time climbing, crawling, cruising wherever he could.  He seemed to know when he needed a break because he would either simply sit where he was when the moment hit, or he would take my hand and lead me away.  Fascinating! I had zero hopes of Nik eating anything at lunchtime.  He didn\u2019t have his \u201cspecial\u201d chair, his massager (to help him alert his mouth), etc.  The place was super crowded and noisy by the time we had lunch.  My champ ate a half a jar of food for me; not a lot but more than I expected. Yippee! We came home after lunch and Nik crashed HARD!  Slept like a log and was really difficult to wake from his nap.  I think he would have slept through dinner if I had let him!  The pillows over the head?  Nik\u2019s doing.  He does that when we bring him down from his crib and he isn\u2019t quite ready to be awake.  He buries himself under the pillows until nothing shows but a hand and a foot.  He cracks me up\u2026constantly! On a related note \u2014 we\u2019ve been watching lots of Mary Poppins lately; it\u2019s Nik\u2019s absolute favorite movie.  Tonight, as we were getting Nik ready for bed,  Niksdad and I both heard Nik \u201csinging\u201d part of \u201cIt\u2019s a Jolly Holiday with Mary\u201d \u2014 I kid you not!  What a ham!

{"date": "July 11, 2007 ", "body": " Jennifer from  Pinwheels  has bestowed upon me a great honor \u2014a  Blogger Reflection Award . The award \u201cshould make you reflect on five  bloggers  who have been an encouragement, a source of love, impacted you in some way, and have been a Godly example to you. Five  Bloggers  who when you reflect on them you get a sense of pride and joy\u2026 of knowing them and being blessed by them.\u201d Then: 1. Copy this post. 2. Reflect on five  bloggers  and write a least a paragraph about each one. 3. Make sure you link this post so others can read it and the rules. 4. Go leave your chosen  bloggers  a comment and let them know they\u2019 ve  been given the award. 5. Put the award icon on your site. To steal Jennifer\u2019s words (because she writes so eloquently that I want to weep sometimes\u2026and often do!) \u2014\u201dThese are my favorite sorts of blogging tags, because it\u2019s full of kindness and good will. \u201d I agree; blogs that make me feel deeply often make me think deeply as well. Without further ado, here are my choices\u2013five blogs that make me think and feel inspired: 1.  Life with Joey . Joey\u2019s mom has taught me lots in the short time I\u2019ve been blogging. She has a  groundedness  about her that is inspiring. Yet, she also has a strong sense of humor and is a fierce advocate for her sons \u2014both of them, not just her autistic son. Through her, I\u2019ve learned some practical tips, gained some new perspective, and realized I am not at all alone in this journey of parenting a child with special needs which include autism. 2.  From Here to There and Back . I\u2019ve tagged Kristen several times for many things. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m not sure how to describe it other than this: It feels like I have known her a very long time \u2014maybe from a past life (if you believe in that)? Not that we know lots about each other, more that our spirits have somehow connected. She always has words of wisdom and encouragement and manges to reach out to see how I am even when it sounds like she\u2019s in the midst of her own challenges. 3. Kristina at  Autism  Vox  has been an inspiration to me. Through her  archives  of posts about her amazing son Charlie, and now through her daily posts about all sorts of things relating to autism, she makes me think about things I might not otherwise even notice \u2014let alone actively consider how I feel or what I think. She has become my go-to link for quick sources of information about autism research, education, news, debate (of which there is always plenty!), and reflections on parenting children on the spectrum. I don\u2019t know how she manages to do it all, but I am very grateful she does. 4.  McEwen  at  Whitterer  on Autism  has been such a wonderful gift for me. She has her hands more than full with a houseful of kids, she straddles the line between Yank and Brit (with great translations for those of us who don\u2019t quite understand some of the terms she might use), and she does it all with the damnedest sense of humor. God, the woman should be doing stand-up comedy, I swear! Whenever I need a good laugh (and the occasional tear), I stop by her site for a cuppa. Seriously, she inspires me with her ability to maintain a sense of  absurdist  humor in the midst of what can be very stressful. It\u2019s a gift, a real gift. 5. Last, but definitely not least, is  Sweet/Salty Kate . I found her site through Jennifer ( Pinwheels ) and have been voraciously reading each and every post. I can relate to so much of what she writes. I don\u2019t really expect her to participate in this meme/award right now \u2014she\u2019s more than got her hands full right now. But I wanted to share her story and her incredible talent with all my readers. She is \u2014to me\u2014strength, dignity, and grace personified. Check her out; you won\u2019t be sorry. (Make sure you read some of the recent archives, too.) Thank you Jennifer, not only for tagging me and allowing me the chance to think about these  bloggers , and their gifts, but for the gift of your strength, wisdom, and heart.

{"date": "January 29, 2008 ", "body": "Apologies for the disjointed writing which follows; I am struggling to find words and string together coherent thoughts lately.  I seem to be suffering from sort of mental (emotional)  malaise  and am finding that I get easily distracted.  That is why I have been so  \u201cbloggy quiet\u201d  as  Kristen  wrote to me in a recent email. Nik\u2019s been ill  again .  It\u2019s nothing  mysterious or scary ; just the upper respiratory crud that\u2019s going around with a touch of stomach bug thrown in.  He\u2019s pretty much over it except for the super snotty nose which makes it hard to breathe and sleep at the same time.  Breathing seems to be winning lately. In spite of the illness, the tyrant, er um, I mean Nik has been ruling the house with an iron fist.  His adoration for  Mary Poppins ?  At an all-time high.  If I am within reach of his hands, they are grabbing mine and dragging me toward the TV to turn it on for him.  I think he now knows how to  SPELL  Mary Poppins.  God knows, if I say the name he starts squealing and dancing around like a \u2018tweener who just won Hannah Montana tickets from some radio show!  Did I say I was fond of Mary Poppins?   I may have been mistaken. When I won\u2019t give in to the MP obsession, Nik  insists  that I play.  Never mind the growing mountain of laundry, the cat hair clumps on the carpet, the breakfast dishes in the sink, or the fact that Mommy hasn\u2019t had a shower yet,  Doesn\u2019t matter to him.  I am getting stronger at telling him \u201cNo\u201d and sticking to it.  Even when it results in the world\u2019s  cutest  suck-up tactics.  Really, where  does  the boy learn these things?!  Nik will come over to the gate and look at me and start making kisses with his lips.  If he\u2019s really angling for my attention and cooperation, he will sometimes walk to the entertainment center, tug on the door, and say  \u201cMamamama\u201d  before he comes back to tug my hands again.  If that doesn\u2019t work, he goes for the triple play which includes his rendition of  \u201cIf you\u2019re happy and you know it\u2026\u201d  (lots of huh-huh\u2019s and ba-ba\u2019s with a few ga\u2019s thrown in for flourish) combined with the kisses and calling my name. Sigh, the boy is a  master manipulator , um, negotiator.  (Hey, it\u2019s a matter of semantics, right?) On the health front, Nik\u2019s  mysterious bouts of pain  have diminished quite a bit since we started treating them like  hypoglycemia .  We still deal with the nocturnal waking but not as consistently.  No word yet about scheduling his video EEG; we are entirely convinced his pain episodes are  not  related to seizures.  None the less, it will be good to have a clearer picture of his seizure activity, too. Nik is doing well with all his therapies; nothing really new and exciting to report yet, just slow and steady progress.   Consistency .  He did recently learn the concept of (and word for)  smell .  Now he loves it when I give him things to smell.  His favorites seem to be peppermint extract and one of his blankets fresh out of the dryer.  The kid\u2019s got good taste.   Of course, there is also the random smelling of his socks when he takes them off; he is  all  boy, for sure. Nik is also getting more adept at communicating \u2014or at least knowing for himself and  trying  to communicate to others \u2014when he needs a break.  Last week in OT, Miss D kept trying to get him to do something and he kept trying to get away and go into a room with the lights off.  Usually, Nik will do  anything  for Miss D but he wanted no part of even playing with a favored toy.  I wondered aloud if he was feeling like he needed a break.  God bless Miss D for listening and trusting; she let him go off on his own and, sure enough, he took a very short break in the darkened room and then came back out to play with her.  I\u2019ve noticed him doing more of this sort of thing lately when he has had multiple appointments back to back or been out to the store or the mall with Niksdad or me.  Where he used to simply fall apart, now he first tries to find some quiet space for himself.  Often it looks like dragging s few toys into his Thomas the Tank Engine tunnel for some quiet play, or hiding under his giant green bucket with his star stacker toy. Nik has also recently decided that  naps are for babies .  Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong, the kid goes down every afternoon after lunch; he just doesn\u2019t sleep anymore!  When I offer him a toy or a book he will take it and play quietly in his crib.  Sometimes he will simply sing little tunes to himself.  He has begun to push the limits, though.  The toys he has don\u2019t entertain him long enough and he wants to be up and about.  Yesterday, he cried and wailed in anger and frustration for a good 45 minutes before I finally got him up.  Today he is singing.  I suspect once he figures out that I am not coming to get him soon those songs will turn into protests. As I write all this it occurs to me that  what I am describing is a lot of age appropriate or developmentally appropriate behavior.   What a nice thing to realize!  We are definitely approaching a crossroads of a sort; though Nik has many, many delays and multiple challenges, he\u2019s doing very rapid catching up in  some  areas \u2014especially cognitively.  He\u2019s learning the  art  of manipulation, effective use of the  nuances  of resentment and anger, and the value of  judicious use  of self-injurious behavior.  Where once it was easy to distract Nik and redirect him from undesirable behavior, now he is set on what he wants and  will brook no opposition.   Sigh; he is in for a lifetime of heartache in that regard!  Niksdad and I are constantly re-evaluating our methods of dealing with some of the less than pleasant behaviors; we need to make sure we are setting expectations that are reasonable and attainable for Nik while also making certain that he does not inadvertently get rewarded for bad behavior which is within his actual control.  It\u2019s that last bit  \u201cwithin his actual control\u201d  which is difficult to determine sometimes. The pressure to interpret Nik\u2019s budding communication is also tremendous.  His voice, face, and body have all become much more expressive.  The range of communication \u2014that is to say, the variety of methods he uses \u2014is not so great but, those methods placed into context communicate so much.  Tomorrow there will be a lengthy evaluation to determine what, if any, augmentative/adaptive communication device might help Nik find more and better ways to communicate.  I am numb about it, frankly.  Having been through  so many evaluations and interventions  in Nik\u2019s short life \u2014going through cycles of hope and disappointment, anxiety and frustration, and finally feeling left adrift to figure things out on our own \u2014I am not certain anymore what I hope and expect from tomorrow\u2019s experience. I will try to write more about that after the appointment. So now my brain has turned left when I want it to turn right and Nik has begun the wails of protest.  Sigh\u2026small measures of quiet are so hard to find some days.

{"date": "January 26, 2008 ", "body": "You  know  it\u2019s not a good sign when your child has had more sleep than you.\n \n \n \n Lulled into a false complacency about leaving him unattended long enough to go upstairs to finally get dressed, I peek in on Nik who is happily watching  Mary Poppins  and clearing out the toys from the play room.\n There, I\u2019ve finally acknowledged it \u2014 the family room is no longer ; it has been overrun by a deceptively small, sweet-faced, impish dictator. Nothing is sacred in that room . All objects not currently in the rotation of favored playthings get summarily tossed over the gate in to the back hall. This includes every single pillow. I swear, if the kid could heft the sofa cushions over the gate those would be history as well! \n In a moment of mingled courage, naivete, and stupidity, I dash upstairs to shinny into my jeans and pull on a sweatshirt; no time for glamour while there\u2019s a curious little boy on the loose.  But, really,  I think to myself,  once he\u2019s cleared out the room, what could he possibly get into?  I take the extra minute or two to select a pair of socks and grab my sneakers to put on while I sit at my computer and pull my email. \n The skin on the back of my neck begins to tingle; my mommy-sense is picking up on an unfamiliar vibe.  It\u2019s too quiet.  I look over the railing from my office space in the loft. My heart kicks into overdrive as I race down the stairs. \n Nikolas has staged a  coup  upon my sanity and forever shattered my already fragile sense of peace. I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry; I do neither. Instead, I do what every self respecting mother of a child teetering on the brink of dumbfoundingly cute danger \u2014mild, but danger none the less\u2014would do;  I grab my camera. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  ETA:   This is a re-enactment.

{"date": "January 30, 2008 ", "body": "Well, in a continuation of  Kristen\u2019s  reference to a  perfect storm , I must say that  today\u2019s evaluation  was  absolutely   incredible . I am practically bursting with hope and joy and good feelings. And you know what? It feels  good ! It must be contagious! I know, I know, it\u2019s the whole  karmic  cycle, the  you-get-back-what-you-put-out-to-the-universe  kind of stuff but\u2026REALLY! I am not sure if the car was actually running as we drove home; for all I know we could have been flying I felt that good! The evaluators really  got  Nik \u2014and he was gracious enough to let them. In an hour and a half, this team of two people was able to discern more about my child\u2019s personality, his intellect, and his communication abilities than an  entire  school full of therapists, educators, and psychologists was able to over the course of fifteen months! That said, I must also acknowledge that both Nik\u2019s OT (Miss D) and SLP (Miss M) contributed greatly to the process; Miss M accompanied us this morning and Miss D talked to the staff OT yesterday to provide her input. I also have to take a great deal of credit because I made  damned  sure that this was not going to be another \u201cwasted opportunity.\u201d I provided tons of information, insights, and feedback. I set up our morning so that Nik had opportunities to settle in a bit. I went in with no specific expectations \u2014 willing for once to let the process take us where it would. And, oh, what a wonderful ride! In the end, we came away with some concrete recommendations for a couple of basic devices and \u2014even better \u2014how to actually use them. Not just  \u201cPush this button to record \u2026\u201d  but how to actually  implement  them as a fundamental part of Nik\u2019s daily routines; we are just beginning the administrative process to actually get them. Perhaps most importantly, I came away with the absolute knowledge \u2014 firmly rooted in my gut now , instead of just in my conscious, rational mind \u2014that the decisions Niksdad and I agonized over all those months have paid off. Richly. What the team saw in Nik this morning would not have been possible even three or four months ago. I cannot fault the school for not wanting to see these things in my son, but I do blame them for their unwillingness to provide the environment he needed to make the gains I always knew were possible; I think they simply didn\u2019t know how and would not admit it. DL, the assistive technology  guru  was all that I had heard he was \u2014 and more.  Or is it less? This very physically imposing man was the gentlest of giants with Nik; after a very momentary meltdown (on Nik\u2019s part, not DL\u2019s) there was an instant  connection . DL engaged Nik in a way that simply captivated all of us. Nik gave his attention in brief intervals with an  intensity  I am seeing more and more lately. It is an awesome thing to witness in my child. I wonder if this is sort of like what  Drama Mama  was describing in  this post  today. In any event, DL was masterful in the most understated and reassuring way. Watching him in action with Nik was a gift. During the course of the evaluation we watched Nik do things he\u2019s never done before. I don\u2019t know if he felt the good vibes and knew it was safe to fully reveal himself but it was remarkable. Sure, he sorted some cups by size and then by color (yay! those sorting and classifying skills are finally kicking in!), but Nik came to me seeking comfort and reassurance \u2014not something he really does even in the throes of his worst episodes \u2014and he accepted it. He complied when the OT asked him to come back to sit down with her. He initiated play with DL and then responded with appropriate frustration when DL wouldn\u2019t let him do something he wanted to do. DL commented to me,  \u201cit\u2019s very obvious Nik fully understands physical cause and effect but he also clearly understands social cause and effect.\u201d  I was floored. How could this man be so incredibly insightful about my \u201cchallenging child\u201d (what he used to be called by some of the staff at his school)? And when did my son suddenly catch on to this whole social cause and effect thing?  Clearly  I  wasn\u2019t looking when it happened! I imagine that \u2014 much like life in general \u2014everything is a matter of perspective. DL is trained to see all actions and reactions as communication; in his eyes, Nik was communicating loud and clear. The objective, he says, is to help Nik find ways to organize those communications and to learn that there is a dance of give and take.

{"date": "March 21, 2008 ", "body": "Nik\u2019s fever spiked around seven this morning to 103.8F and he was  cranky and beyond lethargic.  In fact, he went back to sleep after a very quick snack (via tube, mostly to make sure he got his seizure meds on time) and slept straight through until Niksdad got him to the pediatrician at ten-thirty. The verdict? Another ear infection.  This one seems to be different; he\u2019s never had a fever like this unless he\u2019s been  really ill . It may have something to do with the fact that he also had his g-tube changed yesterday afternoon; always a traumatic experience for Nik, this time was worse because of a large buildup of granulation tissue inside his stomach. (Imagine that scene in  Alien \u2026and you might have an idea of what that tube change felt like for Nik.) Again, not a typical reaction for Nik when his tube gets changed, either. But he  was  pretty sore and his body may have mounted an  inflammatory response  (which can include fever) to both the tummy trauma and his ear infection. Whatever \u2014it  wasn\u2019t  fun in the early morning hours today. So here we are on his  third  antibiotic in roughly a month after rapidly eliminating the ones he can still tolerate with  \u201cnormal\u201d  or expected side effects (those which don\u2019t involve rashes, open sores, or vomiting). Oy. But the Tylenol and several hours of sleep seem to be helping a bit. Nik\u2019s fever is down under 101F and he is quietly playing for the first time all day. Here\u2019s what  that  looks like: Can you say  \u201cWho drained the Energizer Bunny\u2019s batteries??\u201d  I imagine he will be back to his rascally self in a day or two. Meanwhile?

{"date": "March 27, 2008 ", "body": "\n Well, I  think  we\u2019ve shaken off most of the  Easter Flu  around here. Nik seems to be pretty well on the mend \u2014as evidenced by an awesome play date with Daddy at the park yesterday afternoon and the return of his happy-go-lucky demeanor today. I am mostly better though still trying to shake off the cough that doesn\u2019t want to quit.\n Meanwhile, as I am sure most can relate to, we\u2019ve been in the \u201cinterruption of all things normal\u201d mode commonly referred to as Spring Break. Niksdad has been on break from nursing school all week and we\u2019ve been juggling projects, appointments, time at the gym, etc. It\u2019s been really tough to find any time to simply sit and reflect on all that is going on in our lives. Writing about it has been a distant vision at best! And, well, my energy level just hasn\u2019t been what it normally is. \n As I mentioned in  another post , Niksdad and I started the South Beach Diet (SBD) just about a week and a half ago. When we did it a few years ago, while Nik was still in the hospital, it seemed  really easy  and we both did very well.  This time?  Absolute torture for me. In the intervening years I have developed multiple food sensitivities to many of the same foods which once sustained us during the diet \u2014soy, nuts, cheese \u2014and I have struggled trying to find enough things that I could eat and not feel completely deprived and run down. \n To make a long story short, I had a conversation with my fitness trainer \u2014no, it\u2019s not as glamorous as it sounds and I don\u2019t see him all that often! We talked about South Beach and my struggles and how utterly run down I\u2019ve been feeling \u2014even before the flu struck. He thinks I\u2019m not getting enough balanced nutrition and that my body is actually slowing down my metabolism in an effort to conserve resources. It made sense to me as I have felt utterly spacey and just lethargic as hell.  Seriously , I\u2019ve had to read nearly everything two and three times just to make sure I understand it. I read blogs and am too spacey to write a comment because the effort of reading it is too taxing; I mark items to return to later with a comment and find I cannot recall what I read \u2014let alone what I thought I wanted to say. \n The effort of doing more than passive blogging, television watching, or mindless web surfing has been too much. Never mind the picture cards and scripts I need to create for Nik\u2019s communication devices, the meals I need to prepare, the house I need to clean, etcetera.  It\u2019s all just been too much. Until today. \n After I spoke with my trainer yesterday morning, I decided that I was  done  with SBD and was going to eat whatever I want. The catch is that I have to record it and keep track in one of the nutrition/fitness resources I have. And that\u2019s exactly what I have done since yesterday. I feel like I am slowly emerging from a deep shroud of fog \u2014 but I am emerging! When I\u2019m back \u2014maybe this weekend, remind me to tell you about how much Nik\u2019s grown, what he\u2019s doing that is cracking me up and making me teary, and some other interesting stuff that I managed to do in a few lucid hours early this week!

I am sure I  must  have at some point in one of my high school or college English courses \u2014when it would have been more of an exercise in \u201cgetting it done\u201d than in saying something in a potentially moving and meaningful way. But I don\u2019t remember it at all. As I get older, I find that I enjoy poetry more and more.

But, I ramble. For some odd reason, after putting Nik down for a nap \u2014in which he actually is sleeping \u2014I felt drawn to write haiku. The first few were pretty pedestrian and have been scuttled. Once I started though, the words seemed to flow forth of their own volition. Some verses have deeply personal meaning to me while others \u2014well, they just came out and I don\u2019t know why. I found the writing almost meditative.

{"date": "February 25, 2008 ", "body": "Hospital screw up No room there for Nik Have to reschedule Well, this day just didn\u2019t turn out a thing like I expected; that\u2019s both a good thing and a bad thing. It started off at  1:30 this morning  when I was up being ill from something I ate last night. Well, that and quite possibly a bit of anxiety \u2014which is actually not typical for me, but this EEG trip had me pretty wound up. Still not feeling great, I spent the rest of the night sleeping sitting up in bed. Highly relaxing \u2014 not . Nik woke in a wonderful mood and laughed and giggled his way through our morning routine and all the way up to and including PT with Miss T. It was during OT that he fell apart. Usually Nik is all smiles and love for Miss D but today he just didn\u2019t want to do  anything  she wanted him to do. It didn\u2019t\u2019 help that Miss N, the intern from the local community college who has been working with Nik for the past several weeks, was doing her video interview and treatment today for her class presentation tomorrow. Not that it was a problem but that Nik  knew  something was different \u2014maybe he sensed the pace was slightly disjointed \u2014and he wanted no part of it. The interview portion was really interesting for me. Miss N asked me all kinds of questions about what life with Nik was like at home, what challenges do we or did we face with school , what changes did we see in Nik as a result of the therapies, etc. It was a great opportunity for me to really look at my child with a slightly different perspective. Not just Nik,  my miracle child , but more as a representative at large of children with disabilities. I had to consider carefully what I wanted the students in Miss N\u2019s class to take away from her presentation; what did I want Miss N to take away from her personal experience with Nik. I talked about the need to  always presume competence  no matter what the test scores may indicate. I specifically talked about our experiences with Nik and testing and why he scores so low on standardized testing methods. I talked about the erroneous assumption that educators and service providers often make in thinking that because a child cannot speak or write that they cannot either understand what is being communicated to them and have nothing to communicate. I shared some of the personal discoveries I have made about Nik \u2014and because of Nik\u2014 and how much he has to \u201csay\u201d if I am willing to take the time to learn how to \u201chear\u201d him. We talked about the need for sensory processing to be thoroughly addressed, especially with children who have spent long periods of time in the hospital. I touched on the importance of re-training or re-awakening neural pathways that either didn\u2019t develop or were somehow interrupted with medical interventions or illness or plain neurological differences. I hope I didn\u2019t overwhelm poor Miss N. When Nik was born, Niksdad and I decided the experience could either make us or break us; we  chose  to become stronger. It has not always been the easy path to walk, I can assure you. But when I realize the opportunities we now have to help influence the training of future therapists, educators, and medical professionals, it makes it worthwhile. Not that being Nik\u2019s parents isn\u2019t worthwhile! But knowing that we can use our experiences and insights to help other children, other families \u2014well, that was just part of the unspoken mutual agreement we made years ago. So here we are at 10:30 in the morning and we\u2019ve just rocked Miss N\u2019s world. Let us proceed with the rest of the busy day. Just enough time to head home and play for a bit before lunch \u2014the usual ninety minute affair of tube feeding, oral food play, and then sitting upright for about twenty minutes to keep Nik\u2019s reflux at bay. After that, Nik slipped into his  backward jammies  for a short one hour of quiet play. (The jammies are for inhibiting hands in his pants \u2014particularly  messy  if there\u2019s a BM involved!) Then, back into clothes and out the door for our very first adapted swim class! This one was a real crap shoot since Nik can either love or hate the pool depending on the day, the planetary alignment, etc. Today was somewhere in the middle, I think. The teacher, Mr. Tim, is a very nice young man; Nik took to him right away. There was only one other child there today; there are a total of three boys including Nik. All three are autistic and all have varying characteristics and strengths. Nik is half the age of the other boys and is not quite ready to keep up with them. He is also the only nonverbal one of the group. After a few minutes of observing Nik and his shifting level of comfort in the water \u2014as compared to the other boy\u2019s ability to paddle around and jump by himself into the water\u2014 Mr. Tim and I agreed that Nik really needed to be in a toddler-oriented class. Since Nik\u2019s schedule of therapies precludes us from taking the regularly offered class \u2014and I\u2019m not sure how much he would get out of that particular group setting just now\u2014 Mr. Tim is going to work with him  one on one  for half an hour every Monday afternoon. I think that will work out very well for Nik; he loves the water and it really gives him some wonderful sensory input that helps him self-regulate so well. So, now Nik\u2019s week includes  feeding therapy  on two days,  PT and OT  one day (but getting ready to request a second day),  speech therapy ,  play group , and now swimming. Whew! When I write it all out it seems like too much, but I know we break it up into manageable chunks. And I also know the steady,  consistent progress  I\u2019ve seen in Nik over the past six months. I just cannot imagine we would be where we are today if we hadn\u2019t taken him  out of   school . So, by now you must be wondering what the hell happened with the EEG, yes? I\u2019ll spare you the story of how I found out that it wasn\u2019t going to happen tomorrow \u2014it\u2019s long and frustrating and involves crossed signals, dropped balls, and one very frustrated mother. Suffice to say, the hospital has only one room in which the video EEG\u2019s are done. That same room serves as a regular patient room when necessary. Apparently, it\u2019s necessary right now. In fact, the woman I spoke with late this afternoon told me that they had been canceling or postponing many video EEG studies lately because the hospital was so full. And while I can appreciate the need for postponing, t sure would have been nice if someone had planned on telling me before I showed up on their doorstep tomorrow with a rambunctious four year old and a carload of stuff! The silver lining in this dark cloud has been the stellar performance of our  new neurologist  and his staff. When I left an \u201curgent\u201d voicemail for Dr. G\u2019s assistant at 4:45pm telling her the hospital didn\u2019t have us on the schedule for tomorrow, she not only called me right back and helped me formulate a plan, she also asked me how Nik was doing \u2014and then really listened when I told her. She must have pulled his chart and gone right to the doctor because not fifteen minutes later Dr. G himself called me. Now you may recall that our last neuro, reputed to be the most brilliant one in the whole state, never bothered to return phone calls or provide written reports unless absolutely hounded to death. Dr. G and I discussed a back up plan \u2014involving an ambulatory EEG (24 hours done at home) if the hospital could not accommodate us within two to three weeks. He also looked at Nik\u2019s most recent blood work and told me that his Depakene level was actually low and we increased it to see if that will help a bit. But most importantly, he responded appropriately; he acknowledged the problem (which is actually out of his hands as he is not on staff at the hospital we were going to), he came up with solutions, and he took personal interest in the outcome. I love this doctor. So, here I sit tonight, with my head spinning from the whirlwind of activities and information; it sure feels like it\u2019s been a long year, er um, day.

{"date": "February 29, 2008 ", "body": "There\u2019s something talkin\u2019 in the wind Whispering through the trees That feeling in my bones again Just puts me right at ease It takes me back to all the times I\u2019 ve been here before But crossroads, old familiar signs Tell me there\u2019s something more (A Change In the Air ~ Clint Black) There does seem to be the scent of change in the air lately. As I wrote in this  poem , it feels like spring is  finally  coming after a long, dark winter. I don\u2019t just mean this particular season; I mean a winter of the spirit, of the soul. It feels as though we are on the cusp of some  big breakthroughs  in many areas with Nik. Since we decided to take him out of school this past autumn (you can read the saga  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here , and  here ), he\u2019s made such remarkable progress  in all the ways which inspire hope and joy in my heart . No, Nik is not yet potty trained or eating by mouth; he still has a way to go in those particular areas. But he has made such great strides in connecting with and integrating his environment, connecting on a deeper, more intimate level with so many people \u2014and differentiating between us all. The bonds between both Nik and his dad and Nik and me, have become so strong that we are no longer peripheral to his daily activities \u2014no longer merely the people shuttling him back and forth to appointments, changing him, feeding him, picking up after him;  we\u2019ve become central figures  \u2014the ones he wants to play with, to dine with, to hang out with. The ones he misses when we are gone from his side for more than an hour or two. The joy in his little face when he hears my voice when I come home from the gym. The gleeful way in which he drops everything and races to the gate when Daddy comes home from school or work; the squeals of delight when he sees his coat and knows he is going  \u201cZoom-Zoom\u201d  \u2014off on an adventure with one or both of us. The deep, crinkly-eyed laughter we share as he looks into my eyes when I tickle him or dance with him, or teach him how to flip backward off my lap to do a standing somersault. The  connection  goes so deep, the current runs  so strong and true  that it makes me weepy nearly every time;  we\u2019ve waited so, so long for this connection . It feels fresh and new and exciting every day. Nik has come light years in a few short months in the way he communicates and cooperates, as well. Nik has progressed from completely ignoring our requests such as \u201c Hand me the red square\u201d  when we are playing with his shape sorter, for example, to not only complying roughly seventy-five percent of the time but to also no longer simply throwing his toy over the gate when he is finished with it. Now, he will bring the toy to the gate and, if one of us is in view, he will babble or make some sort of noise to get our attention and then  hand  us the toy. I realized just yesterday, as I watched him try and fail a few times to get one of the pillows from the sofa over the gate, that Nik\u2019s tolerance for frustration is increasing; he\u2019s developing more of a determination to persevere. He still gets upset when certain things don\u2019t cooperate with him, but \u2014by and large\u2014 it seems that he makes so many more attempts at things before he falls apart if he cannot do it. He is more easily calmed down in the aftermath, as well. If I see he\u2019s very frustrated with something, I\u2019ll let him have a bit of a tantrum over it and then I\u2019ll come into the room and simply say,  \u201cWhat is it, buddy? Can you show Mommy what you want?\u201d  Usually, he then engages with me to  help him problem solve ; I am trying very hard to not simply do things for him any more. Nik has more than proven he is perfectly capable of figuring things out, but sometimes he just needs a little reassurance that he can, in fact, do it. Not terribly different from any other four-year old, I imagine? I am very excited about getting Nik\u2019s communication devices; I haven\u2019t written much about that because I didn\u2019t have any idea how long it would take or what to expect. We are completing the paper work to order the devices recommended during his  AAC evaluation  at the end of January. In the meantime, though, I just found out today that the local branch of our statewide assistive technology initiative ( DATI ) has both devices available for us to borrow for up to two weeks at a time. If no one else is waiting for them, we may be able to renew them for an additional two weeks which should nearly cover the processing time for Nik\u2019s own devices. I\u2019ll tell you more about the devices and how we can use them in another post a little later. In the aftermath of  the EEG fiasco  earlier this week, our  fabulous new neurologist  has made arrangements for Nik to have an ambulatory EEG done locally \u2014 this coming Wednesday!  We are hoping that the results will give us some more information about Nik\u2019s  odd, recurring pains . I truly don\u2019t think they are seizures but it will be good to have the results to rule it out. Dr. G recently increased one of Nik\u2019s seizure meds \u2014and we\u2019re seeing some positive changes, thus far. The increased dose does tend to make Nik a bit drowsier \u2014though you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell during the day! If you didn\u2019t know Nik and watched him play during the day, you\u2019d think he was a fairly energetic boy; I can see that he is a bit less frenetic and is able to focus on one thing at a time for longer periods. He also takes slightly more quiet breaks and will lay down to play with a toy for a few minutes before he jumps back into the fray. Where I really see a change is that  he is napping again  \u2014up to two hours at a clip, if I let him! And it doesn\u2019t seem to interfere with his ability to fall asleep at bedtime. Nik is averaging about ten to eleven hours a night; I wish I could say he is  consistently  sleeping through the night \u2014but I am hopeful that he will again! The best part though is that both Niksdad and I think we are seeing  much less seizure activity  since the increase. It\u2019s only been four days so far, but it\u2019s a good sign. And, of course \u2014 as you saw earlier this week \u2014 the eating is progressing  very  well. Now, mind you, we\u2019re nowhere near even being able to count the calories in what Nik is eating and even farther away from thinking about losing the feeding tube. But, the progress Nik has made in the last couple of months is unbelievable. It\u2019s as if he is constantly challenging himself to try something new. The key, I think, has been in  recognizing and honoring his need for autonomy ; Nik wants to feed himself \u2014which is right in line with his extremely strong spirit of self-determination! It seems that, as long as Nik has his own utensil \u2014and, lately, his own bowl \u2014and can have some measure of control over eating, he is a willing participant. I might even venture to call him a  joyful  participant. He still struggles with large quantities of more than a half-teaspoon at a time, or with chunks larger than a grain of rice; he hasn\u2019t quite figured out the whole chewing mechanism but we think he is on the way. Where, a year ago Niksdad and I were running on the faintest  vapors  of hope that Nik would ever eat by mouth again, we are now both excited and enthusiastic. Mealtimes are wonderful family times again. Many would say that our life goes at an insane pace \u2014and I suppose they would be right. Between Niksdad\u2019s nursing school, nursing clinicals, and work and  Nik\u2019s multitude of therapies , playgroup, and swimming \u2014with the very frequent doctors\u2019 appointments thrown in for good measure\u2014 and my renewed  attempts  to get in regular work outs at the gym and  maybe  even a date with Niksdad every once in a while, I guess it is rather frenetic. But it feels like the pace of a family finally hitting its stride after so many stumbles and false starts; like we\u2019re actually gaining some ground right now. And that\u2019s a pleasant change, indeed.

{"date": "November 13, 2007 ", "body": "Having found some highly useful information about  Intracranial Hypertension , I truly wonder if this is what has been bothering Nik. I don\u2019t know if this  is  what Nik is suffering from but it sure seems to fit; it puts his sometimes  extreme   symptoms into a context which is understandable. Whether he has  ICH , and if so what the root cause may be, remains to be determined. For now, though, this is the framework within which we are operating; it helps us to try to manage the frightening episodes better. Well, okay, for the most part. Nik seems to be learning to listen to his body lately as he struggles \u2014as we all struggle \u2014to deal with this mysterious ailment which sneaks up on him. It seems that as he moves around and is extremely active,  minutes  later he is felled by the most extreme pain. When he plays quietly, either sitting or lying down, the pain seems so much less debilitating and the episodes are slightly farther apart. I think Nik \u2014who is a very,  very  smart child \u2014is figuring out this strange dynamic all on his own. Sometimes he remembers too late that his active climbing, spinning and crawling bring on the panic-filled episodes. Other times, he seems to know instinctively that he needs to lay low.\n \n I greedily reap whatever benefits I can of this new found, tenuous understanding of his. Let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s  something  to be said for a child who is normally quite active \u2014and, therefore, too busy for snuggling and expressions of need or affection\u2014 suddenly feeling so poorly that he stops. And snuggles. And kisses. \n \n And brings his favorite book with him as he nestles into the soft fullness of my lap.  \n  Nik\u2019s not much of a bookish child; he prefers to do his learning in a hands-on, full-body experiential fashion. Yet, somehow  this book  has captured his fancy since it was first gifted to him nearly two years ago by Miss Eleanor, his OT through Easter Seals. I don\u2019t know if it is the sound of the clicking crickets as he presses them that captivates him so and causes him to giggle with glee. Or maybe the large, softly shaded pictures which are easy to see. Or the feel of the thick board pages between his little fingers as he turns them. There is simply something  magical  about this book.  \n I put it away for safekeeping and bring it out from time to time when we need some quiet play. Each time he sees it completely anew. His eyes dance and he claps his hands with delight. Usually he will grab it from my hands and settle onto the floor to immerse himself in the world of Little Cricket \u2014just the two of them\u2014 with Cricket\u2019s mother and all their woodland friends.\n Today is different. Nik\u2019s slender fingers grasp the book and tug it from my hands but he doesn\u2019t settle alone on the floor. Quietly, as quietly as the little mouse in the story book, Nik slips into my lap, dragging his beloved book with him. He turns to look at me with that little laughing twinkle in his eye; my heart swells every time I see that look. I kiss his forehead as his tousled head lolls back against my breasts. Smiling into his hair, I feel little hands reaching to hold mine, guiding me to turn the pages as he squirms and clicks the noisy crickets. \n \n My breath hitches in my throat as I begin to read.

{"date": "November 14, 2007 ", "body": "Finally!  There is some forward momentum toward  diagnosing  Nik\u2019s mystery ailment . It seems to have an awful lot of the hallmarks of  Intracranial Hypertension  and yet there is also still the disturbing  immunological component  which has waxed and waned for more than a year now. The chronic, low-grade fevers and mild infections, the low immunoglobulin followed by the \u201crobust\u201d response to immunizations (as tested by various blood work for antibodies). The ear and head pain, the eye discomfort, the constant swollen glands without any active infection. The constant nocturnal awakenings and  episodes of excruciating pain  \u2014where once Nik slept peacefully, painlessly for ten to twelve hours a night without fail. You can understand why we might be a  tad  tired and frustrated, anxious and ambivalently hopeful about finding an easy or simple answer.  Nothing  about  my son  has ever been \u201croutine\u201d or straightforward. Call me jaded but I don\u2019t expect that\u2019s about to change any time soon. This is why I have such mixed feelings about the MRI now scheduled for Friday morning. Yes, as in the day after tomorrow. (Have I mentioned lately how much I  appreciate   Dr. Ma ry? She called in some favors to make this happen so fast!)  Either  way it turns out, it\u2019s not good. Stay with me for a minute, here\u2026 If there is a mass or lesion or some other visible anomaly in, on, or near Nik\u2019s brain that\u2019s  clearly  not a desirable thing at all. In fact, that\u2019s got to be one of the most terrifying things for me to think about. Yet, the alternative \u2014the idea that there is  no visible, discernible cause  for all his excruciating and unpredictable pain? I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s any better. The need to find answers juxtaposed with the need to find \u201cnormal.\u201d It just isn\u2019t reconciling in my poor brain. Is this some sort of cruel cosmic hoax? WTF?

If I thought I felt lost before, this is a thousand times worse. What would  you  wish for if you were me? Ok, besides normal MRI results and the complete cessation of any and all of Nik\u2019s mysterious and debilitating pain?  I only wish my questions weren\u2019t rhetorical or my dilemma hypothetical. Keep on praying , please? For  what  I can\u2019t say \u2014the best possible outcome, I guess. Whatever it looks like.

That is one of the dualities of the internet \u2014the freedom to reveal maybe more than I might normally reveal to my in-person acquaintances yet all the while retaining the personal boundaries of physical space and emotional proximity. The flip side of that same duality is that I don\u2019t have the daily consistency of communication which I would have with close, intimate friends. Where those same friends and acquaintances may see  more  than I would sometimes wish, you \u2014my faithful (or sometimes) readers \u2014 only get to see the bits I choose to share. It goes without saying and yet, today, I feel compelled to say it anyway. Recent events which I have written about  here  (and  here , and  here ) compel me to write a disclaimer of sorts. I have not written anything that is false or deliberately misleading but I have not written the  whole story  of what we are dealing with on a day to day basis. Instead, I have shone a spotlight of sorts on specific elements. These are the elements which, at the time of my writing them, were (are) the most salient to me. The most emotionally charged or intellectually weighty \u2014 in that moment. \n It is  absolutely  true that Nik is dealing with some sort of  extreme pain complex  or syndrome, and that we are looking ahead to  tomorrow\u2019s MRI  with some mixed emotions. Those things are very present in my mind each moment of the day. But I try not to let them  consume  my every waking thought and deed. I have moments of feeling desperate and expressing those sentiments but I am not so desperate that I cannot find the  moments of joy   in each day , the personal growth and learning (which sometimes come in unexpected moments), and always there are moments which pull me back to my \u201ctrue north\u201d of faith, hope, and belief. \n Often, those moments are either too intensely personal to share with anyone or the significance of them eludes me. Sometimes, the moments happen so quickly and I think about sharing them,  I really do ; but by the time I have an opportunity to write about them, the intangible thing which made the moment so incredibly special is gone and cannot be recaptured. Sort of like telling a funny story to a group of friends and no one laughs; it\u2019s that elusive sort of  \u201cI guess you had to be there\u201d  moment. Like the fleeting glimpses one may have of a deer in the forest, a rainbow during a sun-shower, or the perfect few moments of dappled sunlight that skilled photographers will sit hours waiting to capture. Some of those moments I am able to capture and convey. Others simply happen and I keep moving. But always, there is motion and balance, emotion and thought which happen so dynamically that the tide simply carries me onward to the next large rock to which I cling and catch my breath. The rocks, the tips of the islands in the fast-moving stream \u2014that is what you see as I regroup and recalibrate.    Those moments are not the sum of who I am and what I experience. I assume the same when I am reading someone else\u2019s words. Like those  dreadful  tests and evaluations our children are subject to, they are but snapshots \u2014snippets of life frozen in time. But they are never the full story. That, my friends, is a long, long way from being written for any of us.

I don\u2019t know that I would have picked it up if it weren\u2019t for  Jennifer  as it\u2019s not necessarily the genre I am drawn to. But I feel such admiration and affection for her and her three beautiful boys and have such a strong sense of  knowing  her that I wanted to get a sense of Tom \u2014beyond the little bit Jennifer has written on  her blog. So far, I am enthralled. I\u2019ll tell you more after I\u2019ve finished.

{"date": "November 17, 2007 ", "body": "I know there is no such thing as true objectivity; our individual upbringing, choices, and circumstances forms who we are and how we interpret things. My experience of a shared event will not be the same as that of anyone else. For this I am grateful. I just finished reading  Tom Groneberg\u2019s   One Good Horse . I wish I could tell you I thought it was a \u201crousing read\u201d or some equally snappy, sound-bitey quote. I can\u2019t. I loved it. And I hated it for some of the thoughts and feelings it evoked in me. The notes on the inside cover of the book says,  \u201cAt its heart, One Good Horse is about the power of hope, the simple story of a horse and the way people connect with nature and with each other across generations.\u201d  Not entirely so for me. That is not to say that the book is not about any of those things; it absolutely is \u2014 and so very much more. Perhaps it is my perspective as a mother of a child with multiple special needs which makes me see this book as something so much deeper and richer than just the \u201csimple story of a horse.\u201d As I read Tom\u2019s story, knowing full well how some of it turns out, I saw the storyline about the horse as simple a metaphor for his struggle to regain his own footing in the wake of several job disappointments and the birth of his two youngest sons. To me Tom  was  Blue, the colt, perhaps feeling a bit tattered and slightly abused or neglected by life until this thing called family \u2014specifically in the form of an expanding family with exceptional needs and circumstances \u2014claim him as theirs. As Tom takes baby steps with the care and nurturing of Blue, so too does he take the same baby steps in accepting the yoke of fatherhood in a different and unexpected way than he ever envisioned for himself. But the story Tom tells, interwoven with that of an old cowboy named Teddy \u201cBlue\u201d, evoked such powerful, sometimes  visceral  responses for me. I am still sorting it out, trying to untangle the threads which are mine and yet not mine. Tom\u2019s words gave me much to think about in terms of my own husband. The feelings of failure, the fears and hopes, the need to feel like a hero somewhere in his own life and for his family \u2014 did my husband feel those things upon the birth of our special child, the loss of his job, our move back east?  Does he feel them still as he struggles to balance the load of work and school and family? Does he feel, as Tom expressed so poignantly, the worry that his family doesn\u2019t get enough of him? The fact that I \u201cknow\u201d Tom through the writings of his wife,  Jennifer , and that I know his boys the same way made it even more difficult for me to read his recounting of the day \u2014and the way\u2014 the twins were born. His account of learning of Avery\u2019s diagnosis of Down Syndrome and his efforts to learn what to do for his son \u2014all of it made me sob with grief. Not for Avery \u2014for Tom.  And for my husband.  In those moments I could see the vulnerable uncertainty he must feel as he watches his son going through the challenges of living in this world and wondering what he can do to ease the way, to teach him what he will need to know. Discovering the lessons to be learned  from  his son along the way. As I read, I could see the faces of the Graf Groneberg family as if I were watching a movie. Imagining the beautiful smiling image I have of  Jennifer  (from the gorgeous photo on her  blog ) contorted with grief and fear was unnerving and disturbing. Though I know how things turned out, in the moment of my reading it was as if I were watching \u2014through a thick hazy window \u2014a dear friend struggle and not knowing what to say or do, not being able to reach through to comfort her. It gave me pause to wonder if that is what it felt like for many of my old friends \u2014the ones long gone since shortly after Nik was born. Did they, too, feel the helpless grief, the burning ache of tears in their throats as they watched from the sidelines, uncertain what to say or do? Did they feel unable to reach me and in their own grief turn away from the pain of not being able to fix it? So, if you were to ask me what I though of Tom\u2019s book I would have to tell you it was difficult for me. The overall book is  so much richer  than I ever imagined it would be and yet so painfully raw in parts that I had to put it down and walk away. I cannot say the book has a happy ending \u2014the story is far from being over. But this particular chapter, if you will, left me with a sense of peace and acceptance. And of hope not just for Tom and his family, but for my own. And for the fathers of children like Nik and like Avery who struggle to find their way in the already murky waters of parenthood. If you haven\u2019t already, read this book.

Oh, wait, that\u2019s my  cat  that does the latter\u2026 Suffice to say, the stress of recent weeks (What? You\u2019ve missed it? Read  this ,  this ,  this , or  this ) has finally caught up with my poor,  sleep-deprived  body. Today I have a sore throat (feels more like a sinus-y kind of sore throat), hacking cough from post nasal drip, and a low-grade fever. Not enough to allow me the luxury of  \u201ccalling in dead\u201d  to my day job (SAHM!), but enough to really miss the days when I could park Nik in a playpen and give him a few toys and a teether! Oy. I did drag my butt along to Nik\u2019s feeding therapy this morning. That is going so incredibly well \u2014but that\u2019s a post for another, more coherent-thinking time. We\u2019re going to try to switch back to Miss M for Nik\u2019s speech therapy, too. Again, a post for another time. There\u2019s  some  forward motion in our  quest for answers  to Nik\u2019s  episodic pain ; we have an appointment with one of the docs on the  diagnostic team  on December 20th. They did offer an earlier appointment but I wanted to make sure Niksdad was able to go with me. So, until next month, we are going to have to sit tight and be generous with the Advil and/or Tylenol cocktails. Ugh. Of course, Nik\u2019s dance card is  pretty full  up until then anyway with a sedated hearing test (auditory brainstem response, ABR), the cerebral palsy clinic, his  four year old check-up , the cardiologist, the pulmonologist, and his various therapies. (Oy, no wonder I\u2019m sick.) Meanwhile, Nik\u2019s started with a bit of a runny nose today; funny thing is that the pain episodes seem to  decrease  when he\u2019s draining. Yet  all  the diagnostic tests show no sign of anything going on in his sinuses or ears. ARGH. So, hmmm, do I hope he continues to have a runny nose and no pain or stays healthy except for the pain? Yeah,  I know \u2026I\u2019m stocking up on tissues tomorrow and keeping my fingers crossed! I have lots of things on my mind that I want to share \u2014most of it really good stuff \u2014but my brain is so fried. I blame it on the cold medication! One of these days I\u2019ll get around to posting about the speech and feeding situation, our search for autism education support in a non-school setting in our tiny state (DE), and some more great books I\u2019ve read. I have been meaning to write up my thoughts on the book the  Kristen  sent me \u2014Jonathan Levy\u2019s  What You Can Do Right Now to Help Your Child with Autism .  There\u2019s some good stuff there. Thanksgiving will be a low-key affair this year; my sister is not only hosting but doing it  all . I think I\u2019ll bring a few good bottles of wine and call it even! I am looking forward to the company of my family and expressing joy and gratitude for the wonderful things in my life.

The one appointment we kept was with the developmental pediatrician.\u00a0 Despite Nik\u2019s less than stellar health, I think the doctor got a pretty good sense of how he is on a day-to-day basis.\u00a0 This was our first time seeing this doctor professionally; I\u2019ve known her for a couple of years since we served on one of the Governor\u2019s councils together.\u00a0 We had seen her partner twice before and just didn\u2019t get the warm fuzzies we needed.\u00a0 We\u2019re glad we made the change.

We discussed Nik\u2019s latest diagnosis \u2014ADHD \u2014 and how it fits with his other issues, and how best to handle it right now.\u00a0 Meds were discussed, educational options, increased speech therapy, behavioral supports at home, even more evaluations.\u00a0 It runs the gamut.\u00a0 Right now we\u2019re sitting with the information we discussed today and will wait for the doctor\u2019s written report and observations before we decide anything.\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve got some sense of options and what\u2019s right for Nik and for our family, I\u2019ll share more.

I have no energy or will by the time I\u2019ve put my son to bed at the end of the day. Our days are so full of struggle lately that I can\u2019t see past it. My thoughts are a jumble; by the time I can sit down to write, the words are gone. I am left with emotional detritus so heavy it causes me to bend beneath its weight.

I stand over his crib and watch him sleeping; the peace and calm which fills his little body is so alien to the fierce and wild energy which drives him through the day. In the darkness, there is no struggle between us, no battle of wills or communication barriers to be broken down. There are no raised voices or tears (mostly mine lately), no moments of panic over keeping him safe from some unintended injury caused by his rampant curiosity or unbridled energy which makes him act before sensing danger. In the darkness, I weep silent tears of love tinged with a grief so deep that it makes my bones ache. I long to fold myself into his crib to wrap my body around his, to shelter him in my arms and will him to know and understand how deeply I love him and how proud I am. It is in those quiet moments that I remind myself of just how far my child has come; I make lists in the moonlight, telling God and the angels watching over my son all about his skills and talents, all about what a good and sweet and loving child he is. He has come so far in his six years, defying odds which many could not. His fierceness enables him to thrive against those odds, yet it is the very thing I wish to tame on so many occasions. The irony is not lost on me; it burns in my throat on those days I am unable to tamp down my anger or frustration. Nik snuffles and shifts in his sleep as if he is aware of my presence.

That appointment is at the end of this month. Meanwhile, knock on wood, Nik has been moderately healthy for the past month.\u00a0 An occasional need for Mucinex here and there but no real illness. That in itself is progress. He has had these weird episodes of extremely swollen tonsils without infection.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking so swollen that you can actually see the tonsils touching the uvula.

Tomorrow is another EEG for Nik.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if I want the neurologist to find evidence of seizures or not.\u00a0 On one hand, it would explain some of the odd tics, facial expressions and behaviors we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of months.\u00a0 On the other hand, it would mean that Nik\u2019s seizures are back.\u00a0 Wow. That was a hard sentence to reread \u201c\u2026Nik\u2019s seizures are back.\u201d Yup, I think I hope the EEG is negative after all.

I think my problem is  twofold .\u00a0 Well, let\u2019s be honest, there are many problems but only a couple which have any direct bearing on my writing at this point \u2014at least, I think.\u00a0 One is the incredible physical and emotional toll being exacted by three years of chronic sleep deprivation and worry about Nik\u2019s health and development. Nope, not even talking autism here.\u00a0 I\u2019m talking ear infections, GI woes, feeding issues.\u00a0 All of those things are separate from his autism.\u00a0 Ditto the possible ADHD.\u00a0 As a result, my short-term memory is  beyond bad .\u00a0 People think I am super organized because I write down everything about Nik\u2019s food, water, meds, bowels, sleep habits, etc.\u00a0 Nope, it\u2019s all because  I can\u2019t remember if I gave him a medication three hours ago  or whether it\u2019s been three days or five since he had a bowel movement, or\u2026you get the idea. Loss of short-term\u00a0memory is not conducive to writing.\u00a0 It\u2019s an awful feeling to have a \u201cbrilliant\u201d thought or insight, or a really funny or inspiring story to share and then completely forget what it is by the time your browser window opens. We\u2019re talking seconds here, people, not minutes or hours. The other obstacle has more to do with  what I write about .\u00a0 Rather, what I think about what I write about.\u00a0 I\u2019ve hit this wall before, this struggle to find my voice and choose my words.\u00a0 I get caught up in thinking that I must have something meaningful \u2014 with a capital M \u2014 to write in order for people to want to read my words.\u00a0 Or that I have to have some stunning story about my son \u2014his challenges or his triumphs\u2014before I have something worthy of sharing.

I pull away.\u00a0 I hide inside myself.\u00a0 I allow myself to connect on fewer levels, with fewer people.\u00a0 The up side is that I spend more time reading other\u2019s words and find myself being incredibly moved by their stories.\u00a0 But the connection is one-way.\u00a0 Connecting,  really \u00a0connecting, is the thing I struggle with \u2014I have my whole life.\u00a0 This opening of myself and allowing myself to be  vulnerable , known.\u00a0 To be seen and loved for who and where I am \u2014warts and all.\u00a0  To be known as more than Niksmom .

{"date": "May 4, 2011 ", "body": "First, a confession \u2014 until last week, Nik had not seen a dentist in nearly three years.  (Niksmom waits patiently for the gasps and groans to subside.)  Worse, it was by my choice that it was so. The reason for that lapse is best explained in this passage from a post dating back to 2008. Though he loves to brush his teeth at home \u2014sitting on my lap as we sing a song about brushing \u2014 Nik has always\u00a0hated\u00a0our trips to the dentist. I don\u2019t blame him; he has to be restrained by strangers who don\u2019t want to take the time necessary to allow him to explore and find his comfort level. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a choice about dentists right now so we try to make the best of it; I still have to argue though to be allowed to hold Nik on my lap instead of sacrificing him to their care. \n Having discussed the issue with the neurologist and the pediatrician, we recently decided to try a low dose of\u00a0 diazepam \u00a0(Valium) to help Nik relax a bit; if he\u2019s not anxious about it he won\u2019t fight, right? Wrong, wrong, wrong.\u00a0WRONG. \n You know how some doctors tell parents\u00a0not\u00a0to give their kids Benadryl or cold medicine before flying because it can have the opposite of its intended effect? That\u2019s called a paradox response. Yeah, that\u2019s what happened to Nik when he got the drug in his system. To say it wasn\u2019t pretty would be a gross understatement.\u00a0Picture your sweet little child strung out on\u00a0 PCP (Angel Dust) ; you\u2019ll get the picture. \n I tell you this not to garner sympathy but to illustrate a point. At the peak of his medically induced rampage, all of Nik\u2019s previous behaviors relating to his episodic pain\u00a0 returned in full blossom \u2014and then some.\u00a0It was one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever witnessed; doubly so because I knew that I had caused it. I knew that it was simply Nik\u2019s mind and body reacting to the horrible, disorienting sensations caused by the drug; the knowledge brought no comfort. \n Sobbing as I drove the 54 miles home with my feral child, I had a flash of insight. Yeah, that last line is a tease, isn\u2019t it? Heh heh.\u00a0(The complete post is\u00a0 here . Go ahead and read it; I\u2019ll wait for you.) ********** Our decision to return to the same practice we left in such distress, back in 2008, was fueled by the fact that Nik has been showing signs of some mild dental discomfort; guilt is a powerful motivator. \u00a0Well, that and the fact that there are no\u00a0other\u00a0pediatric dentists in our area who (a) take Nik\u2019s insurance and (b) work with children with special needs. \u00a0Oh, and our pediatrician threatened to withhold her adoration of Nik if I didn\u2019t get him to a dentist. (She plays hardball, she does!) So, it was with great trepidation that we returned to the scene of the trauma.\u00a0 I was reasonably certain that Nik would fight like a wildcat when we had to hold him to have his teeth cleaned. Right? Um, no, apparently not. I give you\u2026my rock star of a son. At least, it  looks  like my son\u2026 So you see,  development \u00a0magic  does  happen. \u00a0Sometimes you have to just walk away and return to try another day, sometimes even  years later , but it happens. \u00a0It\u2019s all about the timing\u2026his timing.

We started the school year full of wonder and excitement \u2014and the knowledge that the current setting/placement would not be permanent as we waited for the state autism program to conduct evaluations and to determine whether Nik meets the criteria for the educational classification of autism. \u00a0The staff at school is wonderful. \u00a0Loving and supportive of my boy and helping us hold on when it feels like things are going to hell in a handbasket. Still, the struggles for my boy have been tremendous. \u00a0With each passing week, the sensory\u00a0assault\u00a0of the large classroom, the noisy cafeteria, the challenge of being a nonverbal child in a highly verbal world\u2014 it has all been exacting a steep toll on my boy. \u00a0We\u2019re seeing a significant increase in sensory seeking behaviors and a regression to some infantile behaviors, too. \u00a0Things we thought had been outgrown or overcome are rising to the fore. \u00a0Eating and drinking are on the decline and health issues have taken an uptic. The bad news is that it\u2019s taken so long for the autism program to do their myriad assessments and evaluations. \u00a0The good news is that we now know Nik qualifies for the services. \u00a0We have an IEP meeting this week to discuss new goals, needs, strategies and placement. The bad news? We know it won\u2019t be resolved in the ninety minutes allotted for the meeting. \u00a0The good news? \u00a0We know that we can get things worked out. \u00a0Meanwhile, we continue with our current course of private PT, OT and feeding therapy until we finalize school services. The increase in stress has manifest itself in other ways, too. \u00a0Nik\u2019s sensory seeking behaviors include a resurgence of licking his hands and putting everything in his mouth. \u00a0I mean everything. \u00a0This contributed to his recent upper respiratory infection which led to our annual \u201cvacation\u201d in the hospital. \u00a0With the addition of steroids and albuterol, Nik\u2019s already erratic sleep schedule went straight down the tubes. \u00a0We\u2019re still looking for it. Since we came home on Tuesday, Nik\u2019s been a mass of anxiety. \u00a0His physical health has returned but the sleep issues are worse than ever; I didn\u2019t think that was even possible. \u00a0Where he once fell asleep easily, Nik now cannot go to sleep without me nearby. \u00a0He used to wake every few hours but then go back to sleep. \u00a0Now? If he can\u2019t see me or hear me, hysteria reigns; even when he wants to sleep, he can\u2019t unless I\u2019m there. I\u2019m hoping and praying that a return to school and some semblance of routine will help ease some of the anxiety. \u00a0Honestly, though? \u00a0I\u2019m not very confident of it. \u00a0Until we get him in a different environment where his sensory and communication needs are being better met, I think this may be with us for a while. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve given up on sleeping much more than two to three hours a night or trying to get anything accomplished around the house as long as Nik is home. \u00a0The anxiety has reached near fever pitch; I cannot leave Nik alone for even five minutes without it resulting in self-injurious behavior on his part. \u00a0I have simply surrendered to it. \u00a0I know he cannot help how he feels and he\u2019s trying to communicate something to me. All I can do right now is be there for him and let him know he is safe and loved. The rest of\u00a0the\u00a0world will just have to wait. ********** Somewhere in the night \n Somewhere in the night \n I\u2019ll shine a light for you \n Somewhere in the night \n I\u2019ll be standing by \n I will be here for you \n In this world of strangers \n Of cold, unfriendly faces \n Someone you can trust \n Oh there\u2019s someone you can trust \n I will be your shelter \n I\u2019ll give you my shoulder \n Just reach out for my love \n Reach out for my love \n Call my name and my heart will hear you \n I will be there, there\u2019s nothing to fear \n ( I Will Be Here For You  ~\u00a0Michael W.

There are probably a dozen or more half-composed posts in my head and a smattering more in my drafts; life has been moving too fast for me to collect my thoughts, my words and my energy at the same time to bring everyone up to speed. Suffice to say, school is not great but it\u2019s not entirely awful, either; it\u2019s just not a good fit. \u00a0Everyone recognizes it and we\u2019re working to remedy the situation as soon as possible. \u00a0Meanwhile, there are sensory and behavioral ramifications to the poor fit\u2014 all of which have kept Niksfamily hopping. We\u2019re still fighting too many sleepless nights and dysregulated days, wondering about possible metabolic causes and going through multiple rounds of  blood-letting  blood tests. \u00a0Toss into the mix a bout of bronchitis and an ear infection which have just cropped up and, well, yeah. Exactly. Somehow, though, if I look closely enough, I can see the glimmers of progress amidst the chaos of dysregulation and I am left stunned, speechless and in complete awe of my child. ********** Yesterday, the worst of the illness was taking hold and my little one was a mess. \u00a0His fever spiked to 103F as he sat on the sofa, restless and uncomfortable. Nik: \u00a0  Fix, Mama. Fix. \n Me: \u00a0  Fix what, baby? \u00a0Your toy?  (Nik always brings his broken toys or the ones which need new batteries to me and I tell him  \u201cMama will fix it, sweetie.\u201d ) \nNik: \u00a0 (Vigorous head shaking to indicate  no .) \nMe: \u00a0  Your music? Do you want Mama to sing for you, lovey? \nNik: \u00a0 (More vigorous head shaking\u00a0accompanied by pathetic whining and tears now)  Fix, Mama. \nMe: \u00a0 Oh, baby, I wish I knew what you need me to fix. I want to fix it, I do. \nNik: \u00a0 Fix. \u00a0Fix. \u00a0Fix  (reaching near-hysteria and beginning some mild self-harm) I gathered my boy onto my lap, cradling his hot little head in the crook of my neck so he wouldn\u2019t see \u00a0my tears of frustration. \u00a0His speech device tumbled onto the sofa next to him. \u00a0He squirmed in my arms; I thought he was\u00a0just\u00a0trying to get comfortable. \u00a0He leaned over and dragged his talker onto his slender legs.

{"date": "November 20, 2010 ", "body": "Whoops! Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to leave everyone hanging, wondering about the  IEP and Nik\u2019s school future . \u00a0Life, it seems, wasn\u2019t quite finished doling out the hard knocks. \u00a0In a nutshell, my seventy-eight year old mother had a bad accident involving a ladder and a head injury which resulted in the discovery of a mass on her brain. \u00a0Yeah, good times! The upshot is that it\u2019s been a rough couple of weeks as I\u2019ve been helping my father take care of her between chauffeuring Nik to school and doctors\u2019 appointments. \u00a0In all, Mom is very lucky and is on the road to recovery. \u00a0An MRI this week has indicated that the growth is actually a fairly benign meningioma which is not actually in contact with the actual brain matter. \u00a0The imaging gave the doctor a pretty good picture of it and he will monitor it for growth and any symptoms which may appear. Meanwhile, Mom is progressing on the slow track to recovery and she\u2019s a tad frustrated (and frustrating, to be honest). So, in the midst of the \u201cfecal maelstrom\u201d that seemed ready to bury us, the rainbows and unicorns began to appear.  (No, really, I did not suffer the head injury. \u00a0I swear.) Nik transitioned into his new placement in the state autism program last Tuesday. \u00a0This program is at the same school he attended three years ago. \u00a0(Long-time readers may recall that we were so disturbed by the situation at the time \u2014what seemed to be an unwillingness to give the supports we knew Nik needed\u2014 that we opted to home school instead. \u00a0For the record, we do not regret that decision one iota!) \u00a0The autism program in our school district was in its infancy then and we weren\u2019t impressed. \u00a0Granted, Nik was in a very different place and needed different supports than he now needs. \u00a0None the less, the idea of \u201creturning to the scene of the crime,\u201d as it were, really left us less than inspired. Funny, isn\u2019t it, how time can change everything? Today, the program is incredibly well-organized and offers significant supports to students  and  their families. \u00a0Nik is currently in a more restrictive setting, that is true, but it is what he needs right now. \u00a0He is only one of five students in a classroom which encompasses kindergarten, first, and second grade. \u00a0Each student has full one-to-one support and unlimited access to a sensory room, an adaptive playground, adaptive PE twice a week (as well as music) and daily swimming sessions. \u00a0Yes,  daily . On top of that, the whole team really made it clear at the outset that they were interested in helping Nik and were willing to make the personal investments necessary to do so. \u00a0Before we even had our intake meeting, the speech therapist made contact with the consultant from PRC (makers of Nik\u2019s speech generating device) and arranged for training sessions for the entire team\u2014 including a full day, on-site training in early December. \u00a0I still get kind of teary thinking about this team of people who want to learn how my son communicates and how to communicate with him as quickly as possible and how to incorporate his speech device into all aspects of his day. \u00a0It\u2019s a complete turnaround from our most recent experience. In the few days Nik has been in school, he has been so much happier and calm. \u00a0Sure, we did start him on Abilify in the middle of the week, but the change was obvious even before the medication was introduced. \u00a0After his first day at school (and swimming! Did I mention?  DAI.LY!? ), Nik actually slept nine hours through the night; he hasn\u2019t slept like that more than a\u00a0handful\u00a0of nights in three years! \u00a0Something about that deep pressure from the water. Another facet of this autism program which really appealed to us is the fact that they offer respite. We haven\u2019t been able to get respite for years because Nik wasn\u2019t considered \u201cdisabled enough\u201d or medically fragile enough for us to need it. \u00a0We were told we made too much money to qualify unless I went back to school or work full-time. \u00a0Yet, we don\u2019t make enough money to actually be able to afford to pay anyone out-of-pocket. \u00a0Funny, I guess parenting and homeschooling a child with multiple disabilities wasn\u2019t enough? \u00a0(Political aside: I wonder if the powers that be which make such policies will ever realize that no amount of money in the world can counter the toll of chronic sleep deprivation, stress, and worry which is exacted upon not only an individual but on an entire family? But I digress\u2026) So, yeah, respite. \u00a0 Trained  respite. \u00a0 In our home. \u00a0When we need it . *hopeful, happy sigh* Sure, there will adjustments and there will be struggles\u2014 for all of us. \u00a0But, overall, I feel really good about the change. The possibilities seem endless.   ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/possibilities-part-one/", "title": "Possibilities \u2013 part\u00a0one"},
{"date": "November 21, 2010 ", "body": "I believe that man will not merely endure; he will prevail. He  is immortal, not because he alone among the creatures has an inexhaustible  voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of kindness and  compassion.  ~  William Falconer It\u2019s painful sometimes to see how our lives have changed through the years; how the path has diverged so greatly from where we thought life would take us, what we thought we\u2019d have, where we thought we would be . \u00a0The kind of life we would give our children. \u00a0The fact that we thought we\u2019d have more than one child or that we are now living on roughly one-third of the income we had when Nik was born but our expenses are pretty much the same or slightly more. \u00a0You know, those developmental toys and therapeutic items all add up quickly. \u00a0Not to mention time lost from work for hospitalizations, etc. We know we are certainly not alone in having our lives turn out so different from what we envisioned as young(er) newlyweds and expectant parents. \u00a0Each person, each family, carries their own burden of sorrows with them. \u00a0Sometimes, they seem so unbearably heavy that there is a very real danger of suffocating under their weight, no matter how hard you try to keep them from crushing you. Yet, somehow, in the midst of it all someone reaches out a hand through the magic of the internet and makes the impossible, well, possible. \u00a0Sometimes it\u2019s with loving and supportive words to let you know you\u2019re not alone and you\u2019re not foolish or crazy\u2014 or whatever other self-denigrating adjective you\u2019ve put on for the day. \u00a0And sometimes, the generosity of one person sets in motion something too wonderful to imagine it could be real. The daily struggles to see the forest for the trees in a world of developmental delays, disabilities and medical challenges is difficult. \u00a0I try, I really do, to stay positive and hopeful and keep my eye on the bigger picture \u2014and always on the joy that is my son. \u00a0But, sometimes, it is defeating to look around and realize there are opportunities I can\u2019t afford to give him. \u00a0Not now, anyway. \u00a0My husband and I have learned a lot about ingenuity and making-do and we try not to ask for favors or charity. \u00a0Certainly not for ourselves and, rarely, for Nik unless it\u2019s vital. We\u2019ve been blessed with a great state university which has a full-time program in disability studies. \u00a0One of the services they provide is an assistive technology initiative where anyone in the state may borrow gadgets, gizmos and devices to try for a two-week period. \u00a0It\u2019s kind of an assistive technology lending library. \u00a0We\u2019ve borrowed numerous items from them in the past, so when they got on board with iPads, I was excited! Nik\u2019s cerebral palsy, while appearing mild to the casual observer, leaves him with little ability to hold a crayon or a pencil. \u00a0He cannot control his movements enough to do more than scribble on paper no matter how hard he tries; even hand-over-hand is difficult for him when it comes to any sort of writing or drawing. \u00a0The concept of a mouse and keyboard are beyond Nik\u2019s cognitive processing ability at the present. \u00a0I figured a touch-screen technology would make it easy for Nik to continue to expand his growing love of letters, numbers and words (ok, and YouTube videos, too!) and to be able to express his knowledge in ways that even his speech-generating device doesn\u2019t allow him to at this time. I\u2019ll be honest, our first trial with the iPad, back in July, was a flop. \u00a0My expectations that Nik would miraculously grasp the concept of the programs we tried, would be able to control his fingers\u00a0enough\u00a0to create the desired results were too high; I had so much emotion invested in his success. \u00a0Nik, quite simply, wasn\u2019t interested. \u00a0I returned the device with regret; I had become totally addicted to Angry Birds. \u00a0Nik, on the other hand, didn\u2019t miss it at all. Fast forward a few months. \u00a0With the daily exposure to school, Nik\u2019s desire to learn and to do \u201cwork\u201d \u2014as he calls it on his speech device\u2014 grew rapidly. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until he was hospitalized in late October that I began to think he might be ready to try the iPad again. \u00a0The hospital has an amazing, state-of-the-art touch-screen TV/computer system in each patient room. \u00a0While Nik was confined to bed for the better part of five days, he was highly\u00a0motivated\u00a0to figure out how it worked. \u00a0While he couldn\u2019t quite navigate with ease, he\u00a0definitely\u00a0caught on to the whole \u201cI touch this screen and something cool happens\u201d vibe. With the change-over to his  new school placement  on the horizon, I decided to give the iPad one more chance before giving\u00a0up\u00a0entirely. \u00a0The difference a few months has made! Nik took to it like a fish takes to water. \u00a0He went from only mildly curious to avidly obsessed with the First Words spelling game (trial-version) and some of the simple matching and puzzle games. \u00a0His rapid facility has amazed us and given us significant hope that this could be a technology which would be useful for him in school. \u00a0But, we also knew the price was out of our reach. \u00a0Not just now but for quite sometime. I posted some pictures of Nik with the iPad on my Facebook page and people began to comment that we should get him one. \u00a0I made it clear it was out of our reach right now. \u00a0That\u2019s when the angels, the unicorns\u2014 the fairy-godmothers struck. Shivon \u2014 who has a world of great karma due to her, I swear\u2014 sent me a private message to ask if she could set up something for people to chip in for an iPad for Nik. \u00a0I didn\u2019t answer her for two days as I battled with my pride and my fear that people would think we were being greedy or presumptuous. \u00a0 My love for my son and my belief in the possibilities before him won out.  I told Shivon it would be ok. Unbeknownst to me, while I was hemming and hawing and stalling, Shivon had already put her head together with  Jess  and  Shannon  to figure out the best way to achieve the goal. \u00a0Once I gave the green light, they were off and running. As the money  poured  in \u2014from places and people I\u2019ve never even heard of as well as old and dear friends\u2014I felt like an announcer on a public radio\u00a0pledge\u00a0drive as I emailed Shivon the updated totals. It was funny\u2014 and unbelievably humbling and moving at the same time. \u00a0 In less than forty-eight hours the goal was not only met, it was exceeded.  Nik\u2019s iPad has been ordered! \u00a0Shannon even arranged for some of the folks from  Moms With Apps  to hold an \u201capps shower\u201d for Nik; they sent codes for numerous apps for free to help us get started. \u00a0The generosity has been overwhelming. I think my tweet from the first night of fundraising aptly sums up how I felt: \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff I won\u2019t name all the names of the many contributors as I\u2019ll be sending a special thank you to each of them once Nik\u2019s iPad has arrived. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if I will ever find words to adequately convey the depth of my gratitude for their generosity or to tell them just how much hope they have extended to our entire family. \u00a0Their selfless gesture has touched us in ways they may never know or understand. But, the story doesn\u2019t end here with Nik. There are so many families just like mine \u2014families with a wordless child or even adult member with autism. \u00a0Families who cannot afford to take advantage of such an incredible technology breakthrough without financial assistance. \u00a0Families who may not know the possibilities exist or who are too proud to ask for help. This year, the  HollyRod Foundation  is giving away iPads to\u00a0families\u00a0who would not otherwise be able to afford them. \u00a0There is  detailed information  on the foundation website, including opportunities for people to make contributions to help others experience the miracle of communication, the wonder of discovery of the gifts which lay hidden within each wordless person. \u00a0Please give what you can and share the information with your friends, family and colleagues. \u00a0(For convenience, you may text  HollyRod  to 27138 to make your pledge at any time.)

{"date": "August 30, 2011 ", "body": "The routine is the same each day. Nik precedes me to the front door by mere steps and waits while I pick up his backpack.\u00a0 He carries his speech device, which weighs just under ten percent of his entire body weight, so I take the backpack.\u00a0 He prances with unfettered joy as he waits for me to unlock the door; he loves going to school. I allow him to walk to the car ahead of me where he waits by the passenger door in the back.\u00a0 It\u2019s a routine so deeply ingrained that we don\u2019t even think about it. Chalk it up to the sensory aftermath of Irene, or the seizure medications which are playing tricks with his brain and body. Blame it on the moon and stars, the planetary alignment. For whatever reason, our routine is off today. Nik darts past me as I grab his device off the dining room table. He is eager to go to school; the new year has started and he already adores his teacher. Today is gym day \u2014his favorite activity. Not surprising for my boy of perpetual motion and boundless energy. 8:09 AM: \nI reach the door at the same time he does.\u00a0 As I reach for my keys, I realize I don\u2019t have the backpack. In the instant it takes to turn and pick it up, the door is opened and Nik darts out.\u00a0  \u201cWait for Mama, Baby; I\u2019ve got to lock the door. I\u2019ll be right there; go stand by the car.\u201d \u00a0 The same script we run every single day. I\u2019m moving as fast as I can so I can help Nik get into his car seat; if I dawdle, he will climb into the front seat and start playing with the radio and the gear shift.\u00a0 Not such a big deal, but today we are running a smidge late and I don\u2019t relish the added hassle. Quickly, I pull the door closed behind me and look to where Nik is standing by the back door of the car.\u00a0  The emptiness of the space takes a moment to sink in.\u00a0  I scan the car to see if he\u2019s already inside; it\u2019s empty and the doors are still closed.  \u201cNikolas? Where are you, baby?\u201d  I call in a voice I think I recognize; it\u2019 is slightly shriller than normal. I turn and scan down the street; Nik knows his Nanny and Granddaddy live just six doors down. There is no sign of him. 8:10 AM: \nInstantaneously, I am engulfed \u2014mind, body and soul\u2014 by a blinding, breath-stealing panic.\u00a0 I begin to scream in earnest,  \u201cNIKOLAS! NIKOLAS ERIK!! Where are you, Baby?\u201d Silence. I throw everything I am holding on the ground.\u00a0 The contents of my purse tumble out; the water bottle from Nik\u2019s backpack goes rolling to the end of the driveway. I don\u2019t spare a thought for the speech device as it crashes to the ground; it costs more than my car is worth, but I don\u2019t think twice. Gasping, screaming, my heart racing and my stomach clenching.\u00a0  \u201cNIKOLAS!!! Baby, come here, baby!\u201d NIKOLAS!!!!!\u201d The neighbors are not home so I know he didn\u2019t run to their house; they would know to bring him to me anyway. In a sickening instant, I think about the hurricane-swollen creek behind our house.\u00a0 Nik is obsessed with water and he is fast enough to have gotten around the quad of townhouses we live in.\u00a0 Sobbing hysterically, I am still screaming his name as I take off running to the side of the house. \u00a0My throat is tight and raw and I can\u2019t see. A loud crash behind me captures my attention, stopping me in my tracks. I turn to see that our garage door is open about a foot. \u00a0 Oh my God, the motorcycle!  I race toward the garage, screaming his name.\u00a0 I don\u2019t expect him to answer, but I cannot stop myself just the same.\u00a0 I hit my knees on the black top and look under the door. I can\u2019t see him. The sudden flood of possible permutations of lethal dangers in the garage fills my lungs, displacing all air. I cannot breathe.\u00a0 Time simultaneously stands still \u2014 allowing all those possibilities to cross my mind \u2014and accelerates; each moment he is missing feels like it\u2019s been ten minutes long. Jumping to my feet, I punch in the code for the door opener. My hands are shaking so badly I can\u2019t get it right.\u00a0 I am too large to squeeze under the small opening under the door. I fly to my car and open the door just enough to reach the remote opener on the visor.\u00a0 As I hit the button, I pray Nik is not near the door when it starts moving.\u00a0 He is not. As the door lifts enough for me to get under, my eyes take a moment to adjust to the light. I can see my husband\u2019s motorcycle still standing where it should be.\u00a0 My son is not pinned beneath it as I feared. I look toward the plethora of lethal garden chemicals and dangerously sharp implements he sees his daddy use outside on a regular basis. He is nowhere near them, nowhere in sight. Panic and fear are rising with the bile in my throat. The water!  If he\u2019s gone there I may be too late. \u00a0As I turn to leave the garage, I bargain with God to allow my too-large body to move quickly enough to keep my baby safe.\u00a0  If I run through the house I might reach the back yard before Nik can get into serious danger. Another crash, not as loud as the first, draws my attention further back inside the garage\u2014toward the fire door leading into the house. It is locked with two deadbolts so I know he cannot get into the house. I hear a giggle from around a corner. I look beyond the metal storage shelving, afraid of what I might find. There, on the concrete, sits my boy. Oblivious to both the dangers around him and my abject panic, he is happily playing with one of the few things in the garage which can do him no serious harm if he were able to get it open\u2026a can of cooking spray.\u00a0 I suppose he likes the feel of the cool can in his hands, the sound of the contents shaking inside. The bright red cap. Thankfully, he doesn\u2019t have the grip strength to remove the cap\u2014the color of which must be what caught his attention. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to shake any more than I am or to lose my already-absent ability to breathe; it is unavoidable.\u00a0 I hit my knees and scoop him into my arms, sobbing and kissing his little face, his soft brown hair.\u00a0  \u201cBaby, don\u2019t ever scare Mama like that again!\u201d I know he doesn\u2019t fully understand; to him, it was just an adventure.\u00a0 He was going about his routine just like normal when \u2014 Ooh! Shiny! \u2014 there it was, a space just begging him to slip through into the darkness to explore. 8:17 AM: \nI carry him to the car and strap him into his seat, thankful for the familiarity of the routine which\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0require thought or sight; I have neither as I am now sobbing and gasping.\u00a0 Shaking uncontrollably from the adrenaline surging through my body.\u00a0 I collapse against the car door as I close it, closing him safely inside.\u00a0 Minutes later, I gather the items strewn about the driveway and we head to school. As I drive, on autopilot, Nik chatters happily in the back seat about  \u201cgym, ABC, Ms. Margaret, school.\u201d 8:30 AM: \nI hand Nik off to his para and tell her simply that we are late because Nik ran off this morning. I give Nik extra hugs and kisses and send him off. 8:32 AM: \nI sit in my car in the school parking lot and breakdown. It could have been worse. So.Much.Worse.  The knowledge of which has changed my world. \u00a0Irrevocably.

{"date": "October 6, 2011 ", "body": "I must admit, for years I thought all the hype about Apple products was just that\u2026hype. I didn\u2019t get the appeal, certainly not for a price point I really couldn\u2019t justify.\u00a0 Sure, I remember my sister\u2019s first MAC and the goofy little icons and the weird mouse-thingy. I thought it was all kind of ridiculous and pretentious.\u00a0 I was a PC gal through and through.\u00a0 I sneered when my other sister became an early adopter of all things Apple \u2014the iPhone, the iPod, etc. It became a badge of honor to me that I resisted the pull. Then, just a little less than a year ago, some friends \u2014with the generous assistance and kindness of some strangers\u2014 made it possible for my son to receive an iPad.\u00a0  We had no idea whether he would take to it or what it might do for him. After all, my nonverbal, multiply disabled son had recently been diagnosed as mentally retarded (those were the words of the doctor) and we were told to prepare for a lifetime of care giving and not much else. We didn\u2019t believe in the diagnosis and just knew we had to show the doctors that there was \u2014there IS\u2014 a light burning fierce and bright within our boy. Because of all the hype, we had borrowed an iPad several months prior, but Nik didn\u2019t really get it. He struggled with the touch-screen; his cerebral palsy made it hard for him to control his hand movements. Isolating finger movements for tapping or making single strokes or swipes required for some of the simple apps we tried was a pipe dream.\u00a0 We were reluctant to try again, fearful that the good will and generosity being extended to us would be wasted. Nik\u2019s new iPad arrived just in time for Thanksgiving \u2014and shortly before his seventh birthday. We already knew that Nik loved letters. In fact, he is obsessed with them!\u00a0 Not having a plan or any idea as to what might be good to try, we relied on the generosity of still more strangers \u2014the fantastic people associated with\u00a0  Moms With Apps \u2014 who donated free apps for Nik to try. The advent of Nik\u2019s  Vantage Lite  speech generating device in our lives, roughly two years ago, brought dramatic change;  it gave Nik the power to communicate  with us in ways that did not involve screaming, throwing, or slamming his head on the floor to express frustration. To date, no other technology has provided that for Nik. Even the iPad, with all its myriad communication apps, does not give Nik the ability to communicate in the manner which works for him. However, I do not exaggerate when I say the gift of Nik\u2019s iPad changed our lives forever. While the iPad cannot replace Nik\u2019s communication device (yet), it has opened up the world to my boy.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about the technology, per se, but what is being done with it and the ways in which children like Nik can discover and be motivated to push themselves so far beyond what others have deemed his ability level. In the time Nik\u2019s had his iPad, he\u2019s taught himself so many things and has opened the eyes of those around him to the intelligence he holds in his wordless self. Once written off as mentally retarded and not very teachable, Nik is now impressing his teacher and other professionals with his spelling abilities, his problem-solving skills and his manual dexterity. We are seeing cross-over and generalization of skills beyond the use of the iPad. My child, who could not point his finger a year ago, can now actively show me what he wants me to look at even if he doesn\u2019t have the voice or the words to describe it.\u00a0 He can find music to soothe himself, videos to entertain or teach himself\u00a0 new things \u2014his interests run the gamut from ABC\u2019s to DIY home repairs. (I told Niksdad to lock up his power tools, just in case!) It has opened up a world of exposure to peer interactions which are not otherwise available to my son \u2014an only child. Video modeling at its finest. Do I think it\u2019s a coincidence that Nik has recently begin to approach children his own age for play and interaction \u2014regardless of how clumsy the attempts may be? No, I do not. Do I think the advent of the iPad means Nik will suddenly be able to live independently or go to college? Perhaps, perhaps not. But I do know that it\u2019s made the idea that it may even be possible a part of the conversation. For that alone, you can call me a Fan Girl. Steve Jobs was a visionary, an out-of-the-box thinker and a remarkable leader. I think his legacy will not be about technological innovation as much as his transformation of the way we connect to one another, the ways in which we open up new horizons for both those who would boldly step into the future as well as those for whom, perhaps, there was once no future. Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs. You will not be forgotten here.

This issue is so important that I have to speak up. Did you know? \n There are 22,000 children of military families affected by autism. \n Less than 10 percent of those children are getting the services they need. \n There\u2019s a bill sitting in committee, okay, let\u2019s be honest here \u2014DYING OF NEGLECT in committee, which could change that. A bill which could level the playing field for our military families and their children who are dealing with the day-to-day realities of autism AND war. It\u2019s the Caring for Military Kids with Autism Act (CMKAA) \u2013 H.R. 2288.\u00a0 It was originally assigned to the House Committee on Armed Services, and then was referred to the Subcommittee on Military Personnel on July 19. And there it has sat, ignored. This bill would: \n Streamline the acronym-filled process for military families to access services for their autistic children through TRICARE, the military\u2019s healthcare system. \n It would also remove the extremely stringent cap on services that can be received. \n My friend  Rachel , a military wife, autism mama and fierce advocate, has put together a slew of posts (go  here  and search for CMKA and even a  website  dedicated to CMKAA where you can read the text of the bill (and click on a  link  to contact your Congressperson). Here\u2019s the deal \u2014as long as this bill sits, ignored, it will die.\u00a0 Since Congress is on recess now, your Representative will, most likely, not see or act upon your heartfelt plea for support.  ASK ANYWAY . (Just click  here  and fill in a few spaces\u2026voila! Message on its way!) More urgently, we need your help in getting the attention of the White House. If we can garner 25,000 signatures on  this official White House petition  by February first, the President \u2014as in President Obama \u2014 will have to give his attention to this matter. Thousands of brave men and women have sacrificed so very, very much for your right to sit in your office or your home reading these words, uncensored and at your leisure. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice \u2014their lives.\u00a0 Please, even if your life is not personally touched by autism or your political leanings lead you condemn the wars in which we are engaged,  don\u2019t make their sacrifices meaningless and don\u2019t make the 22,000-plus children with autism the victims of politics .  Or apathy. Please go  here  NOW to sign the petition. (You will need to sign up for a White House account, which takes less than a minute, to sign the petition. Don\u2019t let  that  be the obstacle which keeps 22,000 children from receiving appropriate care!) Then share this with your friends, your co-workers, your neighbors.

Pleeeease?\u201d  The lump in my throat got a bit larger and tighter. \u00a0The brightly colored rows of cards swam before my eyes as the unshed tears threatened to spill over \u2014not with the deep, soul-searing love I had felt moments before, but with hot, bitter sadness. Every holiday is fraught with mixed emotions for me. I cherish the sweet images of typical celebrations while, simultaneously, feeling the sting of my son\u2019s many and varied challenges like a\u00a0jagged and dull knife-blade\u00a0through my heart. \u00a0At seven years old, he still doesn\u2019t understand Christmas or Halloween. He doesn\u2019t know what a birthday is or that his is so very, very special to me. \u00a0I knew we would not be giving any \u201cValentimes\u201d to his friends at school. My son is in a very small class in a specialized program with one-to-one adult-student ratios; every one of his classmates is nonverbal. Every.single.one. \u00a0Though these children spend just over thirty hours together each week, I am not sure they even know each other\u2019s names or if they are aware of one another at all. \u00a0The irony is not lost on me that my son\u2014who uses a speech generating device with only very modest accuracy and success and still, mostly, for requesting\u2014 is the  most communicative  child in the class. I know the teacher spends time teaching about holidays and weather and such during their circle times and highly regimented but very short time at different learning centers throughout the classroom. \u00a0Still, how much can my son be soaking up in those five-minute center-rotations? \u00a0During breakfast times over the past week he has chattered away (with his speech device) about  valentine card, candy, chocolate, heart . \u00a0I know he\u2019s learning the language of the holiday, but what is he learning about the meaning? About love? Family? Friendship? Unable to handle the sting every time I thought of it, I fortified the wall around my heart with another layer of resignation and dashed hopes. Still, I knew it was important to go through the motions for Nik\u2019s sake. \u00a0Fake it until you make it, right? \u00a0Which is how I found myself in Michael\u2019s yesterday morning agonizing over heart-shaped stickers and doilies, foam cut-outs and glitter glue, pushing back intrusive thoughts. \u00a0 \u201cThis one\u2019s too small, it would be a fine motor nightmare for Nik.\u201d \u00a0\u201cHe can\u2019t do this one, he can\u2019t even see the tiny pieces, let alone manipulate them into place.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhy am I even going to bother; he doesn\u2019t get it anyway.\u201d Perhaps if I had started my quest a bit sooner, I might not have felt so disheartened by all the fine motor challenges on the shelves. \u00a0Valentines, it seems, are better when they are loaded with oodles of small, shiny objects which are difficult for my son to pick up and manipulate. I\u00a0persevered\u00a0and found what I thought was a good selection of glittery heart stickers in varying sizes and colors, the requisite red card stock, some gold heart-shaped doilies and a jumbo pack of glitter glue tubes. \u00a0The very same tubes Nik\u2019s school OT said would be great for strengthening his grasp as he tried to squeeze the tube. I was determined that my boy and I would make some valentine\u2019s for his grandparents, his papa, and his teacher and para. Ambition, they name is Niksmom! I had visions of Nik pressing the heart doily into the glue and happily slapping stickers all over the paper. \u00a0Then, I would help him sign his name\u2014 hand-over-hand, of course, as my boy can\u2019t even draw a straight line yet\u2014 and we would bask in the beauteous glory of our one-of-a-kind creations. The reality was far different. Nik wanted only to shove markers in his ears and nose and rub his fingers in the glitter glue. \u00a0Which, dear school OT, he had  zero  difficulty squeezing an\u00a0entire\u00a0tube onto my dining room table, thanks. I think you can check off that hand-strengthening goal. \u00a0I did manage to get him to hold a marker long enough to scribble a barely legible  Nanny and Granddaddy  on the back of his card and sign his name. Hey, you try hand-over-hand with a left-hander, while writing upside down with a highly resistant partner. It\u2019s not as easy as you might think! Still, when all was said and done, Nik had helped to create a special card for both his Nanny and Granddaddy and for his Papa, too. \u00a0Papa\u2019s card is very special because Nik asked me to draw a green truck. Hey, some folks like hearts and flowers to say  I love you . \u00a0Nik uses the language he knows his papa understands on a deeper level. \u00a0His teacher and para? \u00a0They\u2019ll have to be satisfied with a few scribbles on their store-bought Snoopy postcards. *shrug* Because Nik still has a very hazy and\u00a0fluid\u00a0sense of time, as soon as we finished our creations, we delivered Nanny and Granddaddy\u2019s card and a small box of chocolates immediately. \u00a0Nik clutched his homemade card and heart-shaped box in his little hands the whole way down the street. \u00a0As soon as he saw his Nanny, he leaned in for a kiss (he\u2019s got that part of Valentine\u2019s Day down just fine,  thankyouverymuch !) and then thrust his gifts into her hands. That was my first inkling that maybe he did understand just a bit more than I thought. In the mornings, as I make Nik\u2019s breakfast and get his lunch ready to take to school, Nik is fairly chatty. \u00a0Usually it\u2019s about his letters or his computer. \u00a0One constant, however, is that he  always  talks about Nanny and Granddaddy; they are the epicenter of his universe outside of our own home. \u00a0It\u2019s really quite sweet. \u00a0Not a day goes by that he doesn\u2019t ask for  \u201cNanny, later.\u201d After a particularly difficult night which had both Nik and me up every few hours, Nik was very chatty this morning. Often, I let the digitized voice sort of wash over me as I go about my routine. \u00a0Today, however, his chatter caught my attention\u2014 \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day!\u201d \n \u201cNanny and Granddaddy\u201d \n \u201cValentine card\u201d \n \u201cMake\u201d \n \u201cCrayons\u201d \n \u201cHeart\u201d \n \u201cChocolate\u201d \n\u201cWalk\u201d \n \u201cNanny and Granddaddy\u2019s\u201d  I knew this was no random chatter. \u00a0Nik was telling me exactly what we had done yesterday. He may not have the words to express the concepts of love and family, but I knew\u2014 I  know \u2014 to the depths of my own heart\u2014 he got it. He understands. \u00a0Every day, so much more than I think he does, he understands. Through the glitter of my tears,  he shines . \n \n \n My funny Valentine \n Sweet, comic Valentine, \n You make me smile \n With my heart \n   \n   \n   \n   \n \n (Funny Valentine ~ Rodgers & Hart) \n         \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://maternalinstincts.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/nik-giggly.jpg", "https://maternalinstincts.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/nik-giggly.jpg"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/better-than-chocolate/", "title": "Better than chocolate"},

[Disclaimer: Nik makes it exceedingly difficult for anyone to look in his throat; it\u2019s only been in the past\u00a0six weeks or so that I\u2019ve been able to get a good look while feeding him.]\u00a0 It makes a lot of sense; the nights his tonsils are more swollen, he wakes more often, is awake longer and is more irritable and hyper the next day.\u00a0 I am amazed at my child\u2019s resilience through all of this, though.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean to imply it hasn\u2019t affected him \u2014it most definitely has\u2014 but the manifestations are the opposite of what I would have expected.\u00a0 Where I have been struggling to string together coherent sentences for simple conversation with my husband or my mother and having what I think may be anxiety attacks, Nik seems to be functioning relatively well.\u00a0 He\u2019s eating and drinking well (um, maybe not so much the drinking \u2014we\u2019re still using a 60 mL syringe to get fluids into him), he\u2019s playing, he\u2019s mostly happy and sunshiny.\u00a0 Except when he\u2019s not. \u00a0 Then \u2014forget about it\u2014 Nik\u2019s moody and irritable, tantrumy and self-injurious.\u00a0 Fortunately, those moments aren\u2019t too frequent.\u00a0 I think the antibiotic for his latest ear infection is helping, too, to eliminate one significant source of distress.\u00a0 Apparently, many children respond to\u00a0obstructive sleep apnea by being very hyperactive and it\u2019s often mistaken for ADHD. Yikes.\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if Nik\u2019s tonsils are removed and he becomes my calm, steady, happy-go-lucky  good sleeper  again?\u00a0 (I\u2019m keeping  everything  crossed, folks!)\u00a0 We see the ENT tomorrow.\u00a0 I hope we don\u2019t have a battle on our hands about getting his tonsils out but I worry that we may.\u00a0 It won\u2019t be because Nik\u2019s tonsils aren\u2019t enlarged.\u00a0 Rather, there\u2019s a question of whether Nik may have a  submucosal cleft palate  which would make him a potentially bad candidate for removing his tonsils.\u00a0 Or so we\u2019ve been told.\u00a0 The hurdle we have to overcome with the doctors is the possibility of  velopharyngeal\u00a0dysfunction/insufficiency (VPD) \u00a0resulting from removing the tonsils.\u00a0 Of course, current research indicates that, in some case, removing the tonsils can actually decrease the effects of VPD.\u00a0 The irony is that VPD\u00a0has a significant impact on speech (as well as eating and swallowing).\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t it be something if my hungry little bear decided he was ready to eat more than pureed foods and was able to make more vocal sounds once his tonsils came out?\u00a0 Just once, I wish it could be a simple, straightforward, black-or-white situation with Nik\u2019s health.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he does, too.\u00a0 Meanwhile, there  have  been some moments of sheer delight and celebration wedged in among the ear infections, the sleepless nights, and the days which leave Nik covered in self-inflicted bruises\u2026\u00a0 In addition to his  recent mastery of socks , Nik has been working on dressing himself.\u00a0 It\u2019s not quite to the point at which I can hand him a stack of clothing and say  \u201cOk, sweetie, time to get dressed!\u201d \u00a0But we\u2019re working on it; I suspect we\u2019ll get there sooner than I think.\u00a0 And self feeding, too!\u00a0 I think we\u2019re closer than we realize; Nik\u2019s been doing great with a fork and pieces of banana \u2014even some meat this week!\u00a0 The gloppy spoon stuff? I think  I\u2019m  the obstacle here as I have a certain attachment to not having food flung all over my walls and carpet.\u00a0  Sigh.\u00a0  Nik\u2019s definitely been expressing an intense desire to do things by and for himself lately, \u2014complete with vigorous chest thumping and head shaking when I ask him if he needs help.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re also seeing some major cognitive leaps being made in OT lately, too.\u00a0 Imagine, if Nik\u2019s able to continue making such progress when he\u2019s chronically sleep deprived and under the weather, how much more could he do if he were healthy and well rested?\u00a0 I hope to find out soon.

{"date": "March 2, 2010 ", "body": "I don\u2019t know if I should be comforted or frustrated by the knowledge that my  instincts were right about the ENT .\u00a0 As Murphy\u2019s Law would have it, Nik\u2019s ear looked great and his tonsils seemed fine when the doctor got a good look.\u00a0 Well, hell, I\u2019m not a doctor but I\u2019m pretty sure that  even I know  that a week on heavy-hitting antibiotics might have some slight ameliorating effects. The bottom line is that the doctor doesn\u2019t think the tonsils are the problem and doesn\u2019t want to remove them; he said he thinks it won\u2019t give us the results we are hoping for and may make Nik\u2019s oral motor issues worse.\u00a0 Now, here\u2019s where the good doctor and I part company because I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s looking at this strictly from his little ENT-corner-of-the-world view while I am looking at the big picture. To whit:\u00a0 Nik has a  significant \u00a0history of both cardiac and pulmonary disease or insult.\u00a0 He was a history of Failure to Thrive (FTT) and is still in the third percentile for both height and weight for his age with a body mass index of less than fifty percent.\u00a0 This child who used to sleep ten to thirteen hours per night without incident has not slept well in three years; the average amount of sleep Nik now gets is eight hours total \u2014broken into three, sometimes four, segments.\u00a0 His longest stretch of sleep these days is about three hours. My once placid and even-tempered\u00a0child is now a whirling\u00a0dervish with a recent diagnosis of ADHD.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure I buy that, really.\u00a0 Not as long as there may be any underlying pathology which may be treatable.\u00a0 And the long-term cost of doing nothing but medicating\u00a0it and hoping it resolves itself is too great.\u00a0 The threat to Nik\u2019s overall health and development is not insignificant; the toll on our family as a unit is beginning to show. I\u2019ve already got calls in to our fabulous pediatrician; I know I can count on her to go to bat for us if we need to be referred outside our state for a second opinion.\u00a0 Yes, one drawback to living in a small state is that all the pediatric otolaryngologists practice in the same facility.\u00a0 Apparently, they also all share one opinion among themselves depending on who\u2019s on the schedule.\u00a0 But I digress. Nik\u2019s insurance demands that we exhaust all possibilities before they will deign to authorize an out-of-area office visit.\u00a0 That means our next step is requesting a sleep study.\u00a0 Call me jaded but I like to think of it as a sleepless study; let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s no way anyone can sleep \u201cnormally\u201d when they\u2019re in a hospital and wired to all sorts of machines \u2014especially  gadget boy  Nik.\u00a0 But it\u2019s one of the hoops we have to jump through before we can make any real progress.

{"date": "March 31, 2011 ", "body": "When it comes to autism awareness and advocacy, I tend to think globally but act locally. I mean, I try to keep up with what\u2019s going on in the bigger picture; after all, my son will one day grow up to be a participant in the world-at-large as he finds his way\u2014 independently or with supports, it\u2019s too soon to say.\u00a0 However, I\u2019m not one for shouting from the rooftops when it comes to building awareness or advocating for my son. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do educate and I do advocate\u2014just with  much less  flair or fanfare. I mean, sheesh, it took me more than a year of lurking on the fringes of our state\u2019s autism organization to finally become a member.\u00a0 That was on Monday\u2014and largely because I wanted to become involved with an event at our state capital on Wednesday and it just didn\u2019t seem right to crash. (Hey, whatever it takes, right?)\u00a0 You see, I\u2019ve struggled for a while with trying to figure out what kind of autism parent I\u2019m supposed to be; then, it dawned on me that I don\u2019t have to choose. I just have to  BE . The catalyst for this enlightenment has been my developing relationship with an amazing group of women who \u2014 gasp \u2014 don\u2019t all share the same beliefs about cause or cure, educational philosophies, medical verses educational approaches.\u00a0 What they\u2014we\u2014 have in common is fierce passion and unyielding love for our children and a willingness to fight for what they need.\u00a0 Some of these women play in \u201cthe big leagues\u201d when it comes to advocacy \u2014they are active in ways I cannot possibly be right now. For a while, I felt guilty because I couldn\u2019t do what they do. All that changed because of a single blue light bulb. Yes, I am referring to the Autism Speaks  \u201cLight it Up Blue\u201d  campaign (LIUB) to raise awareness for  World Autism Awareness Day (WAAD) .\u00a0 If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, please click  here  (but come back!): I decided to participate this year because Nik is growing up.\u00a0 Sure, he\u2019s still the most adorable child I\u2019ve ever known (yes, I am biased\u2014 sue me).\u00a0 But, he isn\u2019t going to stay a small, adorable child for long; I need to know that my child can be a fully participating member of our community and trust that the community will have some greater measure of understanding, acceptance, and \u2014yes, sometimes\u2014 accommodation of Nik and the growing number of children with autism. So, back to how I became a loud-mouth advocate this week. The Home Depot teamed up with Autism Speaks to promote the LIUB campaign by selling specially priced blue light bulbs and blue Coleman lanterns \u2014a portion of the sales is donated to Autism Speaks. Last Thursday, I enthusiastically went to the Home Depot to get my bulbs, thinking that was the end of it.\u00a0 When I got there, I was disappointed to find they not only did not have the bulbs but the employee I spoke with had no idea what I was talking about. I dropped the first pebble in the pond by telling her about LIUB and why it was important to me. As I purchased my not-specially-priced-not-benefiting-anyone-but-Home-Depot bulbs, this kindly woman told me she would do her part by participating on April 2 nd  even if the store was not. I was touched. But I was also frustrated. I came home and started to poke around the Internet to discover that many people were having similar difficulties with their local Home Depot stores. On the heels of a not-insubstantial victory over Parent\u2019s Magazine \u00a0lack of including autism awareness in their April issue (you can read the story  here ,  here ,  here  and  here ), I was inspired to take on HD and AS. How could they have dropped the ball so badly? How could they ask the world to shine a blue light of awareness when they couldn\u2019t even get their own corporate partner to mount a consistent campaign within their own stores? I stewed a bit and had a few distractions with doctor\u2019s appointments and tests for Nik.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Niksdad went back to Home Depot on Sunday for something unrelated; he called to tell me they had the special bulbs in \u2014in a tiny display tucked halfway down the aisle. It felt like insult was being added to injury.\u00a0 Getting to the bottom of this became my personal mission.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it had to wait until after Nik\u2019s MRI on Monday. (Side note: all is fine. Well, if you don\u2019t count the badly deviated septum we discovered, the chronic mastoid inflammation and, possibly, evidence of a future need for braces.) Tuesday morning, I dropped Nik at school and went straight to Home Depot to return the original (expensive) bulbs. I had decided to drop the personal crusade; there are too many other irons in the fire pertaining to Nik\u2019s health and school issues to allow myself to be distracted by something I couldn\u2019t possibly change. Standing at the service desk, processing the return, I noticed a small sign \u2014not much bigger than a half sheet of paper\u2014promoting autism awareness and the LIUB campaign.\u00a0 As the cashier handed me my refund, I asked \u201cSo, do you know about this Light It Up Blue campaign for autism awareness?\u201d She started at me blankly. I felt my inner bull-in-the-china-shop awaken. The cashier\u2019s blank stare was the waving red flag I needed to come to life. I politely told her about World Autism Awareness Day and what the blue light bulbs represented. She had the grace to look chagrined and thanked me. I decided I needed to talk to the manager after all. On the way across the store to find him, I stopped every employee I saw and asked them about LIUB and Autism Awareness. The blank stares and shrugged shoulders were consistent. With each encounter, I could feel my ire rising.\u00a0 I actually pitied the store manager as I mentally prepared what I would say to voice my frustration, anger and disappointment in his failure to educate his employees about such an important companywide endeavor. I was prepared to dislike the guy from the moment I met him\u2014 until I asked if  he  knew the significance of the special display.\u00a0 He admitted that he did not, and then he asked me to educate him.\u00a0 I proceeded to do so for the next thirty minutes.\u00a0 When I left, it was with the promise that I would drop off some talking points for him to share at a staff meeting on Wednesday (yesterday) afternoon.\u00a0 I figured that was about as far as awareness would go, but knew it was a start. Yesterday turned into a busy day full of family advocacy. My husband and I spent time at my son\u2019s school reviewing records in preparation for an upcoming IEP meeting. Then we whisked Nik away with us to Legislative Hall to join in a special autism awareness event and a proclamation in the House of Representatives declaring April as Autism Awareness Month. By the time we were finished at the capitol, Nik was at the end of his tether and having difficulty coping.\u00a0 The State House had been noisy and crowded and the lights did a number on his eyes.\u00a0 Nik was in sensory overload; we think he may have even had a small breakthrough seizure while we were sitting in the gallery. Dashing across town to Home Depot, we decided we would all go in just long enough for the manager to meet Nik; we wanted him to have a face to remember when he talked to his staff about autism awareness.\u00a0 As soon as we arrived, one of the cashiers I had talked to the day before came rushing over to me. \u00a0She was gushing with excitement. \u201cYou know, as soon as you left yesterday, Mr. W. kicked into high-gear about autism awareness day. He checked the inventory of the entire eleven-store region and found out only two stores ever got the bulbs. He called people at corporate, he called suppliers\u2026he went above and beyond and got us all on board. We\u2019re doing some fundraisers besides the blue bulbs \u2014I think I\u2019m making blue cupcakes to sell. He even challenged the other stores in the region to come up with ways they\u2019re going to help raise awareness and funds.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say I staggered and my vision got a little blurry. In those moments after I left his store, the manager could have shrugged it off and blamed someone else \u2014his regional manager, the corporate office, maybe even Autism Speaks\u2014 for the lack of information and understanding.\u00a0 When he discovered that the fine print of the campaign only called for Home Depot to donate up to $80k from the bulb sales (that goal was met on March 17), he could have said  \u201cOh well, maybe next year.\u201d  Instead, he took a stand; he told his company that wasn\u2019t good enough, that it wasn\u2019t just about the money; it\u2019s about raising awareness of and for people who live in our communities. When I offered Mr. W. the two short pages of bullet points for his meeting, he asked if we could stay to kick off the meeting.\u00a0 We walked into a staff room and saw familiar faces \u2014some of you may recall that Niksdad worked at HD while he was going to nursing school.\u00a0 I don\u2019 t remember exactly what I said as I didn\u2019t have any prepared remarks, but I drew upon the fight and the knowledge that I have gained from my fierce warrior mama friends and the love I have for my family and I let the words flow.\u00a0 I shared statistics and answered questions. I was real and honest. I must have done okay because there were questions, there were tears (not mine, for once), and there was a room full of people who understood that what they were doing wasn\u2019t for some nameless, faceless cause, that what they do makes a difference.\u00a0 I let myself simply  BE  Nik\u2019s mom, sharing from my heart and trying to help create that community he needs. Thanks to Mr. W. and his dedicated and caring employees, I suspect there might be more people in my community shining the blue light of awareness this weekend than there would have been just a few days ago. Truthfully? I think my new favorite color just might be orange.

{"date": "March 11, 2010 ", "body": "He presses his tear-stained cheek against my chest, wedging the top of his head with its slightly damp hair under my chin.\u00a0 His delicate fingers toy gently with the drawstring on my sweat jacket; the repetitive motion gives him a focus for his restless energy. Drawing his legs up tightly, he takes my arm and wraps it around them.\u00a0 The pressure of being hugged so firmly provides him with the input he needs to be able to calm himself again. With my left hand resting on his cheek, I begin to stroke behind his ear.\u00a0 I can feel his body gently easing out of fight-mode as his breathing becomes more even.\u00a0 I look down at his sweet face in the dim glow of the night-light; his eyes look up into mine, pleading.\u00a0 Begging me to make the pattern cease once and for all. Thus, does my heart break each night at seven-thirty. It is so difficult for me to reconcile this frantic, frightened child with my sweet boy who once slept like a rock each night.\u00a0 He would practically dive into his crib, pushing me away as I leaned over to stroke his cheek or to sneak in an extra kiss goodnight.\u00a0 Now, it is I who sometimes withdraws as he begins to wail and moan, clutching and clawing at my hands.\u00a0 Begging me not to leave him in the semi-darkness with whatever demons \u2014physical or emotional, real or imagined\u2014 he battles but has not the words to tell me about.\u00a0 What damage is not inflicted by his grasping hands is more than made up for by the guilt in my heart as I close the door on his cries. Thus, does my heart break each night at seven-thirty. I feel his body become limp and heavy in my embrace.\u00a0 And I wait for what seems like an eternity until I am sure he\u2019s sleeping soundly enough that I can put him in his crib.\u00a0 While I wait, I look at the slender fist curled around the drawstring.\u00a0 As I gently disentangle his fingers, I cannot reconcile the soft hand in mine with the fists which strike out at his face in the middle of the night. And yet, the evidence is writ upon his face in a tapestry of scratches and bruises in varying hues of purple, black, blue, green and yellow.\u00a0 Bruises on top of bruises. Scabs on top of scars from the breakdown of his skin each time he jams his face hard into the corner of the crib, the fabric of the protective tent leaving burn marks on his forehead from the pressure. Thus, does my heart break each night at seven-thirty. Most nights I am not successful at transferring his ever-lengthening body into bed without waking him.\u00a0 The clutching and clawing begins anew, accompanied by a plaintive, exhausted wail.\u00a0 I reach into the crib and place one hand on his head, gently stroking near his ear as I firmly place the other one on his bottom and gently rock him side to side.\u00a0 Sometimes, I merely hold him and whisper a soft, repetitive shushing sound.\u00a0 If I\u2019m lucky, I can get him to sleep again in a matter of minutes. The pattern is nearly always the same no matter how many times he wakes in the middle of the night.\u00a0 The moans and wails turn into shrieks of terror or pain.\u00a0 I know not which.\u00a0 The fists begin to fly and his legs kick against the side of the crib with enough force that I fear he will, eventually, break the slats.\u00a0 By the time I am able to reach his side, he is in full-blown panic.\u00a0 Adrenaline pumping, spittle flying as he pummels his face and pokes at his eyes and forehead.\u00a0 Even the sound of my shushing voice and my hands, desperately trying to contain the damage he\u2019s inflicting, are not enough to calm his frenzy. If I can sit him up and put the side of the crib down, I can wrap my arms around him, gently trapping his flailing limbs as I croon soothing sounds into his ear.\u00a0 Eventually, the sobs subside and he simply sits and holds my hands in the darkness as his body shudders with each ragged breath. Thus, does my heart break each night in the middle of the night. He lets me lay him down and put my hands on his head and bottom.\u00a0 The familiar pressure and warmth of my hands seem to soothe him a bit.\u00a0 The familiarity of the hold unnerves me slightly; it transports me back to our days in the NICU.\u00a0 Nik was so fragile that, for months of our two hundred nine-day sojourn, all I could do was gently touch the top of his head and the soles of his feet; anything else was too stimulating, too much for his delicate, underdeveloped body to tolerate. The memories unleash a torrent of grief \u2014like a flash flood moving swiftly and then gone again.\u00a0 I am able to keep the grief at bay most days; there is so much more which demands my attention during waking hours.\u00a0 Here, in the darkness, there is nothing else to occupy my mind and the tears run freely, falling in scalding drops on my arms and hands.\u00a0 Drawing in a shaky breath, I stem the flow and resume my gentle shushing. Often, he will not go back to sleep but is content to sing and coo to himself for a bit until he eventually succumbs to the exhaustion and falls into fitful sleep.\u00a0 I stumble to my bed and sink into sleep until the next wave washes over us and the ritual begins again. Thus, does my heart break each night in cycles. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/spin-cycle/", "title": "Spin cycle"},

On each of our recent trips to the hospital \u2014I should interject here that nearly all of Nik\u2019s doctors practice in the various affiliated clinics; our trips are not of an emergent nature\u2014 Nik has adamantly repeated these two words \u2014sometimes paired together\u2014 as we either wait for our appointment to begin or as we are waiting for the valet attendant to bring the car. \u00a0(What? They offer free valet parking; I\u2019d be a fool not to use it when I can!) \u00a0My poor little guy, has been\u00a0pressing\u00a0those little icons on his talker until his fingertips must ache from the effort it takes to try to make himself understood. Today\u2019s visit was no different. Brown. \u00a0Butterfly. \u00a0Brown, brown, brown. \u00a0Butterfly. Brown. \u00a0Butterfly. I\u00a0wracked\u00a0my brain trying to figure out what he could possibly mean. \u00a0 Is there a song I sing to him with those words in it? Does he want me to sing it? What song is it?Is he asking me to color? Does he want to go see a butterfly? Oh, Baby, Mama doesn\u2019t understand. Help me understand, okay?   His frustration at not being understood was so palpable; my throat ached with unshed tears. What the hell good does it do to have this fancy speech device if he still can\u2019t tell me what he wants?  I felt myself spiraling downward with each digitized utterance. \u00a0 Brown. \u00a0Butterfly. \u00a0Brown. \u00a0Brown. \u00a0Butterfly. \u00a0Butterfly.  Each word a condemnation of my inability to understand my own child, little razors to my heart. Knowing he\u2019d been cooped up in the car and so patient during his appointment and the subsequent scheduling of multiple other appointments, I offered Nik a chance to play on the playground before we strapped ourselves in for another hour on the road. \u00a0He was\u00a0excited\u00a0at the prospect and began to dance what Niksdad and I laughingly refer to as the \u201cexcited pony dance.\u201d \u00a0Smiling and dancing, we headed for the exit. SCREEEEEEEEECH!  CLOSED??\u00a0 What do you mean the playground is closed?  Turns out it\u2019s been so hot that a child got burned while trying to sit on a swing yesterday so the hospital had to close it until the weather cools off a bit. \u00a0Um, yeah. Hello, autism? Meet thwarted expectations and changed plans. \u00a0Let\u2019s just say the next twenty minutes were pretty harrowing and we narrowly avoided a trip to the ER\u2014 a short walk through the parking lot. \u00a0We made it home in better spirits and had an amazing session with a new-to-us speech therapist (very definitely blog-worthy in a separate post). \u00a0The afternoon was smooth sailing. Fast forward to bed time tonight. \u00a0Our evening ritual is very consistent and always involves the use of Nik\u2019s \u201ctalker\u201d so he can tell us \u201cGoodnight, please\u201d or something of that nature. \u00a0Tonight, as he sat snuggled on his papa\u2019s lap \u2014talker balanced on his slender little legs\u2014 I heard one of those damning words again. Brown, brown, brown.    \u201cYou know, honey, he kept saying that at the hospital; I can\u2019t figure out for the life of me what he\u2019s trying to say.\u201d  Niksdad looked as baffled as I was. \u00a0We both sort of figured it was going to remain an enigma. \u00a0Suddenly, a little electronic voice drew back the shroud of mystery: Play. Brown. \u00a0Play. Brown. \u201cOH. MY.GOD! Of course!!!!! How could I not understand!\u201d  My husband looked at me like I had three heads. \u00a0 \u201cHoney, did you hear that? \u00a0Do you get it now?\u201d  Niksdad looked at me blankly. \u00a0I pressed the talk section of the device (which then repeats the whole phrase that\u2019s been entered). \u00a0Nope, still blank. I sighed and said  \u201cPut one finger in your ear and imagine what Nik might hear\u201d  and I pressed the buttons again.  Play. Brown. \u00a0Play. Brown.   \u201cIt\u2019s playground! He\u2019s been trying to tell me PLAY-GROUND! \u00a0Brown must sound like  ground  to him.\u201d Nik smiled\u00a0beatifically as my heart flipped in my chest. \u00a0Slightly weepy but\u00a0exhilarated, we carried our sleepy boy up to bed. \u00a0As we came back downstairs to the playroom, it struck me:  BUTTERFLY! OF COURSE! \u201cHoney, do you say a particular phrase to Nik when you go to the park? Like \u201cDo you want to slide?\u201d  Niksdad said  \u201cSometimes. \u00a0Or I\u2019ll ask if he wants to climb. Why?\u201d Go ahead, put your finger in one ear and then say the phrase \u201cwant to slide\u201d or \u201cwant to climb\u201d with a moderately\u00a0elided\u00a0pronunciation. \u00a0Imagine what it might sound like to a child with, perhaps, moderately impaired hearing. \u00a0Do you hear it?

As in  we-may-be-hitting-the-beach-this-summer  kind of major way. (Insert quiet, hopeful SQUEEEEEEE!) \n \n Nik\u2019s learning to play in my sister\u2019s pool without his swim vest. \u00a0As long as he has his arm floats, he does just fine. He can now doggie paddle the length of the pool a couple of times over. The boy adores the water, for sure! Nearly every day the first words out of his talker are  \u201cGo swimming. Cool. \u201d \u00a0Yes, we\u2019ve figured it out; he really does say  cool  when he means  pool . \u00a0Sometimes he\u2019ll even voice the \u201cpuh\u201d before touching the button for cool.

Which, no surprise, also correlates directly to broken sleep. GAH! With this latest heat wave, we\u2019re willing to forego some sleep in order to satisfy the boy\u2019s pool cravings. \n \n And, last but most definitely not least,  Nik has returned to school . \u00a0Today was his first (part) day. \u00a0This topic merits a separate post for so many reasons. \u00a0For now, though, suffice to say it\u2019s not a perfect situation but it\u2019s  so much better than we could have anticipated . \u00a0Where we once felt sick and hopeless about the idea of putting Nik back in school, there\u2019s now a glimmer of hope. \u00a0It may be elusive\u2014 like that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow\u2014 but we\u2019re going to chase after it with all we\u2019ve got. \n We\u2019re ready, Nik\u2019s ready. \u00a0 I hope school\u2019s ready for him!

In a flash of panic it registered.  Shit! I forgot to tether the gate! I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be gone more than an instant, saying goodbye to my mother in the driveway, when the police officer pulled up outside.\u00a0 We live on a cul-de-sac and have had some problems with our next door neighbor on one side.\u00a0 In fact, the whole\u00a0court has had\u00a0problems with this same neighbor which is why the police\u00a0were involved; one of the elderly neighbors on the other side of us must have called them.

NIKOLAS!!\u00a0 NIKOLAS\u00a0ERIK!!\u00a0  My throat was raw.\u00a0 I screamed as my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest.\u00a0 I dashed across the top of the stairs to the loft, quickly scanning to make sure he wasn\u2019t under his father\u2019s desk or sitting atop the cat climber \u2014nearly twelve feet above the playroom floor below.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s vision and depth perception would not keep him from attempting to climb over the railing to the room below.\u00a0 Not even realizing I\u2019d been holding my breath, I let out a sigh of relief when I saw the loft was empty.\u00a0 That\u2019s when the sound of the shower in the master bathroom invaded my consciousness.\u00a0 Somehow, Nik had managed to slip through the very short bungee cord tether we use to keep the cats out (but let air circulate through) and got into our bathroom to play in the shower.\u00a0 When I got to him, he was partly dressed \u2014shirt askew around his neck and pants and pull-up around his ankles.\u00a0 The shower was running at full pressure \u2014Nik having opened both valves completely\u2014spraying all over the bathroom walls and floor as the door was fully open. Nik was merrily humming quietly to himself.\u00a0 The cordless telephone was clutched\u00a0in his hand as it hovered over the toilet bowl.\u00a0 I grabbed the phone and then pulled Nik away from the toilet.\u00a0 He was soaked.\u00a0 The floor was drenched.\u00a0 Lined up on the countertop were the other handset to the phone and the digital camera with the battery compartment wide open \u2014and empty.\u00a0 I looked into the toilet to see just what he\u2019d done.\u00a0 Floating inside were my husband\u2019s hairbrush, one of my hair styling brushes, the nailbrush which sits by the sink, and the batteries from the camera.\u00a0 (Thank goodness he hadn\u2019t flushed!)\u00a0 I felt my heart unclench in my chest and my breathing became regular again.\u00a0 Sinking to my knees, I gathered my sopping wet son into my arms, kissing his head.\u00a0 The tears fell fast and hard on his head but I don\u2019t think he noticed; his hair was already wet.\u00a0  Baby, you scared Mama so bad.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t do that again, sweetie, ok?, \u00a0 I choked through my tears. I stripped my wet boy down and took him to the hall bath to let him play in a tub full of warm water.\u00a0 As he splashed and sang to his bathtub letters, I kept repeating to myself,  It\u2019s only stuff.\u00a0 It\u2019s only stuff .

{"date": "February 14, 2010 ", "body": "Valentine\u2019s Day.\u00a0 A time for romance, for hearts and flowers, extravagant gestures of undying love and devotion.\u00a0 A time to really show your loved ones how much they mean to you.\u00a0 This year, I say skip the candy and jewelry, the flowers and dinners.\u00a0 Instead, do something lasting and truly meaningful\u2026create your living will as part of your advance directives for medical care.\u00a0 Yes, I did just suggest you sit down and write down your wishes should you become incapacitated to the point that you are unable to make your wishes known while in the hospital in the middle of a life-altering,\u00a0potentially life-threatening crisis.\u00a0 If you want to show your loved ones how much they matter to you, do something  now  to prevent them from ever\u00a0having to fight the medical establishment to honor your wishes. What prompted this unorthodox \u2014and unromantic\u2014declaration from me today?\u00a0 My sister and her in-laws are, this very minute, in a meeting with hospital officials to discuss the possible fate of their youngest family member.\u00a0 He\u2019s forty, perhaps not the picture of perfect fitness and health and, certainly, a man living with personal demons.\u00a0 Who among us isn\u2019t, really?\u00a0 This man is also a beloved brother, son, uncle, friend to many.\u00a0 He is sweet and gentle-natured and has been known to give away his money, his possessions, his time to those in need.\u00a0 He has a reputation for putting others before him. Friday morning, this man was found unconscious in his home and was rushed to the hospital.\u00a0 No one knows exactly what happened except that he is now in a coma fighting for his life.\u00a0 He suffered massive internal bleeding, is on the verge of multiple organ failure, and has questionable brain function beyond pure brain stem activity (which allows one to breathe).\u00a0 If he survives, he may never be the man his family and friends knew. Because he did not have a living will or advance directives indicating his wishes for care, the hospital must do absolutely everything in their power to try to keep this person alive \u2014significant amounts of blood and plasma, tests and procedures, mechanical ventilation, mechanical feeding, medications, intensive care facilities, respiratory therapists\u2026and on and on.\u00a0 The hospital\u2019s efforts are contrary to the family\u2019s wishes; the grief and shock the family is experiencing is beyond awful as they must watch and wait.\u00a0 Hoping and praying that his damaged body will let go on its own. Let me be clear; the doctors all agree that this man\u2019s life will never be the same.\u00a0 He will be alive but may be\u00a0in a permanent state of complete disability and utter dependence on artificial\u00a0 supports for nearly all bodily functions.\u00a0 However, the law stipulates (and the lawyers admonish heartily) that the hospital must do all it can to preserve the life of this man.\u00a0 Had there been an advance directive,\u00a0 the situation would be very different. This situation strikes too close for comfort, I know.\u00a0 People don\u2019t like to think about their mortality.\u00a0 Certainly, no one likes to think about the possibility that they could suffer a sudden accident or illness which would leave them unable to communicate their wishes.\u00a0 Take the time now, while you are healthy and able, to discuss your wishes with loved ones and to commit them to an actual legal document.\u00a0 It\u2019s simple to do, though certainly not easy to think about.\u00a0 Niksdad and I had a lengthy discussion about this last night; it left us both raw and gave us much to think about.\u00a0 There are so many shades of gray and unanswerable questions; I think that is why most people avoid the topic entirely.\u00a0 DON\u2019T. You will save a world of heartache for those you love and who love you. ********** Advance directives are comprised\u00a0of three elements: the living will, a medical power of attorney, and a Do Not Resuscitate\u00a0order (DNR).\u00a0 Some states honor living wills without the need for a medical\u00a0power of attorney (California does not). The Mayo Clinic web site has a good overview of the topic  here . \u00a0Find out more about advance directives and the laws in your state.\u00a0 The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization has free forms on  its web site .

Today .] Nik slept through most of the night; he woke for about an hour at 11:00 p.m. last night, asked for his book and had a temper tantrum when he did not receive it. (Tough luck, kiddo.)\u00a0 I feel compelled to add that Niksdad and I lay in bed  chortling with glee  at both the impressive display of vocal\u00a0histrionics coming through the monitor and the fact that this behavior was so, well,  normal . Nik went back to sleep around midnight and proceeded to sleep straight through until 8:15 this morning.\u00a0 No, that\u2019s not a typo.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve had a few of those kinds of nights in a row now.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t mentioned it for fear of incurring the wrath of the sleep gods, but I honestly wonder if we\u2019re turning a corner.\u00a0 To say the benefits of good sleep are plentiful would be a gross understatement.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s been eating better, playing more happily, cooperating more readily ( swoon ).\u00a0 The leaps he\u2019s making in communication have just blown us away. Today, Nik managed to get his pants on  and  pulled up all by himself.\u00a0 That alone is a herculean task for a child who has poor fine motor control, serious attention wanderings, and who won\u2019t generally use both hands at the same time.\u00a0 Oh, and he had to put down his beloved letters in order to do so.\u00a0 HUGE. Many of you know that we recently got Nik\u2019s speech-generating device.\u00a0 It\u2019s been challenging to figure out how to tell you more about it since I am still learning \u201cbest practices\u201d for implementing it and teaching Nik how to access what he wants to say.\u00a0 It\u2019s somewhat akin to giving a brand new reader the entire  Encyclopedia Britannica  and asking them to find the section on aardvarks. Overwhelming. Nik \u2014being, well,\u00a0Nik\u2014 seems to have already figured out some of it for himself.\u00a0 Just this morning he wandered over to his  \u201cgreen box of words\u201d , turned it on by himself and proceeded to touch all the food choices to let me know he was ready for breakfast!\u00a0 Granted, we had a few months\u2019 worth of trials with a loaner so this is not completely new to us,\u00a0 but Nik has been exploring and finding new words and trying them on for size.\u00a0 I give him feedback for each word, trying to help him see that it\u2019s not just a sound.\u00a0 Nik is discovering the power of communication.\u00a0 He\u2019s also realizing that it\u2019s a reciprocal activity requiring a partner.\u00a0 If I leave his device turned on and accessible to him while he\u2019s playing, Nik shows little to no interest in exploring, unless he has something to say.\u00a0 He already recognizes that this magical box is not a toy. Ha! As I was writing the above paragraph? Nik turned on his device and told me he was hungry.\u00a0 Using the  actual  word \u201chungry.\u201d The\u00a0boy is voracious \u2014 not just for food .\u00a0 He\u2019s on a quest to learn all about the world around him and how to be in it, how to master skills to build on.\u00a0 He  wants  to be with people and be social\u2014he just needs our help in learning how to do that.\u00a0 He has so much going on inside his beautiful head but doesn\u2019t know how to get it out there.\u00a0 That\u2019s my job \u2014to help him find his voice.\u00a0  To empower him to tell us who he is, how he feels, what he thinks.

Toss into the mix the fact that Nik is not ony not sleeping through the night, but he\u2019s getting more and more  agitated \u00a0each night that he is unable to sleep.\u00a0 The poor kiddo  wants  to sleep in the worst way.\u00a0 Last night, as he fought to go back to sleep for nearly four hours, he alternated between\u00a0lying in his crib, sobbing and punching himself in the head, and sitting up \u2014also sobbing\u2014 and banging his head against the crib.\u00a0 He would calm himself down and lay down to go to sleep only to be sobbing twenty minutes later.\u00a0 It\u2019s been heart-wrenching \u2014and beyond exhausting. Those of you who\u2019ve followed our story for some time already know that we use melatonin, we\u2019ve tried a variety of medications, relaxation techniques, etcetera. Nothing works.\u00a0 The bigger he gets the worse it gets.\u00a0 Now, the patterns of disrupted sleep even show up on his EEG\u2019s.\u00a0  Sleep Maintenance Insomnia \u00a0is the official diagnosis.\u00a0 I kid you not; there is such a medical diagnosis and it\u2019s actually fairly well-studied, documented and classified.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not a good thing for an already undersized, developmentally delayed child with growth issues.\u00a0 The human body does most of its growth and repair during sleep; children Nik\u2019s age should be getting an average of ten hours uninterrupted sleep per night.\u00a0 On a good night, Nik will get about three and a half hours in before he wakes.\u00a0 Some nights he\u2019s only awake for a short while \u2014twenty to forty minutes.\u00a0 Others, like the last three nights in a row, he is awake for just as long as he has been asleep. Tonight, we began a trial of clonidine at bedtime.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been reluctant to use it because of Nik\u2019s history of rebounds and adverse or paradoxical responses to nearly all medications which alter the balance of his central nervous system.\u00a0  Desperate times call for desperate measures.\u00a0  I am worried that we\u2019ll see a lot of grogginess tomorrow \u2014and probably some significant behavioral challenges.\u00a0 But, you know, I think I can handle those if I\u2019ve actually gotten a good night\u2019s sleep.

We opted to hold off on the clonidine\u00a0again until we speak with our neurologist and get a clearer plan in place and set some parameters about how long we need to give the clonidine before we call it a bust. We\u2019 have gotten some good feedback and suggestions from many sources about possible medications to explore.\u00a0 At this point, though, we are very limited in what we can give Nik because of his swallowing difficulties.\u00a0 If it can\u2019t be crushed or chewed, mixed in with food, or doesn\u2019t come in a liquid form we can\u2019t try it with Nik right now.\u00a0 This rules out some of the medications we\u2019ve heard so many good things about,\u00a0relatively speaking.

All I know is that I no longer just look at the sky and see blue.\u00a0 I start to notice textures and nuances.\u00a0 I look at my son playing with a toy and see more than a happy child; I see his highly inquisitive mind taking it all in and analyzing what he\u2019s experiencing.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have words yet to talk about these things together so we simply do them.\u00a0 But we\u2019re learning together that science isn\u2019t always about the complicated math and the space travel. WhyMommy has reopened my eyes to the beauty and wonder of the science of everyday life.\u00a0 She\u2019s rekindled my own curiosity and inspires me to foster my son\u2019s.\u00a0 I may not ever be a rocket scientist, but I don\u2019t have to be afraid of science anymore either.

Never is a long, undependable time, and life is too full of rich possibilities to have restrictions placed upon it.\u201d   \n ~ Gloria Swanson \u00a0 When my son was about three years old, we spent the night in the hospital\u00a0for a video-monitored EEG.\u00a0 The EEG was actually ancillary to the reason we were in the hospital in the first place as he had been very ill with some sort of gastroenteritis and was very dehydrated to the point of needing intravenous fluids.\u00a0 This was not our first hospital stay; my son was born extremely prematurely ans spent the first 209 days in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\u00a0 He has gone through more surgical procedures than most people endure in a very long lifetime.\u00a0 Thus, he\u00a0is no stranger to the invasive procedures inherent in a hospital stay.\u00a0 He is also a trooper, putting up with things most of us would whine about. On this particular stay, he suffered the indignities of being swaddled into a papoose board to allow the EEG technicians greater access and cooperation for placing the leads.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever had an EEG, you know the leads are numerous and the goop used to hold them in place is sticky.\u00a0 A twenty-four hour EEG in the hospital is worse; the leads are held in place with the medical equivalent of model airplane glue which is dried with a hair dryer.\u00a0 Did I mention, there\u2019s somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty electrodes or more used for an EEG.\u00a0 Did I also mention that my son hates to be restrained in any way? My poor boy fought so hard that he actually got a hand free from the swaddling \u2014ripping out an IV line in the process.\u00a0 He never said a word through it all.\u00a0 (Why would he? \u00a0He\u2019s nonverbal.)\u00a0 He kicked and screamed to bring the house down but  he never said a word . The following morning, my indignant child \u2014who also was unable to stand on his own at this point in time\u2014 badly needed a bath.\u00a0 His hair looked like it had been styled with an egg beater and glue and there were smears of dried blood on his arms and torso.\u00a0 One of the very kind nurses offered to let us use the bathtub in the therapy room because it was big enough if I needed to get in\u00a0with my son; it was our first time ever trying a bath in a real tub.\u00a0 Nik was small enough that we were still using an infant tub at home for the convenience and security; his trunk control wasn\u2019t strong then and we feared he might topple over in a regular tub so we\u2019d simply never tried.\u00a0 Despite the larger tub, I was fairly confident that this would be a simple enough procedure as my boy always loved bath time. Never was a mother\u2019s intuition more wrong than that morning. \u00a0 The moment I placed my naked, filthy child in the tub \u2014just to let him feel how it was different from his tub at home (and with no water in it yet)\u2014 he catapulted himself\u00a0 to\u00a0 a standing position holding on to the side of the tub and\u00a0 said  screamed\u00a0the first and only word I had ever heard him utter.  \u201cNO!\u201d \u00a0 The nurse chuckled and said  \u201cI thought you said he doesn\u2019t talk.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d  I stammered.\u00a0 We spent the next hour trying to calm him and clean him up as best we could before heading home.\u00a0 * * * * * * Time is a great equalizer and many things have come to pass which we never thought we\u2019d see.\u00a0 My son began walking shortly before his fourth birthday.\u00a0 In the blink of an eye, Nik seemed to go from a non-ambulatory child to the fastest of runners and most agile of climbers.\u00a0 He even learned to love the water again by spending countless hours in my sister\u2019s swimming pool over the intervening summers\u2014 many of those hours spent screaming and clinging to me or Niksdad.\u00a0 He\u2019s even learned to like baths once more and would be happy to play in the water long after it\u2019s turned cold and his fingers and toes have gone wrinkly. But, seriously?\u00a0 Nothing could have prepared me for yesterday. * * * * * * It\u00a0was an unseasonably warm day filled with tremendous noise and disruption which kept Nik off-kilter all day.\u00a0 A crew was working to replace the roof on our home; it was noisy and the house had been tented to protect it from the debris being ripped off the roof.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s\u00a0usually quiet, bright play area was anything but.\u00a0 Despite it all, Nik seemed pretty sanguine about it all\u2014 at first.\u00a0\u00a0As the day wore on, we could sense the tension in our son though we would have been hard pressed to identify anything more specific. \u00a0 Niksdad spirited Nik away for some quiet time at the park.\u00a0 Despite Nik\u2019s apparent\u00a0imperviousness to\u00a0all the noise, we could tell the disruption was taking a toll by the way he was perseverating on specific things which he hasn\u2019t for a long time.\u00a0 It was definitely time for a getaway!\u00a0 Despite falling asleep in the car on the trip home from the park, Nik was in better spirits when they returned.\u00a0 He was also badly in need of a bath.\u00a0 My husband removed Nik\u2019s shoes and orthotics in preparation for \u201cthe b-word.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cAre you ready to go take a bath, little buddy?\u201d  Nik squealed (nearly a shriek!) and began to dance in place like an excited pony.\u00a0 Then, he  bolted  from the room, making a beeline for the stairs.\u00a0 He paused just long enough to grab his daddy\u2019s hand to pull him along.\u00a0 My six-foot-one husband had a hard time keeping up. It was one of those rare moments when so many things come together in an instant, so many skills taken for granted: * comprehending the question \n* motor planning and coordination \n* desire to share the experience (of the bath) \n* recognition of that desire \n* appropriate interaction to request company \n* expressing emotion appropriate to the situation I wish I\u2019d had my video camera at the ready.\u00a0 Instead, all I could do was laugh.\u00a0 And marvel.

{"date": "April 26, 2010 ", "body": "Who am I? Before my son was born, I had a career.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a stellar, glamorous career but it was steady work doing something I\u2019m good at, something for which I was appreciated and valued and which gave me a certain measure of latitude in my days and weeks.\u00a0 When I became pregnant, I was a very high-risk patient due to my age and my reproductive history of miscarriages and infertility.\u00a0 I was put on \u201cmodified rest\u201d and highly restricted activity \u2014definitely no thirteen hour days commuting into the city, managing the stressful details of running an office and juggling the demands of multiple executives.\u00a0 Through my entire first trimester, I managed to stay in contact with my office and keep things running as best as I could through conference calls and emails. At the end of my first trimester, my new obstetrician gave me the thumbs up to return to work.\u00a0 I was relieved and felt a renewed sense of purpose each day.\u00a0 My plan was to return to work just a few months after the baby was born.\u00a0 Life, as it turns out, had other plans for me. Nik was born at twenty-seven weeks.\u00a0 Because of a previously unknown uterine anomaly, his growth had been restricted and he was the size of a 23 or 24 week fetus.\u00a0 He weighed in at a whopping 530 grams at birth \u2014including the breathing tube and apparatus to hold it onto his impossibly tiny face.\u00a0 One pound, two and five-eighths ounces of determined fighter.\u00a0 He turned my world upside down in ways I haven\u2019t even begun to identify! Two hundred nine days in the NICU, countless operations and ongoing interventions.\u00a0 It became glaringly clear that my work days were over for the foreseeable future.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s needs were too great and the cost of childcare too steep.\u00a0 My fulltime job became \u201cmom\u201d; my new boss had me wrapped around his little finger. \u00a0Somewhere along the line, I just assumed that I would return to the work force eventually \u2014once Nik was \u201chealthier\u201d or when he went to school.\u00a0 My husband and I had discussed the fact that we probably couldn\u2019t survive for long on just one income. Fast forward six years.\u00a0 Many twists and turns in our journey have led us to a new home, a new career for my husband \u2014who is about to return to school to advance that career further\u2014 and the unexpected decision to home school our son.\u00a0 His needs are still very great and the cost of specialty care is prohibitive.\u00a0 We cannot afford a private school but I am no longer able to juggle the constant demands of his safety and education with running a household, being a wife, being a mother and trying to make it all work.\u00a0 Something has to give. That something, historically, has been me.\u00a0 Tonight, as my husband and I discussed the next stage in his career development, it finally hit me; I\u2019m not ever going back to work in the way I once imagined.\u00a0 My husband\u2019s school program will take another two to two and a half years at which point I will be nearly fifty.\u00a0 Ten years out of the work world.\u00a0 Ten years out of the loop of, well, everything that doesn\u2019t somehow revolve around parenting a child with multiple disabilities or being a wife.\u00a0 Make no mistake, I do not devalue those things at all \u2014they are a vital part of who I am. However, tonight, it felt like the paradigm of my future that I\u2019ve held for so long simply vanished in a puff of smoke.\u00a0 I am left feeling lost.\u00a0 Who am I? What will I do?\u00a0 Who do I want to be outside of my roles as wife and mother?\u00a0 Is this all there is? I don\u2019t have any answers yet; I suspect I won\u2019t for a long while.\u00a0 But I do know that I need a plan for my here-and-now to make sure that something anchors me, fills me up.\u00a0 Something gives me a sense of self outside my family, a sense of purpose.\u00a0 Something to look forward to that is just for me.

{"date": "August 1, 2010 ", "body": "\n I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in the feeling that this life of parenting a child with disabilities and special needs is a bit like trying to ride a wild pony, unbroken to saddle. \u00a0There are the moments which leave you feeling breathless and sweating with fear and panic. \u00a0Then there are the sweet moments when you can feel the pony gentling under your touch, surrendering to the saddle and bridle. \u00a0The transition to the knowing and trusting of your guiding hands. \u00a0The process is at once exhausting and quite satisfying. \n This past week began with the wild, sweaty, panicky struggle. \u00a0The kind which makes you fear you are in so far over your head that the pony may break you, instead. \n ***************************** \n Nik\u2019s been struggling with some odd gastric distress which, we have (we think) figured out is the result of either an enzyme deficiency or other metabolic process which is then complicated by his highly unusual intestinal layout. \u00a0In any case, the treatment we\u2019ve been using \u2014until we can have our suspicions confirmed by a specialist, is dietary modification. \u00a0To make a very long story\u2014  it\u2019s taken us nearly three years to figure things out while our boys has suffered \u2014 slightly shorter: \n We\u2019ve recently discovered that the very medication which is supposed to be helping Nik\u2019s nocturnal pains may have been contributing to them. Nice, huh? \u00a0So we began the process of weaning the medication. A bit faster than we should have. \n The first couple of days went fine; we\u2019d forgotten to take into account the beauty of half-lives. \u00a0On Wednesday, the shit hit the fan. \u00a0The out of control behaviors, the frantic inability to cope with the merest of frustrations, the escalating self-injurious behaviors. \u00a0My nerves were pretty much frayed. \n ***************************** \n Wednesday afternoon, we ventured up to the hospital (home of nearly all Nik\u2019s specialists) for our post-neuropsych evaluation conference. \u00a0Both Niksdad and I had been wondering how things would go; were the doctors impressed with Nik\u2019s ability to use his talker? His stellar sorting and matching abilities? \u00a0Or would they be wholly unimpressed at Nik\u2019s trenchant refusal to play the evaluation \u201cgame\u201d the way they required him to do? \u00a0Would they see the kernels of brilliance everyone else sees in Nik? \u00a0Or would they see his deficits starkly laid out in check-list fashion? \n ***************************** \n \u201cMr. and Mrs. Niksparents, we know this is only one snapshot in time, one data set, but we think it\u2019s a fairly accurate reflection of where Nik is right now. \u00a0Our findings lead us to think that, while he certainly has many autistic characteristics and warrants a PDD-NOS diagnosis, his\u00a0intent to communicate, his desire to connect with people\u00a0just don\u2019t fit the criteria for an actual autism diagnosis.\u201d \n Oh, okay. Well, we can certainly understand that reasoning and kind of agree. \u00a0Though, to be honest, his communication is a bit on the perseverative side and his desire to interact is significantly greater than his\u00a0 ability  to do so appropriately. \u00a0But, those things can be worked on, right? \n \u201cNik\u2019s been characterized as having\u00a0\u2018global developmental delays\u2019, but, really he\u2019s outgrown all that the term implies,\u201d she continued. \u00a0\u201cWhen we think of delays, we reasonably assume that a child will, eventually catch up with their peers. \u00a0In Nik\u2019s case, he seems to be falling further behind his age group. \u00a0Consequently, we\u00a0really\u00a0feel the diagnosis which best fits Nik is, well,\u00a0MR.\u201d \n MR? \n M.R? \u00a0As in\u00a0 \u201cmental retardation?\u201d \n My stomach lurched and I could no longer seem to draw enough air to breathe, let alone speak. \n (We did not discuss the actual testing and quite where and how Nik fell in the ranges, but it was clear that he had not been able to show what we perceive as his true abilities on that long, long morning back in June.) \n Nik\u2019s current state of mild withdrawal symptoms from his Neurontin didn\u2019t help as I found myself\u00a0desperately\u00a0trying to get him to show just how smart he was with his talker, just how much he could express of the things he\u2019s learned. \u00a0Had it been a movie, the whole scene would\u2019ve had the viewer squirming uncomfortably in their seat, rooting for the little boy to\u00a0 \u201cshow those doctors how wrong they are about him!\u201d \n It was not a film. \u00a0There was no carefully scripted happy ending in sight. \n ***************************** \n Instead, we discussed things like respite care, SSI benefits, the ARC, educational supports, Nik\u2019s hyperactivity and the exhausting toll it\u2019s taking on our family. \u00a0The doctor encouraged us to get a second opinion from a psychiatrist who could also help us with Nik\u2019s medication management. \u00a0It felt as if we had crawled across the sand in the desert toward an oasis only to discover ourselves in the middle of a maze made of concertina wire and we were supposed to find our way out. \u00a0Blindfolded. \n For the first time\u00a0ever\u00a0in my child\u2019s life, I felt physically ill at the prospects which were being laid before us. \u00a0 I didn\u2019t feel this intense sense of loss and despair when he was born three months early, weighing barely more than a pound. \u00a0 Nor when he had his first heart surgery at just nineteen days, or his third \u2014open heart surgery\u2014when he was mere months old. \u00a0Through all the medical procedures, the interventions, the fears that he might never walk \u2014even his inability to speak\u2014 I have never felt so\u00a0devastated\u00a0as I did on Wednesday. \n I knew in my heart that they had to be wrong. \u00a0Nik\u2019s never been good at testing in brand new environments or with new people. \u00a0Once he\u2019s explored and taken it all in, only then will he open up and show his true abilities. \u00a0But, hearing the doctor talk about the\u201d significant\u00a0brain damage\u201d  which had taken place either  in utero  or at birth \u2014 the thin corpus callosum, the gaping holes in the white matter, the enlarged ventricles \u2014brought me up short. \n No one had ever laid things out so bluntly, so starkly for us. \u00a0 I\u00a0know\u00a0my son has brain damage; that\u2019s not news to me . \u00a0I have chosen to not focus on it simply because, well, I guess I was afraid to give it power. \u00a0I\u00a0see\u00a0the great progress Nik makes when he works so hard. \u00a0But I also see his constant struggles with focus, sensory regulation\u2026a host of things. \u00a0I know how much support it takes for Nik to be able to make those gains. \u00a0I also\u00a0know the brain is highly plastic and can compensate in remarkable ways; I have seen it in my own child over the years; he has constantly amazed us all. \n But the ugly, evil crone\u2019s voice in \u00a0my head won\u2019t shut up now.  \u201cWhat if they\u2019re right? \u00a0What if they\u2019re right?\u201d \n The fear that I may simply be naive and overly optimistic battles fiercely with the\u00a0to-my-core\u00a0belief that they are wrong. \u00a0Dead wrong. \u00a0Still, the crone whispers in my ear in the dark of night. \n ***************************** \n Next:\u00a0 Riding the wild pony: trusting. \n Also known as \u201cHow things have a funny way of working out.\u201d \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/riding-a-wild-pony-breaking/", "title": "Riding a wild pony:\u00a0breaking"},
{"date": "August 3, 2010 ", "body": "As I wrote in my previous post\u2014 I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in the feeling that this life of parenting a child with disabilities and special needs is a bit like trying to ride a wild pony, unbroken to saddle. \u00a0There are the moments which leave you feeling breathless and sweating with fear and panic. \u00a0Then there are the sweet moments when you can feel the pony gentling under your touch, surrendering to the saddle and bridle. \u00a0The transition to the knowing and trusting of your guiding hands. \u00a0The process is at once exhausting and quite satisfying. \n This past week began with the wild, sweaty, panicky struggle. \u00a0The kind which makes you fear you are in so far over your head that the pony may break you, instead. \n (Read the rest of the beginning of the story  here .) ***************************** In breaking a horse, as in taming any wild creature, if you lose your nerve or doubt yourself for even a fraction of a second, the cost can be steep. \u00a0I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to let that happen; too much rides on my ability to shake of the fear, dust myself off and keep going. It took me a few days and some offline communications with several people to help me find my way back to sold footing\u2014 to my core belief in possibilities and hope, but I can say with confidence that I\u2019m there. \u00a0Friends have been loving and supportive in voicing\u00a0their\u00a0\u00a0belief in Nik and his brilliance \u2014it\u2019s why I love my friends (yes, even those of you to whom I did NOT reach out; I know you would\u2019ve said many of the same things though, thanks!). The most uplifting commentary came from an assistive technology specialist \u2014the guy who willingly dropped everything on Friday to set up a touch-screen computer for Nik to try for a month. \u00a0He had just been talking to Nik\u2019s speech therapist that morning (they were in a meeting together, I think) about Nik\u2019s creative use of language such as\u00a0 brown butterfly . While we were talking on the phone, he told me about the conversation and how incredibly \u201cbrilliant\u201d (his word) Nik is. \u00a0I chuckled, took a deep breath and told him about our recent diagnosis. \u00a0The silence from the other end of the phone was deafening. \u00a0I heard an intake of breath, then his voice boomed through the receiver.  \u201cThere must be something wrong with \u00a0my phone; I thought you said something else!\u201d We laughed and my heart lightened considerably. Surely, the people who know my son, who have watched him learn and grow and outsmart us all over the years aren\u2019t as naively optimistic as I? \u00a0I\u2019m sure they are not, yet I cannot completely silence the crone as she whispers in my ear every so often. It seems there is one very powerful antidote to the whispering, though. That is Nik himself. \u00a0It seems, no matter what the stakes, he always comes through even when those around him are certain he will not. ***************************** Shortly after his frighteningly premature birth and all its incipient anxiety, some of the NICU nurses advised us not to decorate the nursery or buy anything new just yet. \u00a0The message was clear; they weren\u2019t sure our son would pull through and survive his first twenty-four hours. \u00a0Niksdad and I refused to live in fear and had already decorated most of the nursery anyway. \u00a0I remember sitting at the side of Nik\u2019s isolette for hours, my meticulously scrubbed hands inside, cradling his impossibly tiny head and gently cupping his bottom. \u00a0My face pressed against\u00a0the\u00a0glass as silent tears spilled onto my lap. \u201cYou\u2019re the best thing your Daddy and I have ever done, Nikolas. \u00a0You are so loved and wanted; so special and smart and strong. \u00a0You keep fighting, baby; Mama\u2019s right here. \u00a0I\u2019m not going away.\u201d Through it all, Nik defied the odds and surpassed the expectations of every professional he met. \u00a0Through the surgeries (there were four in as many months), through all two hundred-nine days of his hospitalization, through the transfers back and forth between the cushy suburban hospital where he was born and the grittier inner-city specialty hospital where we ended up staying due to the complexities of his care \u2014Nik was constant, determined. \u00a0A fighter. ***************************** I watch in awe as my nonverbal boy\u2019s fingers fly through the screens on his speech device (his \u201ctalker\u201d). \u00a0With barely a glance, he is able to tell me he is hungry and wants an egg-salad sandwich (he even remembers to use his manners most of the time). \u00a0Or that he wants to go to the beach, the pool, the playground or even school. \u00a0And I know, without a doubt, that these are not random utterances, nor are they rote as had been suggested by one of the doctors. In fact, Nik\u2019s\u00a0mastery of this complex, sequenced speech-generating device has been inspiring to watch. \u00a0One of the speech therapists working with Nik this summer has been amazed at the speed with which his mind must process things. \u00a0She told us one day what seems to us to be random exploration of icons and seemingly unrelated words is, in fact, evidence of Nik\u2019s lightning processing of new vocabulary. \u00a0He may not know what it all means and how to use it yet \u2014that\u2019s part of our job (and school\u2019s) to teach him, but he is filing away the knowledge so he can call upon it when needed. She, too, was speechless when we shared Nik\u2019s recent diagnosis. ***************************** After the initial shock of the doctor\u2019s pronouncement had worn off, Niksdad, Nik and I all got back to the business of living; no time to wallow in the fear and anxiety. \u00a0I have not contacted the ARC or set up an appointment with SSI yet \u2014I\u2019ll get around to it eventually. \u00a0I have not shared the diagnosis with school \u2014yet; I am concerned that the label will become an insurmountable barrier to getting my smart, determined child included in a general education Kindergarten program on even a part-time basis. So, what have I done instead? Well, for starters, I picked up that touch-screen tablet PC to try for a month. \u00a0I\u2019m researching classroom techniques to try with Nik so that I can video tape his progress to show the eligibility/IEP team when we meet on August 17th. \u00a0I want them to see that, while he may  test  poorly,  Nik is both\u00a0interested in\u00a0and capable of doing the work to learn . \u00a0I\u2019m putting out feelers for an advocate, too. \u00a0I\u2019m assuming we will need someone more objective to help us navigate what is certain to be a less than straightforward path to Nik\u2019s education. I\u2019m putting my feelings and my fears out there for you to read. \u00a0The support and insights you\u2019ve given me have been so valuable and have meant so much to me. \u00a0Your stories of having \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d and your children\u2019s progress you have shared\u2014 all of it has let me know that not only am I not alone, I am not delusional. \u00a0You, too are helping to mute the crone\u2019s voice. ***************************** Part of the business of living, this week anyway, has actually included, well, living. \u00a0Like a normal family. \u00a0Well, okay, a normal family with special considerations. \u00a0But we\u2019ve been doing lots more of it since Nik got his speech device. \u00a0We\u2019ve been expanding our horizons, expanding Nik\u2019s horizons. Many of you know that it has taken us years to help Nik learn to get over (through) his abject sensory fear of sand. \u00a0It\u2019s been a slow process which, like almost everything with Nik, seems to have suddenly transformed overnight. \u00a0It was the same with his eating; he refused to eat by mouth for, quite literally, years. \u00a0All of a sudden, we went from a few bites here and there to a ravenous appetite for anything and everything. (The boy is like his father; he hasn\u2019t met a food he doesn\u2019t like!) \u00a0But I digress. This has been the summer of acclimating Nik to the beach. \u00a0If this past Saturday\u2019s trip to the shore was any indication, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a rousing success. \u00a0Not only does he love the water \u2014we\u2019ve known this for a while now, he has apparently embraced his inner sand flea! \u00a0Here, see for yourself: \n Hard to believe this child wouldn't touch so much as his big toe in sand just two months ago! Nothing \"rote\" about knowing how to make his needs known.  In this case, it's french fries! All that playing in the sand and surf makes for a hungry surfer boy! ***************************** One of my friends, Ange, wrote these very wise words to me \u201c I know labels can help direct us\u2026but sometimes they send you down a path that leads you away from your child.\u201d  Armed with that wisdom, the strength I draw from your support, and the lessons my son continually teaches me about faith and trust, love and determination, I think we\u2019re on pretty sure footing.

{"date": "December 17, 2009 ", "body": "Okay, okay, I know I owe a major post about Nik turning six and all that stuff.\u00a0 And another one about how the poor boy has been so, so , SO stinking sick that we\u2019ve narrowly averted trips to the ER for respiratory distress and all sorts of fun stuff.\u00a0 It\u2019s coming, I swear.\u00a0 But then, so is Christmas.\u00a0 Frankly, the holiday may arrive before I get to those posts at the speed with which our days are passing. Nik\u2019s finally recovering from this dread illness. \u00a0H1N1? Maybe; no one ever bothered to test. Roseola? Check. Bronchitis? Check. Antibiotics? Double check! Nebulizer treatments? Check. Inhaled steroids? Check. Oral steroids? Check.\u00a0 I think you get the general picture, no? In the middle of this rousing fun, Nik had a pretty good day today.\u00a0  He actually ate an apple for the first time .\u00a0 Yes, you read that right; my son \u2014the challenged-eater with the voracious appetite and non-finicky palate\u2014 bit and chewed  AND SWALLOWED  nearly\u00a0a third\u00a0of an apple at lunch time.\u00a0 Granted, I still need to follow the bites with some pureed food so he doesn\u2019t get all freaked out by the chunky texture.\u00a0 HE.ATE.APPLE! I thought that was the pinnacle of my day.\u00a0 Considering the subsequent trip to the lab for a blood draw in which they had to stick Nik twice, it very well could have been.\u00a0 My son, finally able to breathe with relative ease after days of being in dire straits, had other things in mind.\u00a0 Without narrating a long and unimportant set-up, suffice to say the boy blew\u00a0both Niksdad and me away\u2026 \nby saying  Mama  and  Papa . TWICE.\u00a0 INTENTIONALLY. Using sign language, too\u2014leaving no room for doubt. Okay, fine, I admit it was prompted.\u00a0  But I never expected to hear a tiny, breathy little voice say the actual words. I\u2019m not sure, but I think I saw Niksdad wipe a tear away.\u00a0 I can\u2019t be too certain; my vision was a bit blurry.

{"date": "December 3, 2009 ", "body": "If you\u2019ve been reading my blog for a while or following me on Twitter, you know that things have not been exactly smooth and easy sailing of late.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s\u00a0hyperactivity has gone beyond mere  \u201cmaking up for lost time\u201d  and has, in fact, morphed into flat-out\u00a0dangerous at times and more than a bit exhausting at others.\u00a0 Nik now requires constant supervision; that makes for some very stressful days while my husband is at work.\u00a0Sleep has been in short supply which means that fraying tempers and impatience have been in greater evidence lately. To say many things have fallen to the wayside or suffered as a result would be an understatement.\u00a0 There are days I can\u2019t turn my back on Nik long enough to put together even the simplest of dinners\u2014 not even in  my beloved crock pot ! \u00a0Showers are now taken at night before I got to bed. Laundry and cleaning get done in fits and starts; thank goodness for our front loading washer with a time-delay setting and a husband who\u2019s not afraid of laundry or a vacuum cleaner! We\u2019re in the process of stripping down what was once our Family Room \u2014the hub of our home where we used to hang out and watch TV, read, drink coffee after putting Nik to bed\u2014 to create a sensory-friendly play space for Nik.\u00a0 Literally, the only things which remain in the room right now are a sofa, our locked TV cabinet, and a handful of Nik\u2019s toys.\u00a0 Long gone are the pictures and wall hangings, the decorative items on the mantel.\u00a0 Hell,  even the mantel is gone  in an effort to keep Nik from climbing the walls.\u00a0 We begin each day by removing all the pillows and sofa cushions \u2014Nik has figured out how to stack them to use as a platform from which he climbs on top of the TV cabinet\u00a0(which is already five feet tall).\u00a0 If he\u2019s able to get on top of the cabinet, Nik has been known to try to swing from the track lights above it \u2014as recently as Tuesday afternoon, in fact.\u00a0 We have had to take away many toys which Nik can stack or stand on, and we now have to actually tether the double-height gate with removable zip ties.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t use the zip ties, Nik is able to squeeze himself up between the two gates to climb over into the kitchen. What, you thought I was kidding, right? Imagine my great surprise \u2014 and terror \u2014 to turn just in time to see my son reaching for my full coffee cup sitting next to a sharp knife on the kitchen counter early one morning.\u00a0 Fortunately, the coffee was cold and he didn\u2019t see the knife.\u00a0 My daily existence with Nik has become fraught with anxiety and worst-case-scenario imaginings simply to try to stay a step ahead of him.\u00a0 Some days it works and others, well, we end up bathed in cold, sticky coffee. This was one of those \"No one will believe me\" moments. Sorry for the poor quality. Even when the gates are tethered together, Nik has figured out how to climb the full height and can now reach the alarm panel which is nearly six feet from the floor.\u00a0 The technician is coming next week to move it to a different room \u2014after my husband and my father fish new telephone lines through to another location.\u00a0 Ditto for the television cable; it\u2019s getting moved this weekend so we can take the TV and cabinet out of the room. I joke about \u201cBaby Gitmo\u201d and the fact that we have to duct tape Nik into his pull-ups, but each day that I have to close my son behind two gates and a series of zip ties,  my heart breaks  just a little bit more.\u00a0 No matter how you slice it, it feels crappy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve gotten a diagnosis of ADHD and have been slowly coming around\u00a0to the idea that Nik may need medication to help him.\u00a0 Our dilemma, and it really is a dilemma not just an emotional issue, is that Nik\u2019s\u00a0system hates \u2014 H.A.T.E.S. \u2014 any medications which even slightly alter the delicate balance of his central nervous system.\u00a0 You might recall the fun we went through when he was on  seizure medications  \u2014the whole  Lamictal tapering nightmare ? Or first foray into ADHD medications was every bit as bad.\u00a0 We tried Focalin\u00a0XR\u00a0(extended release) for a few days before we knew it was\u00a0a bad choice.\u00a0 The rebound effects actually kicked in after just a few hours and the transitions from  peak  to  trough  to  peak  again were beyond hellish.\u00a0 By the\u00a0second day, poor Nik\u2019s\u00a0system was so overwhelmed and hyper-focused that his usual \u201cstrong interests\u201d (ok, fine, perseverations) became true obsessions.\u00a0 Normally, Nik\u00a0is able to put one of his beloved letters (fridge phonics \u2014we\u2019re on our third set!) down to get into his pajamas or go eat a snack.\u00a0 With the Focalin, all of a sudden not only could he  not  simply put them down he would scream and cry and hit his head if we even  asked him to  or tried to take them from him.\u00a0\u00a0 Even beloved outings to the park with Daddy became agonizing for everyone.\u00a0 Nik would begin flailing and crying, kicking and beating himself for no\u00a0discernable reason.\u00a0 The bruises were so bad (just like the Lamictal situation!), we were afraid to take Nik out in public for a few days in case someone called the police about suspected child abuse.\u00a0 Despite the fact that stimulant medications usually cause loss of appetite, Nik\u2019s\u00a0appetite at meal times was voracious; he couldn\u2019t slow down to eat in his normal fashion.\u00a0 It was like watching a junkie scarfing down his post-high binge.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s sleep \u2014already not the best \u2014became even more restless and the wakeful stretches in the middle of the night became longer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there were a  few  good hours early in the day when Nik was calm and easily able to focus on tasks and therapies and such.\u00a0 But by day three? We spent hours just sitting together on the floor.\u00a0 Nik would come to me in tears and push my feet apart so he could settle between my thighs.\u00a0 He would reach out and hold my hands and simply swing them.\u00a0 Usually, this is his sign that he wants me to sing; not this time.\u00a0 When\u00a0I tried to sing, he would shake his head violently and moan  \u201cNg, ng, ng\u201d  (\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d).\u00a0 If I tried to talk quietly to him he would do the same thing.\u00a0 It was as if the world was just too much for him to even bear and all he wanted was for me to anchor him.\u00a0 If I so much as tried to get up to go to the bathroom the wails and self-injurious behaviors would begin. I tweeted one day that I felt  more stressed and anxious than I had in all of Nik\u2019s\u00a0209 days in the NICU ; I don\u2019t think I exaggerated.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cried so many tears or felt so helpless in a very, very long time.\u00a0 By Day Four, I called the doctor to tell him we were stopping the medication; unless we\u2019re talking life-saving measures, I don\u2019t believe the treatment should ever be worse than the ailment.\u00a0  This was far, far worse. Meanwhile, because my husband has a long history with it, and I\u2019ve actually experienced first-hand some of the benefits \u2014in some situations, we decided to try a homeopathic version of a stimulant.\u00a0 We figured at best it might help; worst-case scenario it wouldn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u00a0  It\u2019s helped some. \u00a0 I certainly won\u2019t say it\u2019s been the panacea we seek but it\u2019s made some of the intervening days far more livable\u00a0than they had been.\u00a0 We\u2019re also paying very close attention to Nik\u2019s meal schedule; we\u2019ve noticed an increase in the sensory-seeking and agitated behaviors roughly 60 minutes prior to a scheduled meal and a calming effect after he\u2019s eaten. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act and it is very far from perfect \u2014or sustainable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nik\u2019s energy levels are off the scale at certain times of day and his sensory seeking behaviors are extreme.\u00a0 His demands on my attention are draining.\u00a0 We are looking into other medications to try but are, understandably, reluctant to dive in too quickly.\u00a0 Still, our family and home are in turmoil as we ride out this stretch in search of answers and solutions.\u00a0 We\u2019re confronting old pictures and new realities, figuring out what needs to give, what needs to change, or what we simply need to let go with grace.\u00a0 I won\u2019t lie, it\u2019s a difficult and painful process; it feels similar to what we went through in the months after Nik\u2019s extremely premature birth and again after each of his major surgeries.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real end point to it, just a journey toward acceptance.\u00a0 For tonight though,\u00a0it feels a bit calmer than it has for a while.\u00a0 (Let\u2019s hope it lasts!) In spite of what it may sound like from this post, there also has been a lot of really wonderful stuff happening.\u00a0 Not the least of which was Nik\u2019s  sixth birthday  yesterday. \u00a0We chose not to make a really big deal about it this year but I can assure you it was a pretty good day.\u00a0 I have another post brewing about that\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://nevertoomanycooks.blogspot.com/2009/10/beef-stew-for-dummiesor-for-busy-cooks.html", "https://maternalinstincts.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/downsized_1203091743.jpg", "https://maternalinstincts.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/downsized_11300918151.jpg"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/12/03/finding-a-new-normal/", "title": "Finding a new\u00a0normal"},

If you don\u2019t live under a rock, you\u2019ve likely seen the latest  figures released by the CDC  last week regarding the rise in the rate of autism in the United States.\u00a0 If you missed it, here\u2019s the bird\u2019s-eye view: 1 in 88 children\u00a0 ~ 1 in 54 boys\u00a0 ~ 1 in 252 girls I haven\u2019t yet had a chance to write my own post about what we are doing for  Autism Awareness Month  and  World Autism Awareness Day . ( Read last year\u2019s post  here .), but I wanted to make sure I shared these posts from some of my very dear friends: Mom-NOS :  \u201cThe blue light reminds everyone who sees it that people with autism are\u2026\u201d  \n And as he stared out into the blue, he answered softly in a voice that came from a million miles away: \u201cAwesome.\u201d \n(You can read the full post  here .) Jess :  \u201cAwareness is not the goal. It never has been. But it is the foundation without which no other change can happen.\u201d \n(You can read the full post  here .) Did you know that April is also the  Month of the Military Child ? Our military families are not immune to the effects of living with and loving family members with autism. In fact, they need our help.\u00a0 Please, take the time to read the words of my friend,  Rachel , who has been fighting tirelessly to change the inequities in the military health care system with regards to autism services. In a  post  featured by Autism Speaks, Rachel writes:  \u201cAs a military spouse and mother to a child with autism, I\u2019m here to spread some multidimensional awareness by exploring how these two pieces of the puzzle fit together, or rather how they do not.\u201d \n(Read the full post  here .\u00a0 It includes information on the  Caring for Military Children with Autism Act  and how to contact your Congressional delegate(s) to ask for their support of this important legislation.) I hope you will subscribe to the posts from  The Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism . All month long, TPGA is featuring  \u201cSlice of Life\u201d  posts from Autistic people of all ages. Because, awareness is great but  ACCEPTANCE  is so much more important. And, finally, I\u2019d like to encourage you to visit the  Autistic Self Advocacy Network .\u00a0 The name speaks for itself as the organization empowers Autistics to speak for themselves. If you don\u2019t live with autism, it may be hard to understand why it is so important to listen to the voices of those who actually are autistic. These are the voices which will help us shape the future for our children, open the minds (and doors!) of employers, educators, business leaders and politicians about what is possible for so many people who are otherwise marginalized because of myriad manifestations of autism. These are the voices which can help us establish more and better supports for adults with autism once they leave the school system. Their voices can help shed a light on the tremendous potential within each person regardless of how autism affects them. The potential within each person may not be the same, but the potential to be so much more than what meets the eye is far greater than you might imagine. Only through dispelling the myths and the fears, through support and acceptance \u2014true acceptance, can we empower each autistic person to meet their potential. So, um, I guess THAT is what we\u2019ll be doing for the month \u2014 and always ; helping our son find his \u201cvoice\u201d and meet his potential. What's not to love?!

{"date": "January 12, 2013 ", "body": "You may have noticed that my writing has fallen off here.  Quite a bit.  Yeah, I know, I know. I don\u2019t need to beat myself up about it, it\u2019s my blog, blah, blah, blah.\u00a0 The truth is, I haven\u2019t been writing because I haven\u2019t known how\u2014or what\u2014to share about the changes happening with\u00a0my son.\u00a0The words are jammed up inside my head, warring with the feelings inside my heart. I have discarded multiple drafts in an effort to find the words I need. I wrestle with what I want to say and how much I feel comfortable sharing. I still don\u2019t have the answer; I am outside my comfort zone. The irony is not lost on me. \u00a0Ever the consummate over-sharer\u2014 not afraid to tell my story to anyone who will listen, I have struggled with what to reveal. I\u2019ve been grappling with finding my own truth and having to confront my own biases all while trying to find a new equilibrium. I have been forced to examine and to reframe my vision for the life I thought we would have. The life I thought  he  would have. It\u2019s very much a work in progress as we continue to redefine, reshape and work our way through the morass of emotions and information. ******* When my son was born extremely prematurely, he was substantially smaller than his gestational age and had a number of identifiable health conditions in need of immediate treatment \u2013either with medications or surgeries. Life\u2014mine and his\u2014became about surviving another day, making it through another crisis. Over the course of his 209-day hospital stay, and even after he came home, the focus was on making it through; through another season, another health crisis\u2014whatever curve-ball life threw our way.\u00a0 At that point in time, there was no way to predict how the cards would fall and no way of knowing what his future might hold.\u00a0 Many professionals told us there were still so few children like ours who were old enough to really have enough data to be able to predict with any degree of certainty. So, we simply hunkered down and did the best we knew how to do with the minimum of supports we had. All we knew was that we were not quite out of the woods but not quite fully in them. \u201cWhen we let go of hope fear wins.\u201d  Through the years, there have been so many well-intentioned people \u2013from health care professionals to total strangers\u2014who confidently told us not to worry, our son would surely catch up. They patted our shoulders in sympathetic displays and told us stories of their cousin\u2019s friend\u2019s uncle\u2019s daughter or their neighbor\u2019s son who were \u201cborn early, too; they caught up by the time they were in elementary school.\u201d When you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know and the prospect of knowing certain things is, well, scary, it\u2019s all too easy to want to believe the well-wishers and the miracle-sellers who predict your child\u2019s miraculous growth and feats of development. So, you put on the blinders and tuck your chin down and simply soldier on\u2014hoping for and working toward the best, whatever that turns out to be. In the absence of even a hint at the longer view, we simply clung to hope and pushed our worries aside, taking it a day at a time, an issue at a time. When our son was ultimately diagnosed with PDD-NOS, it gave us something to hold on to and provided a new context through which to view everything else. As time progressed and some of the more emergent health issues began to resolve or remained stable, we hit a kind of developmental sweet-spot.\u00a0 Our son began to make tremendous progress and was rapidly gaining many skills which had been so severely delayed. In a seemingly short time, he blossomed from the child who couldn\u2019t even sit up or roll over and who relied on a tube for all his nutrition, to a child who could walk and run, climb and eat, and who had taught himself letters and was showing signs of spelling and early reading skills emerging. With that swelling surge of hope, we began to really push for supports and look for signs of academic progress.\u00a0 Some early literacy skills were emerging, multiple word sentences constructed on his speech device \u2013 there were glimpses; glimmers of dazzling progress. Until there weren\u2019t. Which is where we have been for a while now. I\u2019ve struggled to understand for myself and to try to articulate for others, the degree to which things have stagnated; there\u2019s been some significant regression in some areas. It\u2019s best summed up in a brief conversation I had with our developmental pediatrician this week. \n ME:  So, if I have three different evaluations, done by two different entities over a two-and-a-half year period \u2013 and not shared between each other\u2014and they all show pretty much the same thing, including almost no change over time\u2026 \n Can I pretty much assume that (1) my son doesn\u2019t test well and the tests aren\u2019t completely accurate and (2) that there\u2019s probably *some* kernel of accuracy there which speaks to a larger issue? The one we think we are seeing? \n DR: (wrinkling her nose in a sympathetic grimace, nods her head)  Yeah, I would make that leap. Let\u2019s make an appointment to talk about it and find a new way forward. \n \n Hope is important; it is vital. But so is the ability to see beyond the heart\u2019s desires, to peel back the thin veil over your fears and really look at what is in front of you.

It\u2019s been painful to confront our own prejudices. \n For years we have both felt like we were sort of straddling two different disability worlds and not feeling like we solidly belonged in either one. Was our inability to settle in, to identify with any one group, born\u00a0of denial and shame? Why is it so much easier for me to say, publicly, that my child has \u201cmild cerebral palsy and autism\u201d yet I cannot bring myself to declare just as casually that he is intellectually disabled\u2014mentally retarded? \u00a0(Yes, I know the term really isn\u2019t used anymore; that\u2019s my point\u2014I\u2019m calling myself out on my own biases and misperceptions.) \n Different words will not change my beautiful, smart, funny, loving child. Nothing will.\u00a0 And yet, the truth of those same words cuts me to the bone, laying bare the fears and grief I\u2019ve held at bay for most of my son\u2019s life; I am the one it changes. I am the one those words challenge. \n I hope I am able to meet it with half the grace, determination and heart with which my son has lived his entire life. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/what-we-didnt-know-then/", "title": "What we didn\u2019t know\u00a0then"},

{"date": "April 28, 2007 ", "body": "Oh God. An empty page to fill and so much to say. Will anyone but me care about the musings which rattle around in side my head, the conversations I have with God \u2014 or myself or the air, when no one else is around? Maybe this isn\u2019t such a good idea after all but I have come this far\u2026too late to turn back now, right? Might as well just take a deep breath and dive in\u2026 Hi, I\u2019m Niksmom. Well, I actually do have my own name and identity, but somehow it all seems to blend together as the days go by. If you have a child with any sort of disability or exceptional needs, you understand. That\u2019s why I am writing, really. I want to connect with the moms out there who understand my life in ways that many others never will. The overwhelming emotions that sideswipe me out of the blue, the uncontrollable urges to watch my child sleeping and talk with God\u2014not about changing Nik or \u201ccuring\u201d him. About giving me the strength and the grace and the spirit to do the very best I can for this miraculous little gift that\u2019s been entrusted into the care of my husband and me. Some days it feels so natural and so easy; those are the days I try to hold on to for as long as I can. Then there are days when I wonder if I am what Nik needs; do I give him enough? Enough time, enough attention, enough love, enough sacrifice, enough tears, enough fighting with doctors and schools to provide enough services to help him be the wonderful being he is? Somehow, even on the good days, it never feels like enough. On paper, my son sounds like a hopeless case, at best. Born at 27 weeks and weighing only 19 ounces,Nik spent 209 days in the NICU. During that time, he endured multiple surgeries on various body systems (heart, intestines, eyes) and spent a long time on a ventilator. Nik has cerebral palsy, seizures, he\u2019s somewhere on the autism spectrum (depends on who you ask whether it\u2019s PDD-NOS or autism), he has congenital heart issues, he\u2019s blind in one eye and presumed deaf in one ear (more about that another time), doesn\u2019t walk, doesn\u2019t talk, doesn\u2019t eat by mouth, won\u2019t look me in the eye, can\u2019t stand to be held\u2026and the list goes on. Fortunately, the list is just a piece of paper. What that list doesn\u2019t show is the spirit and determination of my spunky, funny, frightfully intelligent and resourceful little boy. We like to tell a story of a neurologist we met while Nik was hospitalized recently: The doctor came to our room to discuss some of the issues we needed to have investigated (which we now believe are part of the ASD). This man, whom we have never seen in our lives, waltzed in and without so much as a how-do-you-do begins to explain to me (in a patronizing tone) about things that \u201cchildren with diminished mental capacity such as your son\u201d do. Frankly, I can\u2019t even remember anything else the man said because my brain turned red and hazy as the mama bear in me poised to strike him down. Fortunately, reason prevailed and I must have been sufficiently polite\u2014the man is still alive to insult some other family! My point though is that everyone that knows Nik, from his pediatrician and numerous specialists (including a neurologist who is NOT Dr. DMC!) to his therapists and teachers at school, everyone agrees that Nik may have multiple challenges. DIMINISHED MENTAL CAPACITY IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Ok, I got off on a tangent. What I really wanted to say is this: On paper, my son is a child that many would pity. In fact, according to some comments I\u2019ve read on other blogs (not by the bloggers, by anonymous posters), there are those who would insist he is a \u201cwaste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d and should be allowed to die. (Yes, for those of you gasping in horrified outrage, there really ARE people in this world who believe such crap.) But, the reality of my son is the polar opposite. Nikolas is NOT his disabilities or his \u201c-isms\u201d or anything else but a beautiful, charming, intelligent, quirky, little guy who rocks my world. And I\u2019ll be happy to take on anyone who says otherwise\u2026 I look forward to sharing my family, my thoughts, our struggles and triumphs, and all the other stuff in between. Thank goodness this ol\u2019 internet is big enough for all of us. Welcome to my world.

{"date": "April 28, 2007 ", "body": "Today is a good day.  The day started off a little bumpy with several moments of what I like to call \u201cCoping Challenges.\u201d  Others call them \u201cmeltdowns\u201d or \u201cdysregulation\u201d  or any host of things that all mean pretty much the same thing \u2014 my child with autism is unable to cope with something for some reason and needs to throw himself on the floor and have a full-throttle kicking, screaming, crying, flailing expression of rage and/or frustration until he\u2019s either worn himself out or I am able to distract him with something else.  My husband often opts for the former while I am a strong proponent for the latter approach; call me the peacemaker of the family?  But I digress.  Nik had not had a good night\u2019s sleep and had already had some rough patches. I dropped Nik off at school this morning with a laughing warning to Ms. Joyce, Nik\u2019s teacher, that he might have a challenging day ahead of him \u2014and so, by association, would she.  We really like Ms. Joyce; she\u2019s warm and wonderfully insightful about Nik and his myriad challenges.  She is patient and kind while firm and no-nonsense at the same time.  She is one of a very small handful of people that we feel really \u201cgets\u201d Nik.  So, I left content in the knowledge that Nik would be fine. (It wasn\u2019t that long ago that I didn\u2019t feel that way, but that\u2019s for another post on another day.) Today was a gorgeous day \u2014sunny and warm and just right for getting out in the garden.  In my case, it was more a case of getting out to the garden center to pick up supplies for my scraggly flower beds in front of my house.  Just getting out by myself was a treat! I relish those quiet times as they occur so infrequently. When I picked Nik up in the afternoon, Ms. Joyce told me that Nik had a couple of \u201cmeltdowns\u201d today but recovered fairly quickly.  Overall, he had a very good day.  He ate a half a jar of food with his tube feeding in the morning; that\u2019s progress as Nik goes through cycles of eating/not-eating!  He climbed up the play structure and went down the sliding board ALL BY HIMSELF for the first time. That was HUGE!  The paraprofessional said Nik looked like he was king of the mountain.  That\u2019s my little fearless man! Can\u2019t walk or stand by himself but give him something to climb or slide and he\u2019s Johnny-on-the-spot!  I can just picture his little impish grin as he clambered up the structure \u2014half crawling, half climbing.  Did I mention that Nik is one determined young man? One of his many endearing \u2014and frustrating\u2014 traits So, school was a good deal today; Nik was happy to see me and even happier to go \u201cZoom-Zoom\u201d in the car to see Daddy before he went to work.  The day was good and getting even better; Nik patently adores his Daddy! Now, Nik is not one to show overt affection.  Due to a combination of his ASD and a visual impairment in his right eye, Nik has a really tough time making eye contact for more than a fleeting moment.  However, every once in a while, Nik will reach out to lace his little fingers through mine as I sit next to him on the floor or he will lean into my side for just a moment.  Kisses\u2026fagheddaboudit!  Since Nik was in the hospital so long and at such great risk for infections, we never got to kiss him on the mouth.  We did, however, more than make up for it by kissing his sweet forehead.  So, when Nik gives kisses \u2014which is not often except at bedtime and even then it is sometimes done grudgingly \u2014he tips his forehead toward my mouth.  As if to say, \u201cYou may kiss me now, madam!\u201d As Daddy was leaving for work, he came over to kiss Nik goodbye.  Nik was ignoring him as he played with one of his favorite toys with lots of doors to open and close.  My husband shrugged in resignation.  I motioned for him to wait a moment then said, \u201cNikolas, give Daddy a kiss.  Kiss  Daddy bye-bye.\u201d  Nik stopped playing for a moment then reached his hand up to touch my husband\u2019s face as he tipped his little forehead to Daddy\u2019s lips.  My husband quickly kissed me goodbye and, I swear, left the house walking taller than I\u2019ve seen him do in a long while!  I sat and blinked back a haze of moisture from my eyes.  You see, Nik has been classified as \u201cdeafblind\u201d at school; we\u2019ve never gotten concrete test results indicating whether he can hear in his left ear or not.  He responds so inconsistently (as many kids on the spectrum do).  So Nik obviously heard me; that\u2019s GOOD. He also responded to a simple instruction; that\u2019s even BETTER.  He also had an intimate connection with his Daddy; no matter how fleeting, that\u2019s GREAT! Today was a very good day, indeed.

{"date": "April 22, 2012 ", "body": "So, um, yeah\u2026about this Autism Awareness Month? I  do  have something to write about how my local Home Depot has completely embraced not only awareness in the month of April, but, well\u2026I\u2019ll tease you and tell you you\u2019ll have to wait another day for that post. It\u2019s worth the wait, I promise! I was all set to post pictures and write pithy verbiage much sooner than this, but, well\u2026 Nik, apparently, had other ideas.\u00a0 More specifically, his brain had other ideas. It began misfiring a few weeks ago with some breakthrough seizure activity. We upped his medication and thought we had it under control.\u00a0  We were mistaken. The past couple of weeks we\u2019ve been not only monitoring Nik\u2019s seizure activity, but increasing meds again and watching the seizures (or seizure-like activity) transform. We\u2019ve had some unplanned phone calls and office visits with our fabulous neurologist and we have a plan in place.\u00a0 It\u2019s a short-term plan, but it\u2019s a plan; it includes another ambulatory 24 hour electroencephalogram (EEG) in the immediate future. We need to know if we\u2019re dealing with increased seizure activity or a severe movement disorder.\u00a0 Think tics which occur at such a rapid and constant rate that they interfere with nearly all functioning and definitely with Nik\u2019s safety and you\u2019ll have an idea of what we\u2019ve been dealing with. Yesterday morning, we watched Nik lose consciousness for the first time in a long time. Then he napped for more than two hours. We\u2019re pretty darn sure  that  wasn\u2019t just a tic. So, we\u2019re looking at options for short-term treatment until the EEG. Good times, my friends. Good times. In the meantime, this week also threw us another curve ball in the form of Nik\u2019s hearing; his hearing is getting worse and he now needs hearing aids.\u00a0 Those will be fitted in just a couple of weeks.\u00a0 That news was a bit of a kick in the gut at first, but I\u2019m getting more used to the idea; I just hope Nik will cooperate with wearing them because we\u2019re running out of options. The issue is not volume so much as loss at certain frequencies which fall right in the ranges necessary for speech comprehension. This new knowledge about Nik\u2019s hearing explains several things with which Nik has struggled during the school year\u2014 including attention, following directions, and reading skills. It\u2019s difficult to know what is being asked of you if you can\u2019t understand the words being said.\u00a0 This change opens up a whole host of questions about what additional supports Nik needs that he is not currently receiving and whether the current placement is best for him. We\u2019re left wondering how to deal with the significant vision impairment  and  hearing loss  and  autism  and  cerebral palsy in a way which allows Nik to play to his strengths versus remediation of weaknesses and in an environment which doesn\u2019t become isolating. We have no answers yet\u2026 just a lot of really good questions. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll write more about this as it unfolds. Our biggest goals and strongest desires for Nik are that he learns to read and to communicate more independently. I feel that if we can give him those skills, the rest will either come or he will find ways to compensate. Without those skills, his shot at independence is incredibly limited. So, on the heels of a very emotionally difficult week (which included a scare about a broken iPad and a 2 hour trip to the nearest Apple store) \u2014and because I may be just a smidgen of a Pollyanna, I am holding on tightly to this little nugget I shared on my Facebook page tonight: OMG OMG OMG!!! I completely forgot to share this news: \n  Nik READ the word PRETZEL on a sign yesterday. I was like, \u201cSweetie, where did you see that word?\u201d He pointed right to it on the sign. Then he promptly asked for ice cream. (We were at Rita\u2019s so it wasn\u2019t an odd request.) \n  HE.READ. Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang. The journey continues.

{"date": "April 28, 2007 ", "body": "It\u2019s funny how quickly our perceptions can change.  How our expectations can shape our perceptions and then get turned and tumbled topsy-turvy in a heartbeat. For the longest time, Niksdad and I have been gearing up for a battle royal with our son\u2019s school about changes to his IEP \u2014 monumental changes.  We\u2019ve been gathering reports and researching regulations and classifications and, generally, trying to get our proverbial ducks in a row before we sit down with the IEP team. Now, in all fairness to the untarnished collective image of Niksmom/dad, we do have reason to believe that the things we are going to be asking for will be viewed as either unnecessary, expensive, or both by the school.  That\u2019s been our experience with the school case manager thus far.  When we\u2019ve asked for things like a one-on-one paraprofessional for Nik, the response in the past has been something like, \u201cWell, if you can show us there\u2019s a legitimate medical need, then I can see if the district will go for it.  But I\u2019ve gotta tell you, they probably won\u2019t.\u201d (Gee, thanks for the rousing support, eh?) Nik started school last June because he qualified for early transition based on his visual impairment.  However, he was initially classified as orthopedically impaired because of his significant motor delays from his cerebral palsy \u2014 which gets blamed for everything but the kitchen sink, apparently, whether it is warranted or not.  But I digress.  We went into Nik\u2019s first IEP meeting still reveling in the warm embrace of our home-based early intervention providers.  Wow, did our world as we knew it come to a screeching halt that day! But, here we are many months later and a whole heck of a lot wiser.  We\u2019ve invested lots of time and energy in learning more about this new world of public education and how to navigate its back streets and alleys.  It\u2019s a very sneaky thing.  Especially so in a small state where money is tight!  We\u2019ve finessed our way to having insurance pay for some things we probably shouldn\u2019t have (evaluations) but, frankly, didn\u2019t want to wait as long as the school district would have taken as they dragged themselves kicking and screaming to accommodate our legal and rightful request.  But, it seems to be paying off.  Not necessarily in the most positive of ways but in necessary ones. We now have three separate reports from completely separate entities which basically support our assertion that Nik has not only NOT made much progress in many areas \u2014he\u2019s actually shown regression.  Betcha can\u2019t guess which areas?  Ok, how about if I give you a clue that the state autism program NEVER COMPLETED THEIR EVALUATION\u2026SEVEN MONTHS AGO! (Sorry, Niksmom apologizes for shouting at you, dear reader. I do get a little frustrated and passionate sometimes\u2026) Finally, we also have three separate doctors each indicating that Nik is definitely on the spectrum and needs intensive one-on-one educational support.  \u201cAha!\u201d think Niksmom and Niksdad, \u201cWe\u2019ve finally got the magic bullet that will bring the evil administrators to their knees! Bwahahahahahah!\u201d (Did I mention that Niksmom/dad are collectively a little zany?\ud83d\ude09 ) We are still awaiting the actual written reports from two of the doctors; we have waited to talk to school about Nik\u2019s IEP until we had that \u201cbullet\u201d fully cast in the mold.  Today, I finally screwed up my courage and girded my loins (maybe I read too many trashy novels in my \u201cunwind time\u201d?  What do you think?), and I went in to talk to the case manager. First, let me back up a step and tell you \u2014all in keeping with changing perceptions \u2014that a week ago I took a little \u201cfield trip\u201d to investigate a school in another district which is known to be the \u201cbest autism school in the county.\u201d  My mission was to find out everything I could that this school has that Nik\u2019s lacks and figure out how to make a compelling case for an out-of-district transfer. I arrived to a very impressive, immaculately groomed building; it was the polar opposite of our ramshackle-feeling little school which sits tucked away from the main road\u2026behind another school\u2026through a chain link fenced area\u2026past a bunch of \u201cmodular offices\u201d (read: trailers).  You get the idea.  I toured the school with a very cordial host and asked lots of questions, many of which he couldn\u2019t answer.  The hallways were quiet, the lights were glaring, and the classrooms appeared to be completely isolated little worlds unto themselves.  The facility was sparkling clean and beautiful. And sterile.  And lifeless. I tried to picture my sweet little boy tooling around these hallways in his mobile prone stander as he does in his current school.  I tried imagine him going into the office to methodically \u2014no, maniacally \u2014 open and close the cabinets, doors, drawers, and anything else he could find in the sterile fortress that was manned this day by a snarling, disdainful, condescending woman.  I couldn\u2019t see the face of my laughing, impish boy tooling around leaving smiles in his wake.  What I saw instead frightened me.  I saw my boy, devoid of emotion and spunk and verve.  I saw him with the characteristics which are so precious to me \u201cprogrammed\u201d out of him. Now, I know on many levels that that might not happen at all.  But it was what I felt that day and my gut was screaming at me \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d  I left to pick Nik up from school and felt like my plans had been turned sideways.  I spent the drive across town reflecting on the things I would miss the most if Nik changed schools.  All of a sudden, it hit me \u2014nearly everything.  Nik adores his teacher and his school.  He claps his hands with glee when we pull up in front of the building each day!  In this safe little nest, he is loved and his uniqueness valued; maybe not always appreciated as keenly by some as by others, but it is valued none the less.  He is nurtured along at HIS pace and with (most of) his needs taken into consideration.  Yes, we have many things to change and fight for but I realized that there are lots of \u201cintangibles\u201d to consider as well. So, today, with my newfound perspective, I went to see the case manager.   I broached the subject of reclassifying Nik; we don\u2019t think he fits the deafblind category anymore and aren\u2019t sure he fits completely in the autism program either.  We want a one-on-one paraprofessional, we\u2019d like to keep him in his current classroom but with significant changes in his services and support, we think he needs a full sensory evaluation and a sensory diet, etc.  After talking for a few minutes, I paused and took a deep breath and proceeded to tell her about my visit to \u201cthe other school.\u201d  I shared my observations and my realizations about all the things our current school does well.  Then I stopped talking and waited for the arguments \u2014that NEVER came. She smiled at me and said, \u201cYou know, Niksmom, you are such a wonderful advocate for your son; I wish we had more parents like you. Nikolas is a very lucky little boy; he\u2019s blessed to have you and Niksdad for parents.\u201d  I was floored.  She then went on to address all of my points.  Never once did she say \u201cOh, we can\u2019t do that, \u201c or \u201cIs there a medical need?\u201d  Instead, she acknowledged very frankly that, of course, it all comes down to dollars for the school district.  But, she went on to say, \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve never done anything like that before so we may be breaking new ground by trying it.  I\u2019ll start working on scheduling Nik\u2019s IEP.\u201d Talk about changing perceptions!  I left her office feeling hopeful and buoyant\u2026and heard.

For some reason, though, there are days when I cannot seem to keep the past in its place and my emotions securely bottled away.  The emotions I feel right now so closely echo those not-so-distant memories of months spent in the hospital at Nik\u2019s bedside \u2014watching, praying, hoping.  Hoping that \u201cthis time\u201d he\u2019d stay off the ventilator or \u201cthis time\u201d he wouldn\u2019t need another surgery.  The feeling of waiting for the other shoe to drop as Nik racked up diagnoses like so many frequent flier miles, I suppose, if you are a parent of a child with multiple disabilities or complex medical or educational needs, the feelings are inevitable.  But doesn\u2019t there *have to* come a point when you get to take a deep breath and coast for even just a little while?  Focusing on the known issues and/or conditions and simply dealing with the day-to-day living with them? Nik may be sick \u2014again.  It may be \u201cnothing\u201d.  Nothing \u2014meaning, it is something that requires monitoring and blood tests every six months.  Or, it could possibly something that could alter his life pretty significantly.  We are waiting for answers which, we hope, are clear and simple and easy to deal with.  I hope my gut is wrong this time or that my \u201cmommy radar\u201d has somehow jammed.  I am not usually full of doom and gloom but I feel like I need to be prepared for the hammer blow that may come.  To protect my battered spirit from another sneak attack. Meanwhile, I pray \u2014constantly\u2014 in spite of the fact that I am not religious.  I have to hold on to the belief that there is a supreme deity somewhere with a master plan.  Without that anchor, I don\u2019t think I could make it through the dark times.  The times when I am filled with such guilt and anguish and rage about my little boy\u2019s immense challenges.  The times when I am filled with despair because I cannot change life\u2019s course for him, for us.  The times like these past few days watching Nik be poked and prodded and drained of blood and energy from trips to multiple doctors, trips to the lab, and the toll it takes on him for days afterward.  Not just the physical toll but the emotional and psychological one which he cannot communicate to me except in his vacant stares when he\u2019s overwhelmed, his cries when he gets tired and frustrated, or his waking in the middle of the night.  My little rock, who used to sleep through the nights so soundly, now stirs and cries out and wakes looking for company in the darkness in the middle of the night.

{"date": "June 2, 2009 ", "body": "So much going on\u00a0\u2026\u00a0 First, I am  chronically exhausted ,\u00a0 I no longer sleep through the night \u2014even when Nik does.\u00a0 I\u2019ve recently had some blood tests to check my thyroid levels; I still need to actually get those results and make an appointment to see my doctor.\u00a0 As a result, I have very little energy \u2014either physical or mental\u2014 to sit and think of words to express what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty sure I may need my thyroid medication adjusted. I went back to the gym today for the first time since Nik was in the hospital.\u00a0 For those of you counting, that\u2019s one hundred days. Ouch.\u00a0 But I made it through a thirty minute elliptical workout \u2014clocking two miles where I once did three.\u00a0 But I\u2019m back in the saddle and that\u2019s what counts. So much is happening with Nik lately that I may have to simply list things for you!\u00a0 The potty training is, um, progressing.\u00a0 If by progressing one means he\u2019s peeing and pooping on my floors, refusing to wear a diaper or pull-up to bed \u2014with the most spectacular of tantrums, I might add\u2014 and generally letting us know he is D-O-N-E.\u00a0 The catch?\u00a0 We still don\u2019t have a full-access solution for him.\u00a0 We\u2019re ordering one tomorrow through our medical supplier.\u00a0 Then the real fun can begin, yes? Eating? Pffft.\u00a0 Like an old pro.\u00a0 I have yet to find something the child isn\u2019t willing to at least try.\u00a0 Believe me, I fully appreciate the gift we have in that.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s working on self-feeding skills as well as challenging himself on different textures and quantities.\u00a0 My latest challenge is finding enough foods to fill him up without giving him too many calories!\u00a0 Thank goodness he likes fruits and veggies.\u00a0 And anything with salsa.\u00a0 I kid you not. *shudders* We\u2019ve recently increased his Neurontin dose to accommodate his increasing weight.\u00a0 We had started at a super low dose so we had plenty of wiggle room.\u00a0 So far, other than some transitional behaviors which we expected, we\u2019re pleased.\u00a0 Overall, I think, it seems to be contributing to some lovely developmental surges. Nik\u2019s recently begun not only noticing other children at the park or in play group but he\u2019s begun to try to insert himself into their activities.\u00a0 Obviously, he doesn\u2019t have the communication skills to be able to indicate  \u201cHey, I want to play with you!\u201d  but he\u2019s trying.\u00a0 The first time I watched him follow a group of children climbing  up the sliding board at the park I wept tears of joy and relief.\u00a0 Niksdad tells me it\u2019s becoming more consistent with each trip to the park, too.\u00a0 His behavior at home is also telling us that Nik really wants to spend more time with others; the change is delightful \u2014and challenging. We\u2019ve set things in motion to not only get a commode chair for Nik but to also get a new car seat, a new stroller, and a new bed!\u00a0 So much physical growth and change all at once! Yikes.\u00a0 We meet with our medical supplier tomorrow to select specific items and then begin the process of authorizations, letters of medical necessity, etc.\u00a0 Nik has grown so much that he needs things which are not commercially available or, if they are, are not designed to meet his safety and developmental needs. Nik\u2019s communication efforts continue to soar!\u00a0 Not only is he picking up \u2014or making up\u2014 new signs; he\u2019s also following multiple step instructions more and more.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know it was possible for a nonverbal child to talk back to his mama but \u2014oy vey! \u2014the tone of babble this child uses with me sometimes is amazing.\u00a0 The boundaries are being tested at every turn and we couldn\u2019t be more delighted and frustrated! Next week we will begin a several week trial of one of the devices from  Prentke Romich  (the same company which supplies  Schuyler\u2019s  Big Box of Words, aka  Pinkessa ).\u00a0 We met with Janet Lehr, the regional consultant for our area, several weeks ago.\u00a0 The trial was nothing short of amazing and it became clear to all of us that the PRC technology would be a good fit for Nik\u2019s learning style.\u00a0 The question on the table now is which device?\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with the Springboard Lite and then try the Vantage Lite.\u00a0 The primary difference is that the SBL doesn\u2019t have text to speech capability which the VL does.\u00a0 Where Nik is not yet an emergent reader, we\u2019re not sure which device will work best for him.\u00a0 It may be that the SBL is the best device but he might learn so quickly that we\u2019d have to replace it with the VL in less than a year.\u00a0 That\u2019s sort of what my instinct says.\u00a0 But, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this multi-week trial, too. Homeschooling has begin in earnest. Sort of.\u00a0 I\u2019m still pulling together materials and deciding which skills I want to work on with Nik.\u00a0 Just when I think I\u2019ve got it figured out, Nik surprises me.\u00a0 It seems he\u2019s recently learned to identify letters by the sounds they make, too.\u00a0 Um, so much for that first goal.\u00a0 (Wow, I must be a powerful teacher; I  think  it and he masters it? Ha! If only.) On the health front, Nik\u2019s recent EEG gave us good news.\u00a0 Nik remains seizure-free and his background wave forms on the look  \u201cnormal for his age\u201d  according to our neurologist.\u00a0 That means the weird eye rolling and facial grimacing we\u2019ve been seeing are  not  partial seizures.\u00a0 Of course, it doesn\u2019t tell us what the cause  is (possibly related to changes in his meds; the symptoms seem to increase in the first week or so of any changes) but we\u2019ll take  seizure-free  any day! The MRI last week gave us good news and some potentially bad news.\u00a0 The good news is that there is nothing showing in Nik\u2019s brain that is either degenerative or progressive in nature.\u00a0 No growths of any sort and his cervical spine appears to be stable.\u00a0 He does have a mild cervical fusion at C2-C3 but we already knew that; we needed to make certain it wasn\u2019t impingeing on the actual spinal cord.\u00a0 It is not.\u00a0 Whew. What does show on the MRI is continued fluid in the mastoid air cells behind Nik\u2019s left ear.\u00a0 This has appeared before and been dismissed by the ENT as  \u201cmost likely he was fighting off some mild infection at the time fo the MRI.\u201d \u00a0 This time, it\u2019s appears to be slightly more infused when compared to the last MRI.\u00a0 Certainly enough so that our neurologist and pediatrician agree that it needs to be  fully  investigated by an ENT.\u00a0\u00a0We see the ENT on June ninth.\u00a0 If they are unwilling to investigate further, our pediatrician is prepared to refer us to either Johns Hopkins or Children\u2019s Hospital in Philadelphia for further evaluation. In light of this recent development, we requested copies of  all of Nik\u2019s MRI images from the hospital.\u00a0 After we met with the neurologist yesterday and he showed us where to look on the films, I spent some time poring over  all  the films.\u00a0 While I admit I am not a neurologist or a radiologist so I\u2019m not quite certain what I\u2019m looking at, what I  think  I see disturbs me.\u00a0 Greatly.\u00a0 Enough that I am going to ask our neurologist to examine the full set of films. It appears that there has been a continual building of fluid in the mastoid region for more than two years \u2014possibly three.\u00a0 It was barely discernible back in January of 2006; just enough of a small patch that it could be either overlooked because the primary focus was on the brain then.\u00a0 Or it may have been dismissed by a radiologist as evidence of a mild infection and not necessarily worth remarking upon. One of the challenges is that the films were not all read by the same radiologist and were not ever read as an entire series; they\u2019ve only been compared one at a time \u2014the most current to the most recent \u2014in an effort to determine if there\u2019s any sign of either progressive or regressive injury to Nik\u2019s brain.\u00a0 Thankfully, there is no evidence of such.\u00a0 However, the potential long-term impact if this is left untreated could be permanent or significant hearing impairment. Going through Nik\u2019s MRI\u2019s \u2014he\u2019s had five in four years \u2014has been a diffcult process for me.\u00a0 They are not  \u201cnormal\u201d by any stretch of the imagination.\u00a0 The damage sustained by his brain in his extraordinarily rough start in this life is emblazoned on those films in splotches of white \u201choles\u201d where there should be grey matter and in enlarged perivascular and periventricular spaces.\u00a0 In short, there is clear-cut evidence of permanent damage to certain areas of his brain. Our neurologist gently answered my hesitant questions yesterday\u2014ones I should have asked  years  ago but was simply too grateful that my child was alive to even  think  about the longer term ramifications.\u00a0 The questions about what those holes and patchy areas tell us about Nik.\u00a0 The truth is, they don\u2019t tell us anything we don\u2019t really already know. Those areas tell us why he has difficulty with motor functions and why he may have some vision problems.\u00a0 Why he may have some longer term speech challenges. This is a tough pill to swallow right now.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known for years that there was  \u201cmild damage\u201d  to Nik\u2019s brain but I was able to fool myself into ignoring its existence by not looking at the stark images.\u00a0 If I didn\u2019t look and I didn\u2019t  understand  those images on the screen, perhaps none of it was real and one day Nik would \u2014miraculously, spontaneously \u2014 recover . It\u2019s like ripping a scab off an old wound.\u00a0 The surrounding tissue has begun to heal and the damage is only on the surface, but the nerves are tender and raw.\u00a0 The pain is none the less searing. And yet\u2026 None of this matters a whit to Nik.\u00a0 He simply keeps moving along and making amazing progress.\u00a0 Whether because of our help or in spite of it, he perseveres in the best of all possible ways.\u00a0 No obstacle is insurmountable, no challenge too great and no adventure too grand. I don\u2019t get the  luxury  of wallowing in my sadness and self-pity.\u00a0 Nik needs me to put on my big girl panties and keep moving.\u00a0 I must if I\u2019m to keep up with my little dynamo.

{"date": "June 9, 2009 ", "body": "Today was a perfect storm sort of day.\u00a0 We would either have a day full of frights and horrors from beginning to end or we would have a day of unparalleled delights and successes.\u00a0 We recently had one of the former\u2014a day in which Nik pushed the limits to breaking.\u00a0 He figured out how to open the lock on the laundry door (using careful analytical skills and brute five-year-old force), purposely defecated on the family room floor (making nary a mess anywhere except in a very neat little spot), and pulled his feeding tube out multiple times in the span of just a couple of hours. The last time he pulled the tube, he chewed on the silicone balloon until it burst into small bits\u2014which could have choked him \u2014and which rendered the tube unusable.\u00a0 Did I mention we\u2019ve gone through six tubes in as many weeks?\u00a0 Yes, we\u2019ve run through what should have been a six month supply already.\u00a0 (Hey, we don\u2019t do things in half-measure around here!) A perfect storm was definitely brewing.\u00a0 Thankfully, today was the antithesis to that  other  day.\u00a0 Nik woke \u2014dry and still dressed in his big boy pants.\u00a0 He refuses to wear a diaper or pull-up overnight and we decided it wasn\u2019t a battle worth fighting.\u00a0 He\u2019s happy and we do a bit more laundry than we\u2019d like some days, but so what? My super trooper woke up hungry as a bear.\u00a0 Seriously, the first thing he did when he popped up into a sitting position in his crib in the early morning hours?\u00a0 Signed  eat banana .\u00a0 I kid you not.\u00a0 So we trundled downstairs in our jammies and proceeded to eat Cheerios and bananas and \u2014for the first time ever\u2014 a juicy, fresh peach.\u00a0 Really, the peach was for  me  but he wanted to try it.\u00a0 I never got it back. Our schedule was jam-packed for the day: PT followed by a developmental play group then lunch and the long drive to the hospital to see both the ENT and the GI doctors to figure out what to do with his ears and his feeding tube.\u00a0 If all went well with the ENT, there were plans to squeeze in a hearing test, too.\u00a0 The  piece de resistance : the drive home in rush hour traffic with time to spare for dinner and bed. So many opportunities for disappointment, frustration or meltdowns of epic proportions for my little guy.\u00a0 It felt like we were walking through an old mine field without any clue as to where the next booby trap might lay. Nik\u00a0sailed through an  awesome  PT session and a  delightful  play group where he did things he\u2019s never done before\u2014 or things he once screamed and resisted doing\u2014 with an ease and a confidence that made everyone remark on how far he\u2019s come and how much he\u2019s developing.\u00a0 It was, I confess, a morning which made me burst with pride.\u00a0 More importantly, it was a morning which made Nik squeal with glee and sing with unfettered joy. The trip to the hospital took longer than we thought so we weren\u2019t quite prepared with enough food to stoke our little eating machine; he did have  one  hunger-induced meltdown late in the day as we waited for the cafeteria to open so we could get dinner before driving home in rush hour traffic.\u00a0 Once Nik realized he was going to get to eat, he calmed pretty quickly \u2014and ate like the rapidly growing boy that he is. Our visit to the GI was really just to have her check the measurements of Nik\u2019s stoma site to make sure we have the right size tube.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to try a different product and see if it doesn\u2019t hold up to Nik\u2019s abuse a bit better.\u00a0 The new device has to be ordered so we\u2019re stuck with the dreaded Mic-Key button for a bit longer.\u00a0 Meanwhile though, they\u00a0gave us a backup tube to take home \u2014just in case! It was sheer delight to be able to see the look on the doctor\u2019s face when we told her Nik  hasn\u2019t had any formula since the end of April .\u00a0 Her jaw dropped and then her whole face split into a grin.\u00a0  \u201cThat is fantastic news! You\u2019e worked so hard for this you must be so pleased!\u201d  she said in her typical understated fashion. Then it was  our  turn for a collective jaw-drop.\u00a0 After taking Nik\u2019s height and weight, the nurse informed us that Nik\u2019s grown just over  half an inch \u00a0 in the past six weeks.\u00a0 (I\u2019ll wait while that sinks in\u2026)\u00a0 That certainly explains why he\u2019s got an insatiable appetite and why he\u2019s not gained any weight.\u00a0 I know he\u2019ll be built like Niksdad \u2014tall and lean\u2014 but I was sort of hoping he might wait a few more years\u00a0 before he tries to catch up to him! Our visit with the ENT went better than we expected.\u00a0 Okay, other than the part where the audiology department forgot to check us in and we waited too long for a hearing test.\u00a0 The bottom line is that  Nik\u2019s hearing is in the normal range , there\u2019s no sign of infection or other cause for alarm and the ENT  is going to investigate  the mysterious mastoid fluid build up.\u00a0 He wants to see Nik in three months and may order a CT scan then.\u00a0 He also asked us to send him copies of the MRI\u2019s so he can review them as a series. Basically, as long as Nik\u2019s hearing is okay and there\u2019s no sign of infection, the approach is to wait and watch.\u00a0 The alternative would be a mastoidectomy which none of us is prepared for.\u00a0 We are, however, probably looking at a new set of myringotomy tubes this winter; this will make Nik\u2019s third set. *sigh* By the time we finished with the back and forth of seeing the ENT then getting the hearing test and seeing the ENT again to discuss the results, Nik was pretty tired.\u00a0 But not too tired to eat his way through the hospital cafeteria once it opened for dinner at 5:00 p.m. In addition to his old standby, peanut butter sandwich, Nik scarfed down a banana, some cantaloupe, some pineapple and several bites of my baby lima beans.\u00a0 My God, the boy can put it away! By all rights, Nik was  fully entitled  to a cranky ride home and a fussy time before bed.\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 He sang and chattered and played with his LeapPad book and then willingly put on his pajamas and let us brush his teeth.\u00a0 He was asleep before we even closed the door to his room. Serendipity?\u00a0 Perfect Storm?\u00a0 Whatever it is, I\u2019ll take a few more like this, please!

True dat, honey! *********** After a long day full of learning, playing and stuffing his hungry little face, Nik is usually more than happy to get ready for bed.\u00a0 After pajamas and tooth brushing, Nik\u2019s usual routine is to turn and give me a quick kiss as he reaches for his daddy to carry him up the stairs. Tonight?\u00a0 Nik  launched  his little leggy self right onto my lap \u2014face first\u2014 wrapped his arms tightly around my neck and nestled his soft little cheek against my shoulder.\u00a0 As I kissed the top of his head,  he started to hum softly . Me?\u00a0 I may have leaked a tear or two. ********** I am watching television; Nik has been asleep for a couple of hours. Through the monitor, I hear a few small cries from Nik; he\u2019s probably having a dream.\u00a0 Minutes later, Nik\u2019s whimpers turn into full blown cries and I can hear him banging his head against the crib.\u00a0 As I dash up the stairs to\u00a0Nik\u2019s room, the cries become more shrill and distraught; I hear the sound of fist hitting flesh.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a few months, I think, since we\u2019ve experienced this  familiar nighttime scenario .\u00a0 With a deep breath, I steel myself for a long stretch spent at Nik\u2019s bedside \u2013one hand pressing against his ear, the other holding his hand to keep him from punching himself in the face.\u00a0  The memories of his horrible self-inflicted bruises will remain with me for a long time. Nik quickly realizes I am there and stands in his crib, arms outstretched for me to lift him.\u00a0 I scoop him into my arms; he presses his face into my shoulder as his fists rain down on my hand.\u00a0 His head rears back and cracks hard against my cheekbone.\u00a0  \u201cShhh, Mama\u2019s here, little bear; Mama\u2019s here, it\u2019s ok.\u201d \u00a0 His little body shudders with a sob; my heart clenches and my throat tightens with the dread of  this familiar road  we are on.\u00a0 I sit on the ottoman and begin to rock. I croon softly in his ear,  \u201cHush little baby, don\u2019t say a word; Mama\u2019s gonna buy you a mocking bird\u2026\u201d \u00a0 Nik\u2019s body has gotten so long and leggy that my arms can barely contain him, but I refuse to let him weather this storm alone.\u00a0 I hold him against my body and rain small kisses on his brow, each one a silent prayer that tonight is  not  like those  other nights .\u00a0 I feel moisture drip onto my forearm.\u00a0 My tears? Nik\u2019s?\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t really matter, we are one and the same in the darkness. After twenty minutes\u2014 and  two  cramped arms\u2014 my prayers are answered; Nik\u2019s eyes drift closed and his head\u00a0sinks heavily\u00a0into my chest.\u00a0 I settle him back into his crib with a kiss. ********** We\u2019re still here and all is, generally speaking, well.\u00a0 The tube-pulling has subsided; it seems we\u2019ve reached a state of  detente  wherein we try to use the tube as little as possible (or give Nik smaller volumes of fluid slightly more frequently) and Nik doesn\u2019t pull it out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also gotten a different type of feeding tube with a slightly differently shaped \u201cballoon\u201d which, we hope, should be more difficult for Nik to remove.\u00a0\u00a0 Fingers crossed. The potty training continues at a more subdued pace; we\u2019ve had to choose our battles and are waiting for the arrival of a specially ordered commode chair that we can leave out for Nik.\u00a0\u00a0 It might arrive by Labor Day; I  wish  I were kidding \u2014I am  not .\u00a0 Meanwhile, we\u2019ve had to get  really   creative .\u00a0 I may cover that in another post \u2014minus any graphic or disgusting details, I promise!

{"date": "June 14, 2009 ", "body": "I\u2019ve got a head full of thoughts to share \u2014many about communication, the challenges and intricacies of using AAC devices, and some thoughts and questions about the interplay of vision and attention span.\u00a0 They\u2019ll have to stay there a while longer, I\u2019m afraid. My days have been filled with playing  \u201cguard the (feeding) tube\u201d  and  \u201cmop up after me!\u201d \u00a0 Seriously.\u00a0 Nik has taken to pulling his tube out more than half a dozen times in any given day (today is a new high, I think) and is making his distaste for pull-ups \u2014even when dry\u2014  inordinately  clear. It has gone from startling to amusing to downright annoying as hell.\u00a0 Where once Nik would  either  pull his tube  or  strip and go to the bathroom on the floor, now we are hit with a constant double-whammy.\u00a0 It has become a game to Nik.\u00a0 He cannot be left unattended right now. Niksdad and I have decided to take it in stride and not make a big to-do over the behavior.\u00a0 We know Nik is trying to communicate that he wishes to be rid of both the pull-ups and the tube.\u00a0 We also know that several things have to happen in order for that to come to pass sooner rather than later.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on those things  daily .\u00a0 However, Nik, in his infinite  smarty-pantsness , has decided we\u2019re not taking him seriously enough and has escalated his campaign.\u00a0 Yesterday, as I stood\u00a0in the\u00a0kitchen preparing dinner for my perpetually hungry son, I heard a distinct  thwack of snapping elastic.\u00a0 Concerned, as there should be no items in his play area which make such a sound, I looked over the gate to make sure Nik was okay.\u00a0 There stood my indignant child, in all his  au naturel  glory, very deliberately ripping the elastic tabs on the dry pull-up he had just removed.\u00a0 I had to chuckle at his determination; he\u2019s figured out that we cannot reuse the pull-up if it won\u2019t stay on his bottom.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As I looked, I could also see that Nik had removed his feeding tube \u2014yet again. I sighed and turned to get the necessary supplies to restore order to his clothing and his tummy.\u00a0 As I returned to the family room, I found this tableau.\u00a0 There was  no hint  of randomness to it in the least. \"Dear Mama & Papa, I'm D-O-N-E! Got it?\" Dear son, \n Your message has been received loud and clear.\u00a0 Believe me, we want to be done with this nonsense of the feeding tube and the pull-ups once and for all as well.\u00a0 Alas, it is not yet time and we must continue to dress you and re-insert the dreaded tube for a while longer. \n Meanwhile, please give us a break? \u2018K, thanks. \n Love, \nMama and Papa ********************************** \nETA:\u00a0\u00a0 Nik decided we really  hadn\u2019t  gotten the message clearly; today he pulled the tube and  hid  it under the sofa.\u00a0 Pray for us.

Oddly enough, it\u2019s the same thing that caused him pain a mere eight days ago: an ear infection.\u00a0 As it turns out, the anitbiotic didn\u2019t\u00a0\u00a0knock out the infection and it came back.\u00a0 With a vengeance. Today, Nik spiked a fever of 102 F and lost his appetite entirely (!!!).\u00a0 Truly, I\u2019ve never seen a child who wanted to eat more than Nik does.\u00a0 But today, all he could muster was a token bite or two before he simply started licking the flavor off of things and putting them back on the plate (or the floor of my car).\u00a0 Such a sad little boy.

{"date": "September 23, 2013 ", "body": "The natural patterns and rhythms of verbal communication do not come naturally to Nik. Despite the fact that he\u2019s had his speech device for three-plus years now, he still struggles with parts of speech and being able to put words together in a way which is understandable to \u201coutsiders.\u201d It\u2019s just a part of how his brain is wired. Much of Nik\u2019s default method of communication is \u201ctelegraphic,\u201d meaning that he will use one word for multiple meanings and that meaning is figured out by the listener who must either be psychic or must elicit more information to determine the context in which Nik means them. For example, Nik may say \u201cPark Daddy\u201d to mean any of the following: I want to go to the park with Daddy when he gets home from work. \n I went to the park with Daddy this morning. \n Will Daddy take me to the park? \n I like going to the park with Daddy. In speech therapy, Nik is working on using \u201caction words\u201d to go with the things he labels. For example, when he says  \u201cPark Daddy,\u201d  Ms. K will ask what actions he can do at the park\u2013 swing, climb, etc. They work on pairing nouns with verbs and reinforcing structure and the relationship between them. It\u2019s a painstaking process which needs to be supported consistently\u2013 not just in his twice weekly sessions with Ms. K. Nik loves to chatter to me as we drive along to the store after school or on the weekends. I try to encourage and coach his language use all the time. Lately, though, I can tell that Nik finds it annoying. I can\u2019t say I blame him; who likes to be grilled all the time, right? Sometimes, he flat-out refuses to participate and changes the subject to avoid the work. Others? He plays me like a fiddle and I don\u2019t even realize it until it\u2019s too late! * * * * * * * * * * \nOn the way home from the store yesterday, we shared a small bag of chips. As we drove along, I doled out chips every time Nik asked  \u201cmore chips.\u201d \n \u201cNik, what actions can we do with chips?\u201d \nWe\u2019ve done this exercise often enough so I knew, from the silence in the back seat, that he was processing the fact that chips are food and you can eat, bite, or chew food.\u00a0 Uncertain if I would need to prompt him with possible answers, I asked again. \u201cNik, what is an action we can do with chips?\u201d I heard the quiet  beep  of Nik activating the screen on his device to answer. \u201cH-O-L-D bag.\u201d Well played, son. Well played. * * * * * * * * * * \nI promised Nik we would go to McDonald\u2019s after his therapy this morning. He was extremely excited.\u00a0 We don\u2019t dine there with any remote degree of regularity; I try to save it for special times (or travel emergencies) and he loves going inside to eat.\u00a0\u00a0 On the way to see Ms. K, Nik and I were discussing what he would have for breakfast. He suddenly got stuck in a loop and began to perseverate on   eggs . \u201cEggs, eggs, eggs, eggs\u2026\u201d Doing my best to help him break out of it, I tried to expand the language.  \u201cNik, what can you DO with eggs?\u201d  I asked. \u201cEggs, eggs, eggs, eggs\u2026\u201d \u201cNik, there are lots of things we can do with eggs, right? Eggs are food and we can\u2026\u201d  I began to sign  eat ,  bite  and  chew  as possible clues for him. \u201cEat, eat, eat\u201d \u00a0 he replied from the back seat. \u201cVery good! That\u2019s right. We can eat,\u201d  I signed.  \u201cOr we can Buh\u2026\u201d  as I signed the word  bite  and made the sound of the letter B. \u201cEat, B-\u201d \n I could tell he was about to spell it out and I started to nod in approval. \u201c\u2026A-C-O-N. Eat bacon. Eat bacon.\u201d \n Yep, I\u2019d say he\u2019s got the important stuff down pat.

{"date": "September 25, 2013 ", "body": "On our way to school yesterday\u2014 NIK:  One, two . \nME:  I don\u2019t understand; can you use your words to tell me more? \nNIK:  I.want.candy.one.two.please. \nME:  Thank you! Here you go. I hand Nik two tic tac candies. It\u2019s a game we play each morning. It started years ago as a way of encouraging counting skills. Clearly, we are beyond that now and we have modified it over time. Now, I use this same exchange to work on language skills and, sometimes, concepts. NIK:  Three, four. \nME:  I understand, but you just had two. You need to wait. \nNIK:  Three, four, please . \nME:  Tell you what, buddy, you may have three and four after we pass the fire station. As I hear the words come from my mouth, it occurs to me\u2014I don\u2019t know if Nik really understands. We don\u2019t exactly narrate our daily travels anymore and we don\u2019t know any firefighters. Other than a character in a story, I\u2019m not sure Nik\u2019s really been exposed to the idea of a fire station. I mean, we drive  past  the large brick edifice multiple times a day\u2014on the way to school, on the way home, when we go to the store, the park, the pool.\u00a0 It is a landmark known to everyone because of both its importance and its location. We take it for granted as simply another part of the scenery. NIK:  Three, four. Now, please, Mama. \nME:  No, sweetie. You need to wait until we get to the fire station. Do you know where that is? I see Nik sign  \u201cyes\u201d  in the mirror, but I\u2019m not convinced he really knows. As we approach the intersection, the light turns red; I ask Nik to point to the fire station. He points, vaguely, to the right side of the car; the fire station is on the left. Realizing he doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, my heart lurches a little. In that instant, it becomes vitally important to me that my son understands what the fire house is and where it is\u2014 as if it\u2019s a confirmation that he does, indeed, have things in common with his typical peers. After all, all boys love fire houses and fire engines, right? I sigh, wistfully, and remind myself that it\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t. Maybe. ME: (clearly refusing to give up as I point to the fire house on the opposite corner)  Nik, look. That\u2019s the fire station. It\u2019s the house where the fire engines live. Can you see it, buddy? \nNIK:  Fire engine.house. Fire engine house. Inside. \nME:  Oh, sweetie, we can\u2019t go inside. We have to go to school. The light changes and we begin to drive. I tell myself it\u2019s a start; we can keep working on it. As we drive past the fire station, I hear some rapid vocalizations from Nik followed by a flurry of beeps from his device. NIK:  Fire engine. Sit. Fire engine. Sit.Later. \nME:  Can you use a sentence so I understand what you mean, sweetie? \nNIK:\u00a0  I.want.sit.fire.engine. Today. I want sit fire engine today, please, Mama. And  that , my friends, is how it started to rain  inside  my car, forcing this mama to drive to school without being able to see a thing.\u00a0 It is also why I am now on a mission to take my boy to the fire station as soon as possible.

{"date": "October 12, 2009 ", "body": "I\u2019ve always been fascinated by kaleidoscopes.\u00a0 Turn the tube one way and brightly colored glass particles create a gorgeous, perfectly symmetrical array of brilliance.\u00a0 Many, many moments with my son are like that \u2014dazzling; the colors almost hurt my eyes they are so intense and the pattern so beautiful.\u00a0 Occasionally, if we\u2019re lucky, we actually have entire days of lustrous sparkle and dazzling displays.\u00a0 Saturday was a shining example of such brilliance within my son.\u00a0 We took Nik to the local Fall Festival at the same orchard that hosts the  Peach Festival  every August; there was nary a meltdown in sight as we drove to  \u201cthe farm.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0With a few exceptions, Nik was like all the other children there \u2014clambering over bales of hay to reach the top of the slides, running through the corn maze, laughing and enjoying the glorious autumn sunshine.\u00a0 Never mind that he wanted to eat the pumpkins; he kept signing  apple \u00a0as he tried to lick the orange skin.\u00a0 Never mind that he had no interest in the petting zoo except to try to climb the fence.\u00a0 The whole experience was a gigantic leap forward from a year ago when Nik wouldn\u2019t even go near the hay or the slides, and kept losing his still tentative balance while standing in the \u201csandbox\u201d full of soy beans and corn; he just wanted to climb in and out without actually  touching  the beans or corn\u2014a major sensory aversion for him.\u00a0 I think we lasted twenty minutes before we threw in the towel. This year,\u00a0Nik managed to hold his own\u2014 even in the face of our forgetting to give him his medication before we left the house.\u00a0 He tolerated a return drive home,  not \u00a0getting out of the car (which usually sends him right over the edge) and was pleasant and sing-songy the entire trip back to  \u201cthe farm.\u201d \u00a0 Niksdad gave him his medicine and that was that; there were slides to slide and hills to conquer. To say I was proud of my boy would be an understatement. Sometimes the gem-colored bits slip and tumble\u2014 tripping and sticking on one another.\u00a0 The slightest change can create a jarring, confusing jumble with no discernable pattern, no rhyme or reason to the splintered shards.\u00a0 Lately, it seems our days are becoming more and more like this imperfect kaleidoscope.\u00a0 The colors are still there \u2014we see glimpses as they tumble around, but the pieces are in constant motion, the formation constantly changing.\u00a0 Just when we think we can detect a pattern the pieces shift again, leaving us no closer to the serene brilliance we\u2019ve come to expect as the norm. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s simply the time of year or a time of growth for my son which causes such tremendous shifts in his daily patterns; I don\u2019t think I can anymore.\u00a0 His behaviors have become more extreme \u2014both the highs and lows\u2014as I cling to a rapidly eroding sense of any middle ground called peace.\u00a0 Sleep has become an elusive specter which will not settle comfortably upon our house.\u00a0 Instead, it teases with brief snatches of slumber interspersed with longer periods of wakefulness.\u00a0 Here, too, there is no discernable rhyme or reason to the patterns.\u00a0 One night is filled with painful shrieks and injurious wrestling.\u00a0 The next is a cascade of gentle laughter and quiet singing as the moon dances in the sky outside my window.\u00a0 We are left weary, without answers to questions we\u2019re not even certain of any more. The daily behaviors are becoming more difficult to laugh off and dismiss as  amusing antics. \u00a0 The long-awaited physical milestones \u2014running, climbing, throwing\u2014 have crossed an invisible threshold and become potentially dangerous for their perseveration and lack of control.\u00a0 The funny videos I post of Nik climbing or standing on the back of the sofa  are \u00a0funny \u2014for a few moments.\u00a0 Then, they become evidence of hazardous behavior\u00a0as Nik is determined to master every physical space in reach; he cares not whether we admonish him to stop. Our home is, bit by bit, becoming a Spartan fortress.\u00a0 Little by little, we have had to strip away  nearly everything \u00a0from our family room \u2014where\u00a0Nik spends much of his time when at home.\u00a0 The end table and lamp long ago gave way to a wall-mounted swing-arm light.\u00a0 That quickly was replaced by a swag lamp suspended from the loft above.\u00a0 The pictures on the wall and the handmade wedding quilt\u00a0 have recently been removed to keep them safe from Nik\u2019s curious hands and to keep Nik safe from broken glass or having an oak quilt hanger crash down on his head as he attempted to swing from the quilt.\u00a0 Furniture has been removed from the room. Moments of brilliance amid increasingly longer, more frequent moments of jarring disharmony.  \u00a0 The boy we weren\u2019t sure would walk now runs everywhere.\u00a0 Even his orthopedist recently remarked at how fast Nik is.\u00a0 His exact words\u2014as Nik took off at top speed down the hallway on Tuesday:  \u201cHoly cow, look at his acceleration! Give that kid a football!\u201d \u00a0 I live in abject fear of Nik getting away from me in a parking lot or in the street.\u00a0 The boy who, for years, wouldn\u2019t raise his arms over his head now has amazing upper body strength; he can pull himself up and over nearly everything.\u00a0 If he can get a good hand hold and something to push his feet against, Nik can climb anything.\u00a0 I can no longer take him shopping unless I have help because he can climb out of the cart faster than I can get him back in. The boy who has been aloof for years now wants to be in physical contact with people  all the time .\u00a0 Sitting or holding hands together is not enough.\u00a0 He wants to be climbing my torso, flipping himself backward in a somersault and doing it again\u2026 and again and again .\u00a0 He wants to ride on his daddy\u2019s shoulders so he can hang upside down by his ankles as he squeals with delight.\u00a0 Not once or twice but for as long as Niksdad can hold him. The boy who was once oblivious to his surroundings now sees  everything. \u00a0\u00a0 His compulsion\u00a0to touch everything, to explore and dissect and analyze\u00a0is all-consuming.\u00a0 On one hand, these are all very good things \u2014 until he begins, literally, climbing over his neurologist to get his stethoscope or the reflex hammer.\u00a0 The doctor, a really wonderful sport who adores Nik (thank God!), puts Nik down only to fend him off moments later \u2014 repeatedly .\u00a0  I do not sit idly observing; \u00a0I am in the thick of it trying to keep\u00a0Nik occupied sitting on the floor.\u00a0 It is a fruitless endeavor; I finally end up having to hold him in my arms \u2014like a sack of writhing potatoes over my chronically aching shoulders.\u00a0 I am drenched in sweat by the time our visit is over.\u00a0 Sadly, this is not a one-time occurrence. We once thought it was wonderful the way Nik explored his world so physically; it was a necessary part of familiarizing himself with the world he was unable to experience for so long.\u00a0 Now, it has become a danger as well as a distraction; Nik is unable to sit still long enough to complete a simple puzzle or to play a short game of matching images.\u00a0 He is no longer available for more than the briefest moments of learning.\u00a0 Nik is a rapidly growing, strong \u2014 and incredibly smart \u2014 whirling dervish; we need to be able to harness that energy so our brilliant boy can learn. We\u2019re on the verge of adding yet another diagnosis to my child\u2019s already hefty dossier \u2014  ADHD .\u00a0 We\u2019ve fought it for a long time, trying to help him with diet and activity.\u00a0 However, the current situation is simply untenable\u2014 for all of us.\u00a0 Reluctantly, we have begun exploring medications which might help Nik with some of his restlessness and impulse control.\u00a0 But there are challenges of side effects which, while never desirable, could actually be dangerous to Nik\u2019s health.\u00a0 We\u2019re limited to certain medications because Nik still won\u2019t chew and swallow more than soft foods or crackers and dry cereal; he certainly cannot swallow pills yet.\u00a0 The remaining options can put him at significant risk for heart troubles because of his cardiac history; we have to get a full cardiac work-up before we can even consider certain meds.\u00a0 Then there\u2019s the whole  loss of appetite  side effect which can be significant with some of the meds available to us.\u00a0 That\u2019s a huge concern to us given Nik\u2019s feeding issues and history of  failure-to-thrive .\u00a0 Though he\u2019s growing well now, Nik is still not even on the growth chart for weight in his age range.\u00a0 My sinewy boy is still able to wear\u00a0size 3T pants\u2014 despite the approach of his sixth birthday a mere seven weeks from now. The final issue is Nik\u2019s hypersensitivity to any medications which alter his central nervous system.\u00a0 Seriously, the slightest changes can send him  right over the edge ; the highs get higher and the lows get lower \u2014and the swings are faster than usual. It\u2019s not a safe situation. Still, we\u2019re largely out of other options right now.\u00a0 Even the neurontin \u2014which significantly helps with Nik\u2019s mystery pains \u2014does nothing for Nik\u2019s sleep.\u00a0 Nor does the melatonin help.\u00a0 Nik wakes every night now \u2014 multiple times most nights, at predictable intervals \u2014 and stays awake for a while playing or singing in his crib.\u00a0 During the day, the combination of extreme hyperactivity and utter lack of impulse control makes it nearly impossible for me to leave Nik alone for more than very short periods of time any more.\u00a0 The added layer of\u00a0significantly disturbed sleep compounds our respective inabilities to cope with the stress. It feels like a deal with the devil; we\u2019re damned if we do, we\u2019re damned if we don\u2019t.\u00a0 Yet, the cost of doing nothing is too great any more.\u00a0 The kaleidoscope turns and the fragments tumble again.\u00a0 What will we see as the shards settle into place\u2014 chaos and disarray or brilliance and beauty?\u00a0 One masks the other at any given moment.

The good news:\u00a0Nik\u2019s ears looked great and he\u2019s gained some more weight!

He\u2019s not afraid to tell a doctor they didn\u2019t look in his ears or to ask the phlebotomist\u00a0for her tourniquet. (Relax, our answer is always a resounding NO!) He knows how to work the otoscopes\u00a0and the blood pressure monitors, the pulse oximiters and the electronic scales and where they keep the disposable caps for the thermometers. It\u2019s all just second nature to him and we don\u2019t give it much thought. We\u2019ve walked this hallway what feels like a million times through the years\u2014 many of them as recently as this past week. The pictures on the walls haven\u2019t changed, the faces are pretty much the same. It works for us\u2013 for him, the routine, the predictability and familiarity. He knows Ms. M at the coffee shop who waits patiently as he orders his \u201ccookie chocolate\u201d with his speech device. Mr. John, the valet attendant, who always gives a smile and a fist bump and who never, ever makes it a problem if we want to play on the playground even after the car arrives. My little ambassador knows the nurses in varying departments by name and remembers the color of the stethoscope everyone wears. Dr. C? Red. Dr. D? Black with tape. Ms. T? Green\u2026and so on. Today, we\u2019re winding down from a very long morning of appointments on the heels of a week\u2019s worth of appointments and disrupted routines. I can tell he\u2019s off kilter and out of spoons. I\u2019m kind of feeling the same way. It\u2019s been a hard break at the end of the school year and he\u2019s missing not only his routines and outlets, but his  very best school friend . Him:  Marcus, today \nMe : No, baby, not today.  (*crack* there goes my heart breaking just a little bit more with each repetition of this exchange) \nHim :  Marcus, school tomorrow. \nMe:  No, baby, not tomorrow.\u201d  *crack* \nHim:  Maybe . My beautiful, loving boy. So hopeful.  So resilient . He stumbles against me periodically as we walk, loosely holding hands; I can feel his weariness. He looks longingly at the wagons of the other children going by. I silently berate myself for not getting a wagon for him; he\u2019s tough but even he has his limits and his legs have been aching so much lately. If we weren\u2019t in the home stretch heading off to get our requisite cookie for the long drive home, I would absolutely get a wagon. He stumbles again and I feel him pull away from me, his hand slipping from mine. Suddenly, I\u2019m on high\u00a0alert as\u00a0he darts to one side. Instantaneously, I scan the area and evaluate the possibilities of where he is heading. I see an office door tucked into the wall up ahead and dash to cut off his inevitable entry. I beat him to the door which wasn\u2019t his target after all. His destination was something I hadn\u2019t even contemplated. He stops suddenly and cranes his neck upward to look at one of the many images which have become so much a part of our, my, unconscious mind. His spindly arms reach upward toward the mural \u2013 almost in supplication. One hand on the image, he is utterly transfixed. Relief washes over me. \u201cNik, what on earth\u2014\u201c I begin. Then, I see the image on the wall. I am unable to breathe and I feel slightly dizzy. I am suddenly sucked into a vortex. Unbidden, hot tears course down my cheeks; I couldn\u2019t stop them if I tried. I watch as his delicate fingers reach up to touch the face of the child in the image\u2014an infant on a ventilator. The woman \u2013 I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s a nurse because of the scrubs, but also because of the tender way she is cupping the top of the infant\u2019s head\u2014looks nothing like any of the nurses who spent so many months by our side all those years ago. Yet, suddenly, I can see their faces and hear their voices. I can hear it  all \u00a0so clearly\u2014the hum and whoosh of the ventilator, the sounds of the automated blood pressure machinery. I can hear the sounds of the gentle crooning as they shushed and soothed sick babies. And the alarms\u2014oh, God\u2014the alarms. I can feel the sudden, urgent energy in the room when something went terribly wrong. And the tears and stricken silence following the unthinkable. I don\u2019t think about those things often\u2014seldom consciously. Yet, I can\u2019t help but wonder at how deeply they have been etched into my psyche. How little it takes to trigger the emotions and memories. Nik\u2019s finger traces over the image of controls on the ventilator. He turns his head to me as if in question, but I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s asking. Could  he  possibly remember? He was so tiny, so fragile\u2014weighing barely more than a pound of butter. Is it even possible? I can\u2019t help but wonder. Is his sudden, reverent fascination with this particular image on this particular day because of an offhanded remark I made to a nurse today about how little he weighed and how long he was in the hospital? Does he have those visceral flashbacks, too? I can point to specific habits and traits he has developed as a direct result of his 209 days in the NICU\u2014habituation they call it. The way he likes to fall asleep all scrunched into a ball with his feet and head pressing against something? That\u2019s a vestige of all those months cocooned in a bendy bumper. The way he can sleep through almost ANY sound, but cannot sleep alone in his room. The way he constantly needs music in the background of whatever it is he is doing. But, never, before this dizzying, heart aching moment, have I ever suspected he had more than hazy awareness of his time in the hospital. I have kept my own memories and emotions so neatly compartmentalized that I simply assumed he had no real memory of any of it. It\u2019s been easier for me to cope with my own waves of remembrance that way. The thought that he might have powerful conscious memories of his difficult sojourn tears at my heart. If I, at nearly 50, still cannot process it all without falling apart, what must it be like for him? How does he process all that happened to his tiny body and tender spirit without the layers of cognition and understanding? I don\u2019t have any nice neat wrap up to this story; it\u2019s unfolding as I write. I\u2019m processing as I go. Apparently, so is my son.

Gov. Denn and Rep. Terry Schooley held a meeting about H.B. 119 yesterday with disability and education advocates. They will be introducing a substitute bill next week that deletes the section on the extended school year and that exempts special education statutes and regulations from waivers (meaning schools and districts may not request waivers to special education policies, regulations, etc.) \n We\u2019ll look for the new legislation next week and keep you advised. In the meantime, we want to thank the Lt. Governor and Rep. Schooley for listening to our concerns. I also want to thank all of you who contacted your own legislators about this bill. The autism community was particularly cited as the community most concerned, so our voices were heard. This was a disability wide effort that included the 3 state disability councils, LDAF and the Arc of Delaware. We presented a united front and it was effective. \n Theda M.

{"date": "May 7, 2009 ", "body": "When he was just a wee little slip of a scrap of a thing in the NICU, we learned very early on that Nik didn\u2019t like it when his diaper was dirty.\u00a0 The minute\u00a0Nik was wet \u2014or worse\u2014 he would wiggle his  impossibly tiny  foot which was wrapped in an  impossibly tiny  oxygen saturation monitor sensor.\u00a0 This temporarily interrupted the signals to the sensor; the resulting alarms caused multiple nurses to come  running  to make sure he was alright; as soon as he felt the touch of their hands he would unclench his toes and\u00a0his oxygen saturation level would perk right up.\u00a0 Little stinker, wasn\u2019t he?\u00a0 That should have been a  giant  clue for Niksdad and me. With all the amazing  developmental leaps forward  which Nik has made in the past months, it was inevitable that potty training would pop up on the horizon.\u00a0 We knew the day was coming; we just didn\u2019t know how soon. * * * * * For the longest time, childproofing our home hasn\u2019t really been a big issue; Nik always played in the family room and never seemed to want for space.\u00a0 He was perfectly content to toddle from end to end of the room or to race around in circles, seemingly unaware of the world beyond the baby gates \u2014until recently. As I\u2019ve mentioned in a  previous post , Nik has mastered the fine art of climbing over the baby gate \u2014both shod and in bare feet.\u00a0 We installed a second gate on top of the first gate connecting to the kitchen.\u00a0 The back hall is more challenging as it leads to the laundry area, a powder room and the garage.\u00a0 Rather than install a second gate in the back hall, we simply locked everything that Nik could possibly get into.\u00a0 That meant using the deadbolt and the keyed door handle on the garage door, placing a safety tether on the bi-fold laundry doors and placing a doorknob cover on the powder room door to keep Nik from being able to turn the knob.\u00a0 With all that added security, we decided to leave the gate open; it seemed to be overkill and Nik can climb it in a matter of seconds anyway. Nik has had a wonderful time taking toys into the back hall and playing in his own little alcove.\u00a0 He especially loves the fact that the garage door is steel (it\u2019s a fire door) and his fridge phonics letters and player stick to the door. \u00a0Every once in a while Nik would kind of rattle the laundry doors trying to figure them out.\u00a0 He would also spin the knob cover on the powder room door. Unbeknownst to us, he was  actually  conducting a detailed study of the design of the knob cover, trying to figure out how to open it. It took forty eight hours. \u00a0 Technically, Nik never actually figured out how to turn the door knob with the cover attached.\u00a0 Being one to work smart instead of hard, Nik simply figured out how to remove the cover entirely.\u00a0 I discovered this by finding him splashing in the toilet one day \u2014mere minutes before we were to leave for his therapy appointments.\u00a0 Since then, we\u2019ve resorted to locking the powder room door which, I must confess, is beyond inconvenient since it is the only bathroom on the first floor. So, now we have what I jokingly refer to as Baby Gitmo; our family room has become an unarmed fortress designed to keep Nik contained and safe.\u00a0 Even with the inconvenience of the locked powder room, it\u2019s been working fairly well \u2014 until Monday of this week .\u00a0 Nik threw us yet another curve ball; he decided to show us  in no uncertain terms  that he is ready for potty training. * * * * * Nik\u2019s M.O. has always been to give subtle clues and escalating the messages until we get it loud and clear.\u00a0 It\u2019s been this way his entire life and has not changed regardless of the issue.\u00a0 Why I thought this would be different, well, I really don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure where the subtlety was but, on Monday, Nik really ramped up the message.\u00a0 First, he stripped himself bare and divested himself of his wet pull-up.\u00a0 I simply dressed him and put him in a fresh one.\u00a0 Next, Nik decided to try to change his own poopy diaper; fortunately, I discovered that in time to avert a very big mess.\u00a0 As before, I simply changed him into clean pants and dressed him again. The third time, Nik decided he  obviously  needed to do something to get my attention; he stripped again, this time out of a  dry  pull-up, and peed on the floor directly outside the powder room door.\u00a0\u00a0Niksdad and I got the message loud and clear! Potty training has commenced in earnest. \u00a0 The challenges feel nearly insurmountable:\u00a0 Nik will not sit still long enough to watch a video and climbs on the TV cabinet if it is open so he can get to the buttons on the cable box and DVD player; things such as  \u201cPotty Power\u201d  won\u2019t help us.\u00a0 Really, the issue in our house isn\u2019t so much motivation as it is communication. \u00a0Nik is nonverbal and doesn\u2019t have a way to communicate his need in advance of the event but is  adamant  about not wearing a soiled diaper.\u00a0 And the  only  bathroom available for use is locked up  and  is behind multiple gates.\u00a0 Short of sitting in the same room with him all day long, I haven\u2019t yet figured out a method which will work for the long term.\u00a0 (We can\u2019t leave a potty chair in the room with him b/c of sensory exploration.) We\u2019re going to try some simple push-button devices which we can program to say  \u201cPotty!\u201d \u00a0 They need to be mounted onto something so that Nik can\u2019t throw them as he is wont to do with many of his toys.\u00a0 While we wait to figure out that part, Niksdad and I are simply trying to set a schedule for taking Nik to the bathroom.\u00a0 Ultimately, we envision that we will have to  unlock  the bathroom door,  lock  the toilet (and wait to see how long it takes Nik to figure that out), install magnetic cabinet  locks  under the sink (Nik is strong enough to break the plastic ones), and  turn off the water  at the sink to discourage his playing.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a perfect system but we  think \u00a0  hope   pray  it will work.\u00a0 It\u2019s just going to take us a few days to put it in place. Nik has already decided that one is a few days too many.\u00a0 Yesterday was filled with many instances of Nik going  au natural  after he\u2019d wet his pull-up.\u00a0 It got to the point that we simply put him on the potty at regular intervals after meals and after having water \u2014all to no avail, of course.\u00a0 At one point, Nik stripped himself down and we decided it was a good time for a shower.\u00a0 Nik adores his shower time with Daddy as it\u2019s giggly, silly time in one of his favorite sensory environments.\u00a0 After his shower, as I was preparing his dinner, Nik stripped himself bare  again  \u2014dry pull-up and all\u2014 and proceeded to pee on the floor in the family room!\u00a0 As Niksdad and I double teamed Nik to dress him and clean up the mess, we couldn\u2019t figure out  why  he would do such a thing if he was dry.\u00a0 While we mopped up the mess, Nik went into the back hall and  stripped again  and started to fidget at the bathroom door.\u00a0 I asked if he was ready to sit on the potty and he responded by signing  yes .\u00a0 So, we went through the motions of sitting on the potty  despite the absolute knowledge that it would be unproductive .\u00a0 After all, Niksdad and I had just cleaned up the evidence of that.\u00a0 Nik sat for a few minutes as I sang songs about going potty.\u00a0 He signed  all done  and we got him dressed again.\u00a0 The issue never came up again.\u00a0 Niksdad and I scratched our heads wondering what it had all been about when it hit me!\u00a0 Nik  knew  that he was clean \u2014fresh from the shower\u2014 and didn\u2019t want to sit in a wet diaper, so he pulled the floor-watering trick.\u00a0 I think the  second  time was probably because he\u2019s already made the association with sitting on the potty after he\u2019s had a wet pull-up or  \u201caccident.\u201d \u00a0 In his mind, we hadn\u2019t completed the sequence he had come to expect. * * * * * Nik has already made the connection with wet pants and sitting on the potty.\u00a0 Today, after  every  wet diaper, he would go stand at the door and rattle the knob.\u00a0 Once we sat him on the toilet and waited a couple of minutes, he\u2019d tell us he was  all done  and that was that.\u00a0 I think we need to get that speech generating device as quickly as possible so we can work on the timing. I see some significant bathroom maintenance/upgrading in Niksdad\u2019s immediate future \u2014the cabinets, the water, etcetera.\u00a0 Meanwhile, I\u2019m looking for a slightly bigger potty seat; the one we have is a tad on the small side and seems uncomfortable to Nik. \u00a0\u00a0I suppose we should have thought of these things sooner but, well, we  thought  we had more time! Clearly, Nik is far readier than we are for this new endeavor!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guess it\u2019s time for us to get off the pot.

So very typical and yet\u2026 not . It occurs to me that, once I\u2019ve prepared his food, the only assistance he needs lately is an occasional admonition to use his napkin or to slow down.

So many years we worked with Nik to just be able to  sit  in a chair without falling over, to hold a utensil , to lift a cup. So many years we worked with professionals, like our beloved Ms. Michelle, to help him learn to tolerate textures, to initiate a swallow, to chew. Teaching him how to drink from a straw, to suck, swallow and breathe.

In case I can\u2019t find the words \u2014or the time, I\u2019ll leave you with a few glimpses of what we\u2019ve been up to\u2026minus the tube-pulling.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave that to your imagination. \n\t\t\t#gallery-753-6 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-753-6 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 50%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-753-6 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-753-6 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.prentrom.com/"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/05/18/im-still-here/", "title": "I\u2019m Still Here"},

{"date": "April 16, 2009 ", "body": "If you are autistic and live in Delaware, if you are the parent of or caregiver for an autistic person in Delaware, or if you know someone who falls into either category, please read the following items and take action to safeguard valuable services. ************ To our friends, family and members of the autism community, Many things are happening related to legislation and funding that could have grave impact on our children and adults. Autism Delaware thinks it is time to advise you about our positions related to these issues, then we are asking you to write, call and meet with your legislators over these issues.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n School funding \u2014H.B. 119 has been introduced which could potentially eliminate the summer program, give districts the ability to waive rules and procedures, and impact non academic programs such as respite. Please see the position paper we sent out earlier today. \u00a0At the same time, DOE wants to make changes in state funding which would open the code for the DAP [Delaware Autism Program]. Both of these possibilities would eliminate safeguards to educational services offered through the DAP such as changing staff ratios and effecting the summer program.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n Adult services \u2014Potential cuts for the Division of Developmental Disabilities Services will reduce adult service contracts by 10% and could eliminate services to new graduates. This would mean there would be no programming for those who have left school and reduced staff salaries and services levels for those who do receive services. In one case, family members would have to stay home to care for their child and in the other; safety and quality will be reduced. \n \n Insurance  \u2013Children with autism are not covered by insurance. Autism Delaware is proposing requiring insurance to cover ABA and other therapies needed by our children.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n The board, staff, and the legislative committee have been working actively with the Lower Delaware Autism Foundation and other disability organizations. Specifically we have done the following: \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Established statewide legislative priorities for the entire autism community and established a weekly presence at the Legislature in conjunction with LDAF \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Testified at Joint Finance Committee about the impact of funding cuts and the proposed elimination of services to students who will be graduating in June 2009 \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Met with Secretary Landraf to address our concerns and identify our priorities \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Created a resolution to establish Autism Awareness month \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Supported Cookie Day with presentation of the resolution in the House of Representatives and followed that up with a \u201cMeet & Greet\u201d event for members and legislators \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Participated in Disability Awareness Day with further legislative visits \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Drafted legislation calling for insurance coverage of ABA and other therapies for our children which should be introduced before the end of the session \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Scheduled meetings with State Superintendent Lillian Lowery and Rep. Terry Schooley During this process, we have met with and spoken to Senators Connor, Simpson, Sorenson and Venables and Representatives Atkins, Barbieri, Booth, Bunting, Cathcart, Gilligan, Hall-Long, Hocker, Hudson, Q. Johnson, Katz, Kowalko, Kovach, Lee, McDowell Schooley, Short, Schwartzkopf, Walls, Williams, and Wilson.\u00a0 \u00a0 With so many issues hitting at the same time we need your assistance. Please make an appointment with your Senator and Representative; write a letter or make a telephone call about the impact of these potential cuts on your family. If you need assistance finding your representative or writing a letter, please contact us and we will help you and/or provide a template for a letter. We are all working for our entire community, but each of us must work to assure our child\u2019s future. It is up to us. \u00a0 Sincerely, \u00a0 Rob Gilsdorf, President \n Autism Delaware \n ************ \n Position Paper on H.B. 119 \n Prepared by Autism Delaware and the Lower Delaware Autism Foundation \n We have also used an analysis by Brian Hartman of the Disability Law Program. \n \n House Bill 119 has been introduced to amend Title 14 of the Delaware Public Education Code. The stated intent is to allow more local control to districts over expenditures of state funds so they can save money.  \n Key Sponsors:\u00a0 Rep. Schooley, Sen. Sokola \n Reps. Bennett, Brady, Q. Johnson, Keeley, Longhurst, Manalokos, M. Marshall, Mitchell, Mulrooney, Plant, Scott, Viola, Walls, Sens. Blevins, Bushweller, Cloutier, Hall-Long, Henry, Katz, Peterson, Simpson, Sorenson, Venables \n This bill is unacceptable and we need you to call your representative and senator to oppose it immediately. The State Code for DAP has been in place for 30 years, providing the infrastructure and staff ratios for a highly successful and innovative program.\u00a0 The bill will negatively impact the Delaware Autism Program and educational services for students with autism (and other disabilities) in the following ways: \n \n \n It deletes the extended school year. \nSpecifically, the bill deletes Title 14, Section 1703, subsections (e)and (f) which call for 12 month programs for children with specific disabilities  including autism  and allows extension of the school year for children with autism to be 1,425 hours. This is highly objectionable and will result in the loss of extended programming for  hundreds  of students with extreme disability profiles including our students. It totally takes away our children\u2019s protection for an extended school year. \n \n \n \n It allows waivers to any regulation, rule, policy, and some statutes.\u00a0 Any district and any individual school would be authorized to obtain a waiver of any regulation, rule, policy, prescribed course of study, and some statutes based on unclear criteria.\u00a0 Everything is waivable!\u00a0 History instructs that waivers often become the norm. Rather than meet the standard, the norm is to simply obtain a waiver.\u00a0 The exception becomes the rule and legislative intent is undermined.\u00a0 This could impact all our staff ratios including teacher/student, speech, psychologists, etc. \n \n \n \n The Legislature\u2019s historical approach to waivers is to limit authorization by both discrete context and time and to monitor waiver effects.\u00a0 For example, the authorization for a waiver of the 1-22 teacher/pupil ratio is specific to this context, must be reapproved annually, and is subject to analysis by the Department of Education (Title 14  Del.C.  \u00a71705A-1705B).\u00a0 In contrast, H.B. No. 119 has no limits in context or time and contemplates no review.\u00a0 Thus, schools and districts could be given indefinite or  permanent waivers  of some State laws and all State regulations.\u00a0 So, what may begin as a temporary change to address a budget crisis can become permanent. \n \n \n \n The bill authorizes districts to cap hours of instruction for individual students with disabilities based on a unilateral administrative decision.\u00a0 Such decisions can only be made by an IEP team with parental involvement, not through a unilateral decision by district administration.\u00a0 Moreover, to avoid illegal discrimination (14 DE Admin Code 225; 34 C.F.R. Part 104), the minimum hours for students with disabilities cannot be less than the minimum hours for students without disabilities.\u00a0  \n \n \n This bill ostensibly gives districts greater local control. Local control will not help our students and we know that districts will not give parents all the information they require to build appropriate educational supports into the IEP. We need to maintain the code that guides the Delaware Autism Program to ensure that our students have staff ratios, appropriate specialists, an extended school year and respite. Parents fought for this code 30 years ago, and parents need to fight today to maintain it. \u00a0 \n Rob Gilsdorf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 John Willey \n President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President \n Autism Delaware\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lower Delaware Autism Foundation \n \u00a0 \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/autism-services-across-the-life-span-in-jeopardy-in-delaware/", "title": "Autism services across the life span in jeopardy in\u00a0Delaware"},
{"date": "April 10, 2009 ", "body": "I don\u2019t know if it was the addition of some overlapping doses of Advil on top of the other meds last night (and frankly, I don\u2019t much care right now)\u2026 NIK SLEPT! Nearly eleven hours!\u00a0 Did  I  sleep, you ask?\u00a0 Um, of course not.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gotten so used to waking and being up in the middle of the night that I found myself staring at the ceiling and listening to the silence.\u00a0 Not a bad alternative, considering. I still stand behind  every word I posted yesterday .\u00a0 Even if the Advil helped last night, we\u2019ve seen this cycle before; it helps for a night or two then\u2026Pfffft.\u00a0 Nothing.\u00a0 Besides which, long term use of NSAID\u2019s is hell on the stomach. So, we\u2019re waiting to try a new course.\u00a0 Still, it\u2019s nice to be able to keep my eyes open while I\u2019m waiting. **************** ETA:\u00a0 The neurologist called us first thing this morning.\u00a0 One of the things I like so much about this particular doctor is his accessibility and responsiveness to families.\u00a0 I also appreciate his willingness to listen and reevaluate his stance on treatments.\u00a0 He agrees that we should try the migraine approach first as well as pursuing some additional imaging to make sure nothing\u2019s changed since Nik\u2019s last MRI done in 2007.\u00a0 Because Nik can\u2019t tell us if the pain is worse, we are left to rely on perception.\u00a0 We all agree that perception, when dealing with potential brain insults, is not a great diagnostic tool. Meanwhile, we\u2019re going to stick with \u201cPlan A\u201d until early next week so we can have a full week\u2019s worth of data before we decide which of the next possible steps to take.\u00a0 We have some medications to read about, too. Unfortunately, our options for migraine treatment are limited because of Nik\u2019s age.\u00a0 Medications such as Imitrex or Maxalt are not approved for use in children as young as Nik so there\u2019s little in the way of any relief from an active migraine except for the whole antihistamine class of meds combined with analgesics \u2014which is what we\u2019re doing now with the Atarax and Advil. The next course is prophylaxis \u2014prevention.\u00a0 The options there aren\u2019t so great either; again, much of the limiting factor is Nik\u2019s age.\u00a0 Some options have cardiac side effects so Nik would have to have regular EKG\u2019s due to his existing heart condition.\u00a0 Others cause weight  loss \u2014not something Nik can afford given that he\u2019s barely topping the third percentile as it is.\u00a0 A third option, which we may try, can result in weight gain and drowsiness.\u00a0  It\u2019s really a question of evaluating and choosing the lesser of the evils. If the imaging results are normal \u2014by that I mean  unchanged from Nik\u2019s last brain imaging\u2014and the medications don\u2019t do the trick, our next step is to lobby the powers that be\u00a0(Medicaid) to authorize a visit to either Children\u2019s in Philadelphia (CHOP) or Johns Hopkins in Baltimore for evaluation in their pain clinics.\u00a0 Since we don\u2019t have other insurance right now, our hands are tied by what we can get covered.\u00a0 We\u2019ll cross that bridge if and when we need to.

{"date": "April 9, 2009 ", "body": "Apologies if this post is a tad disjointed (and poorly written); the cumulative effects of chronic sleep deprivation seem to be kicking in a little quicker each day. Nothing\u2019s changed.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s still in pain and the episodes are increasing in frequency, duration and intensity.\u00a0 The toll on our family is becoming too great to wait out the dietary changes.\u00a0 Frankly, I\u2019m not entirely convinced that\u2019s the root of the problem anyway. Before all the bio-med supporters go getting up in arms, let me clarify.\u00a0 I do think that Nik will derive benefit from the GFCF diet but I do not think those benefits have anything to do with his autism.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gotten lots of kind, caring and very well intentioned emails and messages \u2014all of which I appreciate\u2014about articles and plans and protocols that will help \u201cheal Nik\u2019s gut.\u201d\u00a0 The gut isn\u2019t the problem here. Nik\u2019s gastrointestinal issues do not stem from food allergies.\u00a0 They do not stem from leaky gut or malabsorption or anything else because of his atypical neurology.\u00a0 They are the result of his  anatomical  differences \u2014his  intestinal malrotation  and resulting  short gut .\u00a0 He also has little to no  transverse colon .\u00a0 He does not have chronic diarrhea or chronic constipation; in fact, his bowels are pretty darn good on most days, thank you very much.\u00a0 He does not have horrible stomach pains or painful reflux that we can tell; believe me, he did at one time so we can tell the difference.\u00a0 In fact, his recent endoscopy in February was so beautiful many of the doctors were envious.\u00a0 What Nik  does  have is some sort of horrible  head pain.\u00a0 We now know it\u2019s been going on for nearly two years and he has been trying his damnedest to tell us.\u00a0 That\u2019s not to say we haven\u2019t been listening; more that we haven\u2019t been  understanding the message.\u00a0\u00a0 True to form, Nik continues to crank up the volume (by increasing the severity of things) until we catch on. We\u2019ve spent the last two years trying to investigate every possible avenue from GI to ENT.\u00a0 We even stopped his seizure medications in September because he\u2019d been seizure free since March of 2008 and his last EEG looked great.\u00a0 That one change gave us a short break from the nighttime wakings and distress for a few months. It also gave us\u00a0a false perception that this latest pain was something new and different. It was that perception which led us down the path of diet and ruling out food allergies.\u00a0 [For the record, Nik\u2019s formula \u2014available only by prescription\u2014\u00a0is  already  GF, does  not  contain soy, does contain  some casein and is entirely food-based.\u00a0 Thus far, any efforts to find a truly GFCF enteral formula has been unsuccessful so we\u2019re giving Nik some enzymes and lactobacillus/acidophilus types of supports.] Things have gotten to the point that Nik, bless his strong little heart and spirit, is so worn out by his own lack of sleep and his own discomfort that he\u2019s barely functional by dinner time.\u00a0 Sure, he\u2019s present and he\u2019s entertaining \u2014just as long as you don\u2019t expect anything from him like focus, communication, learning.\u00a0 Even the quality of his sleep, when he gets it, is different now; he no longer drifts off to sleep looking peaceful and content.\u00a0 Now, he simply passes out in whatever position he lands in, his smooth forehead creased and furrowed as if he\u2019s fallen asleep in the middle of some deep thought. Thus far, no medication we have on hand helps him sleep through the night more than one night in a row.\u00a0 He either doesn\u2019t respond to it in a typical fashion (highly possible with Nik) or it\u2019s simply not the right thing and isn\u2019t working on the right mechanism.\u00a0 The end result is the same \u2014another night\u2019s fractured sleep filled with screaming, face pummeling pain. (Sometimes the face getting pummeled is actually mine if I\u2019m not quick enough to dodge when Nik starts rearing in pain.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gotten clocked in the face a few times.\u00a0 Ouch.) I\u2019ve fought the good fight and am not giving up on finding answers for Nik; if there\u2019s one to be found I will not rest until we find it.\u00a0 Ah, but\u00a0now we come to the crux of the matter \u2014 rest .\u00a0 The toll exacted on our entire family is simply becoming too great; it\u2019s long since crossed the line from  highly inconvenient  to  flat out dangerous .\u00a0 One of these days Nik will either hurt himself badly or hurt me; my husband and I are practically sleeping in separate shifts and his school work is starting to suffer because of all the additional worrying he\u2019s doing about both Nik and me.\u00a0 I look and feel awful and I no longer even care about it \u2014I\u2019m just too tired to care anymore.\u00a0 It hasn\u2019t happened but I fear the day when my frayed nerves snap and I end up doing something I would regret.\u00a0 Nothing abusive or horrible like that \u2014I would walk out the door first and call my mother to go watch Nik\u2014 but behavior I would not be proud of having my son witness. We have become a family on the verge of a crisis. I placed an emergency call to our neurologist on Monday.\u00a0 We saw him Tuesday morning and discussed the situation.\u00a0 He is of the opinion that much of what Nik is experiencing is  \u201ctypical behaviors seen in children with significant developmental delays or autism.\u201d \u00a0 He wants us to try increasing Nik\u2019s melatonin at bedtime and giving him a larger dose of Atarax \u2014roughly a fifty percent increase over what we\u2019ve already tried though certainly still within normal prescribing guidelines.\u00a0 The plan is to try this for two weeks and see how it works.\u00a0 If it  doesn\u2019t work, then he wants to talk about a trial of Risperdal at a low dose.\u00a0 I  hate  the idea of trying the Risperdal; I can\u2019t put my finger on why, exactly, just that it doesn\u2019t  feel  right (and I\u2019ve learned over time to trust my instincts).\u00a0 On the one hand the doctor is saying he\u2019s  reluctant  to label Nik as autistic  (\u201cHe\u2019s so interactive and social with you\u201d) \u00a0\u2014though three previous doctors have had no trouble with labels from PDD-NOS to atypical autism.\u00a0\u00a0Yet, on the other hand, he is suggesting that Nik\u2019s issues are potentially best treated with a drug used for many autistic people.\u00a0 (Yes, I know, it\u2019s not  only  used for autistics.\u00a0 However, in the context of our conversations with this doctor, the point was made clear.)\u00a0 To hedge his bets, he\u2019s also referred Nik for a full autism evaluation by the Developmental Pediatrics group at our  home-away-from home  much frequented pediatric hospital.\u00a0 Nik does, after all, meet many of the diagnositc criteria for ASD. But, here\u2019s the thing: I still  believe  with all my being that what Nik is experiencing is genuine, acute, physical pain.\u00a0  In his head. \u00a0 Migraine or cluster headaches, perhaps?\u00a0 The pain certainly seems strong and debilitating when it strikes \u2014enough so that it has woken him from a heavily drugged sleep on many nights including the last two \u2014nights when we\u2019ve increased the Atarax by more than fifty percent.\u00a0 My son has had a lifetime of unnatural things pumped into his little body; it\u2019s what was necessary to keep him alive when he arrived far too early and far too undeveloped to face this world.\u00a0 Little by little he\u2019s divested himself of the need for most of his medications and it pains me to start on what feels like a potentially slippery slope of medications and side effects.\u00a0 If we\u2019re going to start down that path, I want to start with a few more systemically benign medications, you know? I\u2019ve put another call in to the neurologist to discuss a change in tactic.\u00a0 (I\u2019m waiting for a call back, probably tomorrow.)\u00a0 Already, the side effects from just two nights of the new \u201cplan\u201d are evident and I don\u2019t like them.\u00a0 Nik is groggy and cranky, off-kilter and easily distressed.\u00a0 His appetite is greatly diminished and his ability to focus on a meal long enough to finish it is dicey at best.\u00a0 I\u2019ve not been able to leave him alone for longer than ten minutes at a time because his threshhold for frustration is so low and his initial response right now is self-injurious; I have to be nearby to redirect him. Ironic, isn\u2019t it, that the medications we thought might  decrease his \u201cbehaviors\u201d are making them worse?\u00a0 That also fuels my belief that the current approach is not the right one.\u00a0 I feel strongly that we need to try treating Nik with migraine medication for a bit before we skip right to the antipsychotics. *sigh* Meanwhile,\u00a0expect my web presence to be sketchy and sort of hit-and-run.\u00a0 I can\u2019t possibly disconnect  completely ; you, my cyber friends, are part of my lifeline.\u00a0 My web of support which holds me up when I am too exhausted and emotional to think straight.\u00a0 You stretch out your hands to the ether and hold me up with your words of support, your posts of hope, your shared videos that make me laugh and cry.\u00a0 You help me release the feelings I don\u2019t have the energy to express with my own words.\u00a0 You are  my  drug of choice.  *grin* ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/best-laid-plans/", "title": "Best laid plans and all that\u00a0stuff"},

{"date": "September 11, 2009 ", "body": "The last time I saw him was June 16, 2001.\u00a0 His\u00a0youthful face was filled with joy and laughter as he hoisted a few too many and danced at my wedding.\u00a0 It was a joyous occasion shared with his entire family \u2014long time friends and neighbors of my in-laws.\u00a0 Less than ninety days later his family\u2019s world was shattered.  Sean Tallon  was only 26 years old and had already served his country well.\u00a0 He died a hero in a horrific catastrophe. ******** The first time I met  Bill Weems , I was mere days out of college and brand new to Boston, having moved from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on a whim.\u00a0 I started out as a temporary receptionist for\u00a0 a video\u00a0and film production/post-production company where Bill was\u00a0a producer and director.\u00a0 He knew I was a new graduate with a degree in broadcast journalism and an itch to learn everything I could about video production.\u00a0 Bill took me under his wing and let me tag along on shoots in my time off to work as a grip or as a go-fer.\u00a0 At the office, I became a marketing assistant and worked with Bill on developing automated estimates for job bids.\u00a0 He was patient, funny and an excellent, encouraging teacher.\u00a0 I remember his laugher and warmth most of all.\u00a0 He was the guy everyone loved to like. I left my job at that company within a year, moving on to \u201cbigger and better things\u201d \u2014at least to my twenty-something way of thinking.\u00a0 Life took many twists and turns and I never looked back.\u00a0 Until that awful, fateful day, when tragedy struck in magnitude too great to comprehend. Then it became personal. For Sean and Bill, and\u00a0for the countless others who died that day and days after in service to our country, the world is dimmer without your light.

{"date": "April 23, 2009 ", "body": "I\u2019ve been trying for days to get a post written.\u00a0 Clearly, it\u2019s not been happening.\u00a0 Too much is going on too fast for me to process and keep up.\u00a0 Forgive me for this \u201cdrive by\u201d style update; I\u2019m going to just toss stuff out there and see what sticks to the wall.\u00a0 If I don\u2019t, well, it could be a while before I get back to any cogent writing! ********** The update on Nik\u2019s pain and waking:\u00a0 Plan A failed.\u00a0 Plan B was dismissed as not appropriate at this time.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on Plan C.\u00a0 As with everything else we\u2019ve tried, there are good nights and bad nights.\u00a0 A little tweak here, a greater tweak there; what works one night doesn\u2019t work the next.\u00a0 We\u2019re still wondering if there\u2019s a dietary component and are working on some small changes and some trial eliminations \u2013mostly dairy. Of course, the road is never straight and smooth.\u00a0 In the last month, Nik has developed a sort of eye and facial tic that is very disturbing to witness.\u00a0 The tic itself, while not the most attractive, is not the upsetting thing; not knowing the cause, watching it increase in frequency and seeing that it causes Nik discomfort \u2013those are the hard parts.\u00a0 Given his history with absence seizures, we are wondering if Nik is starting to have partial seizures. His last EEG was a little more than a year ago; it showed no seizure activity thought it did show some abnormal spike and wave patterns.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to reevaluate.\u00a0 He\u2019s been off of seizure medications since last September and has appeared to be seizure free to this point.\u00a0 We know these tics are not the direct result of the pain medication he\u2019s now taking because they started before we even tried the new medications.\u00a0 But they are increasing at an alarming pace \u2013and they are now happening in the middle of the night when Nik awakes. We\u2019re waiting for an MRI to be scheduled; for some reason it\u2019s a long and laborious process every single time we have to do this.\u00a0 We need to schedule an EEG and another visit to the neurologist. Of course, the worry heightens my already extreme insomnia.\u00a0 Not a good thing when Nik continues to make lightning progress in so many areas; I need to be at the top of my game to keep up with him! ********** Here are some random things Nik\u2019s done lately that are keeping me on my toes: Begun eating with greater ease and consistency.\u00a0 It\u2019s still mostly pureed or soft foods that he can dissolve in his mouth.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve progressed to things like pancakes and hash browns, fish sticks (though those are still a bit of a challenge), peanut butter crackers, and cooked sliced carrots.\u00a0 Nik likes to eat the carrots like they are cookies; who am I to tell him otherwise? Nik signed \u201cMama\u201d for the first time ever the other night.\u00a0 It was prompted but it was intentional and clear.\u00a0 And I have Niksdad as a witness.\u00a0 I still tear up when I think about it.\u00a0 It may not happen for another six months or it could happen again tonight, who knows?\u00a0 It\u2019s burned in my memory forever;  he knows my name. Nik\u2019s learned how to climb the gates in the family room.\u00a0 He spent all day yesterday showing off his prowess.\u00a0 He thought it was  heaven ; I thought it was  pure hell \u2013mostly because I had to spend the day trapped in the room with him in order to keep him safe.\u00a0 (It\u2019s a long story; our home is very difficult to Nik-proof and he\u2019s not at the point where we can let him roam freely in the house.) I spent the day yelling at him so much that I have laryngitis today.\u00a0 It\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t think his name is  \u201cGet down. NOW!\u201d \u00a0 I don\u2019t know why it took me until this morning to think of it but I took his shoes away today.\u00a0 He\u2019s gone to the gates a few times and put a foot up but decided he wasn\u2019t ready for the barefoot climb.  Yet .\u00a0 The day is coming, I know. ********** Niksdad is in the home stretch of his R.N. program; his finals are next week.\u00a0 His pinning ceremony is May 5th and graduation is May 11th.\u00a0 I am so proud of him, I could burst!\u00a0 I wish we were in a position to be able to throw a big party for him but we aren\u2019t.\u00a0 Not sure how we\u2019ll celebrate; I do know it  won\u2019t be with his family \u2013they\u2019ve made it clear they aren\u2019t making the lengthy trip from just north of New York City aaaaallll the way down to Delaware. (Sarcastic? Who, me?) I know, I need to let it go but it makes me so angry that he\u2019s worked so hard to make a career change and that he\u2019s happy with his choice\u2026but they still resent his choice to ever leave New York in the first place.\u00a0 Never mind that was nearly ten years ago!\u00a0  sigh  There\u2019s more to it that I can\u2019t share publicly, but it amounts to the same result. ********* Saturday is our big trip to Sesame Place.\u00a0 I am excited and a bit anxious about how Nik will handle it.\u00a0 Fingers crossed.\u00a0 The weather forecast is for sunny and warm with temperatures in the eighties.\u00a0 Perfect for all those water rides with Daddy. Of course, I\u2019ll post pictures after the fact. ********** It slipped right past me yesterday\u2026my two year blogging anniversary.

Whew! \u00a0 Saturday, we went to Sesame Place for the Variety Club  Day for Families with Autism .\u00a0 It was our first time at Sesame Place so we weren\u2019t sure what to expect \u2014especially from Nik.\u00a0 It was also our first outing as a  Family with Autism  and, again, we weren\u2019t sure what to expect.\u00a0 Both of those merit their own blog posts though I may not get to it for a while.\u00a0 I can tell you that we met some really wonderful families, had a great time and can\u2019t wait to go again.\u00a0 To whet your appetite, here\u2019s a glimpse of the day: \u00a0 \u00a0 Saturday night, I learned that a very dear and special childhood friend passed away.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been riding a roller coaster of emotions; we were extremely close growing up though we\u2019d lost touch when I left town many, many years ago.\u00a0 He was like the brother I always wanted when we were kids. \u00a0We reconnected via Facebook recently; I was so excited at the prospect of seeing him over the summer and getting to meet his wife and daughters, having him meet Nik and Niksdad and reconnecting.\u00a0 One of my greatest regrets is that I\u2019ve waited so long to start to reconnect with old childhood friends. \u00a0 Nik seems to sense that I\u2019ve been sad.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a conscious knowing, more of a kind of symbiosis; he\u2019s been gentle and loving with me, going so far as to actually want to snuggle in my lap before bed for the past two nights.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s the medication or maybe it\u2019s symbiosis; I can\u2019t know for certain, but it feels indescribably, achingly lovely.\u00a0  \u00a0 I can count on  one  hand the number of times in our life together that Nik has let me rock him to sleep in my arms \u2014let alone upon his request.\u00a0 Yet, Saturday night found us plastered together in the heat of his room, rocking in the darkness until he fell asleep.\u00a0 I could smell the baby soft scent of sunscreen in his hair and taste the tang of sweat on his skin when I kissed his brow.\u00a0 Pure heaven. \u00a0 Both yesterday and today, Nik ate.\u00a0 No, really \u2014 everything! \u00a0 He.had.no.formula!\u00a0 The only things that went through his feeding tube were water and his vitamin.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on getting him to increase his fluid intake by mouth; it\u2019s slowly coming along.\u00a0 Once we can get him drinking enough fluid by mouth we can start to think about getting rid of the feeding tube.\u00a0 If you had told me less than a year ago that we would be in this place I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\u00a0 I always knew we\u2019d get here but I just assumed it would be in slower, smaller steps. \u00a0 Today, he not only signed  Mama  several times with prompting, but he also signed it when I asked  \u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d \u00a0 It makes my heart sing. \u00a0 Oh, and did I mention that he tried to change his own poopy diaper the other day?\u00a0 Yeah,  that  was a fun time! \u00a0\u00a0Or did I tell you how he\u2019s trying to feed himself with a spoon now and signing to indicate  \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d  more often now?\u00a0 Or how he\u2019s helping to pick up his toys when I ask him to?\u00a0  Seriously. \u00a0 It just seems that Nik is making huge leaps forward in multiple areas lately.\u00a0 Climbing gates, eating food, signing new words, using intentional communication with other people besides just me\u2026 it all seems so sudden.\u00a0 Sometimes I actually wish it would slow down \u2014just a teensy bit\u2014 so I can savor the moment at my own pace.\u00a0  \u00a0 Nik, clearly, has other plans. \u00a0 Today\u2019s accomplishment involved opening the\u00a0\u00a0 child-proofed  door to the powder room and playing in the toilet and the sink \u2014five minutes before we were supposed to go to his PT and OT sessions across town. \u00a0Niksdad has been busy installing new hardware and extra gates in between studying for his final exams!\u00a0 Nik, like his daddy, is highly mechanically inclined.\u00a0 I fear it is only a matter of time before he figures out how to work around all our carefully laid plans. \u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to see what our little  MacGyver  does next. \u00a0 Yep, this is the thing that Nik figured out how to remove...in 7 seconds.

And so nice to send him out the door each morning with a little more spring to his step and a smile on his face. Whew; it\u2019s been a long seven months! But what I really want to share with you is this little snippet from an email I just sent to our regional  Prentke Romich \u00a0representative, Janet, to update her on Nik\u2019s progress with his trial of the  Vantage Lite  (VL for short).\u00a0 It\u2019s one I\u2019ve been meaning to share but the significance of it  really  hit home with me yesterday; my mother shared with me a  very disturbing sentiment one of her friends expressed.\u00a0 This \u201cfriend\u201d has known our family for a few years and has met Nik on many occasions; she also used to work as a counselor for children in a special education program in our state.\u00a0 Imagine my shock to learn that she told my mother that she thinks Nik  \u201ccould talk if he wanted to; I think they just baby him too much so he isn\u2019t motivated.\u201d \u00a0 (I think my jaw hit the floor so hard and fast that I may have chipped a tooth on impact.) Really, this woman did, in fact, say those words to my mother.\u00a0 My mother who is my biggest cheerleader and Nik\u2019s greatest fan.\u00a0 I\u2019m amazed this \u201cfriend\u201d is still alive.\u00a0 (Side note: I did ask my mother  not  to tell me any more such stories; I don\u2019t need the added  agita !) So it was with great pride that I wrote this brief update to Janet tonight: We have had some pretty amazing communication breakthroughs, though.\u00a0 I\u2019ve shown the HELP icon on the core and taught him to use \u201cHelp, please\u201d when he\u2019s having trouble or when he\u2019s upset.\u00a0 It helped to defuse a potentially ugly meltdown last week. \n\u00a0 \nWe were sitting at the dining room table, working on colors and blocks.\u00a0 Nik got frustrated and threw his orange blocks into the kitchen. I told him I didn\u2019t like that and I took the rest of the blocks away.\u00a0 HE LOST IT.

Want blocks. Orange blocks.\u201d\u00a0 I asked if he wanted me to help him get them.

Still, I\u2019m not going to lie; the anxiety is really running deep over this one.

Nor am I talking about that deep and abiding sense of inner peace \u2013 that all-encompassing knowledge that all is as it should be in one\u2019s world and the path forward can be visualized if not actually seen. My world, my daily life, is far from that predictable! The peace of which I speak is simpler, more fleeting. It\u2019s the lingering minutes of quiet after my son has fallen asleep on the sofa while my husband is sleeping before he goes to work. That rare window when the cats are asleep and the only sound I hear in the house is the gentle trickle of water from their fountain. Or the subtle creaks and groans of the windows as the wind picks up outside. The peace of knowing I can drink a cup of tea while it\u2019s still hot. Or go to the bathroom without a visit from my son \u2013 or one of the cats. I give thanks for the peace which settles into my body\u2013 no matter for how short a time \u2013 as it relaxes, relieved of its state of constant vigil. A reprieve from the coiled tension required to spring into action to keep my son out of harm\u2019s way due to his utter lack of a sense of danger.

Peace. Those rare moments of quiet, when the tension drains from my body and my mind slows from its constant whirl. Those infrequent times when I can put aside the constant worries about my son\u2019s fragile health, about his uncertain future. About our finances and our future plans. When I can shut out the world for just long enough to really catch my breath. In those rare moments, I find I can breathe more fully, more consciously. Deep breaths\u00a0in\u2026 Slow, cleansing breaths out. In so doing, I gently refill that well within me\u00a0which, far too often, is on the verge of running dry. In the quiet, I breathe in peace.

{"date": "November 2, 2012 ", "body": "[ Ed. Note: November is National Blog Post Month (aka  NaBloPoMo ; click to learn more about it). While I hadn\u2019t set out to return to my blog with any specific plan, I stumbled onto another monthly blogging theme \u2013  Thirty Days of Thanks . Since November is the celebration of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., I decided this might be a nice way to jump back into my blog and reconnect with you, the faithful readers who keep checking back and dusting off the screen. I\u2019m thankful for you, too. ] In the midst of a tough day, there are these golden moments for which I am so very thankful\u2026 Nik asked me to come play with him. It\u2019s the first time, ever, that I can recall him using actual words to make such a specific request of me. He stood at the gate in the playroom, resting his device on top;  \u201cSit, Mama, play\u201d  he implored with his whole body, making full eye contact. Both my child and my heart would brook no resistance. For nearly twenty minutes, we drew scribbles, shapes and letters on the iPad as we sat on the sofa, Nik\u2019s warm little body leaning into mine as we wrote and made sounds together. It took coaxing and more than a little prompting at first, but we took turns drawing the lines to complete the letters. \u201cNik, draw a line down, baby.\u201d  With a little assistance, he did. Then I drew a line down.  \u201cCan you draw the line across to make the letter A?\u201d  With a sure hand, Nik dragged the stylus across the screen. He looked at me with a questioning look and intoned  \u201cAaaa\u201d  to tell me he knew we had just made a capital A.\u00a0Repeating the process for the letter B, I had Nik draw the line down then I drew the \u201cbumps.\u201d\u00a0Ever the perfectionist,\u00a0when my marking was bigger and there was a gap at the bottom of the letter, Nik tried to lengthen his first line with interesting results. \u201cGreat job, buddy! What letter did we make?\u201d  His eyes lit up as he said  \u201cBuh\u201d  and shook his hand in an approximation of the sign for the letter B. And on we continued, sometimes hand-over-hand for the harder, curved letters, all the way to G. Knowing he\u2019d reached his limit, I let Nik take the lead. Thinking he would take the iPad away from me and turn on his music, I was surprised when he thrust the stylus back into my hand.  \u201cWhat do you want, love?\u201d  I smiled. He tapped the blank screen then signed  \u201cPlease.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cDo you want mama to draw shapes, numbers, or letters?\u201d I waited while he contorted his sweet little face with a mighty effort. My heart was about to shatter with shared frustration as I watched him, knowing he was trying so hard to form a sound. Just as I was about to tell him to use his \u201ctalker,\u201d he let out a series of short, breathy sounds which, I swear, sounded like he said  \u201cABC\u201d  as one word\u2026 a la Big Bird\u2019s song. My eyes may or may not have gone a little wide and gotten slightly misty when I asked him,  \u201cDid you say A-B-C, baby?\u201d  He signed  \u201cplease\u201d  again. After a few rounds of drawing ABC\u2019s and singing along, it was clear; Nik was spent and needed a break so he got up and started wandering in the playroom. As he walked, I took the iPad and wrote the word  hammer . We\u2019ve been struggling for a very long time to figure out just what, if any level of reading comprehension Nik has. His cognitive and communication disabilities make it nearly impossible to test with any reliable accuracy. We know he can spell and decode words, but we can\u2019t quite tell if he understands the words he is reading unless they are paired with a spoken word. Because of his disabilities, Nik relies heavily on auditory reinforcement \u2013 pairing the sounds with the visuals. I held up the iPad and showed Nik the word.  \u201cCan you find this, sweetie?\u201d \u00a0 He approached the iPad and traced his finger across the word, much as an early reader does when keeping their place in a sentence on a page. I knew he was decoding it \u2013sounding it out in his head. I waited as he did it again. He cocked his head to the side.  \u201cWhere is it, love?\u201d  I prompted. He looked around the room a bit before he spotted it. Nik walked right over to the reflex hammer from his doctor kit and brought it to me! Next, I wrote  vest . Seeing, decoding, understanding; Nik brought me his swim vest. Feeling giddy, I wrote  3 socks ; it was a long-shot. Nik struggles with numbers and counting so I wasn\u2019t sure if had set him up for failure and frustration.\u00a0 There was two pair of socks on the floor by the laundry closet door.\u00a0 Again, the finger, the decoding, the head tilt\u2026and off he went toward the socks. Nik immediately picked up two socks; it made sense as we sing about how  \u201cshoes and socks will always come in twos.\u201d  He hesitated. \u201cHow many?\u201d  I prompted. He looked at me for a moment then\u00a0bent over and picked up\u2026 one.more.sock.\u00a0 He brought me exactly  three  socks.\u00a0Not four.  THREE. And on this went for a few more words.\u00a0 I added some complexity\u2014 \u201cGet orange hat.\u201d  He got it. \u201cPut hat on.\u201d  He did\u2026 on  my \u00a0head.\u00a0 (Smart alec kid! Who says kids with autism don\u2019t have a sense of humor?) I admit,  \u201cPut hat in blue bucket\u201d  may have been pushing the envelope a bit. He struggled with that one.\u00a0 But\u2026 NIK READ. Like, really, truly read!  And he understood what he read! \u00a0 I didn\u2019t speak the words at all and gave him  NO  help other than asking  \u201cHow many?\u201d  for the socks. He.Read. Signaling the end of our play time, Nik walked to where I sat on the sofa, took the iPad out of my hands and turned on his music. Without so much as a backward glance my way, he crossed the room, turned the bucket over and climbed on top to sit by the window. \u00a0The message was loud and clear \u2013  \u201cAll done, Mama.\u201d Somehow, I think we\u2019ve turned a page. And, oh, my little bear, this is just the beginning of an exciting new chapter. \u201cThe journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\u201d ~ Lao Tzu \n \u201cI am unwritten, can\u2019t read my mind, I\u2019m undefined \n I\u2019m just beginning, the pen\u2019s in my hand, ending unplanned\u2026\u201d \n \u201cUnwritten\u201d \u00a0(N.

{"date": "November 4, 2012 ", "body": "It\u2019s been roughly a year since my son\u2019s sleep troubles have decreased dramatically. For years, yes, you read that right,  years  (five, in fact), my son would wake in some sort of heart-rending distress multiple times a night at roughly ninety-minute intervals and they lasted about 20-45 minutes each. To say those were brutal times would be a gross understatement. It took a long time to finally debug what we think was the root cause; if I told you, you\u2019d look at me like I had three heads. Even our son\u2019s fantastic neurologist took a while before he believed we were right.\u00a0 But, suddenly, the screaming, writhing bouts of self-injurious behavior\u2026stopped. The transition from those hellish years to sleeping through the night has not been\u00a0without some bumps along the way and I\u2019m not sure I believe we\u2019ve fully crossed a threshold yet.\u00a0But, here we are several months later and we have\u00a0all finally retrained our bodies to sleep (mostly) through the night. Nik still has nights where he is up for a few hours in the middle of the night, but that\u2019s more often the exception than the rule these days and\u00a0usually only when something is brewing with his health. I am extremely grateful that we now have a home health aide here to help us every night during the overnight hours. My husband works nights and I have to be able to function to get Nik ready for school and doctor\u2019s appointments and to manage the day to running of our home which includes managing all aspects of Nik\u2019s educational and medical plans and needs. It is a full-time job and my boss can be kind of, well, a bitch sometimes \u2014 especially when she doesn\u2019t get enough sleep! So we\u2019ve been on cruise control for a while now and I was just starting to feel cocky. Until Super Storm Sandy came along; Nik\u2019s sleep hasn\u2019t been right since. He didn\u2019t have any obvious anxiety from it, but his sleep has definitely suffered. Nik\u2019s gone from sleeping up to nine hours straight through the night to either being awake for a few hours then going back to sleep or, worse, simply starting his day a mere small handful of hours after I\u2019ve gone to sleep.The poor\u00a0boy was so exhausted all day! I thought (ok, PRAYED) he would nap this afternoon so we could push his bedtime out a little later to help make the transition to Standard Time a little easier. Ha! Nik came sooooo\u00a0close to falling asleep on the sofa a few times and then would rebound suddenly. It was an ugly sight to see; the poor child was so dysregulated and exhausted that I described him to some friends on Facebook as being like a malfunctioning robot. At one point, immediately after he had eaten lunch, Nik got very upset because he couldn\u2019t have his ice cream \u2014 which he always has after dinner. He started to fray around the edges and tell me he was hungry and asked me to make dinner. Then breakfast. Then lunch. Then dinner. Then ice cream NOW. Then the tears and frustration came followed by kisses and soothing from Mama. Then it all repeated in a seemingly endless loop. By late afternoon, I knew I had to get him out of the house to keep moving. We went to Target where he was\u2026a complete angel. As soon as we got home, the demands for dinner and ice cream began again in that anxious, perseverative kind of manner. He only ate half of his dinner before deciding he was done.\u00a0 By six o\u2019clock his body thought it was later ( and  he\u2019d been up since the wee hours) and he was starting to fall asleep on the sofa for real this time. I helped him don his spiffy new pajamas, got all his myriad meds into him and brushed his teeth before heading upstairs. Nik never actually made it upstairs under his own steam. Halfway up the stairs, he stopped, turned around and put his arms up for me to carry him.  \u201cNo, baby, you need to walk; we\u2019re almost there,\u201d  I said. He looked at me and his lower lip quivered. He shook his head  NO  then sat in the middle of the staircase, laid his head on the stair above where he sat and closed his eyes. He\u2019s such a little stinker. I convinced him to make it up to the top landing before I scooped him up and tossed him over my shoulder. I think he may have been half asleep before his head even hit the pillow, but as I turned out the light and leaned over to kiss him on the forehead, he snuffled and raised his lips to mine. Resting a palm against his soft cheek, I smoothed his hair and whispered my goodnight. It\u2019s a ritual I started when he was in the NICU so he wouldn\u2019t ever feel alone in the middle of the night. I have whispered those same words every night since he was born. Even on the very rare occasions when I\u2019m\u00a0away from him, I make my husband put the phone to Nik\u2019s ear and I softly say \u2014 \u201cGod bless you and the angels keep you overnight, baby. I love you. I\u2019ll meet you in Dreamland with Papa and I\u2019ll be here when you wake. Good night, little bear.\u201d Today, tonight, I am grateful for sleep and the rituals surrounding it. For the progress my child has made in sleeping again and for the fact that he is here for me to kiss and snuggle each night. There were so very many scary days and nights in his early life when I thought we might not have this time together.

{"date": "November 5, 2012 ", "body": "Nik can only verbalize a couple of words and string together letter sounds. When he does vocalize, it always sounds kind of breathy, like he has mild laryngitis. Actually, he might; we\u2019re not sure how much damage may have been done to his vocal chords as a result of being on a ventilator for so long. But I digress\u2026One of the words Nik can say with some degree of consistency now is  \u201cMama.\u201d  It melts my heart every time he says it, despite the fact that he only ever says it with prompting. Like tonight. Earlier this evening, Nik and I were playing and laughing together. I leaned over to kiss him on the forehead \u2013just because I can. I always tell him how much I love him when I do that. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m making up for all those lost days of his infancy when I couldn\u2019t just scoop him up in my arms and smother him with kisses for fear of dislodging tubes and intravenous lines or possibly upsetting his tiny and fragile body. All I know is showering my son with affection is an addiction I just can\u2019t quit. I don\u2019t want to until he forces me to stop! After kissing his head and telling him I love him, I asked Nik if he could say  \u201cI love you, Mama.\u201d  He leaned down to his talker and hit the sequence of icons to tell me. I smiled, but I wanted more. I pushed.  \u201cNo, baby, can you say it with your voice? With your mouth?\u201d  as I laid a finger on his lips.  \u201cCan you say, \u2018Mama, I love you\u2019?\u201d  I knew he wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t but I had to try. He looked at me and grinned and whispered his breathy, disjointed  \u201cMa-ma\u201d  and then kissed me softly on the lips. I laughed and said  \u201cDo kisses mean \u2018I love you\u2019?\u201d  He tipped his hand in his own rendition of  yes  in sign language.  \u201cCan you say it again, baby?\u201d  I asked. He leaned toward me and put his face up to mine; I felt the whisper of an angel wing on my lip and heard him rasp  \u201cMa-ma\u201d  once again. In the instant that I blinked, he was whirling away from me toward his LeapPad\u00a0books, humming the Spongebob\u00a0Squarepants theme. Don\u2019t ask. A few hours later, not too long after I\u2019d put Nik to bed and sat in the dark listening to his gentle snores, the telephone rang. It was my husband\u2019s employer; Niksdad was asleep so I took a message.\u00a0They had called to update Niksdad on the condition of one of his patients who had gone to the hospital the day before. Shaking, I went upstairs and kissed my baby one more time and let the tears fall. Somewhere tonight, another mother of another child with special needs kissed her boy for the last time. My heart aches for her pain. Tonight, I am grateful for every kiss, every sigh and snuggle I have with my precious boy. Hug your children tight. Cherish every moment.

{"date": "December 5, 2012 ", "body": "Yesterday was a pretty tough day for my son. He\u2019d been looking forward to the country-wide Special Olympics bowling event for weeks. His excitement was mostly about riding the school bus and seeing \u201cfriends\u201d with whom he could play his wordless hand-clapping game. His expectations and the reality were so very, very far apart. Don\u2019t get me wrong; we love Special Olympics and all that it has opened up for Nikolas. It gives him an opportunity to learn new skills, to experience new situations, and to practice some of the very important listening and participation skills which challenge him greatly on a daily basis. I appreciate that he can participate in whatever manner meets his needs dictated by his physical limitations in both motor and visual processing and coordination. Frankly, I also love that Nik is often not the most obviously impaired child present \u2013 as it so often feels when we are at the park or even within Nik\u2019s own wonderful classroom setting. So, why was it such a tough day, you ask? Simple, really\u2026 Take approximately 200 kids, each with an accompanying teacher, paraprofessional and/or nurse, add a family member for every other kid present, the staff and volunteers from Special Olympics, the requisite number of bus drivers to transport those children and school professionals from four different school districts and pack them all into a 32-lane bowling alley for three and a half hours.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have many sensory issues of my own, nor do I have any impairments which make it exceptionally challenging for me to process visual and auditory input like Nik does, but I can tell you that my brain was still buzzing from the tension more than six hours after the event was over. Nik gets ready to bowl with the help of a ramp and his friends. Nik didn\u2019t even make it through the first of two full games before he was spent.\u00a0 He went from a bubbly and exuberant boy when they first started, to a child who could not even pull himself together after the first five frames of the first game. He simply shut down. DONE. No amount of coaxing or cajoling would work. In fact, it made it worse. If I had the benefit of today\u2019s hindsight yesterday, I would have simply taken Nik home. It was shades of our Special Olympics soccer experience of a year ago when Nik was so utterly overwhelmed by the sheer volume \u2013 both in terms of people and noise, that he could do no more than throw himself on the ground and wail his outrage and frustration. Yesterday was deceptive in that he did not throw himself on the ground, but he made it crystal clear he was not going to bowl any more. Instead, we spent hours walking up and down and taking some breaks to sit and drink some soup or nibble at his bagel. Nik has, clearly, had enough fun for one morning! Given how crummy he feels right now between his infected ears and sore throat? It\u2019s a miracle he didn\u2019t throw himself on the ground and weep and rail at the world; I\u2019m not so sure I wouldn\u2019t have in his situation. Progress. But at what cost? I watched as my beautiful boy flitted from place to place like a hummingbird \u2013unable to fully alight and be comfortable or content for more than a flash before the compulsion to move on took hold. We walked and wandered. We tried to eat lunch and sing songs in the semi-quiet rooms near the back of the bowling alley. Still, it was all too much. I could see the perseverations rising like flood waters and I felt helpless to figure out where and how to draw the line. I wanted to hang in until the end so that Nik could get the ribbon for which\u00a0he had worked so damn hard. He may not have finished his event, but he gave it his all and I was proud of him. I wanted him to hear the crowd celebrate his achievement, too. As the awards were being given out, Nik\u2019s para, Ms. M, and I realized that something was wrong; Nik\u2019s entire group had been given their medals and ribbons and were making their way toward their school groups. There we stood, confused.\u00a0 I know Nik didn\u2019t understand the ramifications of what was happening, but Ms. M and I both did. I felt hot tears prick my eyelids. Ms. M adores Nik like he was her own son; she asked me to stay with Nik and strode off like a mama bear on a mission. Ms. M returned triumphant but disgruntled. When Nik hadn\u2019t finished his first game, a volunteer removed his name from the roster. On paper, it was as if my boy had never shown up, had never given every ounce of heart and energy he had. As Nik sat slumped against my shoulder and my heart was, figuratively speaking, on the floor wailing in frustration and outrage, Ms. M. simply made it right. (It\u2019s one of very many reasons I am so grateful she is working with Nik!) When the announcer called Nik up to get his ribbon, Nik was all smiles and fist-bumps with the police officer who gave him his ribbon. I, on the other hand was all sniffles and quiet tears. The oversight in such a setting where it\u2019s all about inclusion, left me rattled. My boy works so hard to make his way in a world which neither understands him nor fully embraces him for how he is right here, right now. As far as I\u2019m concerned, he deserves a ribbon every day. Emotional crisis averted, we made our way to the opposite end of the bowling alley to find Nik\u2019s teacher and the three classmates who had participated in a different division. It was like watching a family reunion; Nik suddenly sprang to life and bubbled over with joy at seeing his friends.\u00a0 They were also over stimulated and tired from the long morning. One of the boys can get very physical when he is in that state and I worried when Nik grabbed his hands to start to clap with him. I admonished Nik to use his \u201cwords\u201d (his speech device) to ask the boy if he wanted to clap. The way Nik spelled everything out was as if it were one long, breathless request. \u201cMarcusclapplease.\u201d Marcus has always made me slightly uncomfortable because he is so much older and bigger than Nik and has no concept of personal space. He also has a very flat affect so it\u2019s hard to tell what he\u2019s feeling or thinking at any moment. I watched, somewhat leery, as he put his hands up for Nik to clap. Marcus pulled his hands away very suddenly and mumbled \u201cclap done.\u201d Nik persisted and Marcus tensed. I knew Ms. M and Ms. C (the teacher) were watching and ready to intervene, yet they didn\u2019t seem at all anxious about what Marcus might do. Marcus reached out and put both of his hands on Nik\u2019s shoulders and slowly pulled him to his chest. I held my breath as I watched in awe; Marcus slowly bent his head down and, with a tenderness I could not have imagined he could express, kissed the top of Nik\u2019s head in the most affectionate and brotherly gesture I have ever seen. So simple, yet so profound. The sting of the three-plus difficult hours which had come before this moment suddenly melted away. This\u2026connection; this was the real prize for my son who gives his all every single day. This was what he came for.

{"date": "November 8, 2012 ", "body": "Today, I am grateful for the  recorder . Nope, that\u2019s not a typo, I swear! Yes, the recorder. You know, that simple carved flute which, through the ages, has made parents cringe and dogs howl as children  endlessly torture the eardrums of everyone in a ten-mile radius  attempt to make something resembling music. (See  yesterday\u2019s post  for a visual.) Now, in all fairness (and in my defense), I am slightly biased; my parents played in a baroque recorder ensemble when I was a young girl. I\u2019ve always loved baroque-era music so I enjoyed it. Once a month, the group would meet at our home to rehearse \u2014 for what exactly I\u2019m not certain; I don\u2019t think they actually ever performed except for each other. But I loved those nights; mom would make coffee and serve some sort of snack and I\u2019d sit in Daddy\u2019s avocado green corduroy chair in the corner of the room and listen, maybe even do some homework. Inevitably, as the group was about to call it a night, someone would decide it was a good idea to play a solo on the\u00a0sopranino\u00a0recorder. (Think\u00a0piccolo-like but not as pretty, and far more shrill when played off-pitch.) We all would laugh with great amusement as our poor dog, Baroness, would sit and \u201csing.\u201d Of course, knowing what I now do about sensory processing and  hyperacusis , I feel badly that my poor pup was probably in pain. I also have many, many fond childhood memories of listening to my Nana playing violin and recorder duets with my parents when she and Granddaddy would come to visit. Nana was a remarkably talented violinist who played with an all-female group called  Polly and her Pals  way back in the 1920\u2019s or 30\u2019s and who also once played as regular member of the chamber ensemble at  Music Mountain  in Connecticut. Call me weird, but I\u2019ve always associated baroque recorder music with warm and happy memories. I had always hoped to share that love of music with my children. A few decades later \u2013the recorders have\u00a0long since been given away and my beloved Nana and Granddaddy many years passed. Somehow, I ended up with a child\u2019s music set which included a wooden recorder. It was given to us by well-intentioned friend of the family who knew Nik loves music. What she didn\u2019t know at the time was that Nik doesn\u2019t have the manual dexterity or control \u2013or the oral motor skill\u2014necessary to play any of the instruments she gave us. With more than a touch of sadness, I put them away in a drawer \u2013along with sharing my love of music with my son\u2013 and forgot about them. Nik is nonverbal. We don\u2019t know if he will ever talk \u2013and frankly, I don\u2019t care as long as he can learn to communicate his wants and needs. He can make some vocal sounds including several letters of the alphabet. The letters he struggles with are the ones requiring shaping of his lips or the voluntary movement of air forward. He says the letter F by sniffling through his nose. Pretty smart, actually, since that\u2019s pretty much the way he hears it. He can make the  PUH  sound for the letter P, but cannot blow air out as if he were blowing out a candle or pushing a cotton ball along a table top. Years and years of speech/communication therapy and it\u2019s all been tried over and over to no avail. Ironically, Nik is all about music and sounds and making the sounds have meaning. In his own way, he is a supreme linguist of a language so unique that almost no one but he and I understand it. Truly, he associates meaning with certain songs that even I can\u2019t figure it out for a while. He also adores his once a week music class at school. So, when he started digging through a drawer the other day, looking for  \u201ctriangle block\u201d  (don\u2019t ask\u2014I have NO.IDEA!), he pulled out the recorder and refused to put it away. Not wanting to make that my \u201chill to die on,\u201d I let him have it. Nik immediately brought the recorder to his mouth; I can only assume he\u2019s seen this in his music class. God knows I haven\u2019t shown him!\u00a0 Then, a light bulb went off in my mind. Or is it that it went on? Either way, I had a  Eureka!  moment. \u201cWhat if I could use Nik\u2019s ability to say the letter P sound and his love of music and sound to help him learn how to blow out of his mouth? I mean,\u00a0it\u2019s been tried a million times before, but, well\u2026what if?\u201d It\u2019s a work in progress, and I\u2019m sure the day will come when I will regret it. However, for now? All I know is my son is, little by little and with growing confidence and consistency, learning to make that god-awful shrill  TOOT! \u00a0from that recorder. The combination of that sound and the laughter which echoes after are the finest music I\u2019ve ever heard. Someone remind me of this later, okay?

{"date": "November 12, 2012 ", "body": "I\u2019ve always been a cat lover. It started long ago when my four-year old self woke to find the family cat having kittens\u2013  in my bed, under my covers!  A series of family pets including dogs, cats and horses followed; the cats were always my favorite for their silent and fluffy unconditional love to an often lonely little girl. In college, my beloved Tasha chose me as hers by climbing up my pant leg\u00a0and forcing her kittenly\u00a0affections on my cheek.\u00a0 We had seventeen years together\u00a0including several moves and many relationships. Tasha used to run and hide from all my boyfriends until my husband came along. I\u2019m convinced she was waiting for the \u201cright one\u201d to come along before she finally succumbed to old age and kidney failure in my arms in the middle of the night mere weeks before my wedding. Shortly after the wedding, my heart still ached with the loss of my Tasha and I wanted to find another cat to love. I was so sure it would be a boy because, well, no other female cat could possibly replace Tasha in my affections. Turns out I was both wrong and right and ended up with not one cat but two \u2014 a boy, Rascal, and a girl, Pandora. ********** Pandora was a feral rescue cat we adopted when she was about four months old. She was, and still is, an incredibly affectionate girl who loved nothing more than snuggling on my lap. When I was pregnant with Nik, she would lie on top of my belly and rest her head against my heart. I was on bed rest during my first trimester, so there was lots of bonding time between\u00a0Pandora and me.\u00a0 In hindsight, I think she was bonding with the baby growing in my belly, too. Though, in typical cat fashion, I suspect she was telegraphing messages of \u201cI rule the castle and don\u2019t you forget it, peanut!\u201d Nik was born three months early. The devastation of coming home from the hospital without my baby, the worry and waiting for the other shoe to drop because he was so fragile and his health so precarious, was made bearable by Pandora\u2019s faithful and patient love. As I sat on the sofa, night after night, sobbing uncontrollably,\u00a0she would silently nudge her head into my before wiggling her way onto my lap. It didn\u2019t take long before she would\u00a0drape herself over my shoulder \u2013offering herself up as a giant furry tissue to catch the torrents of my grief. When Nik came home from the hospital, seven months later, Pandora immediately bonded with him. Nonetheless, I had to constantly monitor her; being a slightly anxious kitty, she had a habit of indiscriminately chewing through things. Like the lamp cord she chewed through on one of the many days I spent at the hospital with Nik. I was worried she would try to bite through the oxygen tubing which trailed around the house, keeping Nik breathing freely. To my wonder, she never tried; it\u2019s as if she knew that Nik needed her to watch over him. When Nik napped, Pandora would circle a few times and lie down facing him. When he was awake, despite his inability to do more than sit in his bouncy chair or lay on a blanket, she would sit across the room watching warily. She kept her daily vigil faithfully and slept outside his room each night. Shortly after we moved back east, when\u00a0Nik was about fifteen months old and no longer on oxygen, the routine was pretty much the same. No matter where in the house Nik was, Pandora was almost always somewhere she could keep watch over him.\u00a0Nik wasn\u2019t yet sitting or even rolling over so she stayed relatively close.\u00a0 Because she\u00a0wasn\u2019t allowed to sleep in our room (Niksdad has allergies) and she wasn\u2019t allowed in Nik\u2019s room for fear she would get into the crib with him, Pandora continued to keep her silent vigil outside Nik\u2019s bedroom door each night.\u00a0 When we went into Nik\u2019s room to start the pump for his overnight feeds, Pandora would accompany me into the room and rub against my ankles until I picked her up.  \u201cSee, girl, our baby is fine. He\u2019s sleeping. Go lie down now.\u201d  And off she would go to wait in the hall. I always thought she would have made an excellent mama cat. ********** The sounds of frantic meows at my bedroom door woke me from my already light sleep.  \u201cPandora,\u201d  I moaned,  \u201cshut up! You\u2019ll wake the baby!\u201d  I hissed and threw a shoe at the door in an attempt to scare her away. To no avail.\u00a0Her meows became louder and more insistent. I got out of bed and threw the door open to shoo her away. She swatted at my leg and head butted my ankle and continued to howl. Something wasn\u2019t right, but I couldn\u2019t figure it out. I picked her up to soothe her but she jumped out of my arms and darted to Nik\u2019s door, pawing and meowing. Annoyed now, I scooped her up and shushed her.  \u201cFine, you want to see the baby? He\u2019s sleeping. He\u2019s fine.\u201d When I opened the door, my heart stopped. I remember suddenly screaming as if the house were on fire. Nik had not ever been able to roll over independently; it was an emerging skill we were working on and he could only roll in one direction. In his sleep, he must have rolled numerous times: the feeding tube was wound completely around his neck. The increasing tension on the tubing had pulled the pump stand over so far that it lay precariously perched on the very corner of the crib. One more turn or a slight bump would have sent it falling to the floor, tightening the tubing around Nik\u2019s neck. Nik was asleep through all of this; he didn\u2019t make a sound.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t have heard anything through the baby monitor which sat next to my pillow. Were it not for Pandora\u2019s utterly uncharacteristic howling in the middle of the night, we would have never known there was anything wrong until it was too late. Guardian angels come in many incarnations.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s has the softest fur and the sweetest meow. ********** Editor\u2019s note: \n  Obviously, that was the end of Nik\u2019s unattended nighttime feedings, but Pandora continues to keep her vigil to this day. During the years in which Nik woke screaming in pain every night, Pandora was always right there at my feet, waiting until all was calm and I would hold her over the crib to stroke her gently and show her that our baby was okay. Even now, she waits outside his bedroom door until he has gone to sleep.

{"date": "November 14, 2012 ", "body": "Ok, so I know today is the whole Wordless Wednesday thing and I could skate by without a post and just slap up a cute picture of my kid and be done with it. But I can\u2019t because, in this case, the picture is just a small part of the story. And this story is too good not to tell. We\u2019ve been going through a few bumpy stretches around here as we work to find a new equilibrium. Between Niksdad working nights now and getting less time with Nik, the wonky school schedule, the \u201csuper storm,\u201d the broken speech devices (it\u2019s fixed now!), the belly troubles, the ear infections and the early triennial evaluation of every aspect of Nik\u2019s needs and services\u2026yeah, bumpy. When we get into a challenging run of days, it\u2019s easy to forget to look for the good stuff. Like this: He\u2019s a great date! So, what\u2019s so special about a picture of my uber-cute son sipping on a beverage at our local Starbuck\u2019s? The fact that  he asked  to do it. Our pediatrician\u2019s office is near a Starbucks with a drive-thru window. Whenever we go to the pediatrician, as we did yesterday for yet another raging ear infection, we stop at the drive-thru for Nik\u2019s favorite treat: lemon cake. Nik only ever gets it after seeing the doctor. I don\u2019t even recall how we started it, but it\u2019s become a part of the ritual, part of the litany he recites  endlessly as I drive  with his speech device.  \u201cDoctor\u2019s office first, lemon cake next!\u201d Over time, we\u2019ve progressed from sharing a slice between us to  Nik hogging it all to himself  wanting a whole piece. I usually drive and sing and hand back a bit of cake here and there as we head home on the highway. It\u2019s not exactly the neatest way to do it, but it\u2019s always been such a hassle to try to wrangle Nik in public places with lots of things for busy hands to get into while Mama pays for stuff. In short, it\u2019s been a sanity-saving measure for me. As we passed the Starbucks on our way to the doctor\u2019s office, Nik kept repeating the word  inside  on his device.  \u201cYes, baby, we\u2019re inside the car.\u201d \u201cYes, Nik, we\u2019ll be inside the doctor\u2019s office soon.\u201d  I didn\u2019t really understand what he wanted but was following the pattern of AAC use which is that you acknowledge every utterance so as to encourage continued communication. It\u2019s become so ingrained that there are days I have to catch myself from doing this to my husband as he speaks! I assume that I have interpreted Nik\u2019s communication correctly because I didn\u2019t hear it again. Until\u00a0 I am about to turn into the drive-thru lane. From the backseat of the car, I hear it\u2026 Inside. Inside, please. Inside, Mama. Inside. Want sit inside. My boy knows what he wants and\u00a0can tell me. My miracle child, who was\u00a0once able to communicate only\u00a0 through self-injury and tears,\u00a0can make himself understood without endless prompting or cajoling! The magnitude of this milestone, years in the making, does not escape me. As I pull into a parking space, I am rewarded by the sound of laughter as Nik claps his hands in delight. Clearly, his success does not escape him either. Once inside, Nik proceeds to use his device to\u00a0tell the barista  \u201cWant lemon cake.\u201d  I admonish him to use his nice words;  \u201cPlease,\u201d  he says in the quirky digitized monotone I have come to love. In this moment, the endless hours of teaching, prompting, shaping and modeling fade from my mind as I watch the naturalness with which he connects with the girl behind the counter. For a fleeting moment, I tell myself I might consider buying a pony if he asked.

{"date": "April 4, 2009 ", "body": "April is  Autism Awareness Month . \u00a0  There are any number of erudite and passionate posts about the subject \u2014some I agree with wholeheartedly and others significantly less so. \u00a0  I\u2019m not jumping into the fray as my hands are  more than a bit full  right now with being aware of my son\u2019s very real,  very intense  needs  right now. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 I am grateful to all those other writers who have the energy, the stamina, and the vision to stand and speak for those of us who are hunkered down in the trenches and feeling under siege. \u00a0  They often provide me with hope and encouragement. \u00a0  Sometimes, they provide a much needed laugh or the comforting recognition of a kindred spirit. \u00a0  Sometimes, they take a stand that is so anathema to my inherent beliefs that it helps me get clearer about where I stand on some of the more controversial elements of autism advocacy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t always like what these writers have to say but I appreciate their right to say it and their role, I hope, in pushing people off the fence.\u00a0  It\u2019s hard to advocate for something if you don\u2019t know where you stand. \u00a0 Here\u2019s where  I  stand.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe my child is  \u201cvaccine injured.\u201d \u00a0  Nor do I believe my child is  \u201ctrapped\u201d  inside a shell waiting to be brought forth by some miracle cure. \u00a0  And, perhaps shocking to some of my readers, I  don\u2019t think  Nik\u2019s pain and intestinal issues are related to his autism. \u00a0  Certainly not in the sense that I believe resolving those issues will make him any less autistic. \u00a0  I do believe, however, that resolving those issues will make him a more physically comfortable autistic person.\u00a0  \u00a0 Right now we\u2019re going through a hellish time, I admit. \u00a0  But I don\u2019t attribute that all to Nik\u2019s autism and I certainly don\u2019t think that my life is awful or that Nik\u2019s life is awful. \u00a0  We\u2019re just going through a crappy patch right now. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 This, too, shall pass. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Until it does, I\u2019ll continue to go to bed early, take the good times as they come, and rely on the community of parents I\u2019ve come to know through my blogging and on-line efforts to buoy my spirits, to touch my heart, to speak the words I wish I had the energy to speak, to walk the walks and raise the funds, and to continue to advocate in the ways they do with integrity, dignity, and respect for our loved ones. \u00a0 Awareness, my friends, takes many forms. \u00a0  Advocacy can occur on any scale. \u00a0  Mine is just smaller and closer to home these days. \u00a0  To borrow the words of my friend,  GoodFountain , autism awareness has to mean Nikolas awareness \u2014first and foremost. \u00a0  I think I\u2019m doing okay there.

{"date": "April 5, 2009 ", "body": "\u00a0 \n \n Original art courtesy of le petit enfant blog \n \n You know it\u2019s  never  a good sign when the nurses at the pediatric hospital  (a)  know you and your child by both sight and name and  (b)  can tell when things aren\u2019t good just by looking at you. \u00a0  Yep, true story: one of the nurses actually commented to me the other day,  \u201cMrs. Niksmom, you don\u2019t look quite like your usual self. \u00a0  Everything okay? \u00a0  You\u2019re usually, um, more, um polished.\u201d \u00a0  She stammered, embarrassed. \u00a0  But she said it with such tender concern that I couldn\u2019t possibly be offended. \u00a0  Besides which, she\u2019s right; it\u2019s been a pretty rough go of things around here these past few months. \u00a0 \u201cOh, thanks T!\u201d  I laughed,  \u201cI thought I looked pretty good considering we haven\u2019t slept through the night since about Christmas!\u201d Poor thing, her jaw dropped and her eyes went wide with surprise. \u00a0  \u201cOh, well, you\u2019re right then,\u201d  she smiled weakly,  \u201cyou do look pretty good. \u00a0  But still, not your usual self.\u201d \u00a0  I was touched\u00a0by her concern. \u00a0  She\u2019s known us for a few years now and genuinely cares for Nik and our family. \u00a0  We\u2019re pretty lucky that way, I think. \u00a0 \u00a0 Things are still clear as mud around Nik\u2019s ever increasing bouts of pain and wakefulness. \u00a0  The allergy testing was all negative and the endocrinologist we saw this week was very up front in telling us he didn\u2019t think the answer would be found in his realm of medicine \u2014at least, not in the  traditional  sense. \u00a0  Both\u00a0doctors hinted quite broadly that we may have more luck exploring the area of food intolerance through elimination diet and the addition of some probiotic types of supports.\u00a0 Actually, the allergist hinted, the endocrinologist flat out told us. \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019ve decided to re-visit the whole issue of gluten and casein in Nik\u2019s diet. \u00a0  There does seem to have been a  dramatic  increase in the frequency and intensity of Nik\u2019s episodic headache and pain activity since we\u2019ve been letting him eat absolutely anything he wants. \u00a0  Really, anything we offer him is more accurate. \u00a0 Difficult to know for sure as the correlation doesn\u2019t always equal direct cause and effect.\u00a0 Still , here we are back to the GFCF diet and trying to find things Nik can or will eat with his textural challenges. \u00a0  The learning curve is steep as Nik has decided to throw in a slight monkey wrench of not wanting to bite or chew anything again. (Insert heavy sigh here.) \u00a0 Consequently, Nik\u2019s getting more formula than we\u2019d like. \u00a0  That one change seems to be having a profound effect on his pain; it seems the more formula he gets, the worse the pain. \u00a0  And the itching sensation is greatly intensified\u2014at least it appears to be an itch; when it kicks in, Nik grabs at his cheeks, his eyebrows, his belly and his legs and pulls frantically at them \u2014as if he could remove the offending or irritated part. \u00a0  The challenge is that we don\u2019t know what is causing the sensations so we don\u2019t know how to eliminate the culprit. \u00a0  His formula (which is a gluten-free prescription medical formula) does contain casein so we\u2019re kind of stuck until we can find a replacement or until he decides to eat enough that we can wean him off the formula. \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019ve added some enzymes to Nik\u2019s diet which seem to minimize some of the gluten/casein effects but it\u2019s not foolproof. \u00a0  Nik can\u2019t say for sure if he feels different after taking them; we can only judge by his behavior or lack of pain whether it\u2019s an improvement. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been told by a few parents who have transitioned their children to GFCF diets \u2014and seen marked improvements in sleep, gastric functioning and a lessening of self injurious behaviors \u2014that there was a definite  detox  period of roughly ten to fourteen days in which the symptoms seemed to get worse before they got better.\u00a0  Hearing that bit of information was a  tremendous relief  for me this week as we\u2019ve seen a marked regression in some of Nik\u2019s\u00a0behaviors. \u00a0  He\u2019s gone back to some of the self-soothing things which he seemed to have outgrown \u2014infant toys which light and play music, vibrational input in his mouth, mouthing absolutely everything (which he hasn\u2019t done at all in months). \u00a0  His perseverations, especially with doors, seem to be very prominent again in spite of all efforts to redirect his attention. \u00a0 \u00a0 Interesting to note though, Nik\u2019s cognitive skills have  not slipped one iota . \u00a0  Yes, he\u2019s very easily distracted \u2014more so these past few days than ever before\u2014 but he\u2019s still  very  engaged in his environment and willing to do his \u201cwork\u201d in his PT and OT sessions. \u00a0  Nik\u2019s keenly interested in letters and numbers and figuring out how things work. \u00a0  Even when it may look, to an outsider, like Nik is simply perseverating on the animals which go with his alphabet train station \u2014repeatedly pressing the animal into the grooves to hear  what it says, what color it is, what it likes to do  \u2014I can tell he is listening intently and taking in the information, storing it away for future reference. \u00a0 \u00a0 I have no idea where all of this will lead us. \u00a0  We\u2019re just taking it a step at a time \u2014grateful for the good days, praying for the bad days and nights to become fewer and farther between, and so appreciative of all the support we receive from people around us \u2014both in \u201creal\u201d life and our online extended family of friends.

{"date": "August 1, 2009 ", "body": "The shoes should have been our first clue. After a perfectly delightful morning \u2014one which began after more than twelve hours\u2019 sleep for Nik and a leisurely breakfast for myself and Niksdad\u2014 we began our preparations for a jaunt to the local peach festival, followed by a visit to the park.\u00a0 The pre-departure routine is always the same:  \u201cOkay, buddy, time for some clean pants.\u00a0 Bring your toy and let\u2019s get clean pants.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cClean pants first, then socks, MAFO\u2019s and shoes.\u201d Nik is always eager to perform this routine; he loves to go out with us.\u00a0 Lately, he\u2019s begun to put his orthotics on by himself \u2014even getting them on the correct feet.\u00a0 He was just beginning to clamber onto the sofa, where I sat waiting with wipes and pull-up in hand, when Niksdad brought over his socks, MAFO\u2019s and shoes.\u00a0 The scream which issued forth from my heretofor sunny child was unlike anything I\u2019ve heard except when he is in extreme and urgent pain.\u00a0 It was the kind of sound which makes my heart race and causes me to drop everything and come running in an instant, certain I will find my child covered in blood. There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth (to put it quite mildly) until we figured out the problem:  the shoes .\u00a0 Perfectly good, serviceable Nike\u2019s which Nik has worn on many occasions though not for sometime.\u00a0 (His other Nike\u2019s were so filthy from repeated outings to the park\u2014 the laces were nearly black\u2014\u00a0that I  insisted we wash them last night; they were still in the laundry closet, slightly damp.)\u00a0 I put the offending shoes on the floor at my feet while Niksdad went to get the still-damp shoes.\u00a0 Apparently, even that was too close for those awful shoes; Nik screamed and jumped off the sofa, grabbed the shoes and ran to the entertainment center to put them on top.\u00a0 That\u2019s were they\u2019ve been sitting for weeks now; it made perfect sense to Nik\u2019s sense of order. Once Nik realized the \u201ccorrect\u201d shoes were going on his feet he calmed down.\u00a0 In fact, he seemed quite eager for our outing.\u00a0 Off we went on our merry way.\u00a0  \u201cWe\u2019re going to get ice cream first, then go to the park. Ok buddy?\u00a0 Ice cream first, then park.\u201d \u00a0 I repeated that phrase, like\u00a0a mantra, as we drove.\u00a0 Nik is usually pretty good about changed routines or routes as long as I tell him the sequence several times over. I should have known that the shoe incident had my precious boy already wound too tightly.\u00a0 As soon as I turned right at a traffic light where we normally turn left, Nik\u2019s tenuous balance shifted and the tempest began.\u00a0 I talked to him in soothing tones as I drove.\u00a0  \u201cIt\u2019s ok, sweetie, we\u2019re going to get ice cream first then go to the park, remember?\u00a0 It\u2019s ok.\u00a0 You\u2019re ok.\u201d \u00a0 All the while, Niksdad held on to Nik\u2019s feet so he couldn\u2019t injur himself (or us) with his kicking.\u00a0 I drove with one hand on the steering wheel and one hand holding Nik\u2019s sweaty fingers, gently squeezing to give him some proprioceptive input which I hoped would calm him. We parked right next to the entrance (God bless our disabled parking placard!) and waited for the storm to abate.\u00a0 When Nik didn\u2019t seem to show signs of calming, Niksdad said tersely,  \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work, let\u2019s just skip it.\u201d \u00a0 His frustration level was, understandably, rising with each howl and each kick which landed on the back of his seat.\u00a0 Not realizing that Nik was already overwrought and wound too tightly, I insisted we at least get out of the car and  try .\u00a0 There have been times when simply getting out of the car has shifted Nik\u2019s attention enough that he is able to calm down and we end up having a decent outing.\u00a0 I also felt very strongly that we  needed  \u2014 I needed \u2014 to not be held hostage to the autism.\u00a0 We spent the first two years of Nik\u2019s life sequestered away from everyone and everything because we had to protect Nik\u2019s fragile immune system.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent much of the last couple years isolated from nearly everyone and everything except the occasional family outing.\u00a0 At some point, I felt, we just have to say  \u201cDamn the consequences!\u201d  and try \u2014just  try \u2014 to be a part of the very society in which we want our boy to thrive. Today was not the day for that. We never made it to the ice cream or the petting zoo.\u00a0 We pulled into the parking lot at the park and Nik fell apart again.\u00a0 By this time, he was so overwrought he couldn\u2019t tell us anything.\u00a0  \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d  Nik signed  please  so we offered him a bite of his sandwich; he thrust it at me and screamed.\u00a0  \u201cDo you want to go play in the park, sweetie?\u201d \u00a0 He simultaneously signed  please  and shook his head  no .\u00a0 I started to hum Mary Poppins songs to calm him.\u00a0 It seemed to work until I stopped.\u00a0 The wailing began again. We drove home to nurse our wounded hearts and try to figure out what our boy was telling us, what he needed.\u00a0 As we pulled into the driveway \u2014like magic\u2014 the tears and tantrums abated and the happy singing began. ********** Nik has now had lunch and is a very happy camper \u2014singing Mary Poppins and Signing Time songs to his toys, playing with his alphabet puzzles.\u00a0 We may attempt the outing again in a while \u2014or not. It\u2019s so hard, trying to find the right balance between stretching Nik\u2019s boundaries and honoring his needs.\u00a0 Between giving my child what he needs and giving myself what I need.\u00a0 Trusting my instincts and listening to the voice in my heart that says  \u201cWe have to try\u2026\u201d \u00a0 The lines are hazy and constantly shifting \u2014like walking on a sand dune in a headwind.\u00a0 I believe we are at a crucial point in Nik\u2019s communication development:\u00a0 the more he knows he can make himself understood \u2014and the fewer tantrums as a result of that success, the more intensely frustrated he becomes in those instances where he cannot make himself understood.\u00a0 The extremes seem to be farther apart and I feel stretched to my limits straddling the chasm.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll write more about that another time \u2014after\u00a0I mull it over some more.

{"date": "August 17, 2009 ", "body": "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, \nNinety-nine bottles of beer; \nTake one down and pass it around, \nNinety-nine bottles of beer on the wall! A mere five and a half months ago, my son decided that eating was a good thing.\u00a0 It only took him five years and three months\u00a0to get there, but who am I to quibble over timing, right?\u00a0 I should clarify: Nik did eat for a short period of time back in\u00a02006 but it was very short lived and was never more than a small percentage of his daily nutritional intake.\u00a0 He has, since the day he was born, always had a feeding tube of one sort or another. In March of this year, we began the journey which has led us to where we are today; we have entered completely new, alien \u2014but exciting\u2014 territory.\u00a0 Over the last months, we have had to measure every last morsel of food and carefully calculate the meager percentages of Nik\u2019s daily calories by mouth.\u00a0 Over an amazingly short period of time we began to see the balance shift between tube feedings and oral intake.\u00a0 All of a sudden \u2014almost overnight, it seems \u2014 Nik was eating pancakes and pretzels, sweet potatoes and cooked carrots, scrambled eggs and fish fillets.\u00a0 The change was dramatic, to say the least. By late May, with great excitement, we told our gastroenterologist about Nik\u2019s vigorous interest in food; by that time he was taking nearly everything by mouth with the exception of some of his medications.\u00a0 Hesitantly, we asked when we would know it was time to lose the feeding tube for good.\u00a0  \u201cOh, Nik has quite a long way to go still, \u201c  she said.\u00a0  \u201cHe needs to be drinking at least 1300 mL\u2019s by mouth.\u201d \u00a0 Thirteen hundred?\u00a0 That\u2019s  forty   ounces .\u00a0 Nik was barely drinking FOUR a day and struggling with his ability to suck from a straw.\u00a0 Sipping from a cup \u2014Nik laps like a kitten from a bowl of milk \u2014 wasn\u2019t even on the radar. It felt like we had been kicked in the gut. We decided not to push the issue, trusting that Nik would come around in his own time.\u00a0 We went through a stretch of several weeks in which Nik continuously pulled his tube out or the balloon holding the tube in his belly would rupture from his strenuous play at the park each day.\u00a0 We went through thirteen tubes in a short period of time; thirteen tubes is considered to be, roughly, a four to six year supply for most people.\u00a0 We \u2014all three of us\u2014 became desperate to speed up the process of losing Nik\u2019s feeding tube once and for all. We talked to Miss M, our beloved speech therapist \u2014who is so very much more than that phrase imparts\u2014 about new goals to foster Nik\u2019s ability to drink from a straw.\u00a0 If we were going to get Nik anywhere near that thirteen hundred mL mark, it would have to be by straw.\u00a0 In June, we began our stringent campaign.\u00a0 Everything was offered to Nik by mouth \u2014even his Prilosec which had been compounded into a ghastly tasting liquid we could put through his feeding tube all those years.\u00a0 Eventually, Nik began to have some success with getting as much into his mouth as he did onto his shirt or the table.\u00a0 We went through sippy cups with valves, sippy cups without valves.\u00a0 So many permutations of sippy cups and bottles and straws that we looked like we were running a daycare center with all the supplies scattered around our kitchen. Niksdad and I \u2014with the blessing of our pediatrician\u2014 had long ago decided that thirteen hundred mL\u2019s was unrealistic for Nik.\u00a0 Even at half that amount on a daily basis, his urine output has been fine, his bowels working fine, he\u2019s well hydrated and he can cry tears.\u00a0 We decided that it was time to push the issue.\u00a0 On one of our emergency visits to the hospital to replace Nik\u2019s tube \u2014because it had failed again and we had run out of spares and the medical supplier couldn\u2019t get any to us for days\u2014 we broached the subject with Nik\u2019s GI doctor.\u00a0 Her response was cautious:  \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that Nik will meet all of his nutritional requirements and I don\u2019t think he will meet his hydration needs, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d \u00a0 We began to push the water in earnest.\u00a0 Just a little bit every hour or so.\u00a0 Then a bit more, and a bit more. Finally, in\u00a0early July, we found something \u201cjust right\u201d \u2014 a sport water bottle with a flip up straw and no valve.\u00a0 We figured, the less suction Nik had to fight, the more water he would be able to consume.\u00a0 It was a slow process at first, but \u2014much like the surge in eating back in March\u2014 one day it just clicked into place.\u00a0 Nik had days where he would drink twelve ounces through the course of the day.\u00a0 Then fifteen.\u00a0 Then twenty!\u00a0 We called the GI to declare that we were all ready to get rid of the tube once and for all; we were prepared to take our chances and needed to know what to do when the tube eventually failed again or got pulled out.\u00a0 It was a reasonable assumption that the tube would fail; we had gone through  two tubes in one day that week and Nik had nothing to do with either! \u201cWhen the tube fails or if Nik pulls it out, you may put a bandage over the stoma and let it close by itself.\u00a0 As I said, I can\u2019t guarantee that he will meet his nutrition or hydration needs\u2026\u201d \u00a0 That was all we needed; we got the green light!\u00a0 We knew it was just a matter of time before the tube failed or Nik pulled it out, right? WRONG.\u00a0 It\u2019s as if, in giving her blessing, the doctor put a spell on the tube \u2014a super-duper-indestructibility whammy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been waiting for three weeks for something to happen to the damned tube.\u00a0 Nothing.\u00a0  Nothing .\u00a0 NOTHING.\u00a0 Nik picks and pulls but leaves it in.\u00a0 He climbs over all sorts of things at the park (and at home) and still that blasted tube remains. We could remove it but we decided to wait it out at least until the weather cools down a bit and Nik\u2019s less likely to grind dirt into it at the park.\u00a0 Oh, wait, that latter scenario?\u00a0 Never gonna happen!\u00a0 So, we wait. Meanwhile, here we are; thirty-two days have passed since we began the water campaign and nothing \u2014and I mean  nothing \u2014 has gone through that tube.\u00a0 The daily successes have been pretty astounding.\u00a0 Especially this past week with Nik being sick; that was the real test of how well hydrated we could keep him without the tube.\u00a0\u00a0On three separate days, Nik has consumed a full liter of water in a day.\u00a0 ONE THOUSAND mL\u2019s.\u00a0 His daily average for the past month?\u00a0 Nearly twenty-seven ounces. We\u2019re  this  close, I tell ya.\u00a0 THIS. CLOSE. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/08/17/punch-drunk/", "title": "Punch Drunk"},

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that our afternoon was the  antithesis  to our morning.\u00a0 So what was different the second time around?\u00a0 Nothing, really.\u00a0 And everything.\u00a0 I know, I know \u2014that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0 But, really, the things we did were so incredibly  simple  that I wasn\u2019t even sure it would work.\u00a0  We met Nik where he was. \u00a0 To do that, we had to observe his behavior and listen to his cues. Let me give you a little background which might help this make sense: Nik is nonverbal but extremely intelligent.\u00a0 He understands just about everything that is said to him, about him, around him.\u00a0 He takes everything in.\u00a0 He also has a very strict interpretation or understanding of certain constants.\u00a0 One of those constants is that food is eaten while sitting in his booster chair at the table unless it is otherwise specified. e.g.,  \u201cWe\u2019re going to Nanny and Granddaddy\u2019s for dinner.\u201d  or  \u201cWe\u2019re going to a restaurant for lunch.\u201d \u00a0 (Snacks are a different category; he\u2019s ok with eating them in the car, at the park, play group, etc.) Nik is also usually very good about adapting  as long as he understands the sequence in which he can expect things to occur .\u00a0 Nik knows  ice cream  is food.\u00a0 He  doesn\u2019t know  that  \u201cgoing to get ice cream\u201d  means going somewhere \u2014let alone somewhere  new \u2014 in the car.\u00a0 So, to Nik,  \u201cice cream first, then park\u201d  would mean  \u201cWe\u2019re going to sit at the table and eat ice cream and then go to the park.\u201d Nik is also amazingly observant of his physical surroundings.\u00a0 He can tell where we\u2019re going based on the turns I take or the scenery along the route.\u00a0 If I tell him that we\u2019re going somewhere different \u2014and I may have to repeat it many times to reinforce the message as I drive\u2014 Nik is, generally, ok with it.\u00a0 Today\u2019s destination \u2014the orchard for the ice cream and petting zoo \u2014took us right past the turn for the park. Can you see where this is going? Right. So here\u2019s our happy-go-lucky boy \u2014already wound tighter than a top from  the shoe incident \u2014 thinking he\u2019s going to sit and eat ice cream and then go to the park.\u00a0 By the time we got to the orchard, not only had we not eaten ice cream but we\u2019d driven past the park!\u00a0 Poor Nik\u00a0 was experiencing such tremendous cognitive dissonance that he simply could not function.\u00a0 I\u2019m not using hyperbole for effect, either.\u00a0 By the time we returned home this morning, though he was happy and clapping when we pulled in the driveway, Nik was  completely motionless and silent  when we opened the car door.\u00a0 It was as if he simply checked out for a moment to re-calibrate. This afternoon, armed with those realizations, and the knowledge that Nik doesn\u2019t know what the new place \u2014the orchard\u2014 is, we realized that we had to give him only one part of the sequence at a time.\u00a0 Otherwise, we risked the likelihood that Nik would fixate on  \u201cgoing to the park\u201d  and block out the rest because he couldn\u2019t visualize it.\u00a0 We also decided to try something that I\u2019ve been meaning to try for a while \u2014a rudimentary picture schedule to help Nik know where we are going in the car and why we are not going the way he expects us to go.\u00a0 (Side note: Nik doesn\u2019t seem to have this trouble with changing activities at home or at therapy; it\u2019s only when we are driving places that he gets so rigidly attached to his expectations.) I printed out two pictures to take with us.\u00a0 We gave Nik the first one \u2014a full size picture of an ice cream cone\u2014 before we got in the car and explained to him that we were going to \u201ca farm\u201d to get ice cream.\u00a0 Oddly enough, though I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever taken him to a farm, Nik seemed to understand that concept.\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe it was simply because I named something that he understands as an actual\u00a0place or, at the very least, a place that is not home?\u00a0 I really don\u2019t know. As we drove along the exact same route we took this morning, I sang silly songs about eating ice cream and going to the farm for yummy ice cream.\u00a0 Nik even got into the spirit when\u00a0I asked him to show me how he eats an ice cream cone by, well, eating the ice cream cone  picture ! Nik never once whined nor got upset the entire drive.\u00a0 As soon as we arrived, he let Niksdad put him up on his shoulders and we made a beeline for the ice cream.\u00a0 Nik\u2019s reaction was all the proof we needed that we had done the right thing: After Nik downed an entire cone \u2014and attempted to eat a few twigs, too \u2014we asked if he wanted to go to the park.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t quite clear about that so I asked if he was ready to go in the car.\u00a0 That got a clear affirmative so we went and sat in the car.\u00a0 Once we were in the car, Niksdad gave him the second picture \u2014a picture of a playground similar to that at the park \u2014and asked if he wanted to go there.\u00a0 The light bulb went on and our little dude was on board. The rest, as they say, is history. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/antithesis/", "title": "Antithesis"},
{"date": "August 31, 2009 ", "body": "\u201c\u2026just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in a most delightful way.\u201d ~ Mary Poppins \u00a0 Since Nik\u2019s been taking this latest antibiotic, his poor little system has been a wreck. The Bactrim gives him horrible, painful gas which, in turn, gives him excruciating gut pains. For Nik, with his  altered intestinal structure , those pains are enough to make him wake screaming in the middle of the night \u2014 just like old times . The beauty of the Bactrim? The effects can actually last for several weeks after he stops taking it. Oh joy! Oh rapture!\u00a0 The other side effects of the Bactrim have included a severe loss of appetite and some really challenging days full of very \u201cstimmy\u201d behavior and poor attention span. So, yes, I think the neighbors may be on the verge of reporting to the police that we  must  be dead. Why else would Mary Poppins be playing ad nauseum, right? Hey, if it makes my boy happy then I\u2019m OK with it \u2014well, most of the time. Nik\u2019s reached a new, erm, milestone though; he sings Mary Poppins songs when he wakes \u2014including in the middle of the night. He  clings  to me at bedtime and won\u2019t let me put him down until I hold him and he sings songs from the movie. (Well, given his nonverbal ability,  singing  is a loose description.)\u00a0 This is the same child who usually catapults himself into his crib and signals his desire for us to leave him alone! Every night this past week it has taken me an extra half hour to get him to settle down without tears and hysteria. Who knew my sweet little boy was  so dramatic ?! (I swear, I have NO idea where he gets that trait\u2026)\u00a0 Finally, this weekend, it dawned on me; maybe it isn\u2019t about Nik feeling poorly that\u2019s had him clinging to me at bedtime.\u00a0  I think, maybe, \u00a0Nik\u00a0has really been asking me to spend more time with him before bed. \u00a0 Since Nik won\u2019t sit still long enough for me to read him a story, I wasn\u2019t really sure what to do.\u00a0 Niksdad and I discussed a few ideas \u2014including some family time before Nik\u2019s normal bedtime routine.\u00a0 Nothing seemed to be quite right so we decided to mull it over a while longer.\u00a0 Still without an answer at bedtime last night, I decided to try something \u2014 anything . After putting Nik in his pajamas, I sat on the sofa next to him.\u00a0 He started to hum a song from Mary Poppins and reached over to hold my hand so I could swing his arm back and forth in time to the music as I do when we are \u201cdancing.\u201d\u00a0 I wrapped my arms around my sweet boy and drew him onto my lap.\u00a0 \u201cEarly each day to the steps of St. Paul\u2019s, the little old bird woman comes\u2026\u201d  As I crooned quietly against his downy hair, Nik rested his cheek against my chest, tucked his little hands between his knees and snuggled into my belly.\u00a0 As I continued to sing, Nik\u2019s body slumped and his eyes fluttered a few times.\u00a0 He wiggled a bit to slide off of my lap; I thought I\u2019d lost the moment. To my surprise, Nik didn\u2019t slither to the floor to run around.\u00a0 Instead, he settled his gangly limbs into a pile at my hip and laid his head down in my lap.\u00a0 As I gently stroked his back and hummed softly \u2014 through a thick frog in my throat \u2014 Nik\u2019s lids fluttered closed for the last time. \u201c\u2026tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHrRxQVUFN4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHrRxQVUFN4"], "link": "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/08/31/a-spoonful-of-sugar-2/", "title": "A Spoonful of\u00a0Sugar"}
