{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nThere's something about caring for a child with disabilities that takes the \"red\" out of \"hot\" in the marital bed. \u00a0The arrival of a baby, healthy or not, can often put a damper on sex in the city. \u00a0I remember comparing notes with other young Mums when my kids were brand new - so much nursing and cuddling and living through the needs of a tiny, totally vulnerable person has that effect. \u00a0Perhaps it's just nature's way of helping parents keep staring at their vulnerable charge like a biological safety measure to ensure the next feed and change. But what happens when the needs of that vulnerable charge never really diminish? \u00a0We keep our parental eye firmly fixed on our son or daughter with disabilities... we keep them safe. \u00a0So, what does it take to keep the romantic fires alight? \u00a0I would say that it requires a decision - a decision to look away from your child for a few minutes and look at your partner. \u00a0It's difficult, especially when looking only at your child becomes a habit - a habit that eventually feels like necessary breathing. And TIME is the enemy here. \u00a0Most parents of children with disabilities have no respite, especially if their child is complex. \u00a0One couple I know who run a home hospital for their 42 year old son have not been out to dinner since 1997. \u00a0They cannot trust others to look after their precious son - his care would tax even a well-staffed, state of the art medical facility. Some couples will have to muster lots of determination to make that decision to remain close. \u00a0Many will have to create complicated puzzles for respite plans, however brief. \u00a0But once the decision is made to have some physical contact with a partner, the decision is there - it becomes real. \u00a0Hands will be held, necks will be stroked, hugs have a chance of leading to something closer. \n \n It takes courage to turn away from a special needs child, even for a minute. \u00a0But a little planning to ensure the best safety measures possible for a break of fifteen minutes or a weekend away can make a mother and a father into a couple. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lpr7mWizbc/T-3TwFdnVvI/AAAAAAAAAOg/8N3nxm3zmtI/s1600/11516325-young-couple-in-love-kissing-in-autumn-park.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/06/can-disability-parents-have-sex-life.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nNews feeds are awash in stories of the  BREXIT referendum  debacle in the UK. \u00a0Weak and deceitful campaigns on both sides of the argument about whether to leave the European Union or not resulted in a surprise victory by the 'Leavers', prompting the Prime Minister to resign. \u00a0The nation is wringing its hands, lamenting 'what have we done?'. \u00a0What does BREXIT mean for UK caregivers and what lessons can we draw for caregivers elsewhere? \n \n Caregivers in the UK  constitute roughly 10% of the population and more than 10% of that number provide more than 50 hours of unpaid care per week. One in five people between the ages of 50 and 64 are caregivers. \n \nHalf of working age caregivers live in a household where no one is in paid employment. \u00a0I mention this statistic because poverty is a huge social determinant of health. Caregivers who are poor are twice as likely to develop illness as their middle or upper income counterparts. \n \nOur family lives in Canada now, but we've spent ten years living in London on account of my husband's job as a diplomat. \u00a0I recall attending a lecture on health inequality in 2009 given by the then UK Health Minister Alan Johnson. \u00a0To illustrate his point on how poverty impacts the health of families, he used this analogy: if you ride the London underground and get on a train at Bond Street (central London) travelling east all the way to Stratford, you will lose a year of life expectancy at every stop. \u00a0Stratford in east London has the same life expectancy as Guatemala. We know that poverty compounds the suffering of people with illness and disability as well their families. And with BREXIT, UK caregivers will suffer even more. \n \nSo many social ills have been revealed by this vote, many of them common to us in North America. Income inequality and the suffering it causes is just the tip of the iceberg. Young people in the UK overwhelmingly voted to stay in the EU, while older people, many hankering after 'the good old days', voted to leave. This demographic rift has pitted not only the rich against poor, but the old against young. Today, a tweet appeared with a photo of an elderly woman with shopping bags crossing the street and the caption below \"Dramatic drop in number of people helping elderly across the street since Brexit vote.\"  \n \n \n \n \n \nBut it's not just the anger against older people that will harm caregiving families, it's the demographics of itinerant paid caregivers. \u00a0Pre-Brexit, the  Guardian  newspaper commented  \" The vision of tens of thousands of care workers packing their bags and heading home to other EU states after a British withdrawal is one that fills the hearts of many social care employers with dread.\" \n \nNo one doubts that BREXIT is disastrous for the UK economy in the short term and it's punched other world markets in the nose as well. But for caregiving families, the greatest concern is that a great bandage has been ripped off the skin of England and revealed a festering infection underneath. Income inequality and disenfranchisement in the face of extreme wealth in London and government leaders focused on their own political futures have put wind in the sails of populism, racism and isolationism. And it's no wonder. \u00a0And now, the bitter irony is that so many promises of the Leave campaign have already proven to be empty. People feel betrayed and frightened about the future.  \n \nMy worry is that UK caregiving families will suffer more with poverty and lack of services as well as a lack of health care service providers than ever before. \u00a0The lesson of BREXIT for me is that we must join together to urgently give value to the natural care given by families and vote to ensure that infrastructure exists to support all our health care needs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8gYTCWUOLCk/V2_ve24UyqI/AAAAAAAAC0Y/d5tYbgvJRek1pbaIQb4_p07hdMRBC0-PwCLcB/s1600/Cl4WkKjWkAAwtD7.jpg", "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887", "https://www.carersuk.org/for-professionals/policy/policy-library/facts-about-carers-2014", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B4wkcxWtxxo/V2_zmQ4k57I/AAAAAAAAC0k/l-x5Zd20yng2Pbr910eZUYtjkg-xUXg4ACLcB/s1600/32CB754C00000578-0-The_polling_data_showed_big_differences_between_how_different_ag-m-11_1459672827371.jpg", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/14/brexit-nhs-health-social-care-disabled-people-eu-referendum", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MDJEWWVZR2I/V2_0QNt32mI/AAAAAAAAC0w/8Xo2ntAk-aoyd6FT51ZWFAv5WT6g1ViiACLcB/s1600/Cio937AU4AICmfk.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/06/what-brexit-means-to-uk-caregivers-and.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nIf you imagine a caregiver at the beginning of a care journey, he or she might be represented as a dot on the map of a neighbourhood. \u00a0She would be surrounded by other dots - neighbours, friends and co-workers. Slowly, as care needs at home increase, the caregiver dot floats further and further away from all the other dots. One day, the caregiver finds herself alone, far from the community she once felt a part of. \n \nIt's at that point the caregiver might wonder how to match up her needs at home with whatever help might exist in the community. Possible choices, people to call, agencies to help... it all seems too much and too vague. It becomes easier to do nothing.  \n \n \n \n \n \nToday, I'm offering you the possibility for a different life: a caregiving life within your community. \u00a0The answer lies in a technology tool designed to coordinate help for caregiving families called  Tyze Personal Networks \u00a0in Canada or  Community Tyze  in the US. \u00a0My idea is this: pick up the phone and call the director of whatever agency supports your family locally. \u00a0It might be the Alzheimer's Association, Easter Seal or the Parkinson's Society. Every illness or disease has an organization that offers information and support to its constituents and most have local offices. If there isn't a disease/disability related association in your area, call the Rotary or Lions Club instead. \n \n \n \n \n \nYou have an opportunity to offer a way for a helping organization to help your family and other caregiving folks in your area to leverage all the good will in your region. Philanthropic groups are always looking for ways to make their dollars work strategically and effectively. \u00a0Buying Tyze for all the families supporting an elder with Alzheimer's in a city, for example, ticks those boxes and more. Here's how it works: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn a nutshell, your local association buys Tyze at a low cost-recovery rate for tech support. This is a non-profit model of support. The association loads the site with information and support resources of their own. They can add announcements of events and contact telephone numbers as well. Local community partners such as restaurants and cinemas can be listed (but remember, this is a secure site with password encoding, so it's not advertising. It's just a list of willing care-partners in your neighborhood). Friends and family are invited to your Tyze network and everyone has access to your updates from home, scheduled appointments and requests for help. There's a calendar to ensure both personal and medical events are tracked. \n \nI've written a lot about  how we use Tyze  in my family. It's a great tool and it's even better if your closest circle of helpers is connected to your primary home care agency or disease-support association. Just write or pick up the phone to make this happen for you and other families sharing similar care challenges in your neck of the woods. \n \n \n IN CANADA:\u00a0 \n \n Tyze Personal Networks \u2013\u00a0 Powered by Saint Elizabeth Health Care \n \n 90 Allstate Parkway, Suite 300 Markham, Ontario Canada L3R 6H3 Email:\u00a0 info@tyze.com \n \n \n \n \n \nIN USA:  \u00a0Community Tyze \u00a0 support@communitytyze.com \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PnO0ObpviOA/V1iLGcxiczI/AAAAAAAACy4/HX43CsSVcIQHBIneGbe_fUblD4IVTorkQCLcB/s1600/importance-of-caregiver-networks.jpg", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://communitytyze.com/", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CLAYmRWCRjs/V1iG5zG9oBI/AAAAAAAACys/LYh-VfIZSJI-quqZOMamjpeoULqmX3QSwCLcB/s1600/tyze-logo.png", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iGf2YYtDrds/V1V0_5YllyI/AAAAAAAACxk/MA6AEXFtexolT6y5Q9L2kNni___HRbFBgCLcB/s1600/Tyze%2Bpamphlet%2Bfor%2Borganizations%2BJune%2B2015%2B%25281%2529.jpg", "mailto:info@tyze.com", "mailto:support@communitytyze.com"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/06/how-local-communities-can-help.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n This Sunday is Father's Day. \u00a0In the realm of disability and family, we talk most often about mothers. \u00a0But today, I would like to say a few words about what it means to appreciate the Dads in our lives. My own father, James Edward Thomson, was a gentle, kind and funny man who was much loved and died too young. \u00a0My Dad was the embodiment of what it meant to be an officer and a gentleman. \u00a0He was a terrific athlete and taught me and my sister how to stick-handle like Jean Beliveau and drive a golf ball 300 yards, or at least keep trying. \u00a0My Dad passed away in 1975 and I still miss him. My husband Jim is like my Dad in some ways. \u00a0He is loyal, clever, hard working and detail oriented. \u00a0Jim helped the children with their math homework when I became mystified by the equations early in their academic careers. \u00a0He reviews Nicholas' health claims and finds extra cash by reading the fine print and closely examining our complicated files. \u00a0Jim feels the heavy responsibility of single-handedly creating the social safety net in our family by making financial, pension and insurance arrangements that will keep all of us safe and worry-free for our lifetimes. He watches hockey games with Nicholas and taught Natalie how to ride her bike. \u00a0He skied with Nicholas when we were members of the \"National Capital Disabled Ski Association\" and he rigged a way for Nick to waterski sitting on a windsurf board with a teenaged helper behind our boat. In her book,\u00a0 \"Love's Labor\", Eva Kittay \u00a0talks about mothering a child with severe disabilities as \"testing the very boundaries of what it means to be a parent\". \u00a0But I would suggest that being a father does that too. \u00a0I know that my husband feels the entire weight of responsibility for our financial wellbeing. \u00a0Today, I want to say thank you to my husband, my own dear father and to all the fathers who inspire and contribute to special needs families today, yesterday and tomorrow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://books.google.ca/books/about/Love_s_Labor.html?id=84CAezBBZBkC&redir_esc=y", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QPWdno9S7u0/T93-AIjOP0I/AAAAAAAAAMM/sLB9qpMm1xI/s1600/familyingrossquare.jpg", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iSSEJojLbgM/V2UB8F-iMRI/AAAAAAAACzk/lGeSLO9HGEsWVOTCEZzWd20vZrKAr9azQCLcB/s1600/earlyfam2%2B%25281%2529.jpg", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xd_A3MHZDYc/V2UCXPmdkxI/AAAAAAAACzs/FNEATbQNMZ07A5_9YyrQ-Wawsw18wxcRQCLcB/s1600/Oldfamilypic%2B%25281%2529.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/06/about-special-dads.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nA Guest Post by Donna Fitzgerald \n \n \n As a\ncaregiver, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve helped to fill out and assisted with mountains of\nimportant paperwork. If you are caring for a loved one or have recently become\nemployed to help care for someone with a debilitating medical condition,\nthere\u2019s a good chance that he or she is no longer able to work due to his or\nher health.  \n \n \n \n When an\nindividual is diagnosed with a mental or physical health condition that is\nexpected to last for at least a year and interferes with his or her ability to\nwork, he or she may be eligible to receive  Social Security\nbenefits  (SSD)\nand as a caregiver, it may be part of your job to help him or her apply for\nbenefits. Here are some things you should know about SSD benefits and some\nhelpful tips when helping file: \n \n Some Things to Know Before Applying \n \n \n \nAlthough millions of Americans apply for SSD benefits every\nyear, many are unaware that the process can be lengthy and often times\ncomplicated. Anyone who may be eligible to receive benefits should apply as\nsoon as possible as the Social Security Administration (SSA) reports that a\nqualifying individual can not receive benefits until the sixth full month of a\ndisability. Additionally, it may take up to a couple of months to hear back\nfrom SSA and whether or not an individual is deemed eligible to receive\nbenefits. Finally (and unfortunately), about two thirds of first time\napplicants are denied, which is important to keep in mind. However, applicants\nhave the opportunity to (and should) appeal their denial, but only have about\ntwo months to do so, therefore it\u2019s important to be organized. \n \n Organizing and Preparation \n \n \n \nWhile there\u2019s never a guarantee that an applicant will\nreceive SSD benefits upon his or her first try, one of the best ways to be\ndeemed eligible is by  submitting accurate and detailed information \nabout medical or employment history. As a caregiver, who most likely attends\nimportant medical appointments with the individual seeking SSD benefits, it\u2019s a\ngood idea to take detailed notes and fill in any gaps by asking questions that\naren\u2019t being asked or answered, but appear to be pertinent information for the\nSSD application.  \n \n Helping with the Application Process \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce you have helped to organize and gather all the\nimportant and relevant information, such as the  residual functional capacity form , you can\nassist with the online application process. It\u2019s important to remember that\neven if you are the preparer (and you may have to answer some questions about\nyourself) that the applicant signs his or her name. Before you submit the\napplication, make sure it has been reviewed carefully and that no information\nis left blank or unfinished. Additionally, make copies of all information you\nsend to SSA and take careful and detailed notes of any conversations that took\nplace with the SSA during the application process.  \n \n \n \nIf, at any point in the application process, things become\nconfusing or you feel like it\u2019s beyond your ability to assist, you can help\nyour applicant set up an appointment with someone at SSA or even consult with a\nlawyer who specializes in SSD benefits. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.marksandharrison.com/ssd-application-process/", "https://www.blogger.com/null", "https://www.blogger.com/null", "https://www.ssa.gov/hlp/radr/10/ovw001-checklist.pdf", "https://www.blogger.com/null", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QxVLs8qiDM0/V2fQwGff_bI/AAAAAAAAC0A/v8m7EK_BiqwoiWUPlhtb6aDxl2qNOMvwACLcB/s1600/istock_000014976213xsmall.jpg", "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/01/steps-to-successfully-apply-for-social-security-disability.html", "https://www.blogger.com/null"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/06/helping-someone-apply-for-social.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nA stranger asks, \"What do you do?\". \u00a0They really mean, 'do you WORK?'. \u00a0When you reply that you care for a loved one, they look past your shoulder, scanning the room for an escape route. At the grocery store, someone you used to know walks by, averting their eyes. \u00a0Conversations with people apart from other caregivers can be difficult and sometimes hurtful. I am a caregiver who has never had a 'proper' job since Nicholas was born twenty-five years ago. I have certain sensitivities and sometimes, I take a chilly greeting personally. During the years when Nicholas was constantly in hospital and often in crisis, I would say this to the doctors: \"I really need you to be nice to me. I mean it.\" I did not know any other way to express the fact that a small slight, a critical gaze, or an unkind word could shatter what bit of resilience I had left to get through the day.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 Eva Kittay recognises this chink in the armor of caregivers because she is one herself (when she is not teaching moral philosophy at SUNY Stony Brook). Eva describes the phenomenon of the 'transparent self' of the caregiver - \u201ca self through whom the needs of another are discerned, a self that, when it looks to gauge its own needs, sees first the needs of another\u201d. Kittay argues that the moral requirements of a dependency relationship make the transparent self indispensable. This labor of love is simultaneously responsive to the needs of others, exhibiting care - it cultivates intimacies and trust between humans. Both care and concern contribute to the sustainability and connectedness fundamental in dependency relationships, but it leaves the caregiver vulnerable. Prolonged transparency of the self can lead to clinical depression at the worst and the absence of empowerment to act on one's own behalf at the least. \n \n \n My clumsy response to being too transparent for too long was to beg those around to 'be nice to me'. Looking a caregiver straight in the eye with real interest (not sympathy) is tonic to the caregiver soul. Asking her (or his) opinion about a shared experience, even if it's what she thinks about the color of the sky - \u00a0demonstrates a respect for that part of the person which is not a caregiver.\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \"What do you do?\" is a question that most caregivers despise. \u00a0Somehow caring for a person you love doesn't stack up alongside occupations like doctor, lawyer or even office manager. New mothers on maternity leave from high powered jobs very often complain that work comrades avoid them or don't include them in professional banter. For long-term caregivers, respectful, authentic and engaging conversation is hard to come by. So, if you happen to overhear someone say \"I just need you to be nice to me\", make eye contact, elicit a few opinions and share a personal reflection. And by all means, don't ask \"What do you do? \u00a0Do you work?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4AqnhSpiMY0/UkNea2KWNpI/AAAAAAAAA_4/SLh5t_mS8Iw/s1600/eminem.jpeg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gU8wgjaomIs/UkNcVj93C-I/AAAAAAAAA_k/tUkc5b25W-Y/s1600/different.jpeg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-POZGe4j4t5E/UkNdPVQ_QQI/AAAAAAAAA_s/YbcRJlnE8yk/s1600/you-are-not-alone45.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/06/a-stranger-asks-so-do-you-work.html", "title": ""},

That's a fancy way of saying that my friend needs assistance to bathe, use the toilet, get dressed, prepare meals and get in and out of bed. \u00a0Recently, troubles with her home care service provider revealed to me what's wrong with home care today. \n \n \n \nA few months ago, the agency providing personal support to my friend began telling her that it would take two people to wash her hair, due to \"the weight of her head\". Medically prescribed treatments would not be given if they were on an 'as needed' basis. Only regularly scheduled treatments during working hours Monday to Friday would be considered acceptable. If my friend had theatre tickets, no one would be available to help with her bedtime routine if it was after 11pm. \u00a0And that was only the beginning of the growing list of rules that make my friend's life unliveable in her own home.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt seems that today, service provider agencies cannot meet the care demands of clients who have higher needs. Shrinking budgets and people with disabilities who are aging into even greater disability are merging with an aging demographic to put unbearable pressure on home care resources. \u00a0Individuals like my friend are faced with the choice of asking family members to provide essential care in order to remain in the community, or to go into a nursing home - an arrangement that comes with  too much  care. I can't figure out the profile of someone whose home care needs CAN be met in my province. Our society has come to this: there is not enough care available at home and there is too much in residential care homes, the only other alternative. Family caregivers are being forced to pick up the slack in order to keep their loved ones at home and offer them a good quality of life. \n \n \n \nLast year I had the privilege of serving on the Ontario Expert Committee on Home and Community Care. We produced a report called  Bringing Care Home  and I'm proud to say that it's full of good ideas and practical solutions to challenges like those faced by my friend. But there are other financial innovations that we need to scale, as well. \u00a0A few months ago, the government of British Columbia raised the asset cap of people receiving disability pensions from $5,000 to $100,000. \u00a0And that's not a typo. \u00a0Now advocates in other provinces of Canada are lobbying their regional governments to follow suit. Having personal financial assets that are tax sheltered (such as in Canada's unique  Registered Disability Savings Plan ) or money earned through employment would not impinge on pension benefits so important for accessing medications and equipment. There are significant costs to having chronic illness or disability and these will never be entirely covered by pension checks. But personal assets combined with a major overhaul of home care provider systems will go some distance to giving people what they need in order to thrive in community. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2f4dhef52o8/VzzRc-dkdAI/AAAAAAAACvg/8jvZUxvD1x0G_DV4_eu8MM9sRE9y9C7MwCLcB/s1600/bigstock-Ball-And-Chain-Isolated-on-whi-77530796.jpg", "http://health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ccac/docs/hcc_report.pdf", "http://www.rdsp.com/", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eQ5GiJnJh5w/VzzSo5d8BNI/AAAAAAAACvo/RgiewrTpoKAW6HmzcIC5Zpr3ZzrxBXCSQCLcB/s1600/Disability-Cuts-Logo-353x265.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/05/the-problem-with-home-care.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nBy Lisa Price, M.D. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen we think of aging, we often think of slowing down,\ngetting tired easily, doing less, and a lesser ability to bounce back from an\nillness or setback. Attributing these issues entirely to aging, however, means we\nare missing what it really is\u2013frailty. Frailty is a collection of health issues\nthat often impact men and women 50 years old and older. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBut while this is associated with aging, thankfully it\u2019s not\na certainty for all older adults. Early identification and intervention is the\nbest way to lessening its impact later in life. \n \n \n \nTo be considered \u201cfrail,\u201d according to the  Journal of American Medical Association ,\none must have three or more of the following: \n \n \n \n-Low Physical Activity \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 Muscle weakness \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Slowed performance \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Fatigue or poor endurance \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Unintentional weight loss \n \n \n \nBy the time an older adult is considered \u201cfrail\u201d and\nexperiencing three or more of these issues, he or she will have a difficult\ntime returning to an improved health status without a lot of work and is at\nincreased risk for institutionalization and even death. Identifying and acting\non this issue is crucial to maintaining and improving health status in older\nadults. \n \n \n \n Working Out \n \n \n \nGetting ahead of the issue is important to stem the body\u2019s\nnatural loss of muscle mass and energy reserve. Prevention is the first step in\nslowing its course. Although most physicians don\u2019t have specific prevention\ntraining, they can take steps to promote exercise among older adults, which\nhelps. \n \n \n \nThere are several ways to age successfully, many of which\nare simple and can be implemented at home with a little help from a physician.\nThese include: \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Eating and drinking well, including following a\nMediterranean diet; \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- \u00a0 Developing an exercise program, including balance\nexercises and strength training; \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- \u00a0 Reviewing medications to ensure all are needed,\nas some contribute to and worsen the condition due to side effects; and \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- \u00a0 Taking note of decline in appetite, weight loss,\nor reduction in physical activity. \u00a0  \n \n- \u00a0Identifying the disorder as early as possible, acting on it\nand planning ahead are strategies to help older adults age successfully. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lisa Price, M.D. is\nChief Medical Officer at Denver-based InnovAge, a provider of health and\nwellness services for older adults in California, Colorado and New Mexico.

{"date": "", "body": "\nThis morning I was scrolling through facebook when a friend's post caught my eye. Eric Fischer is a disability Dad whose son is palliative and very complex. I always read Eric's sensitive and searingly personal writing - you may remember that I reviewed his book of poetry  here. \n \nToday Eric shared a TED talk, \"Healed if Not Cured\" by his son's own palliative care physician, Dr. Ron Sabar. Dr. Sabar's talk originates in Isreal, so the subtitles are in Hebrew. But the talk itself is in English and I urge you to listen. Dr. Sabar shares his insights into what constitutes a good death and his conclusions might surprise you. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe good doctor points a finger at medical practitioners whose own fear of death prevents them from healing and instead impels them to continue seeking cure even when that is futile. Dr. Sabar is not afraid of death. To his patients at their end of life, he says \"Go home. Enjoy the love of your family. Enjoy your last days. We will be there with you to ensure that you are comfortable.\"  \n \nBut I was most interested in the questions that Dr. Sabar asks his patients when they transition from seeking a cure to seeking a good death. He asks three questions: 1) Tell me what you know about your condition 2) Tell me what you're most afraid of and 3) Tell what would make you happy now. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe doctor described a patient he treated who was diagnosed with end stage colon cancer. \u00a0In a darkened hospital room, she lay with her family nearby. She said to the doctor, \"Please help me die. I used to dance. I used to be an academic. Now everything is over and I just want to die.\" Dr. Saba asked her the three questions. \u00a0\"Tell me about your condition.\" As expected, this young scholar knew everything about her disease. \"Tell me what you're most afraid of.\" She didn't want to suffer anymore. \"Tell me what would make you happy now.\" \"To finish my PhD\", she said. \u00a0It turned out that this young woman was only weeks away from finishing her dissertation. Years of research would not form any kind of legacy without completion of her degree. \u00a0So, the doctor said \"Go home and finish your degree. Together, we will do everything we can to give you three good hours a day for a couple of weeks - enough time to finish your work.\" \u00a0This, they did and a few weeks later, the young woman received a letter from the university informing her that her research had been accepted and she was now a Doctor of Philosophy. A couple of days later, she died peacefully. \n \nNot all palliative patients will have unfinished projects. \u00a0Perhaps they would answer question #3 with a wish to visit a family cottage one last time. Or to see an estranged brother in order to settle longstanding differences. These three 'Tell Me' questions are worth asking to any chronically ill or dependent loved one. Anytime. They're especially worth asking at times of transition such as to another level of care or to a new diagnosis. I'm going to visit my Mom today and I'll ask her these questions. On the way home from Mom's I'll stop in at Nick's and I'll ask him too. It's good to check in with people we love and I'm grateful that now I've got the right questions to elicit the important answers. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j4aHnEVlepg/V0GxIfYuHuI/AAAAAAAACwA/rAs23RN8un0ypYXxaGdo1t96rZl2arPqwCLcB/s1600/3Q-logo.001-960x265.png"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/05/healed-if-not-cured-what-good-death.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFamily\ncaregiving: a powerful and touching way for you to give back and express all\nthe hope, love, and support that your loved ones have given you when you were\nyounger. Unfortunately, this type of caregiving is also an often\nunderestimated, unappreciated, and misunderstood calling. With the rising costs\nof long term care and more seniors in need of some sort of support and care,\nthere definitely is a need for  family caregivers \nto step up. But what should these caregivers need to know in order for them to\nprovide the best care for their loved ones? Read on to find out and learn from pointers\nthat will help you be the best caregiver for your family: \n \n \n \n 1.  Determine your needs. \n \n \n \nBefore\nplunging into being a family caregiver, you must first assess yourself. After\nall, family caregiving is a full-time calling, which will affect your daily\nliving and habits. Ask yourself these questions: am I sure that I want to give\nup my career for my family? Will caring for my family be worth all the\nsacrifices (personal time and connections, work opportunities, etc.)? What are\nthe changes I need to adapt to in order to properly care for my loved ones?  \n \n \n \nBy first\nassessing your own care requirements will allow you to then plan and commit to\nthe care tasks; that is called for in being a caregiver. Do this by listing\nactivities (both for you and your loved one) within a given day. Doing so will\nallow you to see the level of care and assistance that you need to\nprovide. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nAs you take\na look at your needs, you will have a clearer picture of what qualities you\nneed to look for and develop in being a caregiver. \n \n \n \n 2. Develop a job description. \n \n \n \nCreate a\ncaregiver\u2019s job description based on your assessed needs to help you get into\nthe persona of being a caregiver. This should include all the tasks that a\ncaregiver needs to carry out. It should also entail the qualifications that a\ncaregiver needs to meet such as certification and certain skills such as\ndriving and cooking.  \n \n \n \nConsidering\nthis calling as a \"job\" will give you the perspective on how a\ncaregiver should act, and if possible, to seek out additional training and\nlearning for care and support as well. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n 3.  \u00a0 Prepare a contract. \n \n \n \nGo the extra\nmile of considering family caregiving as a career option by drafting a\ncontract. In this document, be sure to include the level of care, the kind of\nwork output that is expected of him or her and for how long the contract will\nbe in effect. Also, state how the caregiver will be reprimanded should he or\nshe should violate any of the rules as an employer. This way, you will be able\nto identify potential trouble areas that need to be addressed and for you to\ntransition smoothly in providing proper nursing and support. \n \n 4. Determine whether to go to an agency or hire privately \n \n \n \nThere would\nbe times when even you would need additional help to properly care for your\nfamily. List down potential caregiver services or agencies that may either\nprovide additional help or, if possible, training for you. Aside from having\npotential or emergency help ready to contact to, knowing these caregiver\nservices and agencies can further expose you to the industry, which may then give\nyou an idea on how your loved ones should be treated. \n \n \n \n 5. Conduct an interview \n \n \n \nMake sure\nthat your loved ones are informed of your decision to be their caregiver or care coordinator. In\norder to make better and transparent decisions when it comes to providing support\nand care, you can ask a couple of other family members to help you evaluate\nyour potential as a caregiver or to assign roles in care coordination. \n \n \n \nBefore the\ninterview, allow your loved ones (and other family members) to prepare a set of\nquestions that are related to your skills as a caregiver or care team leader. Have\nthem inquire about work background and your intentions. Be sure to have them\nask all the appropriate questions in order for them (and consequently,\nyourself) to assess if your capabilities are substantial enough for the requirements\nneeded to watch over and care for your family.  \n \n \n \nApart from\nthat, have them also ask them if there are parts of the job description or\ncontract that concern them. If there are, check if you can meet halfway and\nrevise on some areas if it\u2019s too restrictive for you as a caregiver.  \n \n \n \nAgencies\nusually take charge interviewing and screening potential caregivers. In the case of family in-home care, your loved ones conducting an interview will allow your family to\neffectively plan ahead for long term care. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n 6. Ask for references \n \n \n \nAsking the\nright questions is not enough. Evidence of good character and the right skills set is central for the peace of mind of everyone in the family. References are a must in the case of hiring private care. \u00a0In the case of reluctant or estranged parents, it might be worth offering them at least two references that can attest to your own capabilities as a caregiver. It may be awkward, but being transparent and having someone to\nvouch for your intentions may give your loved ones the peace of mind that you\nare committed in pursuing this calling and sometimes, applying a business plan to tricky family situations can help to give everyone confidence and comfort. \n \n \n \n 7. Always be on guard \n \n \n \n Being a\nfamily caregiver isn\u2019t a walk in the park  \u2013 this is why there is a need for\nyou to motivate your loved ones to constantly give you feedback on how you\nwatch and care for them. This way, you and your family can closely monitor if\nyou are delivering a good quality of care. It would be better if you develop a\nsystem on how to determine if your loved ones are being cared for adequately.\nDiscuss this with your family.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Samantha Stein is an Online Content Manager for  ALTCP.org  whose works focuses on long term care insurance, finance, elder care and retirement.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Maria is a frequent guest blogger here at The Caregivers' Living Room. Today, I'm thrilled that she's chosen to write about driverless cars, largely because my Mom wants one - badly. This innovation will be transformative for the elderly and people with disabilities or mobility impairments. Driverless cars? Bring them on! \n \n \n \nDriverless cars are on the horizon and coming with them are\na multitude of benefits. Aside from being the ultimate transportation\nconvenience, autonomous cars are energy efficient, very safe and will enable\npassengers to multi-task to get the most out of their busy days. However,\nperhaps the population they would most benefit would be the elderly and the\ndisabled.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis new generation of cars would be able to transport the\nelderly and disabled virtually anywhere, efficiently and safely, without your\nloved one having to control the wheel at all. Through a combination of sensors,\nalgorithms and GPS tracking, driverless cars can sense exactly where they are\nand what is around them, making them able to avoid obstacles on the road. They\nwill be able to slow down for pedestrians and  detect objects up to two\nfootball fields away . Additionally, seniors will be able to call for an\nUber-like automated taxi to take them to a specified location. This will change\nthe lives of those who have to wait for someone to give them a ride to get out\nof the house. Even seniors with mild dementia can navigate riding in a car that\nhas a pre-set destination. \n \n \n \nThe elderly are already being served by electronic home\nsystems such as emergency alerts, motion detectors, and  home\nautomation  for climate control and appliances. A recent report predicted\nthat driverless cars will reduce road accidents by  nearly\n90 percent , just by taking human error out of the equation. Having your\nelderly loved one driven around by a driverless car is going to be not only\nconvenient but also quite safe. \n \n \n \nOne other positive to come from self-driving cars is that\nthey are energy efficient and wouldn\u2019t use dirty resources like oil and gas\nlike traditional cars.  Energy\ncompanies in Alberta  have calculated that fuel savings will be around 20\npercent just from more efficient driving with less unnecessary stops and\nstarts. If driverless cars were all electric vehicles, that savings could reach\nup to 94 percent. Because driverless cars would ideally all be electric, cities\nwould have to include charging stations. There is even a prototype of roadways\nthat automatically charge the vehicles as they drive over them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEventually, the driverless phenomenon will extend to homes\nand businesses with mini-vans and big rigs that transport goods via the\nhighways. But for now, the people who may benefit the most are the disabled and\nelderly. Auto-driving, self-parking vehicles will give them the mobility and\nfreedom they need for a fulfilling life. General Motors has already invested\n$500 million in ride-sharing service Lyft for  a\nfleet of self-driving vehicles . \n \n \n \nOf course, there are obstacles along the way to becoming a\ndriverless society. Self-driving vehicles will have to deal with unforeseen\nproblems like road work, bikers, detours, accidents and traffic lights that\naren't working. The biggest challenge may be getting driverless cars on the\nroad along with so many automobiles driven by humans with their built-in\ndriving impairments like distractions and emotions. \n \n \n \nHowever, all of these challenges are being met and the\nfuture of automated cars seems certain to be bright. Having automobiles on\ndemand is more efficient than having an automobile for each member of the\nfamily. Adults caring for elderly parents will be able to call for a ride\ninstead of taking off of work for their parents' doctor's appointments. Best of\nall, the elderly and disabled will gain a mobility that they didn't have when\nthey had to rely on others for transportation. \n \n \n \n Maria is a freelance writer currently living in Chicago.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nMy Mom is 94 and prone to falling, so I am pleased to host this important guest post by a regular guest blogger here at the Caregivers' Living Room. Thank you, Maria! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFalls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injuries\namong the elderly, according to the  Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention . Falls can lead to broken bones, head\ninjuries and other serious physical trauma that is more difficult for the\nelderly to recover from than the average fall victim. Making sure that an\nelderly loved one doesn't fall is one of the most difficult requirements of\ncaregiving. Even a vigilant caregiver may not be able to stick around at all\ntimes to prevent a fall. Fortunately, fall prevention technology is a growing\nindustry that offers helpful ways to reduce the likelihood of a fall.  \n \n \n \nNew developments in senior care have improved the lives of\nseniors as well as their loved ones. The use of fall prevention technology not\nonly reduces the risk of a fall but allows seniors to live independently for\nlonger. These technologies can also be used to give caregivers peace of mind\nwhen they are not around.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Shoe Sensors \n \n \n \nShoe sensors are a popular form of senior monitoring\ntechnology. These sensors are embedded into \u201csmart slippers\u201d and they detect\nchanges in a person\u2019s foot movement, transmitting a signal to a doctor or\ncaregiver if there is cause for alarm. Although this technology isn\u2019t on the\nmarket right now, there has been talk of more information being available about\nAT&T\u2019s  smart\nslipper prototype  in the near future. \n \n \n \n Carpet Sensors \n \n \n \nCarpet sensors work similarly, but they sense changes in\nmovement without requiring that the patient remembers to put on shoes. Sensors\ninside the carpet monitor the amount of pressure being exerted on the floor. If\na senior falls, the increase in pressure will trigger an alert that allows\nassistance to come. Carpet sensors also measure the stress on the bridges of\nthe foot and can detect the weight and location of any object that hits the\nfloor. \n \n \n \n Security Systems \n \n \n \nSecurity systems installed in the home can alert caregivers\nif a patient with dementia tries to leave the home. Many systems offer various\ncomponents and attributes that would aid in your senior\u2019s well-being, which you\ncan learn more about through different  websites .\nIt is common for elderly patients who suffer from  dementia \nor confusion due to traumatic brain injuries to attempt to wander in the middle\nof the night. Wandering can be emotionally traumatic and lead to injuries, so\nit is important that caregivers are notified as soon as a door or window is\nopened. \n \n \n \n Wearable Technology \n \n \n \n Wearable\ntechnology  scaled down to the size of a button can be used to detect\nwhether the wearer is sitting, standing or walking. An Australian company has\nmanufactured a necklace with a built-in sensor that helps build the reflexes of\nthe wearer so he or she falls in a safer way if an accident occurs. Seniors can\nuse a video game console to play a simple training game that helps improve\nreflexes and prevent the likelihood of a fall. Personal airbags have also been\nintroduced as a potential solution for making falls less damaging when they\noccur.  \n \n \n \n Medical Alert Systems \n \n \n \nMedical alert systems can help independent seniors contact\nemergency services if an emergency occurs. Many of these devices are compact\nand can be worn around the neck or held as a button to push in case of a fall.  Medical\nalert systems  are ideal for situations in which a senior may be unable to\nreach a phone to call for help. These devices also contain GPS to locate an\ninjured senior who does not know where they are. \n \n \n \nFall prevention technology may not be perfect, but a stream\nof innovative entrepreneurs and researchers are creating lively competition for\ncompanies who seek to make the world safer for seniors. By adopting one or more\nof these fall prevention technology options, caregivers can reduce the\nlikelihood that a patient will fall and significantly decrease the risk of\ndeath or serious injury if a fall does occur.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nIt's my pleasure to host this guest post. The topic interests me particularly because recently, we had future planning discussions and tours of local senior care homes with my Mom. In the end, we decided to continue supporting Mom in her independent retirement community, even though her needs are increasing. For the time being, she chooses to pay privately to supplement her care. Having these discussions and knowing what's out there in the way of options though, was a really helpful exercise for our whole family. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Senior Living\nConsiderations \n \n As any person ages, their needs and\nphysical abilities may change. For this reason, it is prudent to consider some\nalternative living situations to accommodate lifestyle, disabilities, and\npersonal preferences. From living in a like-minded senior community to staying\nin the family home, there are some things to consider when helping your loved\none make these tough decisions.  \n \n Caregivers should consider the\nfollowing when trying to help a senior facing a possible move: \n \n \n \n The benefits of living in a senior community.  \n \n A senior\ncommunity allows residents to be with individuals who are at the same stage of\nlife, which could foster engagement and promote socialization. There's a\nfeeling of community, security and safety found in these senior living residences that\nother apartments, condos, or subdivisions may not provide. Even seniors that\nare reluctant to move may take some comfort in a senior living community. Some\nother perks of taking up residence in a senior community include the following: \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Avoiding isolation with close\nneighbors and supports. \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Staying active and engaged with\nlike-minded individuals. \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Living with more ease and simplicity\nin a downsized situation.  \n \n \n \n Considerations for living in an independent living home. \n \n When asked, many seniors remain firm on the fact that they want\nto live independently in their own home. Downsizing to a more manageable sized\nresidence could be a practical way to make this work, or some simple strategies\ncould make the family dwelling safer and more secure for those that choose to\nremain there.  \n \n Consider the\nfollowing questions when helping a senior make decisions regarding their\ncurrent home: \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Where do they live? Is the location\nof the current home practical and is the floorplan design flexible for changing mobility needs? Be sure that the senior has access to the\nservices, providers, and places that they need. Also, be sure to make an\ninventory of the current home to determine what, if any, work needs to be done\nor modifications that should be made to make the home safe for those living\nthere.  \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n What are the accommodations? Does\nthe home have the things the senior will need? From beds to ramps, be sure that\nthe home suits the seniors need, while providing them full-access to the\nbathroom, mailbox, kitchen, or other areas of the home.  \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Are there any activities or amenities?\nWhat types of services are nearby? Make sure that the senior lives in proximity\nto markets, recreation facilities, providers, and caregivers. For instance, be certain that your\nsenior loved one will have easy access to public transportation if they do not drive. \n \n \n \n Some other things to think about.  \n \n Another option is an assisted-living facility that provides on site nursing care for residents who are recuperating from an injury or who have physical limitations. These accommodations might be short-term housing during recovery, or longer-term living situations for\nseniors who need this level of care.  \n \n Many innovative care communities are adopting a step-down approach which incorporates independent\nliving options with assisted and skilled-nursing models. These rooms or apartments are on\nthe same property, so an individual who needs a bit more help is able to get\nit without leaving his familiar community. Many older individuals worry that\nan extended stay in a nursing home or hospital may result in them losing their\nhome. \u00a0This step-down model eliminates this concern and ensures that residents\nwill be able to live on the premise for the rest of their lives, which brings a\nsense of security in the fact that they won\u2019t ever need to move again.  \n \n Talk with your\nloved one about their wishes and where they want to spend their golden years.\nFrom independent living to a senior community, options abound based on the\nresident\u2019s age, physical needs, and personal preferences. Clarify what the\nsenior sees as the most pragmatic option and listen when they verbalize\nconcerns. Tours of various dwellings and facilities may help to put some minds\nat ease during this process.  \n \n \n \n Author Bio: \n \n \n \nDaniel Lofaso is the Community\nOutreach Manager for Lourdes Noreen Mckeen, a retirement and  independent living facility \nin West Palm Beach, FL. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5ROZ8ZzBaeI/Vyey_NGFKgI/AAAAAAAACtM/NSU5ViuZVJErLjZx2nIxjeALfIaGDK9_wCLcB/s1600/senior-living-west-palm-beach.jpg", "http://lourdesmckeen.org/independent-living/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/05/senior-living-considerations.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the moment of birth, there is suddenly stillness and a\ncollective intake of breath. There is recognition by everyone that a momentous\nand transformative event has taken place \u2013 a miracle. \u00a0  A new baby is placed on a mother\u2019s breast and\nlife begins. This is the baby\u2019s first caring relationship and it represents the\nsacred and pure headwaters of every other caring relationship that will come\nlater on in life. \u00a0  At the moment of birth\nand the days following, it is the mother who is the producer and director of\nthis delicate and vital dance. She teaches the first and most important lesson\nin being human: basic trust. \n \n \n \nAs the baby grows, a mother shares her love and care with\nothers. \u00a0  The family and the network\nbegin. In the earliest days after birth, the father and inner circle of loved\nones will ensure that the mother is unburdened by concerns other than those of her\nbaby. Everyone understands that mother-baby bonding, nursing and close physical\ncontact is of central importance to the health and wellbeing of these two principal\nplayers who have been through so much together in the gestation and birth\nprocess. \n \n \n \nAs weeks pass, care is shared and others develop their own\nclose, caring relationships with baby. \u00a0  A\ndifferent family configuration begins to settle into familiarity with a new\nmember in it. Roles shift and change.  \n \n \n \nThe mother retains a central role. She is the vigilant\nworrier, the multi-tasker \u2013 she remembers shoe sizes, food preferences and\nschool assignment due dates. \u00a0  As children\ngrow to teenagers, she might become a confessor and confidante. All of these\nroles, she assumes on the basis of need and love. Need and love \u2013 that is the\ncurrency of motherhood.  \n \n \n \nIf a mother is lucky enough to welcome grandchildren into\nher life, she will join the helpful inner circle of loved ones whose role is to\nsupport the new mother and baby. A new life cycle begins. \n \n \n \nWhen a mother gets old and needs help, need and love begin\ntheir exchange activity again, but differently. Who is helping whom may have\nreversed, but new lessons are being taught and learned.  \n \n \n \nMothers are the warp and weft of our most important, loving\nrelationships in life. Their work is vital and central to all we know about how\nto live a life that is rich in the love of friends and family.  \n \n \n \nHappy Mother\u2019s Day, Everyone! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dwOuoOeNn9I/Vy34QAgtNhI/AAAAAAAACtk/oCVDZONw0B4pStlFnspbh3KLUJ6ZM71swCLcB/s1600/podaaqjpoo.jpg", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aLaWy9Aofg/Vy34vKEqlNI/AAAAAAAACto/7xpptSB5MLQM4OqDqDYck4QS29ewfptmwCLcB/s1600/Momandmerose.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/05/motherhood-currency-of-need-and-love.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Almost three weeks ago, my husband Jim and I\nwent to hear the author  Dr. James Doty speak about his book Into the Magic Shop \nat the Ottawa Writers Festival. I\u2019ve been thinking about the talk ever since.\nJim Doty was a poor and angry 12 year old who walked into a magic shop one\nday in his California desert hometown. A woman, Ruth, sat behind the cash register\nand began speaking to him in a way that no adult had ever done before. She\noffered to teach young Jim Doty secrets and lessons that would change his life\nforever. \u00a0  What Ruth taught Jim in their\ndaily conversations over the period of six weeks all those years ago was mindfulness\nand the connection between the brain and the heart. \u00a0  Jim was a good student and Ruth\u2019s lessons led\nhim to forgive his alcoholic father and his depressed, disabled mother. He\nbegan to imagine a future for himself that was full of possibilities. Doty became a professor of neurosurgery at Stanford University and subsequently founded the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education at Stanford. \u00a0  James Doty\u2019s story is a rollercoaster ride\nbetween ignorance and knowledge \u2013 he has loved and lost many times and with\neach crash, Ruth\u2019s lessons have shown him the path back to authentic happiness\nand the balance between aspiration, humility, compassion and confidence.  \n \n \n \n A week after that book talk, Prince died. I am\na fan of Prince\u2019s music \u2013 I\u2019ve always had to turn it up and dance when one of\nhis hits came on the radio. But I\u2019m a boomer, not a child of the 80\u2019s who grew\nup with his songs as markers my personal memory book. \u00a0  Nevertheless, I have become a little bit\nobsessed with his life and work over the past couple of weeks. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Prince was a young boy when he decided to\nbecome the best rock musician in the world. He learned to play every instrument and\nhe honed his vocal talent, too. \u00a0  He\nwanted to be the best at every aspect of his performing art and he was. One time, someone asked Eric Clapton what it was like to be the best guitarist in the\nworld. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, he answered, \u201cask Prince.\u201d Why have I been so moved by\nthe passing of this diminutive musical genius? I\u2019ve been asking myself that\nquestion and I think it\u2019s because he, like James Doty, reinvented the idea of\ngrand possibility in his life and he dared other artists to follow him in the\nchurch of fearlessness. \u00a0  As one pundit on\nCBC radio said recently, \u201cPrince understood the power of the profane and the\nsacred. He knew that ecstasy was part sex, part holy and part excellence. And\nhe believed in God \u2013 he knew there was a greater power.\u201d \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Watch Prince blow up the stage at about 3:30 in\nthis tribute to George Harrison in 2004. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And at the SuperBowl half-time show in 2007,\norganizers were frantic that the monsoon-force rains would make performing\nimpossible for Prince and his dancers. \u201cCan you make it rain harder?\u201d was the\nartist\u2019s response. Watch this!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n So what does a book about a magic shop and a\nrecently deceased rock and roll performer have to do with caregiving?  \n \n \n \n First, they are both inspiring, but that answer is\ntoo simple. They\u2019ve mastered their craft to such an extent that they can move\nfearlessly and without boundaries into territory that is 100% grit, joy and\ndespair. That is our caregiver territory of human drama, generosity and hairpin turns of\nemotion. \n \n \n \n Service providers should watch Prince\u2019s\nperformances and think about excellence. They should think about innovation and\nabout bravery.  \n \n \n \n And what can we caregivers do with these\nlessons in living out loud other than watch videos and read good books?  \n \n \n \n Paolo Coehlomight have some answers in his novel, The Witch of Portobello . \u00a0  The liner notes read:  How do we find the\ncourage to always be true to ourselves\u2014even if we are unsure of whom we are? \n \nThat is the central question of international bestselling author Paulo Coelho's\nprofound new work,\u00a0 The Witch of Portobello . It's the story of a\nmysterious woman named Athena, told by the many who knew her well\u2014or hardly at\nall. \n \n \n \n Coelho\u2019s Athena is a contemporary witch who\ndevelops a cult following when she begins to teach people how to live more\njoyfully and mindfully. \u00a0  \u201cUse your left\nhand for a day if you are right-handed\u201d, she advises. \u00a0  \u201cDance purposefully off the beat of the\nmusic.\u201d \u00a0 Athena advises her friend: \u201cWhat do you want?\nYou can't want to be happy, because that's too easy and too boring. You can't\nwant only to love, because that's impossible. What do you want? You want to\njustify your life, to live it as intensely as possible. That is at once a trap\nand a source of ecstasy. Try to be alert to that danger and experience the joy\nand the adventure of being that woman who is beyond the image reflected in the\nmirror.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cHow do we find the courage to always be true\nto ourselves \u2013 even if we are unsure of who we are?\u201d is an important question\nfor all humans, but it\u2019s especially urgent for caregivers. \u00a0  Often, we lose sight of who we are as we tend\nto the needs of loved ones. Can mining around good books and the lives of extraordinary\nperforming artists teach us something about living out loud in the quiet of our\nhomes? I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m definitely going to practice\nRuth-from-the-magic-shop\u2019s lessons to find out and I\u2019m going to put on Prince\nand turn up the volume. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kUpRJukLXyc/VyTQW37W67I/AAAAAAAACs8/sZoqbEBEiwggirh_H-I9-KLXIQNYCHH9ACLcB/s1600/51cjzFQElSL._SX331_BO1%252C204%252C203%252C200_.jpg", "http://intothemagicshop.com/buy", "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816720.The_Witch_Of_Portobello", "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816720.The_Witch_Of_Portobello"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/04/prince-magic-shop-and-witch.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Every caregiver has a worst fear - a nightmare scenario that unfolds like an unwanted, sinister guest in the imagination. \u00a0It might be triggered by the sound of an unusual thud upstairs, a front door slamming, or the smell of burning toast. \u00a0In my case, it's the telephone. \u00a0When Nicholas was very young, the treatment team suggested that he attend a special school for children with disabilities. \u00a0The intensive therapy on offer sold us on the idea and so, one day, a yellow school bus arrived at our front door. \u00a0I remember Nick's tiny face, contorted in a silent scream behind the \u00a0bus window. \u00a0It was raining that day and I cried too. I sat down for a cup of coffee in the unfamiliar silence and peacefulness of our house. \u00a0A little while later, the telephone rang. \u00a0\"It's the school here. \u00a0Nicholas has had a seizure and the ambulance has been called. \u00a0He is still not responsive, but he is breathing.\" \u00a0\"I don't understand\", I repeated dumbly, \"Nicholas doesn't have seizures.\" \u00a0But he did have one that day and we have now come to accept that our boy has epilepsy, amongst his other disabling conditions. After that, I startled whenever the phone rang. \u00a0I dreaded speaking on the phone and feared answering each call.\u00a0 Years later, Jim and I were sitting at our dinner table with Jim's sister and her husband. \u00a0We were laughing about something when the phone rang. \u00a0It was Jean, my mother in law. \u00a0\"Great!\" I thought, \"we can all chat on the phone together\". \u00a0But Jean was calling from the hospital. \u00a0She had fallen on an icy street and had broken her hip. \u00a0Her life would never be the same. Last summer, Jim and I were at our family cottage in the Quebec Laurentians. \u00a0The end of a long, lazy beach day was broken by the telephone ringing. \u00a0It was an unfamiliar voice from Nicholas' residence - Nick had choked - he had stopped breathing - for 15 seconds or so - ambulance called - Nick was now breathing but unresponsive. \u00a0I searched for the car keys and left my wet bathing suit lying on the floor. I drove through frustratingly slow country roads, many made even slower by summer construction. \u00a0Two hours later, I walked into Nick's emergency room bay to find the doctor assessing my young man. \u00a0Nick looked like himself, just a little flushed in his cheeks, but with pale lips. \u00a0A chest X-Ray showed nothing worrisome and so, he was discharged. Still trembling, I pushed Nick out into the evening light. I still hate the telephone. \u00a0I much prefer email with its considered questions and answers. \u00a0I worry when I laugh at someone's joke in the company of adults - I am relaxed and happy, but suddenly a telephone ringing silences me. \u00a0I feel chastised and wary.\u00a0 Everyone who gives care to a loved one who is vulnerable will have a deep-seated fear of losing control and somehow failing to protect their charge. \u00a0Those whose caregiving responsibilities test the very boundaries of human compassion will have well-founded fears that dog their every waking moment. \u00a0We all have our demons. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B5mSn8qqgOM/Vw1Qi1TY01I/AAAAAAAACrM/7zMPWubcto4nH99o_whwgMI6b9UdWAEIgCLcB/s1600/Emergency-Sign.vu_.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/04/my-caregiver-worst-fear.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nYesterday I was listening to an artist on the radio. \u00a0I was in the car and I was travelling only a short distance, so I don't even know who this artist is or what they produced, but I was captured by this, \"I wanted to explore grief and how we either turn away from it or we look it right in the face.\" \n \nI began to think about turning away from grief and what that might lead anyone to do, especially caregivers. Self-medicating exhaustion and sadness in our society usually equates to a glass of wine (or three) or it equates to eating foods that are high in sugar or fat. \u00a0These treats at the end of the day offer us temporary satisfaction and in the case of alcohol, the promise of a duller pain. \u00a0These enticements can become a daily form of respite. \n \nI'm not talking about preaching to persuade people to give up the rewards that give pleasure at the end of a hard day. Rather, I thought it was interesting to consider whether sometimes over-indulging in self-medicating with food and booze could be a form of turning away from grief. And what's the end result if we do that day after day over years? \n \nWhat would happen exactly if we decided to look grief squarely in the eye? Would that change anything?  \u00a0Julie Keon, author of the wonderful \"What I Would Tell You\"  has this to say: \n \"Grief can be our silent companion, something to be tended and nurtured. Think of grief as a person knocking on your door who really wants to see you. They knock incessantly...When the knocking starts, instead of hiding, you can take a deep breath and welcome this person into your home...\u00a0 You set a few reasonable boundaries as to how much time you have to give and then you put the kettle on.\u00a0 You settle in for some hot tea and conversation. As the visit progresses, you notice it isn't as bad as you thought it would be. You are discovering that this person you had always hidden from is wise and has much to offer.\" \n \nSometimes the choices we make represent the way we manage our deepest emotions. There's nothing wrong with wine or chocolate cake (two of my favourite things). But they can become bad friends if they entice you into the abyss of despair. The next time I feel at my worst, I am going to re-read Julie's words and consider how I manage grief in my own life. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vohCIAg_5L4/VxtgjfAZ4yI/AAAAAAAACsE/WkdoKe83_c0ltEP5iuY3Z3yYZ7sNBz7YgCLcB/s1600/Black_Feather.jpg", "http://www.whatiwouldtellyou.com/book-preorder/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/04/are-bad-habits-your-way-of-getting.html", "title": ""},

I find that defining moments such as this one are met with the\u00a0 building of a relationship with many types of emotions. The adjustment to a new way of living can be colorful if I allow for the accessibility to it. However, in the months after my caregiving responsibilities came to a close and my father's loss was more palpable, describing my experience as one that was swaddled in joy seemed misguided and implausible.\u00a0I had\u00a0invariably conformed to thinking that joy was an emphatic state of bliss that\u00a0overcomes our being. But I have since realized that authentic joy for me is wandering in and with the extensions of all of my experiences.\u00a0 I now diagnose the circumstances surrounding and ingrained profoundly within my caregiving story as moments full of agony, curiosity and revelation--all of which have generously reached out to the hand of joy. Yes, unrelenting joy. \n \n \n \n One evening, my father needed assistance putting on his shoes. He was in a power chair, as his mobility and balance were considerably limited to bend down and take on what he had once experienced as a simple daily action.\u00a0 He gently pointed to the pale brown slippers directly in front of his feet and looked at me holding a gaze of appreciation.\u00a0 I delicately placed his slippers on his feet and he placed his hand on my head- a gesture that showed his respect for me.\u00a0 In a world that is full of complexities, joy finds its way to those quiet, uncomplicated moments. It is attainable even in times that ask us to succumb to despair. \n \n \n \n Part of my discovery was ceasing any of my prior beliefs in how it should present itself. Joy paved the way from unforeseen circumstances to a worldly purpose. It is the undercurrent of what runs my creative process. It is full of blessed moments that are filled with sorrow and elation as it opens up a conversation with myself and humanity. As I took more time to indulge in it, it blew through what I had once considered \"my story\" and redirected my energy to listen to the many stories of others who walked a path similar to mine and whose unique and diverse accounts have only elevated my gratitude for community. \n \n \n \n Joy shows up to give each beginning and each ending the comfort of peace, as a way to expand our mind and live courageously in every incredible span of transformation. And in the recognition of this, I gladly show up for joy too. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.priyasoni.net/#!home/oniv6", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hiI9SodYg-E/VwwZMWcQD9I/AAAAAAAACq8/sQuJnmUFnoARZ6KSWVSRRsf1w4zYu3jGw/s1600/Priya.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/04/the-infallible-presence-of-joy.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \nI thought it was time for an update on what's been going on with me. Since Christmas, it's been busy! Here's what I've been up to: \n \nMy husband Jim and I went down to Cat Island in the Bahamas for a few weeks. Every year we stay at a little stone cottage on the beach called  The Point House . \u00a0We love Cat - it's very undeveloped, populated by a few (deeply wonderful) friends, with breathtaking scenery. It was a perfect place to rest, read and work on my  new book . \u00a0Thank goodness for the internet - we skyped Nick and Mom every day. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAhhh, the new book! My co-author  Vickie Cammack  and I have been religious about chatting on a weekly basis to refine ideas, talk about structure and keep the project moving and growing. \u00a0I've published snippets that we've written, but here is a statement of our purpose: \n \n \n What is this book about? \u00a0Human caring relationships are the subject of this book; their fragility, their strength, and their meaning.\u00a0 Natural care is like clean air or water. We can\u2019t live without it and we expect it to be there when we need it. But we don\u2019t teach it, value it or support it. Family caregivers are struggling and families are even collapsing under the weight of picking up after overtaxed health and social care systems. What is the future of families and of living and dying at home?\u00a0 This book is a clear-eyed deep-dive into the present and future of our most precious national resource: loving care. \n \n \n \n \n \n What is the central thesis? \u00a0\u00a0 Care is love in action. It is a source of wisdom, comfort, growth and meaning.\u00a0 This kind of loving care must function within the realities of burden, obligation and efficiency, but it reaches far beyond. Care is a precious and fragile resource that can and must be taught, nurtured and supported. Three ways to do this are: embracing the language of care, valuing the knowledge of care and fostering new relational approaches to caregiving. The valuing and supporting of care in families will ensure that everyone may reap the benefits of giving and receiving care across the lifespan now and in the future. \n \nBefore leaving for our southern sojourn, I worked on a  new health navigator program at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario . Complex care parents said they needed help coordinating resources and assistance in and out of hospital, so two parent navigators were hired to complement the roles of system navigator and knowledge navigator. Finding a way around health, education, recreation, social services, government and local systems for complex families is so mind-bendingly impossible that three types of navigators work together to ease the way. It's all brand new and I helped out by writing the training protocols, orientation and resource materials for the parent navigators. Everyone hopes this model will help families. \n \nFor the past couple of years, I've had the pleasure of sitting on the board of  NeuroDevNet , a  Network of Centres of Excellence (NCE ). NeuroDevNet is the entity that disseminates Canadian federal government money for research in the area of neurodevelopmental disabilities in children (autism, CP and FASD). I represent the voice of patients and families. It's been great fun to learn about research and my involvement with the universities led me to participate in a kind of dragon's den competition for major government funding of a three year project looking at the life course of children with brain based neurodevelopmental disabilities. Our project is called Child Bright and WE WON! You can read all about it  HERE . \u00a0Work will begin in earnest soon and I'm looking forward to the excitement, optimism and camaraderie that Child Bright will bring to my life. \n \nA couple of days ago, I opened my inbox and found an exciting message from Mark Stolow, the CEO of  The Caregiver Network . \u00a0He and I had tossed around an idea for a podcast on advocacy for caregivers and I've recently learned that Mark got funded for the project, so it's a go! I teach advocacy to caregivers on a fairly regular basis, but I've never done an online presentation, so I'm looking forward to this new opportunity. \n \nI continue to support  Tyze Personal Networks  (called  Community Tyze  in the USA), an online tool to coordinate the help of friends, extended families and paid supports in the lives of caregiving families. In our family, we use Tyze to coordinate our caregiving - I don't know how we'd cope without it. \n \nThe really important news is, of course about my family. \u00a0We are all doing pretty well, but there's been a few bumps in the road with Nick lately. \u00a0Right now, he has the flu. I'm going over this afternoon to give him some TLC - he's had a fever, sore throat and lethargy for the past week or so. We're watching him carefully because we know that a mild flu could turn sinister and even life-threatening very quickly in his case. \u00a0Mom is doing well, but she's slowing down a lot. I went to Montreal yesterday to visit, bring her new nightgowns, a maple fudge cake and homemade brownies (her favourite) and bring her out for a haircut and blow dry. \u00a0We had a lovely visit with lots of laughs. \u00a0Her regular and beloved helper Glenna broke her wrist recently, so my sister and I are picking up the slack and making sure that Mom has plenty of smokes and rum (if you read my blog regularly, you'll know my Mom)! \n \nAll in all, I feel blessed every day by the love in my family and by the opportunities I have to make a positive difference in the lives of family caregivers. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fernandezbayvillage.com/", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eObn3QKXS6Q/Vwe66bdd_mI/AAAAAAAACqc/qbSoyfYb5BIOl8yoteaMAKvnORQdd4Mcw/s1600/MomIpad.jpg", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nGw1WGtVIS4/Vwe7nMIqAPI/AAAAAAAACqk/MTbMyG8uxg0ao-jyx9wIsebIIdWK4iZ-w/s1600/lodge-from-water.jpg", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickie-cammack-9523908", "http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/cheo-unveils-pilot-support-project-for-families-with-chronically-ill-children", "http://neurodevnet.ca/", "http://www.nce-rce.gc.ca/index_eng.asp", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/muhc-research-network-1.3515592", "http://thecaregivernetwork.ca/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://communitytyze.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/04/an-update-on-me.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n I wrote this article for Today's Kids in Motion Magazine and it appeared  HERE . It's written for an audience of parents of children with disabilities, but the advocacy principles apply to all caregivers.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They say it takes a village to raise a child,\nbut in today\u2019s climate of government austerity and private consumerism, where\nare all the compassionate villagers?\u00a0 Is\nit possible for families to successfully galvanize community supports to help\nthem raise a child with disabilities?\u00a0 The\nanswer is YES, if they borrow strategies from professional lobbyists to\ninfluence government agencies, community leaders and neighbourhood resources. \n \n \n \n There are four things that parents of children\nwith disabilities have in common 1) They are exhausted, 2) They are on at least\none waiting list for help with family needs 3) They probably haven\u2019t had a real\nbreak since their child was born and 4) They fear the future because they know\nthey can\u2019t survive the long term with the first three realities. \u00a0  Most families know they should advocate for\nhelp with care at home, but they don\u2019t know where to begin.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n WHY ADVOCATE? \n \n Parents of children with disabilities perform\nthousands of small tasks every day. \u00a0  Each\ntask in itself seems perfectly doable, but over time, parents can be worn down\nby the weight of caring and constantly seeking support. \u00a0  Engaging in a coordinated advocacy effort to\naccess help at home might just seem like one more thing to do, but it\u2019s worth\nit \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to do it alone.  \u00a0 In fact, a team of committed family members,\nfriends and community members can do it with you. \n \n \n \n \n \n The\nbuilding blocks of advocacy are: ANALYZING what help you already have that is\nhelpful, IDENTIFYING what kind of help you need, RESEARCHING the community for\nsources of direct help as well as people to help you advocate, CULTIVATING a\nchampion within your target organization, and EXECUTING your request under\nwinning conditions. Professional lobbyists use these techniques to influence\ngovernment \u2013 families can use them too.  \n \n \n \n WHAT DO YOU HAVE?  \n To begin advocating for care, it's important to\nunderstand the 'givens', or what you already have in the way of support. \u00a0Knowing\nwhat kinds of help are actually helpful to your family is the first step in\ndeciding what you need.  A\nfriend who takes ALL your children for a sleepover is one kind of informal\nsupport that may be truly helpful. \u00a0  A\nweekend half-day respite programme for your special needs child (formal\nsupport) might be too far away, making it more bother than it\u2019s worth. \u00a0  Begin by assessing what kind of assistance\nyou have for the whole family currently and decide what kinds of help are\nhelpful for YOU. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n WHAT ARE YOUR TASKS CURRENTLY? \n \n Next, make a list of\ndaily tasks that you carry out for your family\u2019s care and wellbeing, putting a\nstar beside those tasks you would assign to an outside person, in an ideal\nworld. \u00a0  Some families find a weekend away\nmost rejuvenating, while others may seek after-school or dinnertime help. \u00a0  If a child with disabilities is often ill,\nparents may wish to spend time at the hospital bedside. \u00a0  That means assistance with other children and\npets at home. \n \n \n \n WHAT HELP DO YOU NEED AND WHO CAN HELP YOU GET IT? \n \n Parenting a child\nwith disabilities is an isolating experience. \u00a0\n So it\u2019s important to survey the local community in detail - this means Googling\nyour neighbourhood or city. \u00a0  There might\nbe a community group, church committee, high school club or neighbour who could\nprovide support. \u00a0  And that support could\nbe in the form of helping to create a strong advocacy \u2018team\u2019. \u00a0  Local community centres have a mandate to\nsupport healthy families and most high school students must complete volunteer\nhours in order to graduate. \u00a0  Remember,\nyou are searching for both places that might offer programming AND people who\ncould help you advocate. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n At this stage, an\nadvocacy goal for home help should be formed. \u00a0\n It might be, \u201cone weekend per month respite for my child with\ndisabilities\u201d. \u00a0  Or it could be, \u201ca\nteenager to help with homework after school so that I can make dinner.\u201d \u00a0  Families of older children may be seeking to\nplan future supported housing arrangements. \u00a0\n Whatever the advocacy goal, a group of family and skilled friends will\nbe required to pull together as a team to locate resources and advocate for\nsolutions.  \n \n \n \n THE STRATEGIC INQUIRY \n \n Once an agency or\nresource organization has been identified as an advocacy target, an information\nprocess called a \u2018strategic inquiry\u2019 begins. \u00a0\n This process involves seeking advice, developing a deep understanding of\n\u2018who\u2019s who\u2019 in the organization and building a relationship with key\nplayers. \u00a0  The objective of the strategic\ninquiry is developing a clear understanding  their \nobjectives. \u00a0  For example, if respite\nmeans having someone with nursing skills for your child, the advocacy target\nmay be the local medical college. \u00a0  A cold\ncall to the office of the Director to ask about getting help into your home\nmight not be successful. \u00a0  But, an\ninformation gathering appointment (with you or someone who has agreed to help\nyou advocate) will very likely reveal some strategic next steps. \u00a0  An appointment to ask advice could be the\nfirst step in cultivating a senior official to be \u2018your champion\u2019 within the\ntarget organization. \u00a0  He or she will\nrepresent your family\u2019s interests when budgets are being decided and\nprogramming decisions are made. \n \n \n \n ORGANIZE WHAT YOU LEARN - THE BRIEFING NOTE \n \n Nominate someone on\nyour team to be the record keeper for your advocacy effort. \u00a0  Their job will be to organize copies of\nimportant background documents such as medical reports, meeting notes and\ncontact details for all concerned. \u00a0  Your\nteam secretary will also produce a document called a \u2018briefing note\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s\njust a fancy name for a handy, bullet-point advocacy tool. \u00a0  The briefing note should include a few\nsentences introducing your child with disabilities and the key supporters in\nhis or her life, such as family members, special friends and anyone else who is\nactive in supporting your child. \u00a0  A list\nof needs and supports in point form is next, followed by a brief story or\nanecdote to illustrate your situation and needs. \u00a0  Finally, there\u2019s a list of questions with\nlots of space for note taking during meetings with your potential sources of\nassistance. \u00a0  Sample questions might be,\n\u201cWhat advice do you have for our family? \u00a0\n How have others dealt with similar situations? \u00a0  Who else can I speak with about our\nrequest? \u00a0  What can we do for\nfollow-up?\u201d \u00a0  After the meeting, don\u2019t\nforget to drop an email to say thank you \u2013 in advocacy, a polite expression of\ngratitude is worth its weight in gold. \n \n \n \n \n \n Good practice in advocacy will not guarantee\noutcomes, but it  will  deliver greater\nopportunities for success.\u00a0 And that\u2019s\nvital, because going without help at home over the long term is not a healthy\nfuture plan for any family.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://publications.todayskids.ca/publication/?i=166165&p=4", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xmMZfSUpssU/Vw_50-6waJI/AAAAAAAACrg/Ge-jw9Ks-7MSd8E7MrWbJ_Fj1xlGWA3hACLcB/s1600/images%2B%25281%2529.jpeg", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-slWvzs4J06s/Vw_6I5KkBpI/AAAAAAAACrk/26J5ZhoI9ocmjBV41w3qyt6-llWfhFCGACLcB/s1600/advocacy-street-sign-concept-illustration-design-over-white-54352409.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/04/advocate-now-to-get-help-you-need.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nFor the past couple of weeks, we haven't used our front door. \u00a0We enter and exit through the garage so we don't disturb the temporary home of a young family of purple finches nesting in our porch light. We don't turn on the light on either, because there's a Mama sitting on her eggs directly under the bulb. \u00a0As Jim jokes, we don't want boiled eggs or fried chicken! \n \n \n \n \n \nThese birds hold a powerful memory for me. They've nested before and I remember watching them intently in the days when Nicholas was struggling hard with illness and pain. At that time, they were my companions and my reminder that life pushes forward outside of my own four walls. \u00a0Here is what I wrote about my my solitude and my front door visitors in my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n I remember reading a film review in the newspaper. I never actually saw\nthe film and I cannot even recall its name. But the reviewer\u2019s words are still\nwith me today. The film was about a convent somewhere in Europe. A young nun\ncomplained about having to wash dishes and scrub pots. The Mother Superior\nchastised her, saying, \u201cThere is meaning in those dishes, in the act of\nscrubbing.\u201d As the reviewer said, the film was a testament to the idea that the\nextraordinary exists within the ordinary; that the entire moral universe can be\nfound in the mundane tasks of everyday life. This sense of wholeness and\nconnectedness is what I found in my garden. \n \n \n \n \u00a0Outside our front door in\nOttawa, we had a black wrought-iron openwork light fixture. Each spring, a pair\nof tiny sparrow-like birds called purple finches came to nest in our lamp. The first\nyear they came, all their bits of straw and string simply fell through the mesh\nonto the ground. Annoyed by the mess, we swept up and thought nothing more of\nit until one day, there on the ground lay two tiny, broken bright blue eggs. I\nwept a little, berating myself for not understanding their simple need to have\na safe nest for their offspring. \n \n The next year when we heard their distinctive chirps at the door, Jim\ncut some bits of cedar and created a floor on the base of the lamp. Nest building\nbegan in earnest, and soon there were four tiny eggs tucked up amongst downy\nroan feathers. That year, I watched as the mum kept her eggs warm and the\nfather worried nearby. The eggs eventually hatched into a noisy quartet of open\nbeaks and soon enough they were ready to fly. I sat an entire day, watching in\nsuspenseful anticipation as every finch in the area arrived on our pine tree\nto begin \u201ctraining\u201d with the youngsters. By turns, each bird would fly to the\ntop of the lamp, perch there for a second and fly off to the nearby branch. The\nyoung birds had a tricky rite of passage: they had to fly inside the lamp and\nexit through a narrow passage at the top of the ironwork. By dusk, all the\nbirds had left the nest and we could finally turn on the light and resume our\nlife without our temporary tenants.  \n \n These birds living in my midst, nurtured by us and by the rest of the\nflock, gave me a certain antidote against loneliness. I had genuine curiosity\nabout the life in my garden and most certainly, felt \u201csome minute, divine spark\ninside me.\u201d By this time I had given up on any idea of justice or natural order\nin the world. Contained in my garden, I thought, there is transcendence; there\nis grace. I began to think that peeling potatoes, raking leaves and mixing\ncakes were all a sort of prayer. I began to understand that to be free, I had\nto have an antidote to despair. \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Theodore Zeldin writes\nabout how some people have acquired immunity to loneliness in his book An Intimate History of Humanity. [i]  In fact,\none of his themes is actually called \u201cLoneliness as an Obstacle to Freedom,\u201d\nwhich of course speaks directly to me, given that I am discussing my family\u2019s \u201cFreedom\nto Be.\u201d Being the mother of a child with multiple disabilities is, by\ndefinition, a very lonely life. Nicholas\u2019 illness, mobility challenges and\ncommunication difficulties never made us top of the guest list at friends\u2019 and\nneighbours\u2019 homes. When his health deteriorated and pain became our constant\nenemy, we hardly ever spoke to anyone save health professionals. I had\nwonderful friends and an extraordinarily supportive family, but I found it\nimpossible to share the gut-wrenching worry that seemed so exclusive to our\nlittle family. Zeldin talks about the fear of loneliness as being a great\nbarrier to personal freedom. He observes that those who have overcome a fear of\nloneliness have done so through experiencing a solitary lifestyle, whether by\nchoice or even by incarceration. But he also says, \u201cThe final form of\nimmunisation has been achieved by thinking that the world is not just a vast,\nfrightening wilderness, that some kind of order is discernible in it, and that\nthe individual, however insignificant, contains echoes of that coherence. People\nwho believe in some supernatural power have their loneliness mitigated by the\nsense that, despite all the misfortunes that overwhelm them, there is some\nminute divine spark inside them.\u201d  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n [i]  Theodore Zeldin,  An Intimate History of Humanity  (London:\nVintage, 1998), p. 68. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ms1QJ3EgBpY/VyIGHhMiJzI/AAAAAAAACsc/LUdVQOUUNkgswJeTE3JRNd0hByZ-SgRMQCLcB/s1600/thumbnail_IMG_0733.jpg", "http://houseofanansi.com/search?type=product&q=The+Four+Walls+of+My+Freedom", "https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1489173439865061632#_edn1", "https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1489173439865061632#_ednref1"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/04/the-divine-spark-inside-me.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n 4 Tips for Finding Quality Nursing Home Care \nGuest Post by Andrew Egan \n \n \n \n Nursing homes or assisted living facilities can help take care of ailing family members or loved ones. At their best, nursing homes can provide a valuable service and essential care during a difficult time. Unfortunately, many nursing homes cut corners, neglect residents, and, in some cases, deliberately abuse those under their care. \n \n \n Avoiding this nightmare scenario should be a top priority for anyone seeking an assisted living facility. With some research and attention, it is possible to identify red flags associated with  nursing home abuse . \n \n.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow to Pick the Right Assisted Living Facility \n \n \n \n \n Transitioning a person into a nursing home is difficult for everyone involved. All too often, people rush through the process in order to reduce the awkwardness and pain, like ripping off a band aid. This can lead to some dangerous oversights that can lower the quality of life of a family member or loved one. When deciding on a specific facility, follow these tips to ensure the highest care possible. \n \n \n \n \n \nAsk Current Residents of a Prospective Nursing Home \n \n \n \n \n Visit any long term elder care facility you plan to placing someone. It is common to give tours to family members and friends of prospective residents. While visiting, make sure to sit down and ask other residents about their experience. Ask anything you would be concerned about when moving into a nursing home. How is the food? How do you spend your time? Do you like the other residents? Also, be careful to observe the interaction between patients and staff. Are the residents forcing politeness and smiles? Are they comfortable with their caretakers? This is less precise than direct questions to other residents but it can help determine if they are genuinely happy in a particular environment. \n \n \n \n \n \nCheck with Your State Attorney General \n \n \n \n \n Nursing home complaints are often field with your state\u2019s Attorney General office. Though facilities that violate the law are ultimately shuttered, building cases against nursing homes and assisted living facilities can take some time. Contacting your attorney general office for complaints against a particular nursing home can prevent you from making a major mistake.  \n \n Try Some of the Food \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Food quality is a simple issue that can dramatically change a person\u2019s mood and overall outlook. When visiting a prospective assisted living facility, try some of the food. Determine the quality, flavor, and healthiness. Obviously, not all people are registered dieticians but common sense can be a powerful ally when evaluating nursing homes. Small portions of bad food does not bode well for the quality of care residents receive at a particular facility. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCheck the Daily Schedule \n \n \n \n \n This is one of the easier ways to gauge the quality of a nursing home and its staff. How are the residents spending their time? A quality facility will have a bevy of daily activities for their residents and patients to engage in. Engagement in a variety of activities on a regular basis, such as line dancing, bingo, or arts and crafts classes, will help with mental acuity and overall health. \n \n Andrew Egan is a Houston-based writer focusing on nursing home abuse and elder law. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://wbnursinghomeabuselawyers.com/", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JCDU-BwXDyk/VvhMcol87HI/AAAAAAAACoc/v3EobSwKpLUd_N10umerZUE55S2SyCG6w/s1600/Nursing_home_corridor.JPG", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-juC2wGHL0Z0/VvhMiAT_3JI/AAAAAAAACog/DT2dcAnR3XgSi6KGYiPzVic6F8dGoF-iA/s1600/download.jpeg", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CYhmDH97WzU/VvhOAkkAhpI/AAAAAAAACos/cF8W-VGWd987ygiVgE9dgdL6H6XgtDFCg/s1600/d88016772ca04807c56f410afaf16405.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/03/assessing-quality-and-safety-of-nursing.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \nFrom time to time, I host guest writers on my blog. \u00a0Today, young caregiver Henry Kingston shares his story. Thanks for reading and sharing! Donna \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MY FAMILY STORY \n \n \n \nMy father was my best friend as he was very well aware of my\nlife inside out. He never scolded me even when I was entirely unreasonable and\nthat\u2019s why I could never let my father down. My Father George Kingston was a depressed\nand anxious child. In his later years, my father suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s and\nhe believed I\u00a0was like his mother. \u00a0\n This was the most unbearable fact of my life. My mother was the kindest\nand most giving woman I have ever known but she wasn\u2019t physically stable at\nthat time, so I became my father\u2019s primary caregiver. \n \u00a0 \n \nWhen I got to know that my father had Alzheimer\u2019s, I was in severe\nshock as I had no clue what this disease was about. Later when I did some\nresearch, I got to know some awful facts about this disease which actually\nbrought tears to my eyes and fear to my heart.  Alzheimer's\ndisease  can last up to 15 years and sometimes longer, which can make a\npatient get really fed up of what he is going through and that\u2019s when\ndepression kicks in even more. Alzheimer is a very devastating disease. In my\nfather\u2019s case, it went unnoticed for 9 years. In the second stage, he was\ntotally aware of what he was going through and got angry at himself quite often\nas he wasn\u2019t able to remember what he said. \u00a0\n The third stage for him was a bit more relaxing as my father didn\u2019t\nremember that he was going through Alzheimer\u2019s and it no longer bothered him.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease can last up to 10 to 15 years and in my fathers case, it\nlasted 13.5 years. Sadly, he passed away two years ago due to a severe heart attack. \n \n \n \n MEMORIES \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOne fine afternoon, My dad was in his condo watching his\nfavorite movie and all of a sudden when I entered the room, I saw a frightful\nlook on his face. His eyes were opened wide. He started yelling at the top of\nhis lungs, \u201cLEAVE ME ALONE!\u201d \n \n \n \nI was standing in the corner in a dilemma, not knowing what\nwas happening or what to do. I felt really helpless looking at my father in such a state of mind, but it really kicked in as I\nrealised how my dad was looking up to me for care and that gave me a bit of a\nboost too and made me realise that i shall stand up to his expectations no\nmatter what it takes. I ran to my dad and held his shivering body really tight. I asked him calmly \u201cDad what\u2019s wrong?\u201d He said strange\ncreatures had intruded.\u00a0I never saw anyone so scared and anxious.\u00a0 He was shivering and crying helplessly. The pressure on my mother was quite devastating. I sent her\nto L.A for\u00a0four months to spend some time with my sister. \n \n \n \n \n \nI feel glad that I was lucky\u00a0enough to spare time for\nhis caregiving, cooking for him and hoping to make him feel better. I used to\nbuy his  favorite\nmovies  and his favorite foods to make him feel as good as I could, which\nseemed to help. That\u2019s when I felt really good about the fact that my dad was\nrecovering and I was able to manage things and stand up to his expectations. That\nfeeling had no sufficient words to describe and I really feel good about what I\ncould do for my father. It eventually made me feel like a proud son, I will\nalways be proud of myself as I do realise how vital a role my parents played in\nmy own upbringing. I will always be thankful to God for making me so strong\nthat I could stand by my dad in those harsh times.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHenry Kingston is a passionate blogger and loves writing.

{"date": "", "body": "\nLast week I agreed to lead a fall workshop on the subject of caring for the caregiver. I proposed exploring the premise and possibility of matching a self-caring action with each caring action we perform for a loved one. An example might be to nurture myself by making myself a cup of tea as I dispense a tube feed to Nick. Or putting my favourite music on in the car as I shop for my Mom. I was wondering about the possibility of intentionally incorporating self-caring actions into everyday caregiving life. \n \nAll this seemed like the beginnings of a good idea until I listened to the astonishing  BBC Essay series 'Crisis in Care' by author and journalist Madeleine Bunting . \u00a0Her razor-sharp dissection of the reasons why society does not value care made me question whether it's even possible for caregivers to care for ourselves in such a murky sea of worthlessness. Bunting cites the systematic cultural and historical devaluing of care that has culminated in labelling those who need care as well those who give it as \"losers who cannot achieve by making something of themselves.\" Anyone in a caring relationship hearing that statement and feeling some sting of truth will be hard pressed to construct a personal, guilt-free narrative that reconciles the demands of home and work. \n \n \n \n \n \nBunting begins her five part lecture series by exploring the roots and definitions of 'care'. \u00a0What IS care and how is it different from healing or curing? Can it be taught? Where does it belong - in hospitals or at home? The speaker settles on a definition that centres on a willingness to be present with suffering, not recoiling from it. Also central to care is LOVE. Think of the wording of marriage vows. \u00a0And yet. We are not educated to care, in fact caring has become counter-cultural. We are impatient and bored by giving care. \u00a0But care is also central to our idea of home and security. \u00a0Clearly, care is a complicated business in today's world. \n \nThe good news is that evidence tells us that the vast majority of caregivers feel it is a privilege to be in a caring relationship with a loved one. They report experiencing a powerful sense of shared humanity. \n \nOur society is fuelled by values of individualism, independence and achievement - all values that are incompatible with care. But there are rumblings in the women's movement, in eldercare, in health care and in exploding caregiver communities that signal we are near the tipping point of sustainability. \u00a0We will continue to undervalue care at our peril, individually and collectively. If lose the capacity to care for each other in families, our world is in trouble. \n \nSo, with this background of looming crisis, can we care for ourselves? \u00a0Yes, I think so. I believe that our growing numbers can provide ammunition for a cultural shift towards placing care at the heart of our ideas of sustainability and survival as a species. We must be ambassadors for the GOOD in caring and we can begin by caring for ourselves as we care for others. We must model what healthy caring relationships look like, for ourselves, our children, our colleagues, friends and neighbours. Otherwise, the future is unthinkable. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b073b0y1", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u7-RmsP1-ws/Vu4KFQIhb4I/AAAAAAAACnw/5EWpPCNSVSUwg5xTLhsSpCnlFNUU6cjBg/s1600/download.jpeg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/03/can-we-care-for-ourselves-if-we-dont.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nLoving care is valuable and  Evan Carp  can prove it. \u00a0He's the 'Emperor of Snuggles', the founder and CEO of  The Snuggle Buddies , a professional cuddling service. \n \n \n \n \n \nPaid cuddling services are popping up everywhere. \u00a0They are clearly filling a void in society; it seems lots of people in the world are not getting their quota of cuddles from their nearest and dearest. \u00a0Or perhaps 'cuddling with no strings attached' is a new manifestation of the 'me' generation... I'm still pondering that. \n \nThis morning I read a  fascinating profile  of leaders in the new cuddling industry. \u00a0It turns out that professional cuddlers have a lot in common with caregivers. \u00a0We know the power of touch and we intuit opportunities for the sharing of fears and memories. \u00a0Caregivers are the mining engineers in the complex business of being deeply human. \u00a0But professional cuddlers get paid $80 an hour - that's just one of the differences between us. \n \nIt's no wonder that artists are interested in exploring the meaning of cuddling, too. \u00a0Here's a review of a 'play' that appeared at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in the summer of 2011. \u00a0Titled  \"The Pleasure of Being: Washing, Feeding, Holding...\" , it consists of one actor and one audience member - and yes, it is played out in silence and involves the actor bathing the audience member (bathing suits required), followed by a long session of holding and being held. \n \n Here is the\u00a0 review from the Edinburgh Fringe : \n \n \n This one-on-one hotel room experience is Adrian Howells\u2019 attempt at total care for a single audience member. It starts with a warm bath filled with rose petals. I undress and step in. \u2018It\u2019s my honour to bathe you,\u2019 Howells says, with no hint of insincerity. He lathers up a sponge and starts to wash my face, torso, arms and legs. Afterwards I\u2019m wrapped in a dressing gown and taken to a pre-prepared duvet nest for a snuggling session. \n \n \n \n \n \n It makes you realise that in adult life most individuals don\u2019t get the opportunity to be truly pampered. I could book into a spa, but after I\u2019d received an all-over body scrub it\u2019s unlikely it would be followed by 15 minutes of tender cuddling. Also, Howells seems to be saying, some people don\u2019t receive any cuddling at all in their lives: not from a professional, not from a partner, not from a parent. His offer is a rare half-hour of someone\u2019s undivided attention and affection. An experience of almost unconditional love that feels like it could be a form of modern therapy for the isolated individual. \n \n But, I think to myself, as I\u2019m lying in the bath covered in petals, there has to be a catch. Everyone brings to this show his or her own set of connotations. I bring a healthy amount of reviewer\u2019s cynicism. I wanted to give myself up to the pleasure and warmth of human contact. But I didn\u2019t feel loved, or even decadent. I thought, instead, of a time when I might not be able to wash myself any more. I thought of my elderly grandparents, and how my parents used to bathe them. That love was truly unconditional. This is just a simulation \u2013 a performance. \n \n Or is it? I don\u2019t for a second feel as if Howells is playing a part. When he hugs me goodbye it\u2019s a real hug. I think about him repeating these intimate moments over and over. Giving away something so much more significant than a therapist \u2013 giving away what feels like a two-way emotional connection for the price of a Fringe ticket. Is he doing it purely for the thrill of participatory theatre, or for deeper reasons? \n \n There\u2019s a moment when I\u2019m lying against his chest when I remember what it was like to be a kid. But this memory jars against the reality of what\u2019s happening. As a child I felt safe because my parents looked after me, and their reasons for doing so were the simplest on earth. In this setting I\u2019m not quite sure what Howells\u2019 reasons are. \n \n Perhaps I should have asked him. But the time seems to run out very quickly. Howells makes it clear that there\u2019s no wrong way of experiencing The Pleasure of Being \u2026 It\u2019s true that your enjoyment of it will depend on what you bring to it. What\u2019s certain is that the show (if you can call it that) creates an incredibly knotted and intriguing performer/audience relationship. I don\u2019t leave feeling relaxed, but I do leave questioning my own definition of the performance, which is testament to how bold and unique this is as a piece of creative work. \n \nCurrently, I'm co-writing a new book with my friend and colleague,  Vickie Cammack . \u00a0We are seeking to define and articulate the inherent skills and wisdom of caring. \u00a0As I said to Vickie last week, \"It's like when a new mother knows the difference between her baby's tired cry and his hungry cry - these skills are often minimized or considered to be private and not really valuable.\" Caregivers are knowledge-keepers and how to give and receive deep comfort in cuddling is one aspect of our sage wisdom. \u00a0There's a booming business in professional snugglers. \u00a0Let's remember our value the next time we hug our loved ones. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/officialtsb", "http://thesnugglebuddies.com/", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MlYaVfIPjqo/VsskVLNmb6I/AAAAAAAAClg/smZCDd2U9yE/s1600/MmQ1MDljNjI1YiMvQ2l2VkUyNlBDOWlqUWM3TzBhSDlISVVhZzlvPS8weDE2MDo5MDB4NjkwLzkwMHg1MzAvZmlsdGVyczpxdWFsaXR5KDcwKS9odHRwOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9wb2xpY3ltaWMtaW1hZ2VzLzk4aWptYnRha2pnaXV6dHBwdHg1Znh6YnZudDgzbTdla3FicW5kcnZya2I1aHdkc3FuNGM2ZGJq.jpg", "http://mic.com/articles/126926/i-went-under-the-sheets-of-new-york-s-pro-cuddling-industry-here-s-what-i-found#.pxQMRtM4Q", "https://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/37152-the-pleasure-of-being-washing-feeding-holding/", "http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/37152-the-pleasure-of-being-washing-feeding-holding/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TiVaTgRYLkU/UFZkShsUqJI/AAAAAAAAAWw/1FJizZMSaxI/s1600/adrianhowellsthepleasureofbeingbyniallwalker-067-lst088212-1.jpg", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickie-cammack-9523908"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/02/the-allure-of-professional-cuddlers.html", "title": ""},

BAD FRIENDS For caregivers, there are two common types of toxic friends; the troll and the narcissist. \u00a0The troll is someone who calls and visits often. \u00a0He or she will ask many questions about your loved one and may even visit in hospital to chat over coffee or lunch. \u00a0They will appear warm and concerned, while inquiring into the minutiae of your loved one's symptoms and treatments. \u00a0This type of toxic friend does not offer help of any kind. \u00a0They simply want to\u00a0 know . \u00a0The human drama of a caregiver's life provides vicarious interest and fodder for their dinner table chat, but that is all. \u00a0This type of friend cannot make the intellectual leap between listening to your experience and offering to sit with your loved one or doing your grocery shopping. The second type of bad friend is the narcissist. \n \n Narcissists rarely, if ever, ask how you or your loved is doing. \u00a0They are bored by others' experiences, so constantly direct the conversation back to themselves. \u00a0No matter how difficult a caregiver's situation may be, it will always be worse for a narcissist - and despite their healthy family status, they will want you to listen and sympathise. GOOD FRIENDS \n \n Caregivers soon find out that longstanding friendships don't necessarily translate into good friendships when the going gets tough. \u00a0Some lifelong friends do show their loyalty and generosity, while others suddenly become too busy to call or drop by. \u00a0The messy and often sad events in caregivers' lives may be too difficult for some people to witness and absorb. \u00a0The fact is, not everyone is cut out for helping others through the toughest times. The trick is to determine quickly who will be a good friend for the long haul and who may be limited in their ability to walk with you through your caregiving journey. \u00a0Wise and experienced caregivers will advise forgiveness in the case of friends who disappear upon hearing your loved one's diagnosis. \u00a0Holding on to bitter feelings will only make it more difficult to spot new friends who genuinely want to help. The\u00a0 extraordinary \u00a0friend is one who intuits your needs, listens without judgement, visits often and always brings food. \u00a0The\u00a0 new \u00a0friend is an acquaintance who, upon hearing that you are giving care, offers help that is truly helpful. \u00a0The kindness of new friends is always a surprise - often the most helpful friends are those you would least expect. \u00a0Whether a good friend is old or new, it is clear that your friends are those who truly want to help. \u00a0Friends will want to give what they can. \u00a0Some may not cook, but their keen wit can suddenly flip fear into hilarity - that is a gift to a caregiver. KEEPING FRIENDS Caregivers have the obligation of reciprocating friendship, too. \u00a0Most often, this means saying thank you. \u00a0The sincere expression of gratitude is not a sign of weakness or evidence that the caregiver is miserably incapable of handling a loved one's needs independently. \u00a0The gracious acceptance of help and friendship in the full knowledge that love flows both ways, is the key here. \u00a0Good friends say, \u00a0\"You must be so tired. Here, let me help you.\" \u00a0That's just what good friends do.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nA Wonderful Guest Post by Ron Burg of  alreadyhomecare.com . \u00a0Check out these new tech products for seniors and caregivers. Thank you, Ron! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As\nyour parents and loved ones age, younger generations in the family are often\nleft worried about the care and well-being of their elderly. Forcing your\nparent to pack his/her bags and enter a nursing home can seem cold. Plus, just\nbecause your parent(s) may need some extra assistance, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean\nan over-packed and understaffed nursing home would be of help.  \n \n \n \n Perhaps\nyou could stop by your loved one\u2019s house a few times a week to help with daily\nduties and tasks. However, if you live far away, you know this is not always a\nviable option. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Determining how\nto properly assist your aging loved one can cause plenty of stress and\nemotional turmoil in your life. You want to help, but you do not want to\noverstep any boundaries or take away your parents\u2019 autonomy.  \n \n \n \n But, on the\nother hand, if your parents truly need assistance in their daily lives, you\nhave to take some sort of measures. While, for some, moving either yourself or\nyour parent across a state or the country is reasonable, for others that is\njust not in the cards.  \n \n \n \n So, what are you\nto do?  \n \n \n \n In today\u2019s\never-evolving tech-savvy world, the answer could be much simpler than you\npreviously thought. A slew of new tech innovations intends to keep the elderly\nhealthy and connected with loved ones, without them moving or entering a\nnursing home. \n \n \n \n New Technology on the Rise \n \n Technology is\nnot just for the sake of having a cool new toy to play with (although we all\nremember how cool it was to hold our first iPhone), but it should change and\naffect (positively) people\u2019s lives.  \n \n \n \n Technology\nadvancements in the medical field have greatly extended the average life span\nfor Americans. In fact, much of the baby boomer generation can expect to live\ninto their 80s. \n \n \n \n Along with\nimproving the medical field, new innovations in technology have also affected\nthe way families cope with their elderly. It is no surprise that loved ones\nwill shell out big bucks to ensure their elderly family members are safe and\nhealthy for the later portion of their lives.  \n \n \n \n That hasn\u2019t\nchanged in many years; what has changed, though, are the caregiving products\nthey are spending money on. New start-ups, and app developers and technologies\nare shifting their focus to an audience that was ignored for some time \u2013 the\nelderly, but Silicon Valley is ignoring them no more! Tech start-ups are\ndeveloping products and apps targeted for seniors at lightning speeds. These\napps aim to keep the elderly generation healthy and living independently for a\nlonger period of time.  \n \n \n \n Interesting,\nright? What is even more exciting are the amazing ways in which some of these\ndeveloping apps can change senior living. Here is a round-up of the biggest and\nbrightest in new technology-driven devices and programs aimed at senior\ncitizens: \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n Aging 2.0 \n \n Aging2.0  makes it their mission to improve the lives of seniors around the world by\naccelerating innovative platforms. Started out of San Francisco, California,\nthe team behind  Aging 2.0 , educates, supports, and brings together all those\ninnovators, designers, entrepreneurs, care providers, and investors of apps and\nnew technology for the elder community.  \n \n \n \n This\nplatform brings together all of those companies and start-ups that create the\nprograms and apps that help seniors lead a more independent life. They are\nworth mentioning because without this key platform a lot of the apps and\ncompanies that are out there to better assist the elderly probably would not\nexist.  \n \n \n \n Aging2.0  focuses on opportunities, health and lifestyle wellness, overall design,\nand the mission of the company for their members. They have more than 30\nchapters around the world. The program regularly holds events, summits, and expos\nthat bring the ideas which companies have to the forefront of technology.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n Lively \n \n Another\nbeauty from San Francisco, (it is the tech capital of the U.S. after all!)\nLively is an emergency medical alert system that reaches far more than the old\n\u201cI\u2019ve fallen and can\u2019t get up\u201d systems.  \n \n \n \n No\nhome internet connection or phone line is required. All one has to do is plug\nthe hub into a power outlet, place activity sensors around the house, activate\nthe account, and wear the watch.  \n \n \n \n The\nwatch is waterproof, has a large, clear display, and comes with bands that\ninterchange. When activated, the orange help button makes a call to the  Lively \nCare Team. The watch configures the time automatically, detects if the wearer\nfalls, and sends medication reminders.  \n \n \n \n Lively \nprovides loved ones of the elderly with peace of mind. The activity sensors can\nbe placed on the refrigerator, pillbox, front door, and anywhere else to sense\nany abnormalities. If something is detected, the care team then contacts the\nloved ones who are listed as emergency contacts. This system allows for seniors\nto continue living in their homes without constant worry and nagging from\nfamily members. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n BrainAid \n \n BrainAid \nis a mobile tool that boosts cognitive capabilities with which the elderly,\nveterans, and those who have suffered a brain injury are more inclined to\nstruggle. The mobile \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d allows seniors to get more done by\nthemselves and improves multitasking abilities. The mobile device is designed\nto help those who suffer from cognitive disorders, without taking away his or her\nautonomy.  \n \n \n \n BrainAid \nhelps those who have trouble remembering appointments, getting to places on\ntime, adjusting their schedule around life\u2019s interruptions, taking medications\non time, and completing small tasks. \n \n \n \n The\nsystem runs on a mobile device and goes with you throughout your day, giving\nyou a \u201cnudge\u201d when you need it.  BrainAid  keeps you on track with time and\nmedicine, without putting that burden on loved ones.  \n \n \n \n Family\nmembers and caregivers can access this information through the BrainAid\n\u201cCircle\u201d dashboard online. It will map out if the device is currently being\nworn, how many steps have been taken, the last time that anything was opened\n(such as the pillbox and refrigerator), and it will send out notifications via\ntext or email.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n Sabi  \n \n An\ninteresting and much-needed change to the 65-year-and-older market,  Sabi \nchanges the design of much-needed products like canes and pillboxes. A young\nentrepreneur saw a lack of appeal, interest, and overall design with these type\nof products.  \n \n \n \n Gone\nare the days of gray, drab looking canes.  Sabi\u2019s products  come in bright, fresh\ncolors and eliminate the shame that has been put into these products for so\nlong. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Lift Hero  \n \n A\ncompany based out of The Bay Area, California,  Lift Hero  is a service that\nprovides the elderly with trusted drivers to assist seniors with their daily\nerrands. A grandson who was concerned when his grandmother lost her license\nstarted  Lift Hero . The goal of the company is to provide non-emergency\ntransportation to seniors that feel like service a family member would provide\nthem. \n \n \n \n The\nservice recruits quality drivers who are trained and experienced. The cars used\nare the personal cars of the drivers, which allows seniors to depend on\ntrustworthy, reliable transportation.  \n \n \n \n Scheduling\na ride is simple, and the service provides options to view the trip in real\ntime, and it sends alerts and reminders that are easy to personalize.  \n \n \n \n What is so\nrefreshing about these tools are that they aim to keep seniors active and\nrelevant in means of communication. Often, with older methods of assisted care,\nthe elderly\u2019s independence and dignity are stripped.  \n \n \n \n These start-ups\naspire to let seniors\u2019 opinions be heard and for them to continue their\nindependent living as much as possible. The apps are great tools for family and\ncaregivers to check on their loved ones and feel safe that they are taken care\nof, while at the same time giving seniors the respect of space and self-sufficiency.\n \n \n \n \n Another awesome\naspect of these start-ups? They come from a place of love and concern of how to\nbetter support seniors. These entrepreneurs are not just creating products they\nthink are best to aid the elderly, but are asking seniors for input, asking\nquestions, figuring out how technology can best serve them.  \n \n \n \n Plus, most of\nthese new app ideas came from real life experience with the designer\u2019s\ngrandparents and parents. They saw a big need in the industry and now are\nstriving to fill it. The innovators don\u2019t want to fill the need of human\ninteractions, but rather to make everyday life easier and to give seniors the\nability to continue to actively participate. \n \n \n \n It\u2019s safe to say\nthe continuation of these and like-minded products and apps can surely improve\nthe quality of life for your elderly loved one, when they are alone and when\nyou two are together.  \n \n \n \n The Elderly  \n \n While having a\nlonger life span is something to be happy about, the trouble comes when\nlearning how to cope with a whole generation who can live longer, healthier\nlives than the generation before them. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Just because\npeople are healthier overall does not mean certain cognitive processes don\u2019t\nslow down. The most common cognitive disorders that occur during a normal aging\nprocess are:  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \u201cFluid\u201d\nintelligence is an intellectual ability that is not based on experience or\neducation. These tend to decline with age.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n A\ncommon misconception is that memory loss happens to all of us as we age. Recent\nmemory, meaning the formation of new memories, is more vulnerable to aging,\nwhile memory or recollection of past events stays the same. \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n The\nelderly often experience difficulty with paying attention to multiple different\nthings at the same time, such as talking on the phone while preparing dinner. \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Language\nis something that affects aging brains and which people often see as memory\nloss. Our vocabulary and knowledge of names, places, etc. are not necessarily\nlost, but one\u2019s easy ability to recall and receive this information is slowed\nas he/she ages.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Reasoning\nand problem solving takes longer for the elderly if the problem or dilemma is\nnot a usual occurrence. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Aging\nminds take longer to process information than before, in earlier life. This\ndoes not mean that your loved one can\u2019t do a certain task; it just means it\ntakes him/her longer to do it. This is something to keep in mind! \n \n \n \n When this\nhappens, small things such as keeping a tidy house, keeping up with personal\nhygiene, and staying sociable with others tend to decline. It is best that you\nknow what to look for to get your aging loved one the right assistance, if need\nbe.  \n \n \n \n Here are some\ntelltale signs that your parent needs living care assistance:  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Personality and Behavioral Changes  \n \n Any\nsudden changes in personality or behavior are signs of cognitive deterioration\nor disorders. If your parent was once extremely sociable, but now likes to\nspend the day alone, or if he/she is experiencing mood swings, this is an\nindicator they need outside help and assistance.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Changes in Pantry \n \n If\nit becomes difficult for your parent to cook meals, you may see a change in\ntheir dietary habits. If convenient frozen or fast food meals become the norm,\nalong with spoiled food in the refrigerator, this is a huge red flag.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Dramatic Weight Loss  \n \n As\na result of the changes in their eating habits, seniors may rapidly lose or\ngain weight. Also, look out for nutritional deficiencies that manifest as skin\nproblems. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Excessive Clutter  \n \n While\npiles of laundry or unopened mail may seem like no big deal, these small signs\nare often the first ones that show your parents are having difficulty with\ndaily tasks. When cognitive function declines, the simple tasks, such as\nsorting through the mail, can become overwhelming. \u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Cuts and Bruises \n \n Apparent\ncuts and bruises signal possible vision loss and inability to move around\neasily and comfortably. If parents cannot tell you where the bruises came from\nspecifically, take that as a warning sign.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Medication Issues  \n \n If\nseniors have an abundance of expired medications or fail to refill their\nprescriptions, this can indicate a need for assistance. Not taking their\nmedication can also explain why their cognitive health is declining.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Failure to Pay Bills  \n \n Failure\nto schedule any services/appointments or pay bills shows serious problems with\ncomprehension.  \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Dangerous Driving Behaviors  \n \n This\nis a tough one for seniors, but, if you notice they start to drive dangerously\nor rack up citations, this could suggest their vision and other brain functions\nare slowing. While it is hard for anyone to give up their license, you may need\nto ask your parents to stop driving for the safety of themselves and others.  \n \n \n \n Considering that\naging and its effect do happen\u2014yes, even to our loved ones\u2014it is easy to want\nto jump on board of the new technology that will strengthen declining cognitive\nprocesses and increase overall satisfaction with independent living (for both\nyou and your parent). \n \n \n \n When it comes to\nyour loved one, you want to take all the necessary steps to keep them both\nhealthy and happy. Explore your options with technological products and\nservices,  at-home care , assisted living facilities, and your\nmany other options.  \n \n \n \n The best choice\nfor you and your family often depends on the specific health and familial\nstructure you can provide for your parent. Take some time, do your research,\nand weigh all your options.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://alreadyhomecare.com/", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6uhinkC-gJ0/Vt3ipu5NPnI/AAAAAAAACmo/nIvkpm5Zaf4/s1600/sCh7QNPnX-WOEOvIh8McUDl72eJkfbmt4t8yenImKBVvK0kTmF0xjctABnaLJIm9.jpeg", "http://www.aging2.com/", "http://www.aging2.com/", "http://www.aging2.com/", "http://www.aging2.com/", "http://www.aging2.com/", "http://www.mylively.com/", "http://www.mylively.com/", "http://www.mylively.com/", "http://www.mylively.com/", "http://www.brainaid.com/", "http://www.brainaid.com/", "http://www.brainaid.com/", "http://www.brainaid.com/", "http://www.brainaid.com/", "http://sabi.com/", "http://sabi.com/", "http://sabi.com/", "http://sabi.com/", "https://www.lifthero.com/", "https://www.lifthero.com/", "https://www.lifthero.com/", "http://alreadyhomecare.com/about-us/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/03/technology-and-elderly-new-era.html", "title": ""},

It's hopeful and it's action-oriented. \u00a0My Mom is 94 and\nfrail, but we're getting her a passport. \u00a0She wants to see to her old\nsummer home of Kennebunk Port in Maine, so we\u2019re planning an overnight stay in\na nearby country hotel as a trial run. \u00a0\n Reservations can be made, changed, and changed again. \u00a0  In the meantime, we can sit together poring\nover guidebooks and reminiscing about summers at the Narragansett Hotel in the\n1920\u2019s. Planning can take many forms, even if it means dreaming without leaving\nhome.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e74oP7aFmfY/Vs4So96AufI/AAAAAAAACl4/L0Vo1UtzzLc/s1600/295_001.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/02/settling-down-even-when-plans-fall-apart.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n In the United States, news is dominated by the pre-election primaries. \u00a0But in Canada, headlines are about how my country should operationalise a Supreme Court ruling on physician-assisted suicide. \u00a0 The Supreme Court's 'Carter Decision'  found that:\u00a0 \n \n \n Section 241 \u00a0 ( b ) and\u00a0 s. 14 \u00a0 \u00a0of the\u00a0 Criminal Code \u00a0 \u00a0unjustifiably infringe\u00a0 s. 7 \u00a0 \u00a0of the\u00a0 Charter \u00a0 \u00a0 and are of no force or effect to the extent that they prohibit physician-assisted death for a competent adult person who (1) clearly consents to the termination of life and (2) has a grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease or disability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition. \n \n The court gave the government 12 months to create a legislative framework for the new law and then a further four month extension when the new federal Liberal government was elected. \u00a0Last week,  Parliament released a Select Committee Report, 'Medical Assistance in Dying: A Patient Centred Approach'. \u00a0 \u00a0This report is Parliament's response to the requirement to create a legislative framework for doctor assisted dying. \u00a0 To date, public opinion has been mixed in its reaction to the latest Parliamentary report. But my reading is that most pundits are saying the report has gone too far.  \u00a0I agree with that assessment and here's why : the Supreme Court cites conditions for assisted dying as \"people who are grievously and irremediably ill... who cannot seek physician's assistance in dying.\" \u00a0The Parliamentary report recommended expanding the criteria for accessing physician assisted dying to include psychiatric patients who are not terminally ill, 'mature minors' and those who have written advance directives.\u00a0 In my youth, I suffered from clinical depression. Our son has severe disabilities and when he was a mature minor, he was deemed palliative (but not at end of life). \u00a0At that time, he suffered from uncontrolled pain. Given this background, I believe that my personal life experience gives me a unique perspective on this debate. \u00a0I agree with the physicians who testified to the Parliamentary Select Committee that all psychiatric illness is potentially remediable (mine was and many people I know have suffered terribly, but with medication and therapy, they have recovered). In our country, children do not have the right to vote, drink alcohol or fight in a war. That is because they lack the maturity to make life altering decisions that require the maturity of adulthood. For that reason, I believe physician assisted dying is not appropriate for children. The pre-requisite for requesting physician assisted dying is capacity - that much is agreed. An advance directive to end a patient's life after they have lost capacity due to Alzheimer's or other cognitive impairment no longer meets that pre-requisite. Furthermore, an advance directive would be carried out after a patient does not have the specific capacity to determine coercion or differentiate the social determinants of health from irremediable suffering. But my real fear about the Select Committee Report is that it does not offer anything in the way of a legislative framework that protects vulnerable patients from seeking physician assisted dying on the basis of coercion or suffering resulting from psycho-social determinants of health (poverty, unemployment, loneliness, etc.) \u00a0The availability (or lack of it) of home care, especially palliative care is an obvious reason patients might well assess their own suffering as intolerable.  Equal access to physician assisted dying without equal access to community-based services and palliative care places the right to die above the right to live. And that's wrong in my view. Luckily, the Canadian Association for Community Living has just released a new tool to assess the potential vulnerability of persons asking to receive physician assisted death. It's called  The Vulnerable Persons Standard \u00a0and\u00a0I am proud to be an\u00a0 advisor \u00a0on it. \u00a0Here are the  Standard's Five Guidelines . If you agree with the principles of this Standard, you can sign to support it  HERE.   I hope the Parliament of Canada will take notice of the Standard and incorporate its compelling safeguards into the legislative framework guiding access to physician assisted dying.  I want to ensure that our son is protected from coercion; that my mother will not choose to end her life because she feels that she is a burden (she isn't!); and that I am allowed to live my life to its fullest and natural end, according to my wishes so long as I am able to choose my fate. \n \n \"The federal government needs to exercise wisdom in striking a balance between equitable access and appropriate safeguards for people whose physical, emotional, cognitive or social vulnerability may make them more susceptible to suicide.\" \n \n \n \n \u2014 Dr. Harvey Max Chochinov, Canada Research Chair in Palliative Care and Former Chair of the \u2018Federal External Panel\u2019 on Options for a Legislative Response to Carter v Canada, and an advisor to the Standard As my friend and colleague, Al Etmanski said in his  excellent blog post today , \" I accept the right to choose active euthanasia for the small minority of people who will ultimately avail themselves of that option. But rights don\u2019t exist in isolation. They carry obligations to ensure that we have sufficient safeguards to address the concerns of a much larger minority of vulnerable Canadians.\" \n \n I urge Members of Canada's Parliament to incorporate the  Vulnerable Persons Standard  into the new legislative framework governing physician assisted dying in our country. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AM0R7Fmc5YE/VtiaxkB__1I/AAAAAAAACmU/QogFc9ULaUc/s1600/palliative-care-300x234.jpg", "https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14637/index.do", "https://zoupio.lexum.com/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec241", "https://zoupio.lexum.com/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec14", "https://zoupio.lexum.com/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en", "https://zoupio.lexum.com/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7", "https://zoupio.lexum.com/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/HOC/Committee/421/PDAM/Reports/RP8120006/421_PDAM_Rpt01_PDF/421_PDAM_Rpt01-e.pdf", "http://www.vps-npv.ca/", "http://www.vps-npv.ca/support-the-standard", "http://www.vps-npv.ca/readthestandard", "http://here./", "http://aletmanski.com/series/save-the-world/when-einsteins-scared-im-scared/", "http://vps-npv.ca/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/03/balancing-love-vulnerability-and-right.html", "title": ""},

Not so much a place as a space. It is a space that breathes and nourishes us. A space becomes a home when it opens to us as we are, and when we in turn, get worn into it. \u00a0Creating this kind of home space when a person is vulnerable or isolated is complex. As families, we are often caught in the paradoxical challenge of finding spaces that both open doors and secure locks. \u00a0This is why cultivating and consulting caring connections beyond us is so important for our loved ones. \u00a0Standing together, we can peek out, open the curtains of our own comfort zones and imagine the living, breaking spaces our loved ones can grow their way into. \u00a0And out of.  \n \nJust as no tree lives forever, no home, no matter how well planned, financed and built, is ever permanent. \u00a0True durability lies in the long arms of others who will care for our relatives beyond our lifetime. \u00a0It is an embrace that will nourish and honour the spirit of our loved ones wherever they may live. \n \n Note from Donna: Vickie Cammack is my friend and colleague in caregiving whom I hold in very high esteem. \u00a0Vickie is a recipient of the Order of Canada for her pioneering work in developing models of personal support networks for vulnerable people at risk of social isolation, including the creation of  Tyze Personal Networks . \u00a0Currently, Vickie and I are co-writing a book about caregiving. \u00a0We don't have a title yet, but we guarantee that it will be interesting.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickie-cammack-9523908", "http://safeandsecureplanning.com/", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WlQaYs2cDMM/VrZxszJ_psI/AAAAAAAACjc/wZ9aqZtcXbE/s1600/amazing-treehouses-11.jpg", "http://tyze.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/02/home-making-of-sanctuary.html", "title": ""},

I was an idealist who believed art could\nmake the world a kinder, less confusing place.\u00a0\nI still believe that. \n \n \n \n Then\nNicholas was born and I became his mother, his nurse, his advocate, his\nchampion, his therapist, his teacher, his translator, his researcher, his\ndriver, his playmate, his comforter and his task master.  \n \n \n \n For\nyears, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off our children and slowly, my dream of being\nan actor turned into a distant memory; something from my \u2018old life\u2019, almost as\nthough that dream belonged to another person. I was so tired, I couldn't carry on a conversation. \u00a0Every train of thought broke into a million pieces.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n But\nmy passion for stories and metaphors didn\u2019t die. It was like a small fire\ninside me - one I didn\u2019t tend often, but that would spark sometimes when I\nimagined my day as a story I could write, changing endings as I pleased. \n \n \n \n My\ndreams of being an actor, of having a job with a business card, of inventing\nanother version of myself outside my home became something private \u2013 like\nprecious gems locked away in a bank vault. \u00a0\n \n \n I\nsettled for a life without the theatre, but I found my voice in writing. \u00a0  I mine my own mundane, everyday life for\nmeaning and find unpolished gems there.

Tyze is powered by  Saint Elizabeth Health Care,  Canada\u2019s largest\nsocial enterprise. \u00a0  This is a story of\nhow Canadian ingenuity and generosity are helping some of the world\u2019s most\nvulnerable victims of war settle in to our neighbourhoods. \n \n \n \n Melissa\u2019s Edmonton support group\nincludes contributors who bring a wide variety of relevant skills and\nexperience; one is a social worker and another works at the local school board. \u00a0  Everyone has special talents that will help\nto ease the new family\u2019s settlement process. The Edmonton response to the need\nfor hands-on support, says Melissa, has been \u2018magical\u2019. \u00a0  But coordinating efforts and ensuring that\n\u2018the left hand knows what the right is doing\u2019 has special challenges,\nespecially given that files related to the family\u2019s needs are private and\nshared on a need-to-know basis.  \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Here are some features of  Tyze  that\nmake it uniquely suited to a refugee support network. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tyze includes: \n \n \n \n \n \n The same data\nsecurity as online banking. It is completely private, password encoded and not\nGoogle searchable \n A sharewall to post updates (videos\nand pictures) and exchange supportive messages among all network members. The\nwall is a place to help keep everyone informed, reducing the social isolation\nassociated with this level of change that refugees will face. \n A calendar of events that offers the\nnetwork owner and members an avenue to be more informed about upcoming events,\nappointments and it helps others within the network plan when activities can\nhave the greatest impact. As well, at the site level, the calendar can be used\nto schedule and inform network participants of local events. \n Secure vault (file storage) to store\nimportant individual documents that can be shared with selected network members\nand/or share and store information that may be of benefit to the groups within\nthat community. \n A place for requesting assistance,\ngiving members of the support network the opportunity to know when their assistance\nis most needed. This promotes the model of \u201cShared Care.\u201d \n A private and secure message system. \n Resources and tools available in the\nlibrary for network owners and all network members to increase their knowledge.\nThis library can be categorized for ease of access and customized to each type\nof network. Common resources can be shared amongst different Tyze sites in the\ncase of agency involvement with multiple support networks. \n \n \n \n \n \n Melissa is thrilled about the way her\ncommunity has come together to create a circle of support for refugees. \u00a0  \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how people have rallied around\nthis family\u201d, she says, \u201cand Tyze is the perfect platform for supporting\nrefugee groups.\u201d \n \n \n \n If you know of a refugee support group\nthat could benefit from using Tyze, contact Mary Lou Ackerman Vice President,  Saint Elizabeth HealthCare  (905) 968 6451  mackerman@saintelizabeth.com  for more information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IPpYms38N2E/VryPU8ocGII/AAAAAAAACkg/4pOvgmr4AoY/s1600/The-Old-Souk-in-Aleppo-001.jpg", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "https://www.saintelizabeth.com/Home.aspx", "http://www.tyze.com/", "https://www.saintelizabeth.com/Home.aspx", "mailto:mackerman@saintelizabeth.com"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/02/a-unique-canadian-story-of-care.html", "title": ""},

But taken together and over time, caregiving tasks may\nbecome overwhelming. This is especially true in the case of degenerative\ndisease combined with the caregiver\u2019s own aging. \u00a0 Caregiving requires us to \u00a0make a  choice  every day\nto provide loving care. \u00a0 F or long-term caregivers, this choice requires courage and the\ndetermination to place love above all else. \n \n \n \n A re-arrangement of priorities is required, a coming to\ngrips, a reconciliation of personal goals, a \u2018settling in\u2019 to care. \u00a0  Sometimes, especially in long-term care,\nthere are natural barriers to making peace with caregiving. \u00a0  Caregivers may engage in a battle of\npriorities, culminating in making enemies of both work and home. They may crave\nmultiple social connections and the consoling \u2018noise\u2019 of an independent and\nbustling, working life.  \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Does being \u2018settled in\u2019 to caregiving represent liberation\nor captivity? \u00a0  Being in the right place,\ndoing the right thing is natural for young parents caring for their\nchildren. \u00a0  But what of an older parent\ncaring for an adult child with disabilities? What about the role reversal in\neldercare? \u00a0  At the beginning of caring\nfor an ill spouse or frail parent, a caregiver might strive to finish caring\ntasks quickly in order to return to a life without the burden of care. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \u00a0 With the passing of weeks\nand months, time spent shifts to a slower pace. \u00a0\n The caregiver stops wishing to be somewhere else. \u00a0  Being alone with a loved one morphs into a\nnatural way to be. \u00a0  And the caregiver\nnotices that the slowness and quiet of care is in itself a presence, not an\nabsence. \u00a0  Settling  for  the reduced ambitions of caring for a loved one opens a door to\na life rich with humanity and meaning. \n \n \n \n A realization dawns that the call to care is not a call to\nbattle. It is a quiet truce in a land that is foreign to most other\npeople. \u00a0  Here, there is the possibility\nof intimacy, of reflecting on hopes, dreams and on mortality. Here, there is\nthe chance to be grateful for small joys and tender mercies. \u00a0  Here, there is the opportunity to know what\nis most important about being alive. \n \n \n \n This is a reflection taken from the draft of a new book I'm co-writing with  Vickie Cammack . \u00a0Stay tuned for more instalments, coming soon!\u00a0 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C0OmTTqPBfY/VsD6MpKkGnI/AAAAAAAACk8/AS9d1JQFQLE/s1600/hqdefault.jpg", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickie-cammack-9523908"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/02/what-does-settling-mean-to-caregivers.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n By a  Seniorly  Contributor \n \n \n \n When we think of millennials, we often\nfocus on their digital technology-driven culture and overlook the fact that\nthey are some of the smartest, most selfless people we know. Millennials these\ndays are driven by a desire to help others, and the careers they choose reflect\nthis. In fact, we seem to be entering an entirely new age of caregiving, one in\nwhich millennial grandchildren set aside personal goals in order to support\ntheir aging loved ones.  \n \n The National Alliance for Caregiving and the AARP Public Policy Institute recently shared Caregiver Profile Fact sheets from their Caregiving in the U.S. 2015 data. One of those profiles focuses on millennials -\u00a0 caregivers \u00a0aged 18 to 34. \u00a0 \n \n \n According to this profile, the typical millennial caregiver is 27 years old and is just as likely to be male as female (a difference from the traditional caregiver profile).\u00a0These young adults are generally caring for a 60 year old female relative, most often a parent or grandparent who needs help with a physical condition. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In many cases, the care they provide is comparable to that of the typical caregiver.\u00a0Although they have been providing care for a shorter period of time (just under three years on average) they spend over 20 hours a week helping with daily living and personal care. Half of millennial caregivers do not have any additional support. They are what researchers call primary caregivers - the person in the family who does most of the caregiving tasks. Others are secondary caregivers. They help the primary caregiver with both hands-on care and decision making. Tertiary caregivers help periodically with things like grocery shopping or yard work, but don\u2019t make decisions regarding elder care. \n \n Grandchildren are probably not the first people that come to mind when we think of primary caregivers. But one\u00a0out of 12 caregivers are caring for a grandparent and 8% of all caregivers over the age of 18 are grandchildren. That\u2019s 5.3 million\u00a0 grandchildren caring for grandparents. \n \n \n Although grandchildren caring for grandparents is common in some cultures, it\u2019s new to many in the United States. In the U.S. context, grandchildren caregivers are an \u201cout-of-time\u201d event, meaning they take on this role at a point in adult development when we tend to focus on other things. Most of us expect to care for a loved one someday, usually later in life when we have a parent or spouse who needs care. Caregiving earlier in life can sometimes lead to delaying education, careers, romantic relationships and parenthood. \u00a0 \n \n Still, research by Christine Fruhauf, PhD (Colorado State University) and Nancy Orel, PhD (Bowling Green State University) found that grandchildren have a positive view of their role as caregiver and offer some creative solutions to the challenges they face while caregiving. \n \n \n For some grandchildren, they are just being supportive and compassionate toward older family members. Others are filling in after a parent or grandparent died. However, most see their caregiving as reciprocal - caring for the grandparent who cared for them when they were younger. They want their grandparent to be happy and recognize that he/she won\u2019t always be around. Grandchildren are happy to provide care now because they know they will miss their grandparent when they are gone. \n \n \n There are many things grandchildren like about their caregiving role. It helps them learn more about themselves and their family. They also form\u00a0a closer relationship with their grandparent, as well as\u00a0a stronger bond with other family members.\u00a0They develop skills such as patience, resourcefulness and compassion. Some even consider studying gerontology or other related subjects in college. Plus, caring for a\u00a0grandparent makes them feel good about themselves. \n \n \n Of course, there are things grandchildren don\u2019t like as well. Caregiving can be very time consuming and stressful, especially for young, busy adults. As a result of filling this role, millennial caregivers have less time to spend with friends. Sometimes they even have to sacrifice a career, finances and other personal goals in order to meet the needs of their elders. This role can often wear on caregivers, leading them to develop anxiety or other stress-related issues. \n \n \n But people in this role also learn to cope. Spending time on things like hobbies, religious activities\u00a0and\u00a0 socializing is important . And when time is short, young caregivers learn to adapt to the situation. Some grandchildren talked about taking a grandparent on dates or having friends come visit at their grandparent\u2019s house. \u00a0 \n \n \n RESOURCES \n \n \n Overall, caring for a grandparent is a positive experience. Here are some tips and resources that can help. \n \n \n Seniorly offers a variety of useful resources and tools. \n \n \n If you or your grandparent live in California, the\u00a0 Seniorly search engine \u00a0helps you make\u00a0senior housing decisions based on care needs, your monthly budget, the size of communities and a time frame of when your elders want to move.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to have conversations early on with your grandparent about their long-term care needs. The\u00a0 Seniorly Resource Center \u00a0has many articles that can help, such as: \n \n \n \n Advance care planning\u00a0 so you can be an advocate for the kind of care they need \n \n \n When and why to consider moving into a\u00a0 senior living community \n \n \n \n \n Deciding whether\u00a0 assisted living or in-home care \u00a0is the best option for your elders \n \n \n \n \n Deciding what type of senior housing is right for them \n \n \n \n Other useful resources include: \n \n The U.S. Administration on Aging Eldercare Locator \u00a0to find help in your community \n \n The HBO documentary\u00a0 \u201cGrandpa, Do You Know Who I Am?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n The Alzheimer\u2019s Association search tool \u00a0for finding programs and services in your area \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.seniorly.com/", "http://www.caregiving.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Caregiving-in-the-US-2015_Millennial_CG-Profile.pdf", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ITsnOdbBadI/VpcW1lsQJZI/AAAAAAAAChk/X6rlUlKE5Xo/s1600/HoldingHandsDark.jpg", "https://www.seniorly.com/resources/articles/a-new-age-of-caregiving-grandchildren-caring-for-grandparents", "https://www.seniorly.com/resources/articles/socialization-and-its-importance-to-seniors", "http://https//www.seniorly.com/search", "https://www.seniorly.com/resources", "https://www.seniorly.com/resources/articles/how-to-begin-a-conversation-with-an-aging-parent-about-the-future", "https://www.seniorly.com/resources/articles/the-seniorly-guide-to-decision-making", "https://www.seniorly.com/resources/articles/assisted-living-at-home", "http://www.eldercare.gov/Eldercare.NET/Public/Index.aspx", "http://www.hbo.com/alzheimers/grandpa-do-you-know-who-i-am.html", "http://www.alz.org/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/01/a-new-age-of-caregiving-grandchildren.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n If you've ever gone to the Emergency Room with someone you love who has mobility or cognitive impairments, you know that hospitals are very unsafe places for vulnerable people. \u00a0Unless your loved one needs life-saving care such as in the Intensive Care Unit, you know that family caregivers are essential conduits between patient and professionals. \u00a0Not only that, but we perform a good deal of personal care to boot. \u00a0The problem is, the clinic and administrative hierarchy of hospital professionals don't admit to the critical role that families play. \u00a0In fact the messaging on hospital websites invites the public to believe that families simply provide an antidote to the stress of acute illness and being away from home. \u00a0Even though family caregivers of frail seniors, cognitively impaired adults or children with disabilities ensure the safety and often the physical comforts of their loved ones, hospitals still charge anywhere between $14 and $25 per day for 'visitor' parking. \n \n Here's what one adult hospital wrote about visitors on its website:  We encourage you to visit your loved one at any time because we\u00a0know that having family and friends nearby helps reduce anxiety and isolation and improves healing and recovery for our patients.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n In the case of Children's Hospitals, parents are encouraged to 'take part' in their child's care. \u00a0This is the way one major hospital phrases the parental role on the website:\u00a0 \n \n Parents are encouraged to take part in their\u00a0child\u2019s care.\u00a0You may stay overnight and sleep on the sofa\u00a0in your child\u2019s room for the duration of their\u00a0stay.\u00a0 Each in-patient floor has a family room for you\u00a0and other family members to use while visiting\u00a0your child. The rooms have a kitchenette,\u00a0appliances, and lounge chairs. \n \nThe implicit message to parents is that they are more than welcome to move in with their sick child. But what is not explicit is how central a role the parents will play in their child's care while in hospital. The reality of hospital care today is that nurses, doctors and therapists perform assessments and procedures from time to time, but they cannot attend to the patient all day, every day. Assistance with nearly all activities of daily living is up to families and this is particularly true for patients with disabilities or chronic impairments of any kind. Today's wards are staffed based on caring for a sick, but otherwise independent patient population. \u00a0But the reality is that the more dependent the patient, the more he or she needs a family caregiver in the hospital. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd the centrality of the family caregiver role in hospital increases with the complexity of the chronic care patient's needs. \u00a0The Alzheimer's patient who also has diabetes along with challenging behaviour cannot be managed on a regular ward without a vigilant son or daughter by the bedside to help keep things under control. Nurses and doctors who trust the knowledge and capacities of 'frequent flyer' parents of medically complex children expect those parents to give their child 24 hour skilled care while in hospital. Some parents describe 'family centred care' as 'parents, do it yourself care'. \u00a0 \n \nNone of this is the fault of the highly trained and compassionate staff in hospitals. \u00a0It's simply an uncomfortable stage in the evolution of contemporary healthcare - caught somewhere between the old model of paternalistic medicine and the contemporary reality of cutbacks, sicker people and an aging population.\u00a0 \n \nFamily caregivers WANT to help look after their loved ones. But we need to be recognized as essential components of the treatment team and we need the ability to set limits on the number of hours we put in at the bedside. Just because family care is borne of love and is unpaid, it shouldn't be deemed arbitrary, frivolous or a luxury. \u00a0Family care is essential in hospitals, so let's start talking about it that way. \n \nUPDATE NEWS FLASH: One day after I published this, a news article appeared in Ontario, Canada, announcing that the Minister of Health had mandated half price parking passes for 5, 10 or 30 days. Passes can be transferrable between patient and caregiver. Apparently the cost of one-day passes will remain the same.\u00a0http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/ontario-hospitals-will-have-to-offer-discount-parking-passes-health-minister-says. \u00a0One tiny step to support the essential role of family caregivers in hospitals.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dKhqrizol8s/VpwsF4MFiCI/AAAAAAAACh8/vztA1s52_z4/s1600/f8acf68a9eaeb001e1f4ddbc88e7fb23_f311.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jJxcd-Ox45E/Vpwvd3FvGyI/AAAAAAAACiI/3Bh4s6H9Zpw/s1600/A-mother-with-a-sick-chil-001.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/01/rhetoric-vs-reality-real-role-of.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of  Elizz  for  IZEA . All opinions are 100% mine. \n \n\n \n\n \n Recently, I was chatting with friends about why caregivers have so much trouble asking for help.\u00a0 \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because asking for help sometimes feels like a betrayal of the person we love who needs care,\u201d I suggested.\u00a0 \u201cI ask myself if I am behaving like a dutiful daughter.\u00a0 So if I ask for help, I\u2019m not being dutiful and I feel guilty\u201d, my friend nodded thoughtfully.\u00a0 \n' '\n\n Picking apart our complicated feelings about love and obligation is essential in making peace with our emotions about caregiving. And to do that, we must be truthful and compassionate \u2026 to ourselves.\u00a0 A good place to begin self-understanding is by completing the\u00a0 5 Stages of Caregiving Quiz \u00a0on the Elizz website. \u00a0I completed the quiz myself and scored  INTENSIVE:\u00a0 Often the longest caregiving stage, with complex and increasing care needs.\u00a0 Individual self-identifies as a caregiver.\u00a0 Without support, caregiver may be unprepared and experience unchartered emotions, family conflict and greater impacts on home/work life with risk of burnout and health issues.\u00a0 With support, caregiver may develop a sense of competence, strength. \n\n \n\n I am relieved to say that after twenty-seven years of caregiving, I do experience a sense of competence and strength. \u00a0Over the years, I\u2019ve realized that a key to being at peace with myself has been in the way that I think about my caregiving role.\u00a0 A few years ago, I began to understand that my loved ones had dependency needs that were separate from their personalities.\u00a0 For me, this was a watershed moment.\u00a0 My mother could still be my mother if a personal support worker helped her most days with shopping and meal preparation.\u00a0 My son will always want me if he is ill or in pain, but now that he\u2019s grown up, he wants another man to help him shower and change. \n\n \n\n Part of the reason that I experience a sense of competence and strength is because I feel good about asking for help \u2013 from family members, friends and paid support workers.\u00a0 Within those circles of support, we all care for my loved ones, but we care for each other and for ourselves, too. \n\n There are lots of quizzes and resources on the\u00a0 Elizz \u00a0site such as the  Styles of Caregiving Quiz .\u00a0Browse to reflect on your personal caregiving stage and how you feel about your role.\u00a0 There are many services available to assist families, but only you will know which Elizz caregiver services are right for you.\u00a0 Which Elizz caregiver services are right for you? \n \n\n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://izea.it/l5vtO", "https://izea.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gF_pM1htXkU/VquPL_wnu6I/AAAAAAAAAcc/6PTIjGPZloc/s1600/hands.png", "http://izea.it/l5vtQ", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IlpgwLy7f10/Vq-eshldeTI/AAAAAAAAAdY/SOR617vXsYs/s1600/unnamed.jpg", "http://izea.it/l5vtN", "https://elizz.com/quizzes/what-is-your-caregiving-style", "http://izea.it/l5vtP", "http://izea.it/l5vtO"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/02/treating-ourselves-as-we-would-treat.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nHappy New Year, everyone! \n \n \n \n \n \nYesterday, I happened upon an article titled  '7 Habits of Chronically Unhappy People' . \u00a0It was number 5 that caught my eye:  You Strive to Control Your Life . \u00a0Now, I'm a very happy person - I'm an optimist by nature. \u00a0But when I am unhappy, usually there's a control issue in the picture. \u00a0Here's what makes many caregivers miserable, including me: \n \n \n There's a difference between control and striving to achieve our goals. Happy people take steps daily to achieve their goals, but realize in the end, there's very little control over what life throws their way. \n \n Unhappy people tend to micromanage in effort to control all outcomes and fall apart in dramatic display when life throws a wrench in their plan. Happy people can be just as focused, yet still have the ability to go with the flow and not melt down when life delivers a curve-ball. \n \n The key here is to be goal-oriented and focused, but allow room for letting sh*t happen without falling apart when the best laid plans go awry- because they will. Going with the flow is what happy people have as plan B. \n \n \nI wouldn't say I melt down when life throws a curve ball at someone I love, but at the same time, I feel most at peace when I believe that I've put in place plans for 'any exigency' as my Mom would say. \u00a0I like it when my loved ones' to-do lists are all checked off. \u00a0That state of perfect care doesn't last more than hours or a day at the most, but I always believe it's always just around the corner if only I had more time, more energy or more foresight. \n \nI know that my caregiving is fuelled by love and that I do the best I can. \u00a0So my New Year's resolution is to put aside my aspirations for perfection and trust in myself, in others and the fates to keep my loved ones safe and warm. \u00a0The business of balancing holding on and letting go is a tough one for caregivers, me included. \u00a0When life throws curve balls, we beat ourselves up for not anticipating or thwarting disaster. \u00a0This year, I'm determined to do better at being happy and going with the flow. \u00a0It's going to be my Plan B starting tomorrow. \n \nOh, and PS: I'm going to finish the book that I'm writing with  Vickie Cammack ! (But if curve balls come my way, I'll be OK with a delay in my publication date.) \n \nMay all your homes be filled with love, joy and gratitude throughout 2016. \u00a0Happy New Year! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OVLLSAVR7q4/VoVmzE76CtI/AAAAAAAACf8/YsecdLS1o2s/s1600/as-2015-approaches-here-are-three-suggested-new-years-resolutions-fo_16001136_40006152_1_14080390_3001-670x375.jpg", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-star/7-habit-of-chronically-unhappy-people_b_6174000.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickie-cammack-9523908", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3olVCqj24SE/VoVm_2jPIYI/AAAAAAAACgE/JjSngCpT5k8/s1600/New-Years-Resolution-Time.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/12/my-new-years-resolution-for-2016.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nThe last few days, I have been thinking about the privilege of giving. \u00a0This is a story that came to mind: I was just 22 years old when my husband Jim and I were posted to Moscow in 1978. \u00a0It was the Brezhnev era and we were nervous about living in a faraway foreign land. But, Jim and I had slogged over Russian language lessons for a year before we left, so we felt somewhat prepared. \u00a0Of course, that was a long time ago and way before our children arrived on the scene. Our time in the USSR was a great adventure and we made good friends both in the diplomatic corps and within the 'refuznik' community of Muscovites (those who had applied to leave Russia, but had been refused an exit visa). Jim and I assumed that Eastern Europe would be our future work focus, but when Nicholas was born with disabilities, those plans were de-railed. \u00a0In fact, our colleague and friend from our 1970's Moscow days, Rod Irwin, was later named Canadian Ambassador to the Russian Federation. It was Rod's wife Penny who introduced me to the remarkable Moscow charity,\u00a0 Maria's Children. \u00a0\u00a0Maria Yeliseyeva is a Moscow artist who has taught painting and textile arts to, over the years, thousands of orphans, including those with disabilities. \u00a0A few years ago, when Penny and Rod returned to Canada from their time in the Ambassador's official residence in Moscow, Penny dropped over to give me a gift. \u00a0It was a quilt. \u00a0Not a large bedspread type of quilt, but an artwork depicting a Russian countryside winter scene. \u00a0It was beautiful. \u00a0It was clearly made with joy, imagination and love, not to mention great skill.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Penny told me her story of visiting Maria's Children and noticing the children with cerebral palsy. \u00a0She told Maria about our family and about Nicholas. \u00a0Maria pressed the quilted picture into Penny's hand, saying \"Please take this and give it to your friend in Canada. \u00a0It will be a great thrill to the children who made it. \u00a0You see, they have grown up in an orphanage and they have never before given a gift to anyone. \u00a0This is a great opportunity for them.\" I've never forgotten those children and their gift to us. At this time of year, that story reminds me of the importance of helping our loved ones to continue their traditions of giving, even if they are infirm, ill or disabled. \u00a0This year, my Mum has not been well, so I made cheese balls which I wrapped with cards for her special friends and helpers. \u00a0She is so happy to know that her friends will receive a Christmas gift from her that says not only, \"You are one of my favourite people\", but also, \"I may need a lot of help these days, but I can still give too!\" One of my favourite things to make and give with Nicholas is white chocolate bark candy. \u00a0It's become a real tradition in our house and we all love it. \u00a0It's so easy, but it looks gorgeous and when it's presented in clear plastic bags and tied with ribbon, it's a great gift that everyone is thrilled to receive. \n \n So, here's our recipe for White Chocolate Bark: \n \nIngredients \n \n 1 \u00a0 lb \u00a0 (454 g)\u00a0 white chocolate , chopped (We use Baker's brand) \n 1 \u00a0 cup \u00a0 (250 mL)\u00a0 dried cranberries \n 1 \u00a0 cup \u00a0 (250 mL)\u00a0 pistachio nuts , shelled \n \n \n \nPreparation \n \n \n \n \nIn bowl (plastic or glass), melt chocolate in microwave according to package directions. Stir in cranberries and pistachios. Pour onto foil-lined baking sheet; using palette knife or rubber spatula spread into 12- x 9- inch (30 x 23 cm) rectangle. \n \nRefrigerate for at least 1 hour or until hardened. Break into pieces. \n \n \n \nThe hardest part of making this recipe is shelling the pistachios. \u00a0My daughter Natalie loves this job though, and so do I. \u00a0(We eat quite a few as we're 'working'!) \u00a0It's just lovely to sit around the table and chat as we're shelling. \u00a0Nicholas helps to stir in the cranberries and nuts. \u00a0Of course, he's the official taster as well! \n \nI hope everyone in your family has the opportunity to give at this time of year. \u00a0I would love to hear your stories of enabled giving and please do share your recipes if your gifts are edible! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mariaschildren.ru/content/view/141/96/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R4A1fWHjfts/UM0NfHRsL_I/AAAAAAAAAiM/czihbletK4Y/s1600/ottepel.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XVAnKh57-64/UM0Mrz8OSpI/AAAAAAAAAiA/WSZ0M5gdJqs/s1600/pistachio-cranberry-bark-1-525.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/12/helping-your-loved-one-to-give-over.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nGuest post by Maria Ramos \n \n \n \nWhile generally a time of cheer and celebration, the\nholidays pose their own set of challenges for seniors and those living with\ndisabilities.  The\nholidays  are a time for family and friends, and generally everybody wants\nto get together for meals and holiday festivities. As a person ages, though,\nthey may lose the ability to participate in beloved traditions like decorating\na Christmas tree. Just because things are changing, doesn\u2019t mean new traditions\nand memories can\u2019t be made! Celebrating the holidays can be difficult when you\nhave a loved one with a disability but there are some creative solutions to\ncelebrating with your elders safely. \n \n \n \n A playlist of holiday music \n \n \n \nEverybody has favorite Christmas tunes, and elders are no\nexception. They are sure to enjoy a CD compilation of their favorite carols or\nsongs. While tracking down the desired music may take some time, nothing will\nbeat the smile on your loved ones face when the music makes their day. Tracking\ndown and compiling videos of beloved performances from family members can also\nplease an aging music lover.  \n \n \n \n Decorations from the kids in your family \n \n \n \nUnfortunately, a full-blown Christmas tree may no longer be\na realistic option, especially if they\u2019re in an assisted living community, they\nmay simply not have room for a tree. On the other hand, they will have room for\nhandmade crafts from the kids in the family. These can range from garlands made\nout of green or red construction paper or pictures made with macaroni to\nfigurines made out of pinecones. Some of the most cherished \u201cmasterpieces\u201d are\nsimply those made with love, some might even consider making it a group\nactivity when all gathered together.  \n \n \n \n Festive items around the house \n \n \n \nThere are many alternatives to a Christmas tree that can\nbrighten a small place and make it feel festive for the holidays. Poinsettias\nand amaryllis are brightly-colored plants that can be placed on any table, and\na wreath or jingle bells can be hung on a door. Nutcrackers and other figurines\ncan also make a senior\u2019s home look more holiday-ready. Better yet, if your\nloved one has always loved having a tree of their own, they might be happy with\na table-top version. Table-top trees are usually about two feet tall and are\nsmall enough to be handled and packed away easily.  \n \n \n \n Make a family recipe \n \n \n \nMany seniors have their own ideas on how to contribute to\nholiday celebrations, but a senior who still  loves\nto cook or bake  can probably be coaxed into making their favorite holiday\ndish or treat. It can be anything from frosting a cake to mince pie to sweet\npotato mousse. Of course, this is also a great way to get seniors involved even\nif they are the gourmet chef they once were - sharing simple tasks like\ndecorating cookies, mixing, or taste testing are always good starting points. \n \n \n \n Look through family albums \n \n \n \nOne entertainment many seniors can provide themselves is\nstories about the \"good old days.\" Bringing a photo album full of\npictures may jog their memory and inspire them to tell some new stories. The\nfamily can even play a game in which they try to guess what is happening in a\ngiven photo, and the senior can then tell them the real story behind the\npicture. Similarly, family members can finally hear the real story behind a\ngiven family heirloom. \n \n \n \nThere are many ways to include a senior, even one with\ndisabilities in the holiday festivities. Families need to consider the senior's\nneeds, situation and desires when planning a celebration, but most importantly\nkeep their health and safety in mind. Medical  monitoring\nsystems  for the home \u00a0can help with an accidental fall and monitor an\nolder person\u2019s whereabouts, and  home\nautomation  setups can ensure lights and appliances are turned off from\nafar. With your peace of mind in tact, nothing is better than being and\ncelebrating together, and by keeping these activities in mind you\u2019re sure to\nbrighten the holidays for the entire family.  \n \n \n \n Maria is a freelance writer currently living in Chicago.

{"date": "", "body": "\nThis past holiday season was particularly wonderful for us on account of Nick's excellent pain management as well as the celebration of love in our family. \u00a0But the icing on the cake was the wedding of our old friend, John Bilder.  \n \nIt was about 1999 when we first met John. Like most Moms, I was struggling with 'arsenic hour', that time between after school and bedtime when children came home from school, the dog needed walking, dinner needed preparing, and homework needed doing. \u00a0I didn't want professional care for Nicholas (we couldn't afford it anyway), but I thought perhaps a local teenager could help Nick with his homework and play a computer game with him while I attended to other pressing matters in my kitchen. \u00a0So I called the guidance counsellor at the high school down the street. I explained that our son had very severe disabilities and I described the type of student I thought we needed: fun, loyal, someone who could be like an older brother. \u00a0John offered to help - he was 16. \n \nThe first day, John was so shy that he hardly spoke a word to Nick. But we persevered and soon, the boys were laughing. \u00a0One night, we all went to a restaurant for dinner where they gave children a toy prize from a 'treasure chest'. \u00a0Nick chose a couple of toy ninja turtles. \u00a0The next day, I heard the Nicholas laughing his head off as John acted out a fight between the ninjas (so THIS is how boys play!).  \n \nJohn took Nick on his first ever city bus ride. \u00a0He came with us to the cottage and rode with Nick behind our boat sitting on a wind surf board tied with a ski rope. \u00a0They went full speed when Jim wasn't looking! \u00a0A couple of years later, John came with us on a family holiday to Kennebunk in Maine. \u00a0He looked at the Atlantic waves and thought, \"I can get Nick to ride on a boogie board!\", and he did. \n \n \n \n \n John helping Nick have his very first city bus ride. \n \n \n \n \n \n The boys dyed their hair blonde at the cottage one summer!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Best buds having fun, always. \n \nAs Nicholas suffered from chronic pain and complications from his disabilities in 2005, the boys learned that the next winter Olympics were to be held in Vancouver. \u00a0Even though Nick was very ill, they promised each other that they'd make the trip out west to see the games. \u00a0The next year, Jim was posted to London and we moved to the UK. \u00a0Nick was far too frail to travel back to Canada, but John never forgot his promise. \u00a0The day of the Vancouver games opening ceremonies, Nick's old friend arrived at our door carrying a large bag of Canadian fan gear and sports snacks from home. \u00a0For the next two weeks, the boys stayed awake all night cheering our athletes on and slept during the day. \u00a0I remember that every morning Jim and I would find a hand written note on the floor outside our bedroom door with the medal count and of course, hockey scores. \n \nToday,  John is a highly successful real estate agent  in our home town of Ottawa, Canada. \u00a0He married his beautiful bride Raphaelle on January 2nd and we know that she will be part of our extended family now, too.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDisability or dependency needs in families can lead to enduring relationships with the people who help us. \u00a0Their kindness, loyalty and friendship enriches all our lives in many, many ways. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dzijrxIZNI8/VpA4cZWgB7I/AAAAAAAACgo/1ti5B9FiA4s/s1600/busride.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9RRF_3UcQL4/VpE_vHBdUtI/AAAAAAAAChE/gkJOfaEM7ns/s1600/Nick%2Band%2BJohn.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4OB6OwdBgjA/VpE_x0cSW3I/AAAAAAAAChM/KdyZXAWh0Rg/s1600/Nick%2Band%2BJohn2.jpg", "http://www.bilder.ca/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mgEG5lVG5l8/VpA8XdKGsGI/AAAAAAAACg0/aif3f8idMWw/s1600/P1030907.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2016/01/an-awesome-wedding-and-lifetime-of.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nI've been thinking a lot about how in my family, we plan special family occasions and how we change our plans or even cancel at the last minute. \u00a0And I've been thinking how typical that is for anyone giving care to a loved one. \n \nFor example... Tomorrow is my Mom's birthday. \u00a0She's 93 years young and at that age, her body sometimes betrays her wish to party. \u00a0So I won't know for sure that we are having her birthday lunch until just before we leave in the morning. \u00a0I've made two quiches and a lemon sponge cake. \u00a0I've packed dishes, wine, cutlery and special decorations, plus gifts, of course. \u00a0If Mom doesn't feel up to having company tomorrow, we'll unpack everything and reschedule her party for another day. \u00a0And that's OK. \n \nOn Christmas Day, we'll drive to our son Nick's house and help him get ready to come home for the day. \u00a0We'll pack up his feeding pump, syringes pre-filled with multiple medicines and extra supplies of all sorts. \u00a0We'll bring him home to open presents and later on join us at the table for a roast turkey with all the trimmings. \u00a0Will Nick's pain get the better of him and force a change of plans? I don't know, but one thing for sure is that we are flexible. \u00a0We'll see how it goes and we'll go with the flow.  \nIf Nick is feeling well on the 26th (not too tired from Christmas and pretty much pain-free after all the excitement), the whole family will join him at his residence for a world junior hockey game on TV (after all, we're Canadian so holidays always involve hockey!) and lunch. \u00a0We'll change up those plans if Nick isn't up to it on the day. \n \nAnd the list goes on. We've got a family event planned every day during the holidays. \u00a0And we know that each event might be on... or not. \u00a0Our job as family caregivers is to accept that we cannot control how our loved ones feel on any given day, no matter how much work we've put into an event or how much we might be looking forward to it. \u00a0Nothing is written in stone, ever. The main point is that we love each other and that we all want to have fun. \u00a0How that happens is very fluid because we are caregivers and we understand how to have a transformer Christmas holiday season. \n \nI want to take this opportunity to wish all my fellow caregivers everywhere a very Merry Christmas and a New Year blessed with joy and contentment. \u00a0We walk a special path - a noble one. \u00a0Peace on earth, everyone! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tXabWjP6XlE/Vnsc1MHexdI/AAAAAAAACfc/DIplll37V-M/s1600/12317746_1670828703174304_1508062182_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-75zkNVFOuV8/Vnse7TXz6lI/AAAAAAAACfo/OSSgOANBoV0/s1600/Christmas-tree-decorations-traditional-colors-red-green-gold-ribbons.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/12/my-caregiver-transformer-christmas.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n December 3, International Day of People With Disability \n \n By Guest Blogger Jennifer Johannesen \n \n Parents with young children with severe neurodevelopmental disabilities\nare extraordinarily committed to helping them achieve as much as they can, despite the\nsignificant odds against them. I was one of those parents until I started to question why we\nwere working so hard, to achieve so little, at such tremendous cost. I have met many\nfamilies who share this experience. Hopefully this story sparks a discussion about the role\nclinicians can play in helping families like mine establish realistic goals and priorities.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n Owen\u2019s brain scans didn\u2019t give us many clues. Although his basal ganglia were underdeveloped\n(this news caused a flurry of inquiry but produced no leads), there was little else to hint\nat why Owen was the way he was. He was about as disabled as you could imagine: he could\nnot crawl, sit, stand, walk, chew, swallow or hear. He was a tiny boy \u2013 just 58 pounds when\nhe died, at 12 years old. The list of medical issues and complications was alarmingly long. In\na way, it was remarkable he lived as long as he did. He died sometime overnight while the\nsurrounding household slept, unaware of his struggle to turn himself back over. (The\ndiagnosis was SUDEP \u2013 Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy \u2013 which was given despite\nthe fact that Owen didn\u2019t have epilepsy, and despite his post-death position. His autopsy\nrevealed that he did not suffocate.)\u00a0 \n \n I mention Owen\u2019s scans because for a while, in the\nearly days, I thought they would reveal his secrets.\nOwen\u2019s doctors and therapists would explain to\nme that his brain was misfiring; it was sending\nwrong or mixed signals to his body, causing his\ndystonia and spasticity. So I made the logical\nassumption that his problems were located in his\nbrain, and I became especially focused on brain\nscan results. Unfortunately more scans didn\u2019t\nreveal more information \u2013 especially as there was\nnothing to see. (By the way: I could say the same\nabout bloodwork, genetic testing and muscle\nbiopsies. He endured a lot of tests, none of which\nrevealed the clues I was seeking.)\u00a0 \n \n All of this to explain that none of us, including his doctors, knew what was wrong with him.\nWe only knew what we could see, which is that he was developing in unusual ways, never\nmeeting developmental milestones, not gaining any skills. But this wasn\u2019t too discouraging:\nour unfruitful quest to answer \u2018why\u2019 left plenty of room for hopes and dreams. No diagnosis\nmeant there were no limits\u2014which suggested that anything was possible.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Our therapists were creative and energetic. Together we heroically embarked on a years-long\njourney to help Owen \u2018reach his full potential\u2019. We tried to figure out communication, gross and\nfine motor function, and literacy. We charted out goals and plans, noting with each failed benchmark\nthat there was always next time. To aid development (and handling) Owen was implanted\nwith an intrathecal baclofen pump (a small programmable pump that administers anti-spasticity\nmedication directly into the cerebrospinal fluid), and we began to explore deep brain stimulation.\nFor a while, I felt purposeful and fulfilled \u2013 I performed well and was praised as \u2018such a great\nmom\u2019. It almost didn\u2019t matter that Owen seemed to simply be along for the ride, not concerned in\nthe least that he wasn\u2019t achieving the goals we\u2019d set out for him. And it almost didn\u2019t matter that\nsomewhere in the back of my mind was a small but rapidly growing sense of futility.\u00a0 \n \n I don\u2019t know if I would have changed course if Owen\u2019s baclofen pump hadn\u2019t malfunctioned. But\nit did\u2014he endured a long and difficult few weeks in intensive care as the neurosurgeon and his\nteam tried to figure out why Owen appeared to be experiencing intermittent symptoms of overdose\nand withdrawal. It was a dark time of difficult decisions and terrible waiting. At one point I\nlay beside him in his hospital bed, contemplating uncomfortable thoughts. What sort of childhood\nwas he experiencing? What sort of mother had I become? If he dies now, will I find comfort in all\nthat work? How will I remember our time together?\u00a0 \n \n Shortly after discharge from the hospital, I rearranged\nour lives. I withdrew him from school and any therapy\nthat had come to feel pointless\u2014which, frankly, was all of\nthem. We focused instead on meaningful experiences\nand enjoyable excursions. (These decisions were not\nmade lightly or recklessly \u2013 please read this post for\nmore context, or my book, No Ordinary Boy, for a fuller\naccount.)\u00a0 \n \n His last few years of life were spent with people who\nloved him, doing things that were enjoyable for all. The\nphysical work of caring for Owen became no easier, but\nwe were relieved of the tyranny of chasing Owen\u2019s\n\u2018potential\u2019, which had cost us so much already.\u00a0 \n \n --\nJennifer Johannesen (@jenjohannesen) writes and speaks about healthcare and disability.

{"date": "", "body": "\n What do caregivers need from the health care system? \u00a0This was the question I was asked at a recent online Town Hall event sponsored by  The Caring Experience , a new project designed to collect the stories of Ontario family caregivers and develop policy options that will reflect what families want and need from the health care system. \u00a0 \n \n I believe that caregivers need the health care system to be  responsive . \u00a0But what does that actually mean? \u00a0In our dealings with doctors, nurses in hospitals, outpatient clinics or in home care, we need doctors to know us and to understand us. \u00a0 \n \n \"If you wish to persuade me, you must think my thoughts, feel my feelings and speak my words.\"  Cicero \n \n Medical professionals want to understand what ails our loved one and they want family caregivers to carry out prescribed care plans. \u00a0But because the way we feel about our loved one's illness and dependency is so emotionally bound up in our personal histories, it is very difficult for medical professionals to understand what is  really  going on. \u00a0But they must. \u00a0We need people working within the health care system to take the time to understand the patient AND the family. \u00a0This means knowing what caregiving at home really looks like and what it feels like to the individual caregiver.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n We need medical professionals to listen well and be kind .\u00a0 My son Nicholas has endured multiple surgeries and chronic pain. I remember saying to the doctors \"I want to tell you something important about what I need as Nick's mother. \u00a0I need you to be nice to me.\" \u00a0I don't recall any doctor understanding the importance of my request. \u00a0In order to be a good caregiver, I need exceptional kindness shown to me. \u00a0At a time of crisis, I cannot cope with the normal brief and sometimes brusque conversation style typical of hospital bedside chats. \u00a0I need medical professionals to drop the veneer of professionalism, call me by my name, look at me and even hold my hand. In short, I need a human interaction with my loved one's medical professionals, especially at times of crisis and especially when caring lasts months or years. \n \n We need medical professionals to work with us as consultants would . \u00a0My friend and colleague  Vickie Cammack  has a beautiful analogy about patients and family caregivers in working together in a circle of care. \u00a0Vickie says, \"When I invite an interior decorator into my home, she asks me about my colour preferences, my favourite pieces of furniture, how we use our rooms and what changes we'd like to make. \u00a0Then, she presents me with some options and costs. Then I choose and we agree on a plan. \u00a0That's how I would like the medical professionals in my life to work with me.\" \u00a0The analogy of the decorator is an excellent one. \u00a0Caregivers need their clinicians to understand the medical and social realities of living with illness and they need options for treatment. Caregivers need support before, during and after taking treatment decisions with or for their loved ones. \u00a0 \n \n We need medical professionals to be accessible. \u00a0Caregivers nod their heads in collective understanding when one of their own sighs, \"My son has epilepsy and yesterday he had a strange new kind of seizure that worried me. Our next neurology appointment is four months away. I'm not sure what to do or who to tell.\" \u00a0So often caregivers at home with very sick or disabled loved ones have only two options: call 911 or do nothing. \u00a0For any frail or complex patient, the emergency room is a risky place to be. But new symptoms that occur can be difficult for caregivers to read - they could be life-threatening or completely benign. \u00a0Caregivers need help navigating the system and a health care professional with access to the patient's record should be accessible to give advice.\u00a0 \n \n We need the medical system to serve the needs of families, not just the systemic need for accountability and resource management. And caregivers want to work in partnership with professionals who have the knowledge and expertise to advise us and support us in caring for the people we love.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thecaringexperience.ca/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gzo2UOR0zBM/VleRqh9CZcI/AAAAAAAACc8/KSbo2kLsYjU/s1600/ona_challenges0713_app_427460.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/in/vickie-cammack-9523908"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/11/what-do-caregivers-need-from-health.html", "title": ""},

They use technology to support their brother in his caregiving. \u00a0Neighbours, friends and work colleagues drop by with groceries and home cooked meals. \u00a0They do\nthis so that a son can give care to his mother without distraction. \n \n \n \n\u2018I care for you because you cared for me\u2019 represents the\nethic of reciprocity that children of the frail elderly cite as an important\nmotivation for caregiving. \u00a0  When\ncaregivers decide to devote time, energy and kindness to an elderly parent,\nthey have made a moral decision about what is right under the circumstances.  \u00a0 And that moral decision is one that is rooted\nin love as well as duty. \u00a0\u00a0 Parents of children with\ndisabilities or spouses of people with chronic illness make this decision, too.\n \u00a0They make it every day, often over a period of many years. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Eva Kittay, a philosopher and mother of a young woman with severe disabilities, also cared for her mother until she died. \u00a0Eva coined the term 'doulia' to describe the concept of caring for the caregiver so that she could care for a loved one without distraction. \u00a0She says, \u00a0\" There is a notion I\ncall \u2018doulia\u2019 which I define as the public responsibility to provide support\nfor the caregiver so that the caregiver can give care without depleting herself\nand her resources.\" \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 There is a saying \u201cYou can\u2019t pour from an empty cup.\u00a0\u00a0Fill yourself up first so you can then overflow.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we see someone giving care, we pour in her cup.\u00a0\u00a0And the pouring and overflowing repeats itself in every family, in every culture. \u00a0Sometimes, it happens naturally and sometimes this process requires intention. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere is no better time than the Holiday Season to reflect on love, family, intention and the good in supporting caregivers. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xuPL11YMTSg/VmHNXxw7CII/AAAAAAAACd0/wcGHff2CWP0/s1600/reciprocity1.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/12/what-goes-around-comes-around-in-caring.html", "title": ""},

Is representing your loved one to medical professionals and to the wider world an important part of your caregiving? \n \n \n \nWhere there is no vision, people perish. Proverbs 29:18 \n \n \n \n \n \n Image courtesy of  Tom Hussey's Mirror of Youth  Prize Winning Series.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy mother and I arrive at the emergency ward. \u00a0  She is dizzy and confused. \u00a0  She complains that her heart is\npounding. \u00a0  She has been nauseous and\nfeverish for the last few days. \u00a0\n Alarmingly, she has no interest in cooking, her number one passion. \u00a0  She doesn\u2019t even want to walk into the\nkitchen. \u00a0  I am relieved that finally, she\nhas agreed to go to the hospital.  \n \n \n \nI provide the intake clerk with all her pertinent\ninformation - medical number, medications, my contact information. \u00a0  I provide most of her medical history. \u00a0  My mother haltingly describes her symptoms.\nHer sentences are incomplete. \u00a0  Her words\nare slurred. \u00a0  I do my best to fill in the\nblanks and describe the bright, vibrant articulate woman she is. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nMany tests are conducted. \u00a0\n Each time a new nurse, doctor or technician appears, we repeat the\ncontext, the symptoms and just as importantly how Mom was before she fell\nill. \u00a0  I describe her passion for\nbaking. \u00a0  I even slip in a mention of the\nelaborate birthday cakes that she still bakes and painstakingly decorates with\nher arthritic fingers for each of her four great grandchildren. \u00a0  I do this because I want them to see what I\nknow. \u00a0  I want to them appreciate what has\nbeen in my mother\u2019s life and spark what is possible.  \n \n \n \nHappily, the cause of my mother\u2019s distress is found to be\nsimple dehydration. \u00a0  A couple of bags of\nintravenous fluid and my mother is pretty much back to normal. \u00a0  When she asks me to go down to the hospital\nstore to buy her favourite cooking magazine, I finally relax. \u00a0  I can see her standing in the kitchen, baking\nup a storm once again. \u00a0  And as the\ndoctor gives my mother instructions to \u2018drink plenty of fluids and take it easy\nin the kitchen\u2019, I know she can envision it too. \n \n \n \nIt strikes me that one rarely hears the terms visionary to\ndescribe caregivers. \u00a0  Yet vision is\nindispensible when we take care. \u00a0  The\ncapacity to see what was, what is and what can be for family members and\nfriends is a critical role that no professional care provider, no matter how\ntrained or prepared, can perform.  \n \n \n \nBut having vision is not enough. We must help others see\nwhat we see. \u00a0  Caregiving requires us to\nshare our knowledge with certainty, our intuitions with confidence and our\nstories with pride. \u00a0  When we do this, we not\nonly provide critical care information, we illuminate everyone\u2019s capacity to\nbring actions into being that bridge the past and the present to the future. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vanierinstitute.ca/fic_vickie-cammack", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0foMER5h-iA/VlBxV1WwVPI/AAAAAAAACcU/B-1sLicOntQ/s1600/Mirror%2Bof%2BYouth2.jpeg", "http://www.tomhussey.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y2-_6Ov2TIY/VlBxuV2mw6I/AAAAAAAACcc/G3eRchvqsnM/s1600/Apple-Mirror.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/11/double-vision-in-er-do-they-see-what-i.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n This morning, there is a medical appointment in my diary. \u00a0It's not a specialist clinic for our son Nicholas; it's for me. \u00a0I'm going to review my spinal xrays with our GP. \u00a0I've abused my spine by lifting Nicholas throughout his life and Natalie when she was small. Now, I have degenerative disc disease and my neck and back are causing pain that interferes with my happiness and my mobility. I might be a danger on the road because I can't turn my head to see the car behind me!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n All of this got me thinking about how we parents of children with disabilities manage to cope when we\u2019re ill or injured.\u00a0 We can\u2019t book off our children\u2019s care for a day or two if we get the flu.\u00a0 So how can we plan for the times when even the most determined and attentive parent will be so sick that help is a necessity just to keep everyone fed, bathed and safe? \n \n \n \n Once, I came down with viral meningitis.\u00a0 Natalie was a toddler and Nicholas was four or five.\u00a0 At that time, an older teenager called Cali lived with us to help me with nursing and childcare at home.\u00a0 She and I worked hard to keep my two complicated children safe and healthy.\u00a0 But when meningitis made me realise that no amount of willpower could get me out of bed, I felt desperate.\u00a0 I cried to Cali, 'what are we going to do?\u00a0 You can\u2019t look after the kids by yourself!\" \u00a0My husband was travelling on business and we were living abroad, so we had no family nearby. \n \n \n \n But Cali had a family and it was her mother who came to stay. \u00a0Mrs. Roffey came to cook, do laundry, play with Natalie and spread a sense of calm and control throughout our home.\u00a0 I was lucky that within a week, I was out of bed and back to my usual routine.\u00a0 I can\u2019t imagine how awful that week would have been if Mrs. Roffey hadn\u2019t been our guardian angel. \n \n \n \n CREATING THE EMERGENCY PLAN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A caregiver 'angel' isn\u2019t available to every caregiver, though. \u00a0That means it's essential to have an emergency plan in place for when the caregiver is too ill to carry out life-sustaining responsibilities.\u00a0 For those tag-teaming with their spouse or another competent adult, an emergency plan could be as simple as promising to step in for the other in case of illness or emergency. \n \n For single caregivers, the best place to start in thinking about creating an emergency plan is by making a list of anyone who has been helpful (or offered to be helpful) in the past.\u00a0 It's a good idea to have a 'Plan A' and a 'Plan B'.\u00a0 Write a draft email to a couple of prospective surrogate caregivers who have the willingness and ability to care for your child (or learn the ropes quickly).\u00a0 Explain that you are creating an emergency care plan for your home and you are asking for a commitment of help to replace you, the caregiver, if you become temporarily incapacitated. \u00a0Leave no stone unturned to explore other sources of emergency assistance as well.\u00a0 If you have a social worker, ask what they suggest.\u00a0 Local community centres and churches sometimes have committees that can handle such family crises.\u00a0 In the case of emergency care for school age children, schools are a natural partner in crisis scenario planning and so are other disability parents. \n \n \n \n An emergency respite plan is a good thing to have.\u00a0 And beginning that conversation with friends, family and neighbours could lead to greater awareness of your role as a caregiver and your need for regular respite.\u00a0 The emergency planning might be an opportunity to create a network of care for your loved one.\u00a0 Either way, like making a will or planning a fire escape route from your home, emergency planning in the event of caregiver illness is a great insurance policy against true catastrophe. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZEWaxpf50Is/VkzQaBscfXI/AAAAAAAACcE/S_ifHZRwd00/s1600/New%2BImage.png"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/11/parents-of-kids-with-disabilities-dont.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If you watched \u201cStill Alice,\u201d you\nwill have a better idea of what a person with Alzheimer\u2019s goes through.\nEspecially if you have a parent with this disease, you will know how it feels\nlike to be in their shoes. \n \n \n \n \u201cThe poet Elizabeth Bishop once wrote: 'the\nArt of Losing isn't hard to master: so many things seem filled with the intent\nto be lost that their loss is no disaster.' I'm not a poet, I am a person\nliving with Early Onset Alzheimer's, and as that person I find myself learning\nthe art of losing every day. Losing my bearings, losing objects, losing sleep,\nbut mostly losing memories...\u201d\u00a0 \n \n Alice Rowland, Still Alice \n \n \n \n Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive and fatal disorder of the brain.\nIt is unpredictable in a way that some patients with this disease can be sick\nfor a long period of up to 20 years or die within just a few years.\nUnfortunately, as in the case of Alice Rowland, the earlier you have AD, the faster\nthe disease will progress. In the US, there are approximately 5.3 million\nAmericans with Alzheimer\u2019s and every  71 seconds , someone develops\nthis disease with two thirds of them being women.  \n \n \n \n If\nyou are caring for someone with AD, you, too, will need help. Just like being a\nparent for a newborn is a 24-hour, often tiring and draining job, caring for\nsomeone in your family with AD is very similar. More so if you have your own\nfamily, your spouse and your children, to care for. There are, though, steps\nyou can take, so that the task will not take its toll on you both physically\nand mentally. You can start by understanding Alzheimer\u2019s, what the symptoms\nare, and identifying what you can do for your parent with AD to make the task\nof caring for them more manageable.  \n \n \n \n Their Symptom:  First, a person with AD will have gradual memory loss.\nThey might place their cellphone in the fridge or step out of the house and forget\nhow to get back. This is why a person with AD needs 24/7 help. From day to day,\nthe disease progresses and they lose a part of themselves every single day.\nWhat they remembered yesterday, may be totally unknown to them today.  \n \n Your Need:  As someone caring for a parent with AD, you too will need\ntime for yourself and of course, for your own family. If you cannot afford to\nhire someone full time, get someone to help you for a few hours a day. That\nshould cut the cost of a full time caregiver. Another option is to alternate\ncaring for your parent with a sibling or another relative.  \n \n What you can do:  To help you cope with this symptom, you can start by\n\u201cAD-proofing\u201d your home. Have signs all over your home that will \u201cspeak\u201d to\nyour parent with AD, such as a note beside their bed that says, \u201cring this bell\nif you need my help\u201d or \u201cthis way to the kitchen.\u201d You will still need to check\non them frequently, but these signs will give you some extra time to prepare or\nto do other things. There are also therapies and medications that can help with\nthis symptom, so bringing your parent to the doctor will not only help them,\nbut you, as well, as the caregiver.  \n \n \n \n Their Symptom:  Y our loved one will be confused\nmost of the time. There may be a point when they no longer know how to wear\ntheir shoes or their shirt. They will forget your\nname or even that you are their child. \n \n Your Need:  You need to be recognized for the care that you are giving\nand the sacrifices you are doing for your parent. This is normal and you do not\nneed to feel ashamed that you will feel this way. Unfortunately, you will not\nbe able to get it from your parent due to their memory loss.  \n \n What you can do:  Caring for a loved one who does not remember you can be depressing.\nYour solace is in your family. Explain the symptoms to them and how they can\nhelp. It is hard enough for you to be feeling unrecognized. It will be harder\nstill for you to have to answer questions from family who do not understand the\ndisease. When possible, have another member of your family with you when you\nand your loved one with AD goes to the doctor, so they can get information and\nexplanation first hand. Make sure, also, that another member of your family can\nget access to  medical records  or information record of\nhow fast the disease is progressing, etc. for emergency cases and you cannot be\naround. Spend time with your family when you can and find comfort that they\nrecognize your sacrifices and your hard work.  \n \n \n \n Their Symptom:  Your parent will suffer from poor judgement, which can be\ndangerous for them and everyone around them. They may attempt to cook, but will\nno longer know how to use an oven or a stove. If this is the case, your parent\nis at risk of causing fire. They may also attempt to drive, but will not know\nhow to operate the vehicle and as a result harm themselves or others.  \n \n Your Need:  The poor judgement of your loved one can be detrimental to\nyou, too. You need to feel safe when you are caring for your loved one.  \n \n What you can do:  Again, you cannot do the job alone. Discuss the symptom\nwith your family and solicit their help and support. Your safety, as much as\nthe safety of everyone in your household is also important. The more your\nfamily understands the disease, the more they can help you. For example, make\nsure that everyone knows to lock the door when they leave. This reduces that\nchances of your parent leaving the house unassisted. All sharp objects should\nbe kept in drawers or places far from the reach of your parent with AD. At\nnight, when everyone is asleep, your parent might decide to get up and cook or\ngo to the garage for some woodwork. You can consider placing a pressure alarm\non the bed so that when your parent gets up, an alarm will alert you that they\nare leaving their bed and possibly their room. If you cannot find this type of\nalarm, you may also use a baby monitor. You can also give your parent the\nfreedom to walk around the house, but make sure that you always know where they\nare and can be there to assist them when needed.  \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Finally, taking\ncare of your with AD will allow you to express your love and affection. On the\nother hand, it can also be overwhelming and when it comes to the point when it\nis too much for you to handle, both physically and emotionally, have a plan in\nplace for you to  get more help .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n There is a poem about AD\nthat goes like this:  \n \n Don\u2019t\nask me to remember \n \n Don\u2019t\nask me to understand \n \n I am\nconfused beyond your concept \n \n I am\nsad, sick and lost \n \n Just\nremember that I need you \n \n That the\nbest of me is gone \n \n Please\ndon\u2019t fail to stand beside me \n \n Love me\n\u2018till my life is done \n \n \n \n AD is a cruel disease, but it is a human disease and the\nlove for your parent is what will get you through it. It is also by keeping your loved\nones such as family, other relatives and friends close that you, yourself will\nget through caring your for parent with AD.  \n \n \n \n Marie Miguel is an avid internet researcher. She is fuelled by her determination to answer the many questions she hasn't been able to find the answer to anywhere else. When she finds these answers she likes to spread the knowledge to others seeking help.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nA Guest Post by Vee Cecil \n \n \n \nCaring for a loved one with  Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease  is an incredible challenge, both physically and emotionally. Often,\nprimary caregivers are spouses who are also aging and sometimes have health\nissues of their own. It\u2019s not uncommon for Alzheimer\u2019s caregivers to neglect\ntheir own health and well-being out of fear that leaving their loved one even\nfor a short time would cause distress.  \n \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Alzheimer\u2019s caregivers are also \nreluctant  to ask family and friends for help with their caregiving duties.\nOften, they don\u2019t want others to view them as incapable of managing their loved\none\u2019s care, or they don\u2019t wish to place unnecessary burdens on friends and\nloved ones.  \n \nWhat they don\u2019t often realize is that many of their family\nmembers and friends would be honored to help, but they may not know how they\ncan help. If you know someone who is caring for a loved one with Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease, there are many ways you can offer help and support.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Be Specific with Your Offer to Help  \n \nMany people who want to help another person in some way take\na broad approach, with questions such as, \u201cIs there anything I can do to help\nyou?\u201d \n \nTo this question, the response is almost always, \u201cThank you,\nbut no, I\u2019m fine.\u201d  \n \nWhether caregivers realize it or not, they do need help. But\nbecause they\u2019re not likely to ask for it or even accept it, it\u2019s up to those of\nyou who want to alleviate some of their burden to be specific. Instead of asking\nif you can help, frame your questions to  offer\na specific service , such as picking items up from the grocery store,\noffering to help with laundry or other household tasks, or bringing dinner.  \n \n \n \n Offer a Shoulder to Lean On  \n \nThe emotional challenges of caring for a loved one with\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease are often the most impactful. When a care recipient has\ndifficult symptoms such as agitation, wandering, or aggression, the toll of\nbeing constantly \u201con\u201d can wreak havoc on even the strongest individual\u2019s\nemotional health.  \n \nEvery  caregiving\nsituation  is unique. Every family has its own differences, and every\nAlzheimer\u2019s patient has a unique disease progression. Even the symptoms of\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease affect patients in very different ways at varying levels of\nseverity, at times differing from one day to the next.  \n \nOne thing everyone can do who wants to help an Alzheimer\u2019s\ncaregiver is quite simple: Offer a shoulder to lean on or an ear for listening.\nIn the process of offering this type of support, you\u2019ll learn about the\nspecific challenges the caregiver is facing. Through these conversations,\nyou\u2019ll uncover specific ways you can help that will be most meaningful.  \n \n \n \n A Few Things That May Help Alzheimer\u2019s Caregivers \n \nBecause each situation is unique and every caregiver\u2019s needs\nare different, it may take some investigating to figure out the best way to\nhelp someone who is reluctant to admit that they could use assistance. Here are\na few ideas for  specific\nways  you can offer help to someone who is caring for a loved one with\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Offer to mow the lawn, and mention a specific\nday you\u2019re available to do so. \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Bring a basket full of cleaning supplies and\noffer to clean the house. Don\u2019t be pushy; if it\u2019s not a good time, schedule\nanother day to come back, and stick to it. \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Mention that you\u2019re going to the store and ask\nwhat supplies you can pick up for her. Don\u2019t ask \u201cif\u201d there is anything you can\npick up, but \u201cwhat\u201d she needs. \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Volunteer to run errands, such as picking up\nmedication from the pharmacy. \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Offer to take the person with Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease to an appointment. \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Give a\nthoughtful gift , such as a gift certificate for a massage and a coupon for\nyour services to provide respite care while she\u2019s being pampered. A card with a\nsincere, personal note letting her know you\u2019re thinking of her and are there\nfor support is often meaningful, too. \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Offer to provide respite care or handle a few\nday-to-day tasks to allow the caregiver to get some rest or time away. For\nexample, you might offer to  wash \nthe Alzheimer\u2019s patient\u2019s hair, trim their nails, or wash their clothes. These\nare tasks that are helpful to the caregiver and will make the person with\nAlzheimer\u2019s feel refreshed and clean. \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Simply be a  friend .\nA simple phone call to ask a caregiver how they\u2019re doing gives them a connection\nto the outside world and helps them feel less isolated.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nGuest Post by Maria Ramos \n \nAs life expectancies have grown over the years, many people\nare living longer than ever before. This is undoubtedly a good thing, but it\nplaces certain stresses on those who care for the elderly. Besides taking care\nof an aged parent or loved one, many individuals provide care for disabled or\notherwise incapacitated adults and children. All told, approximately 39 percent\nof adults in the United States are caregivers, according to  research\nby Pew . They devote their time, energy and sometimes significant amounts of\nmoney to ensure the wellbeing of their loved ones. November is  National\nFamily Caregivers Month  and this year's theme is \u201cRespite: Care for\nCaregivers.\u201d It's only fitting, therefore, to examine the ways in which\ncaregiving can be made easier especially in light of the advanced technologies\nthat are available today. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThose who are unable to properly care for themselves are\nsubject to sudden emergencies, which leave  caregivers\nworried and feeling helpless . With personal emergency response equipment,\nemergency services can be summoned directly by the individual in question\nmerely by pressing a button.  Lifeline ,\n Rescue Alert  and several other firms\noffer this type of product, which typically requires a monthly subscription.\nWith these systems, seniors can stay at home by themselves yet still avail\nthemselves of help when it's required. \n \n \n \nThe elderly and those with reduced mobility stand to gain\nenormously from developments in the field of  home\nautomation . Adjusting thermostats, turning lights on and off and operating\nhome appliances all pose problems for those who have difficulty taking proper\ncare of themselves. By letting sophisticated machines do the tough work,\ncaregivers don't have to personally ensure that temperatures are okay, lighting\nis adequate and the proper security precautions are employed. Indeed, with the\nright automated  security\nsystem , the authorities can be alerted whenever there's a break-in or other\nworrisome event, and these systems can be controlled by senior citizens without\ntheir having to get up and move around.  \n \n \n \nOne of the most difficult tasks facing caregivers is making\nsure that the right medications are taken at the appropriate times and\nfrequencies. Electronic pillboxes can make this chore simple by automatically\ndispensing drugs, tracking consumption and alerting caregivers when a dose has\nbeen missed.  Tabsafe  and  MedMinder  are two such solutions that\nallow for the review of past information using web interfaces, making things\neasier for patient and caregiver alike. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith the use of the right sensors, keeping tabs on family\nmembers from afar becomes simple.  Motion sensing\nequipment  can let you know if your loved one has left the house or what\nroom he or she is in. Because you can access this information from your\ncellphone or other mobile device, there's no need to physically go to the\nsenior's home as often to make sure that everything is okay. Other sensors can\nbe attached to items that tend to get lost, like keys or TV remotes. When an\nobject is missing, the user can press a button to have the sensor beep, making\nit easy to locate. \n \n \n \nCertain wearable devices contain GPS equipment that will inform\nyou through text message or email when the wearer leaves specific geographical\nlocations.  MedicAlert  and the  Alzheimer's Association  have joined forces to\noffer a service whereby the caregivers of dementia sufferers are automatically\nnotified if the system determines that the patient is wandering around. \n \n \n \nUsing modern technology for  elderly\ncare  provides a double boon: Not only is the senior's life made easier, but\ncaregivers can accomplish their duties without spending as much time on them.\nNow that routine chores can be automatically handled, patients and caregivers\ncan devote their energies to more productive and enjoyable pursuits, enhancing\nquality of life for everyone concerned. \n \n \n Maria is a freelance writer currently living in Chicago.

{"date": "", "body": "\nOn the eve of the first day of National Family Caregivers Month, I've decided to plant a stake in the ground for the dignity of our stories in the media. \u00a0Here's what  I read in my news feed  this morning and what I wrote in response.  \n \n \n \n \n ine Goldberg her mother, Lily, who suffers from dementia, at the Jewish General Hospital in 20 TE \n \n \n SHARE ADJUST COMMENT PRIN A \n \n \nAlthough Francine Goldberg\u00a0was once director of an Alzheimer\u2019s support group in Montreal, nothing prepared her for her own mother\u2019s\u00a0dementia.\u00a0Her mother Lily, now 91, was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia about\u00a0three years ago, and\u00a0by then was no longer able to\u00a0live independently. \n \nWhen Goldberg, an administrator of a downtown Montreal health clinic, brought her mother home to live with her, the learning curve was steep and the costs high, both financially and emotionally. She\u00a0wished someone had\u00a0warned her to\u00a0get a mandate and a power of attorney to look after a parent\u2019s affairs. \n \nAlthough she knew\u00a0 the challenges of eldercare are considerable , no one\u00a0warned her that caregiving would\u00a0take over her life.\u00a0Goldberg eventually consulted a therapist to help her with the\u00a0depression and disarray. \n \n\u201cThe moment she came to my\u00a0house, I was afraid to leave her alone,\u201d Goldberg\u00a0said, because of the unpredictability of the illness,\u00a0which\u00a0can cause\u00a0psychosis, hallucinations and bizarre behaviour. For example, her mother sometimes threatened to break windows and slash her wrists. Goldberg has called the police out of fear for her mother\u2019s life, and Lily\u00a0was admitted to a hospital for emergency care more than once. \n \n \n Lily Latowsky Goldberg enjoys a happy moment with dogs Bob (left) Nelly (right) and Mickey at the home of her daughter Francine\u00a0in\u00a02014. \u00a0 JOHN KENNEY \u00a0/\u00a0 THE GAZETTE \n \n \nNo one told her,\u00a0Goldberg says, how to live with an appalling disease\u00a0that changes a once\u00a0kind and loving mother into\u00a0an aggressive, hysterical woman, who throws things and yells obscenities and threatens to tell everyone\u00a0that she is kept in jail against her will. \n \nNo one talked about the dirty diapers on the floor. No one mentioned the possibility of having feces thrown at you, no one explained how to coax\u00a0a\u00a0crying\u00a0mother into the\u00a0shower. She never foresaw having to\u00a0rush home from work\u00a0because the hired caregiver couldn\u2019t cope. \n \nLily was rejected from a private nursing home because she was a difficult patient. Goldberg tried\u00a0a public long term nursing facility, or CHSLD, but took her mother home again after\u00a0she curled up on the bed and refused food. \n \nLily now lives\u00a0in a public facility, which she believes is a lovely hotel. \n \n\u201cNo one tells you about the overwhelming guilt,\u201d Goldberg says. \n \n cfidelman@montrealgazette.com \n \n Donna Thomson \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \n \n Author \u00a0at\u00a0 Author \n \n \n \n \n I have been a family caregiver all of my adult life and I am the author of a book titled The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving. I applaud this series for shining a light on family caregivers and our need for greater support. I'm disappointed though, that existing bilingual supports such as The Caregiver Network ( http://thecaregivernetwork.ca/ ) weren't mentioned and I'm especially disappointed in Ms. Fidelman's decision to highlight the sordid aspects of caregiving life and exclude the intimate, joyful moments such as this one where an Alzheimer's suffer er recognizes her daughter and tells her, \"I love you.\"\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKBcE4KhFPc . A life of caregiving includes the full range of human emotion and we must tell the whole story - the difficult and the deeply wonderful. Caregivers need support and we need all levels of government and society to give us that support, because as Rosalind Carter said, \"There are four kinds of people in the world: Those who have been caregivers, those who currently are caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need caregivers.\" But in advocating for ourselves and our loved ones, we must uphold the dignity of our vulnerable family members whom we love and protect. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/aging-well/quebecs-eldercare-challenge-no-one-tells-you-how-hard-it-is-caregivers-say", "http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/aging-well/quebecs-eldercare-challenge-no-one-tells-you-how-hard-it-is-caregivers-say#", "http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/aging-well/quebecs-eldercare-challenge-no-one-tells-you-how-hard-it-is-caregivers-say#", "http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/aging-well/quebecs-eldercare-challenge-no-one-tells-you-how-hard-it-is-caregivers-say#", "https://www.blogger.com/null", "http://montrealgazette.com/tag/eldercare", "mailto:cfidelman@montrealgazette.com", "https://www.facebook.com/donna.thomson.35", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Author/108744805817575", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Author/142247449129909", "http://thecaregivernetwork.ca/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKBcE4KhFPc"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/10/can-we-please-advocate-for-caregiver.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nRight now I'm in Toronto at the annual conference of the\u00a0 Ontario Association of Children's Treatment Services . I'm learning valuable lessons for ALL caregivers and of course I had to share them here. Today,\u00a0 Sonia Lupien , the Director the\u00a0 Centre for Studies on Human Stress \u00a0revealed to me how stress works and how it's possible to understand and control it. \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to Dr. Lupien, there are four basic triggers for all stress and an easy way to remember them is with the acronym NUTS. \u00a0Stress triggers are either Novel, Unpredictable, a Threat to the ego, Sense of little control. Our early human evolutionary history programmed us to react to the threat of the woolly mammoth. \u00a0Sensing that our life is in danger, we instinctively react by fighting or fleeing. \u00a0Either way, our body is flooded with energy boosting hormones. \u00a0The problem with many caregivers is that we are often in a state of stress - ready to fight or flee - even when our lives are not actually in danger. This persistent state of heightened hormonal stress response doesn't serve us well and it can actually make us sick, especially over time.  \n \nSo, how can we begin to control our stress response and rule it, rather than be victim to our extreme emotions day after day? \u00a0Dr. Lupien explains her strategy for calming our hearts and minds here: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDr. Lupien's research reveals the secrets of what strategies work to alleviate stress. \u00a0One calming element is social support, but the surprising finding is that GIVING someone else social support is even more beneficial to stressed out caregivers than receiving it.\u00a0\u00a0Fleeing instead of fighting sometimes works to alleviate stress - removing yourself from situations that cause stress can be beneficial, even if it's for a short break to pause and reflect. \u00a0But if you chronically flee, that can be a problem. Deconstructing and reconstructing... understanding nature of the stressor and then consciously locating a strategy to deal with it is in itself a calming process.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe second type of stress alleviation is the 'quick fix'. \u00a0Deep breathing, laughing, exercising and especially singing all work to lower pulse, blood pressure, cortisol levels (or stress response) and increase a feeling of overall wellbeing.\u00a0 \u00a0One study \u00a0revealed that singing in a choir not only reduced stress but boosted singers' immune systems as well.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nBut stress isn't only bad for us, it's bad for our loved ones too. \u00a0When we are stressed, our negative emotions literally spill over to flood those we love. That's one good reason to take a time out if possible, when anxiety and feelings of helplessness threaten to overwhelm.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAnother effective stress-busting technique I learned about at this conference is\u00a0 mindful meditation . \u00a0That will be the topic of my next post, so stay tuned.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.oacrs.com/", "http://www.iusmm.ca/research/researchers/researchers/sonia-lupien.html", "http://www.humanstress.ca/stress.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8ozlmiph4NQ/VjigFuMWs0I/AAAAAAAACaU/YQQLFc6ipaQ/s1600/Logo_CESH_EN.gif", "http://www.humanstress.ca/stress-and-you/daily-fix/daily-fix/grab-your-microphones-sing-to-reduce-your-stress.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/11/caregiver-stress-how-to-call-it-and_3.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nOnce, I tried relaxation exercises. \u00a0  I was hopeless. \u00a0  In an earlier life, I was an acting student\nand for actors, it\u2019s important to relax your body and focus intently on listening\nto others.  \u00a0 For me, there was something\ninfuriating about being told to lie still and concentrate on my breathing. \u00a0  I wanted to jump up and start yelling. \n \n \n \nSo a couple of days ago, when I participated in a mindful\nmeditation workshop for caregiving parents of children with disabilities, I\nwasn\u2019t expecting any gold stars.  \u00a0 I\nimagined that I knew something about mindfulness and meditation. \u00a0  After all, I read about it in my Facebook\nfeed sometimes and I\u2019ve tried that \u2018chewing a raisin for five minutes with my\neyes closed\u2019 exercise. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nBut the workshop I attended made me realize that I knew\nNOTHING about mindfulness or its healing powers. \u00a0Karen Dillon (from the  Children's Treatment Network ) and  Stephanie Moeser  (a clinician in private practice)\u00a0 are both social workers who have made it their business to study the benefits of mindfulness and teach them to caregivers. \u00a0They offer their workshop to carers and clinicians alike and I had the privilege of attending with a group of parents of children with disabilities. \u00a0Mindfulness helps ALL caregivers though, and I found myself thinking about both Nicholas and my Mom during the workshop. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \nKaren and Stephanie began by introducing us to the work of mindfulness pioneer, physician and author  John Kabat-Zinn . \u00a0Here he being profiled on 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper. \u00a0Fascinating! \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everyone took something different away from this workshop. \u00a0Mindfulness is a highly individual endeavour. \u00a0For me, the analogy of not being alone in the shower was striking. \u00a0My mind is always whirring away with conversations playing back, recitations of to-do lists, forgotten tasks breaking through reverie with a sudden 'Oh damn!' coming out of my mouth reflexively. \u00a0No, I am never alone in the shower. \u00a0I really liked the exercises involving movement too (remember, I hate stillness). \u00a0So walking slowly in bare feet is something I'd like to try. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n It's funny, I remember unwittingly practicing some of these techniques in my loneliest days of caring at home. \u00a0I recall peeling potatoes in the sink and really looking at my hands. \u00a0I concentrated on the rhythm of the motion and I savoured a grateful sense of pride that I was feeding my family in this work. \u00a0Now I know to call that thoughtful intention 'Mindfulness'. \u00a0Now I know that it can soothe anxious hearts, painful joints, lonely thoughts - mindfulness has the potential to accomplish that beautiful magic trick of helping us to care for ourselves and our loved ones at the same time.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nRemember, November is National Caregivers' Month. \u00a0Give yourself the gift of mindfulness - you'll be helping yourself AND your loved one.\u00a0 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ctnsy.ca/", "https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/name/Stephanie_Moeser_BSW,MSW,RSW_Peterborough_Ontario_173555", "https://www.blogger.com/John%20Kabat-Zinn%20http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/about-us/people/2-meet-our-faculty/kabat-zinn-profile/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/11/this-worked-to-quiet-my-mind.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nMy husband Jim and I are soaking our feet after a long walk through pine forests and seaside cliff sides in north-eastern Spain. \u00a0We are on holiday. \n \n \n \n \n \nAs I walked today, I thought about being away from our son and my Mom. \u00a0Taking two weeks from home and fragile loved ones is a tricky business for many reasons, not the least of which is guilt. \u00a0I'll admit it - I feel a bit wistful, but not guilty and that's because my husband and I planned the heck out of this trip. \u00a0Feeling happy and at peace while away is a very personal matter. For me, I need to know that everyone in our circles of care has our itinerary, contact numbers and that any important events or appointments have been rescheduled till after our return. \u00a0I need regular, written updates on how it's going back home and I need to skype often so that I can see my loved ones up close even though I'm far away. \u00a0Most of all, I need to trust that Nick and Mom are being cared for very well at home, and I do. \u00a0We are blessed with a great team and a loving extended family. \n \nEveryone needs a holiday sometimes, especially caregivers! \u00a0It can be difficult to begin thinking about taking time off, but vacations pay huge dividends to you and to your loved one. A rest and a change helps to build positive attitudes, appreciation of each other and resilience for the long haul.  \n \nSome caregivers will choose to go away, leaving instructions to call only the case of emergency. \u00a0Others will want daily phone or email updates so they can relax by knowing that all is well. \u00a0Everyone's comfort level is different and there is no right or wrong in planning for the type of reassurance a caregiver needs to feel relaxed.  \n \nWhether or not your loved one lives at home or in a care facility, you will need to create a detailed travel itinerary along with contact details. \u00a0Let folks at home know how often you plan to be in touch and what kind of information you need from them while you're away (that way there are no surprises and they're ready to give a report when you call or email). \n \n \nHere are some considerations in planning a vacation if your loved one lives  at home : \n \n \n \n Do you have care arranged during your time away that will meet the needs of your loved one? Do you trust this care? If you have hired agency staff, invest in enough training time before your departure to ensure that you feel good about the care arrangements. Take at least one whole day out of the house before going away to ensure that you can correct any errors or answer questions.\u00a0 \n Arrange visits from extended family and neighbours to check in or have a meal with your loved one.\u00a0 \n Ensure that food matters are all covered. \u00a0This could include grocery or meal delivery as well as planned outings to restaurants.\u00a0 \n Have a plan in place so that your loved one knows who to call for assistance of any kind during your absence. \u00a0 \n If you are travelling outside of your telephone area code, it's a good idea to purchase a roaming package from your phone provider (if you have a mobile phone). \u00a0This way, you can easily keep in touch by phone if that gives you comfort. \u00a0Using your mobile away from home without a plan can be very expensive. \n \n \nHere are some considerations in planning your vacation if your loved one lives  in a care facility : \n \n \n \n \n The most important special planning task for you will be to think about how you would like to communicate with paid care staff during your time away. \u00a0Being explicit about frequency and content of information sharing between care home and you on holiday is key. \u00a0Paid staff may be prone to feeling mistrusted or threatened if you hand them a list of your communication wishes without a friendly discussion first. Explain that you trust them, but that you need a lot of reassurance that everything is alright while you're away (if that is what you want). \u00a0Whatever it is that you believe paid staff can do to help you enjoy your holiday should be made clear to all concerned well before you leave.\u00a0 \n \n \nIf funds for time away are a barrier to your respite, consider getting in touch with agencies that offer holidays to long-term caregivers such as  CAREGIFTED . \u00a0A google search of 'Caregiver Relief Charity for Respite' came up with a number of community faith groups offering this assistance as well as others such as  The Caregiver Relief Fund .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nThe bottom line is, if you can manage it, a caregiver holiday is a very good thing - both for you, your loved one and your whole family. \u00a0It's an investment in your own mental health and the wellbeing of your family.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oJU3mYKWtf4/Vhqbt9JgpDI/AAAAAAAACYc/gV86mDYKN8U/s1600/MeSpain.jpg", "http://www.caregifted.org/", "https://multco.us/file/18189/download"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/10/im-caregiver-and-im-on-holiday.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n This morning, I\u2019m looking at a medical clinic appointment in my\ndiary. \u00a0It's not a specialist appointment for our son Nicholas - it's for\nme. \u00a0My family and good friends know that sometimes I have trouble\nswallowing food. \u00a0Occasionally, a dry piece of meat or bread will lodge\nitself in my 'throat' (actually closer to my breastbone) and no amount of\ndrinking water or purposeful swallowing will get it to budge. \u00a0So at this\nappointment, the doctor will use a scope to \u2018stretch\u2019 my esophagus and scrape\nout an overgrowth of webbed tissue that is responsible for my swallowing\nchallenges. \u00a0  Of course I\u2019m hoping that\nI\u2019ll be back to normal by the end of the day after the procedure. \n \n \n \n All this got me thinking about how we parents of children with\ndisabilities manage to cope when we\u2019re ill or injured. \u00a0  We can\u2019t book off our children\u2019s care for a\nday or two if we get the flu. \u00a0So how can we plan for the times when even\nthe most determined and attentive parent will be so sick that help is a\nnecessity just to keep everyone fed, bathed and safe?  \n \n \n \n Once, I came down with viral meningitis. \u00a0Natalie was a\ntoddler and Nicholas was four or five. \u00a0At that time, an older teenager\ncalled Cali lived with us to help me with nursing and childcare at home. \u00a0  She and I worked hard to keep my two\ncomplicated children safe and healthy. \u00a0\n But when meningitis made me realise that no amount of willpower could\nget me out of bed, I felt desperate. \u00a0I cried to Cali, 'what are we going\nto do? \u00a0You can\u2019t do Nick\u2019s nursing care and look after the baby by\nyourself!\" \u00a0My husband was travelling on business and we were living\nabroad, so we had no family nearby.  \n \n \n \n But Cali had a family and it was her mother who came to stay.\n\u00a0Mrs. Roffey came to cook, do laundry, play with Natalie and spread a\nsense of calm and control throughout our home. \u00a0I was lucky that within a\nweek, I was out of bed and back to my usual routine. \u00a0  I can\u2019t imagine how awful that week would\nhave been if Mrs. Roffey hadn\u2019t been our guardian angel.  \n \n \n \n CREATING THE EMERGENCY PLAN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A caregiver 'angel' isn\u2019t available to every caregiver, though.\n\u00a0That means it's essential to have an emergency plan in place for when the\ncaregiver is too ill to carry out life-sustaining responsibilities. \u00a0For\nthose tag-teaming with their spouse or another competent adult, an emergency\nplan could be as simple as promising to step in for the other in case of\nillness or emergency. \n \n For single caregivers, the best place to start in thinking about\ncreating an emergency plan is by making a list of anyone who has been helpful\n(or offered to be helpful) in the past. \u00a0It's a good idea to have a 'Plan\nA' and a 'Plan B'. \u00a0Write a draft email to a couple of prospective\nsurrogate caregivers who have the willingness and ability to care for your\nchild (or learn the ropes quickly). \u00a0Explain that you are creating an\nemergency care plan for your home and you are asking for a commitment of help\nto replace you, the caregiver, if you become temporarily incapacitated.\n\u00a0Leave no stone unturned to explore other sources of emergency assistance\nas well. \u00a0If you have a social worker, ask what they suggest. \u00a0Local\ncommunity centers and churches sometimes have committees that can handle such\nfamily crises. \u00a0In the case of emergency care for school age children,\nschools are a natural partner in crisis scenario planning and so are other\ndisability parents.  \n \n \n \n An emergency respite plan is a good thing to have. \u00a0And\nbeginning that conversation with friends, family and neighbors could lead to\ngreater awareness of your role as a caregiver and your need for regular\nrespite. \u00a0The emergency planning might be an opportunity to create a\nnetwork of care for your loved one. \u00a0Either way, like making a will or\nplanning a fire escape route from your home, emergency planning in the event of\ncaregiver illness is a great insurance policy against true catastrophe. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NfRa65Huef4/VfsC5150hDI/AAAAAAAACXA/-47M8IOjeXU/s1600/Plan.png"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/09/caregivers-get-sick-too-planning-for.html", "title": ""},

(indoors, walkway, garage, or carport). \u00a0  We would never advocate storing an expensive\nscooter outdoors or under a tarp (and people have told us they planned on doing\nthat!) \n \n 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Will the scooter be transported in a\nmotor vehicle? \u00a0  Does this require ramps\nor vehicle lifts to get the scooter into the vehicle? \n \n 4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Will the scooter be used as a Travel\nScooter on trips? (Carried onto airplanes or other modes of public\ntransportation like buses or trains?) \n \n 5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Does the Scooter User have special\nsize requirements? (the user is over 300 lbs or the user is super tall). \u00a0  Specialty sized scooters for the tallest\nand/or heaviest users do exist and careful consideration should be made to\nensure a proper fit. \n \n 6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Does the user have the hand-strength\nand dexterity to operate the scooter controls? \u00a0\n \n \n 7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Does the user have the cognitive\nability to navigate roadways, intersections, and all types of traffic? (auto\nand pedestrian traffic) \n \n 8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n If my favorite store(s) has electric\nshopping carts, do I really still require a scooter in my daily life? \n \n 9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Will the scooter be used in a gated\ncommunity or resort-like environment? \u00a0 Vendors such as  Parentgiving  sell\u00a0 scooters that go as fast as 18 mph   \u00a0and certain shopper segments gravitate to these car and golf-cart\n\u201calternatives\u201d in safer-to-navigate environments. \u00a0\n These types of scooters are becoming EXTREMELY popular and an\never-expanding assortment of custom colors, finishes, and accessories are\ndelivering more and more consumer choice to the discerning 55 and over\ncommunity scooter shopper. \n \n 10. \u00a0  If\nthe Scooter is for outdoor use, how far can it travel on a single charge? \u00a0  What is the roundtrip capacity for the\nScooter? \u00a0  If you plan on riding your\nscooter into town for a day of shopping (and back), does it have the charge\ncapacity to do so? \n \n 11. \u00a0  What\nKind of Accessories should I consider for my scooter? \u00a0  Just as in purchasing a car, the right\naccessories can deliver so much more satisfaction in daily usage. \u00a0  Anyone travelling in a scooter outside should\nconsider a safety flag for drivers to better recognize them. \u00a0  Other popular accessories include water\nbottles, extra batteries, and cup holders. \n \n 12. \u00a0  If\ndriving out of the home, will I ever be using the Scooter at night? \u00a0  Some scooters come with LED headlights and\ncan be driven at night. \u00a0  Others do not\ncome with lights and no after-market light system will make the scooter\neffective for night-time driving. \n \n \n \n Here are the most common types of mobility scooters: \n \n 3 Wheel Mobility Scooters \nThree Wheel Electric Scooters are the most common of all of the scooter types. \u00a0  These scooters are full featured, and can accommodate\nlarger and taller users, and are flexible enough to be used indoors at home or\noutside the home. \u00a0  This scooter type generally\noffers more spacious legroom for taller users, and is easier to use indoors\nwith its\u2019 smaller turn radius.  \u00a0 Scooters\nin this class often carry an array of features like arm rests, storage baskets,\nswivel seats and more. Maximum weight capacity varies, but many models go up to\n350 lbs and beyond.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n 4 Wheel Mobility Scooters \nFour Wheel Mobility scooters offer the most stable scooter platform, and with a\nwider wheelbase, are designed primarily for outdoor use.  \u00a0 Larger models can have studded tires and higher\nground clearance and can even travel over rugged terrain. Some models offer an\neffective travel range of 20 plus miles per charge and a top speed of 10 mph. Because\nof their stable four wheel design and platform, we often see larger weight\ncapacities in this scooter class. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Travel Mobility Scooters \nThese scooters are effortlessly folded and ready for transport and are perfect\nfor the person who likes to travel. Models in this category can disassemble\ninto 3 or 4 pieces for easy transport in the trunk of most cars.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nOn holiday in Cat Island, Bahamas recently, something happened.\u00a0 Regular readers of my blog might recall that\u00a0 I\u2019ve blogged about Cat Island before \u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s a remarkable place in its beauty, its simplicity and its authentic (but few) inhabitants.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nLast year, I visited an 87 year old firecracker called Miss Ella Sweeting.\u00a0 Back then, Miss Ella sang\u00a0 us a couple of rap songs and explained raucously that she had been banned from calling in to the Eleuthera radio station for over-using that privilege.\u00a0 She was, what you might call \u2018a going concern\u2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis year, I dropped in again to visit Miss Ella.\u00a0 Her straw work roadside stall was empty of wares, but the door was open, so I knocked and stepped inside.\u00a0 There was a tiny frail woman sitting by the television.\u00a0 She wore an ill-fitting black wig.\u00a0 I asked if Miss Ella was in.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m Miss Ella \u2013 that\u2019s me\u201d.\u00a0 But, it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 This woman was shrunken \u2013 her face sad.\u00a0 There was no light in her eyes and she had lost so much weight that I was forced to stare, searching for the Ella I knew. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe drove back to our little beach cottage and collected groceries and cash, delivering them to our elderly friend.\u00a0 Then I stopped in to \u201cYardies\u201d, a local conch shack and gas station down the road.\u00a0 I stopped the owner, Odette, and expressed my concern about Miss Ella\u2019s decline.\u00a0 \u201cYes\u201d, nodded Odette, \u201cher pension cheque ran out and she\u2019s getting old.\u00a0 She\u2019s just old, that\u2019s all.\u201d \n \n \n \nI have been thinking about that statement every day since we returned home from the island.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI wondered about why I thought Odette's acceptance of the \u00a0inevitability \u00a0of aging was so culturally different from my own ideas of infirmity. \u00a0Recently, my mother has been ill with complications of her own advanced age - she is 92. \u00a0I get frustrated with her when she refuses to call the doctor about her pain or dizzy spells. \u00a0I want my mother to seek medical attention and to be 'cured' of her ailments. \u00a0I am so used to pestering professionals about my son Nicholas' litany of conditions. \u00a0Most recently, I have been on the road and on the phone trying to sort out a recent jump in the number of seizures he suffers each day. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nOdette's voice has been in my head with her knowing, sad explanation to me of a simple fact of life - that life ends, and it's not easy, but.... there we are. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am a natural-born crusader and acceptance is a state that does not come to easily to me. \u00a0But I think I need to be more humble in the face of the forces of nature. \u00a0Nicholas has a disability that cannot be cured. \u00a0The clock cannot turn back the years that my mother has lived on this earth. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNext year, when we return to Cat Island, will Miss Ella greet me with a song or even a sigh? \u00a0I don't know. \u00a0But either way, I will return to Odette and seek her guidance on how to better accept the inevitability of struggle and pain in those we love. \n \n Listen to what Dr. Gerda Lerner says about aging \u00a0- her reflections are profound. \u00a0Dr. Lerner was a historian, author and teacher. \u00a0She was one of the founders of the field of women's history and taught history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Duke University. \n \n \n \nPost Script: Miss Ella Sweeting Larrimore-Thurston passed away on January 28, 2015. \u00a0 HERE  is her obituary.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GLZgJsc9t-8/UU7y05UUC9I/AAAAAAAAAuA/E75dgEjFbIA/s1600/P1060261.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aQUYkPKVoXw/UVjttF9dVaI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/5zB19_NPSd4/s1600/missella.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE8ljoS9rH4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE8ljoS9rH4", "http://www.tribune242.com/obituaries/2015/feb/27/ella-larrimore-thurston/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/09/from-treasure-chest-making-peace-with.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Resilience is a word that\u2019s thrown around a lot these\ndays. \u00a0  Everyone needs it and everyone\nwants it, especially people giving or receiving care. \u00a0  \u00a0 And\nthe truth is we all need resilience the most at times of big life changes or\ntransitions. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n We mine our reserves of strength and optimism when our\nchildren with disabilities graduate to high school, or even scarier \u2013\nadulthood. \u00a0  We look for ways of coping\nand remaining calm when our aging parents move from family homes into assisted\nliving accommodations. \u00a0  What exactly is\nresilience, and how can we all get some? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n To me, resilience is the ability to remain whole throughout\na process of change. \u00a0  Profound,\ntransformative change buffets us, threatening to fracture or morph us into\nforms of being that we no longer recognize as ourselves. \u00a0  Resilient people do not think about change as\nprimarily consisting of loss and they weather transition without being\ndestroyed by it.  \u00a0 They see their core as\nimpermeable and perceive change as just that: a transformation of their\nenvironment. \u00a0  Resilient people look at\ntheir new surroundings and ask, \u201cWhat can I do today with all of this?\u201d \n \n \n \n My husband\u2019s aunt Nellie is a geriatric\nphysiotherapist. \u00a0  She helps elderly\nresidents of Montreal to maintain their mobility and independence as long as\npossible. \u00a0  I asked her what she thought\nwas the principal ingredient of resilience in her clients. \u00a0  \u201cI think people who weather change the best\nare those who aren\u2019t alone\u201d, she said, and then added, \u00a0  \u201cThose who do well are the ones whose\nfamilies have talked WITH them all through the planning of a move.\u201d \u00a0  Nellie explained that when an elderly person\nhas a debilitating accident, for example, and is transported to a nursing home\nwithout prior discussions or consultations about the move, that individual is\nbound to be confused and heartbroken by his transition. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n I reflected on our family\u2019s move back to Canada from England\nin 2011. \u00a0  Our son Nicholas was to move\ninto a care home directly from the airport upon arrival. \u00a0  I thought about our entire family supporting\nNick with daily visits for months after his move. \u00a0  I thought about our long family discussions with\nNick about his impending move from home. I remembered that I bunked in with\nNick for the first couple of weeks in order to train staff and support our\nyoung man. \u00a0  Certainly he wasn\u2019t alone and\nfor sure, he had the opportunity to voice opinions, hopes and fears about what\nthe future might hold at his new address. \u00a0\u00a0\n That said, transition is never easy, because change is\nuncomfortable. \u00a0  It threatens our habitual\nways of being and stresses our sense of ease in daily life. \u00a0  From time to time Nicholas still expresses\nhis worries about his life away from us and we are there to listen. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Nick being welcomed to his new digs by family and friends - August 30, 2011 \n \n \n \n I think Nellie is right \u2013 helping someone (and ourselves) be\nresilient at times of transition is about understanding the power of group\nsupport and it\u2019s about talking through the change. \u00a0  The next time I feel threatened by a looming\ntransition in my family, I\u2019ll try to remember Nellie\u2019s good advice, because weathering\nchange with resilience makes us strong and wise \u2013 qualities that are like gold\n\u2013 beautiful and precious. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-isuR2R0dg7M/VfF5pHiColI/AAAAAAAACVc/x-MCtxCEHLc/s1600/Kintsukuroi-Collage.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--JefM9KNEvw/VfF-fV43jJI/AAAAAAAACVs/8D94HVtmWHY/s1600/P1050432.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/09/how-to-be-resilient-caregiver.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Guest Post by Stephanie March \n \n \n \n Even as we sit here, the battle continues. \u00a0  The evil enemy keeps spreading and threatens\nto consume everything. \u00a0  The best defense\nsystem in the world cannot stop the current onslaught of devastation. \u00a0  I am completely helpless against this silent\nmonster that is attacking my territory. \u00a0\n I can no longer claim ignorance of a war that had always seemed so far\naway. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n This time the threat is real and this time it is\npersonal. \u00a0  There are no guns or tanks to\nbe afraid of, only the name of the invisible terrorist from which there is no\nescape-  Alzheimer\u2019s . \n \n \n \n The shock of seeing my Grandfather in this role as a\nprisoner of war has rendered me speechless. \u00a0\n He sits before me in his favorite chair that he\u2019s had for as far back as\nmy memory will stretch. \u00a0  The large\nrecliner now overwhelms his body that has shrunk during his captivity. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Seemingly overnight, this man that now sits before\nme has replaced the statuesque man that used to tower over me. The only\nevidence of his contagious smile can be found within the deep lines framing his\nnow solemn face. \u00a0  The twinkle in his eyes\nis now hidden beneath a distant stare that promises to travel farther and farther\naway from the home in which he has lived, loved, and lost. \n \n \n \n My Grandmother\u2019s voice drifts into the living room\nfrom the kitchen where she is preparing a dinner that includes my Grandfather\u2019s\nfavorite deviled eggs. \u00a0  I hear her softly\nsinging  \u201cAmazing Grace \u201d over the banging\nof pans and pots. \u00a0  \u201cI once was lost but\nnow am found, was blind but now I seeee\u2026\u201d drifts into the room and hangs in the\nair like an omen. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Through it all- his memory loss, erratic mood\nswings, and eventual diapers - my Grandmother\u2019s faith has not faltered. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n The love and care she has provided for him\nthroughout his illness should be commended with nothing less than a Purple\nHeart medal, like the one my Grandfather earned during his military career.  \u00a0 I don\u2019t know how she does it. \u00a0\u00a0  As Assistant Professor of Nursing at  Bradley University , Cynthia M. Steinwedel\neloquently  states  \u201c Family caregivers are thrust into an ever-deepening,\ndemanding role of caring for a spouse or parent who gradually becomes\nincreasingly distant and yet dependent, unreachable and yet intrusive, lost and\nyet still present\u201d . \u00a0  And yet, despite\nit all, my Grandma faces losing the man she loves with a courage and strength\nthat I can never begin to comprehend.  \n \n \n \n My Grandfather\u2019s dog Pepper, bounds into the room\nand jumps up on Grandfather\u2019s blanket-covered lap. \u00a0  As though a secret switch had been flipped,\nhis face instantly lights up with love and amusement. \u00a0  I never thought I would see the day when my\nstrict and tidy Grandmother would allow an animal in her house. \u00a0  But she does it for him and for  how it helps him\ncope . \u00a0  \n \n \n \n He runs his paper-like hands over her silky black\nand brown body. \u00a0  Pepper sticks her tongue\nout and gives him a great big canine smile. \u00a0\n This 2-year-old loyal furry companion gives him a reason to get out of\nthe bed every day. \u00a0  After sniffing the\nair for hints of a turkey coming out of the oven Pepper runs hurriedly back\ninto the kitchen. \u00a0  My Grandfather\u2019s face\nreturns to its sleepy existence.  \n \n \n \n My chest aches with the desire to turn the mystery\nswitch back on and bring him back to life. \u00a0\n Blinking back tears, my gaze shifts out the window and onto the\nexpansive green lawn and perfectly trimmed trees. \u00a0  When I was a little girl he would sit me on\nhis knee as we rode on his tractor mower around that very yard. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n After my Grandfather removed the blades for safety we\nwould journey around the lawn like we were headed somewhere far away. \u00a0  My cousins and brother sat behind us in the\nbright red wagon that my Grandfather carefully anchored to the tractor. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Since those days long gone, one of my cousins passed\naway in a tragic car accident. \u00a0  My\nGrandparents were devastated by his death and could not believe that his time\nhad come before their own. \u00a0\u00a0  And now, my\nGrandfather prepares to be reunited with his Grandson.  \n \n \n \n \u00a0 As the\nafternoon sky turns shades of orange and pink, the room begins to darken. \u00a0  The corners of my mouth turn up as I remember\ncoming to visit when I was a little girl. \u00a0\n Much to my chagrin, my Grandmother would force me to eat healthy\nvegetables and drink endless glasses of milk. \u00a0\n But there were these precious occasions when my Grandfather would tell\nher he was taking me to eat a healthy lunch at the nearby cafeteria. \u00a0  Instead, we would end up sharing a big greasy\npizza and guzzling sodas. \u00a0  My Grandfather\nwould look across the table at me and wink\u2026 it was our little secret. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n I know that now he doesn\u2019t remember those moments\nand so I remember them for him. \u00a0  I will\ncarry them with me. \u00a0  The  memory loss of\nAlzheimer\u2019s  is difficult to witness. \u00a0  The\nslow destruction of buildings that took a lifetime to build. \u00a0  But there are still memories being made. \u00a0  Small moments of laughter. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n The air conditioner kicks on and he gives a little\nshiver. \u00a0  I get up and tuck his red and\nblack wool checkered blanket around him tighter. \u00a0  He likes to be wrapped up like a warm burrito\nand telling him this makes him laugh. \u00a0  A\ngood hearty laugh, his laugh. \u00a0  I see that\nfamiliar twinkle for a moment and it is this twinkle I will remember. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n As I kiss him on the forehead I regret all the times\nI was too busy to visit, too self-involved to ask about his life, and too blind\nto the fact that he would not always be here in his favorite chair. \u00a0  I struggle now to block the forming picture\nin my mind of his empty chair beside my Grandmother and her endless stack of\ncrossword puzzles. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n He will only disappear deeper into the vast unknown\nof the foreign terrain. \u00a0  I wish I had a\nmap to find him and bring him back. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 I tiptoe out\nof the living room and walk outside into the cold dwindling sunshine. \u00a0  The wind blows lightly through the trees and\nswirls my long dark hair around my face. \u00a0\n The grass needs to be cut and my Grandfather\u2019s old tractor sits\ncollecting dust in the garage waiting for the man I used to know and the little\ngirl I used to be. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n A warm sensation spreads over my entire body as I\nglance up at the evening sky. \u00a0  He might\nnot always be here in his favorite chair, but I know where I can find him. \u00a0  He will be where the grass is always green\nand where there are no more battles to be fought. \u00a0  It is there that I will find him, riding\nthrough the clouds on a shiny new tractor with my cousin bouncing on his knee.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n July 1920 - November 2003 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n

Eleanor Smith and her colleagues learned that the term\n\u2018Visit-ability\u2019 was being used in England for a similar concept and later\nadopted the term for those basic accessibility features that they promoted. \u00a0  A worldwide movement for accessible housing\nwas born.  \n \n VisitAble homes have three basic accessibility\nfeatures: \n \n No-step\n     entrance (at the front, back or side of the house ) \n Wider\n     doorways and clear passage on the main floor \n A\n     main floor bathroom (or powder room) that can be accessed by visitors who\n     use mobility devices \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Apart from these features, home design can be whatever the\nhomeowner wishes. \u00a0  VisitAble Housing\nprinciples do not affect the second floor of housing design.  \n \n \n In Canada,  The Canadian Centre on DisabilityStudies  has taken the lead in championing VisitAble design by launching  TheVisitability Project . \u00a0  Its aim is to\npromote VisitAble housing for all Canadians, including persons with\ndisabilities and seniors. \u00a0  The project\npromotes adoption of accessible design principles among buyers, builders and\npolicy makers as well as awareness amongst the general public about the many positive\nbenefits of VisitAble Housing for people of all ages and abilities. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n I asked our son Nicholas about his opinion on VisitAble\nHousing.\u00a0 We talked about his frustration when he couldn\u2019t visit friends after school because of architectural\nbarriers.\u00a0 We reminisced about the great\ntimes when neighbours invited us for impromptu family pot-luck dinners \u2013 and we\nwent, because their homes were accessible.\u00a0\u00a0Our family life is richer because of VisitAble Housing design principles.\u00a0 I\nhope the movement grows in depth and influence over the coming decades.\u00a0 I want to be able to visit my grandchildren\nand my friends, wherever they live!  \n \n \n \n \n For more information on the Visitability Project in Canada, go  HERE . \n \n For more information on Visitability in the USA, go  HERE .\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rwC8zdwTpls/VeeOOgpmCgI/AAAAAAAACUQ/4CTipnUz6nM/s1600/welcome.jpeg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitability", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_for_Humanity", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FKKbKdxV880/VeeNrQscovI/AAAAAAAACUA/PmZVnVfFF-8/s1600/Visitabilityprincipals.jpeg", "http://www.disabilitystudies.ca/", "http://visitablehousingcanada.com/visitability-project/overview/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5Iu3JzMHTmA/VeeN0fDRx4I/AAAAAAAACUI/5OHLjv-dmc8/s1600/visitable1.jpeg", "http://visitablehousingcanada.com/visitability-project", "http://concretechange.org/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/09/the-power-of-architecture-to-enrich.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nBy Guest Contributor, Kathy Bell \n \n \n My son\nKevin\u00a0is 20 years old. Kevin has  Mowat Wilson Syndrome , a condition that\ninvolves\u00a0developmental and medical challenges. He is non-verbal (although  he communicates well with his iPad ),\nand he has motor and processing issues. From a physical care perspective, Kevin\ncan do some things on his own, but he requires physical support for many of his\ndaily tasks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This\npast\u00a0Sunday\u00a0we dropped Kevin off at camp for the week. Now his third\ntime at camp, he walked up to the aisle to the stage when his name was\ncalled,\u00a0 showing Kevin\u2019s comfort and\nsense of belonging there. \n \n \n \n It took\nus many years to be in a position for Kevin to go away overnight. Sure,\u00a0 he \u00a0had had slept over at his\ngrandparents over the years, but never with people we (he) didn't know.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n When Kevin was quite\nyoung, we worked with a behaviour therapist who coached us to introduce nights\naway for Kevin as soon as\u00a0we could, preferably no later than 16. New\nsettings would teach Kevin that it was okay -\u00a0 even\nfun, if we could get that far - \u00a0 for him to be away from us. To\nthis day I hear the therapist\u2019s words, and though we didn't understand it at\nthe time, this coaching was more about teaching my husband and I to learn to be\naway from Kevin.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Yet, it still took us many years\nto be in a position for Kevin to spend the night away. We certainly didn't seek\nit out, and sometimes even felt guilty about it. So, when the opportunity came\nup, saying no wasn't really an option. \n \n \n \n At\nfirst,\u00a0 Kevin went away for only\none night, and then two the next time, eventually building up to being away for\na week of summer camp. \u00a0  A\nfew weeks before Kevin's first time at camp, the school sent a social story\nabout, \"what to expect at camp,\" with photographs of the facilities\nand activities there, to introduce and orient Kevin about was ahead.  \n \n \n \n When Kevin prepared to go away to school camp for\nthe second time, a year later, he was very excited. This time around, what I\nlearned was unexpected.  Kevin brought me\u00a0 his \u00a0camp\u00a0 social\u00a0 story five times a day,\nevery day, three weeks before the trip. He wanted to look at the photographs\nand talk about who was going to be there and what they were going to do. Not\nonly did he want to go, I realized he was telling me how much he needed to go,\nknowing how much fun he would have. \n \n \n \n You might\nwonder what Kevin going to camp has to do with our roles as his caregivers.\nHere is what I would tell you. Meeting Kevin's needs each day, although not\nalways easy, is a day that speeds by and is filled with tasks and\nconsiderations. Stepping away and letting other people support Kevin is an\nentirely different exercise. It is odd not to know what he did for a day, let\nalone an entire week. When he is away I most often fall asleep wondering about\nhis day. I remind myself though that as a mother of a 20-year-old, it is a\nperfectly typical moment not to know all the details. \n \n \n \n Three\nyears later during Kevin's time at camp, we focus on ourselves and our other\ntwo children. We eat out, wake up when we want to, go for walks, see a movie\nand treat ourselves to a week of doing what we want and when. \n \n \n \n Last\nyear, during the early morning two-hour drive to pick up Kevin, I remember\nasking my husband if he thought Kevin missed us while he was at camp. When we\nwalked into the chapel with the entire camp watching the end-of-camp slide\nshow, I got my answer. The photos showed Kevin, and every other camper and counsellor\ntoo, laughing and dancing and swimming and painting shirts, and eating and\nsleeping and acting silly at the campfire. It is not clear who was having the\nmost fun: the campers and their friends or the counsellors who take a week off\nwork to attend or the therapists who give a week of their four-week summer\nvacation, or the mom who now helps run the camp as an old-timer who had\nattended since college, or all the students who are there to help. For this one\nspecial week, this group becomes family and they look after each other. \n \n \n \n It is the\nmost beautiful form of care I can imagine. Kevin didn\u2019t miss us. He was too busy\nhaving fun.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n Kathy Bell is a Canadian writer, currently living in New York City.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor most, high school graduation is a happy and hopeful\ncelebration as parents launch their children into a successful, independent\nlife.  \u00a0 But there\u2019s an expression that\nparents of children with disabilities use to describe graduation and their\nchild\u2019s transition to adulthood. They call it \u2018falling off the cliff\u2019. \u00a0 This turn of phrase especially epitomises the new reality of young adults with severe disabilities.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nTransitioning a child with disabilities into adulthood can\nbe fraught with anxiety, loneliness, confusion and even hopelessness,\nespecially if the disability is severe. \u00a0\n In this age of public funding austerity, parents are expected to lead\nthe process of building lives that are safe as well as rich in meaning and\npurpose for their vulnerable children. \u00a0  \u00a0 \n \n \n \nOrganising a safe and meaningful life for a young adult with\ndisabilities is possible, but it requires a team approach. \u00a0  \u00a0 Achieving a smooth transition to adulthood for\na young person with disabilities is a large and complex task. \u00a0  That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have the help of\nextended family, friends and willing, qualified community members. \u00a0  When a big job such as transition is divided\ninto small manageable parts, team helpers understand they can make a tangible\ncontribution. \u00a0  This is especially true\nwhen tasks are matched to helpers\u2019 skill sets.  \n \n \n \n START EARLY \n \n \n \nThe first year of high school is a good time to begin putting\ntogether a \u2018transition team\u2019 for a teen with disabilities.  \u00a0 Starting early is ideal and will ease the way\nlater on, but a future planning process can begin anytime. \u00a0  Of course, at an early stage, families\u2019\ndreams about supported housing, employment, friendships and social activities\nwill not be fully formed. \u00a0  A vision for community\ncontribution and money matters will be murky as well.  \n \n \n \n RESEARCH \n \n \n \nThat\u2019s why research and information gathering are so\nimportant. \u00a0  Every transition team will\nneed someone who agrees to investigate local supported housing options and\ninnovative models of group or independent living. \u00a0  Someone else can help by compiling a list of\ncommunity resources for social engagement (these could be clubs of interest, volunteering\nopportunities, community centres, church groups, etc.). \u00a0  Another friend or family member might wish to\ntake on researching government supports, eligibility and regulations.  \u00a0 There are disability savings plans, education\nsavings plans that are flexible enough to cover the costs of post-secondary\nskills training and trust arrangements that do not impinge on disability\npension benefits. \u00a0  Professionals who can\nhelp advise families and transition team members are school guidance counsellors,\nrepresentatives of relevant government agencies, employment counsellors and\nthose in the know about supported housing such as cooperatives,  IndependentLiving Centres  and allied non-profit agency leaders. \u00a0  There are lawyers and financial advisors who\nspecialise in wills and estate planning for families who can and wish to\nprotect assets for their child with disabilities. Frequently the best sources\nof information and lived experience are other parents who have walked the walk\nand achieved great results. \u00a0  There are many\nonline family forums and bulletin boards to gather and exchange information\nabout future planning. \u00a0  A terrific guide\nto all the practical aspects of future planning is  \u2018Safe and Secure\u2019  by Al\nEtmanski and Vickie Cammack.  \n \n \n \n TURN DREAMS INTO PLANS \n \n \n \n Person Centred Planning, or Person Directed Planning  is a\nprocess that helps to clarify life dreams and transform them into practical\nplans. \u00a0  Trained facilitators gather\ninformation from family, friends and close associates of the young adult\nregarding his or her gifts, goals, interests and aspirations. \u00a0  In the course of group meetings, a  MAP  of\ndreams is evolved and from there, reasonable and actionable plans are\nmade. \u00a0  To locate a Person Centered\nPlanning facilitator, google Person Centered Planning in your city. \n \n \n \n USE TECHNOLOGY TO COORDINATE THE TEAM \n \n \n \nLike any complex task with multiple players, communication\nis key. \u00a0  Tyze Personal Networks  is an\nonline tool that can help. \u00a0  Tyze  has a\nshared filing cabinet for all gathered information about transition as well as\na shared calendar for meetings and deadlines. \u00a0\n There is a \u2018Care Wall\u2019 where all messages appear so that every team\nmember is in the loop. \u00a0  Private or small\ngroup messaging is possible for private chats. \u00a0  There\nis a page where members can \u2018set a task\u2019 or claim one by clicking \u2018I\u2019ll do it!\u2019 \u00a0  And goal setting with tracking is built in to\nthe programme as well. \u00a0  Tyze is\ncompletely private and password encoded because future planning for a young\nperson with disabilities is a highly personal affair. \u00a0  Tyze is not searchable and contains no\nadvertising. \u00a0  And because it\u2019s linked to\nteam members\u2019 email addresses, reminders or alerts are sent automatically when\ndeadlines loom, so jobs get done.  \u00a0\u00a0 Parents are in control of who participates\nonline; they can invite or remove people from the Tyze network on an as-needed\nbasis and they can share those Tyze administration privileges with whomever\nthey wish.  \n \n \n \nLike able-bodied teens, young adults with disabilities and\ntheir families want to celebrate high school graduation, not mourn it. \u00a0  Transitioning with confidence and relative\nease from childhood to adulthood is possible, but careful planning and teamwork\nis essential to success. \u00a0  Teamwork and  Tyze \ncan help. \n \nPS: \u00a0If you are already using another care coordination tool such as  Lotsa Helping Hands  or  Caring Bridge , try this method of intentionally designing of your preferred tech tool to ease transition of your son or daughter into adulthood. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aAEI2DrEeik/VdyjDp-OFBI/AAAAAAAACSw/DEuqI7aKWjU/s1600/download.jpeg", "http://www.ilcanada.ca/article/il-centres-across-canada-166.asp", "http://safeandsecureplanning.com/", "http://www.mcss.gov.on.ca/documents/en/mcss/publications/developmental/Person_DirectedPlanning.pdf", "http://www.qamtraining.net/docs/english/Connections%20-%202010.pdf", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://lotsahelpinghands.com/", "http://www.caringbridge.org/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/08/technology-teamwork-can-ease-transition.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Guest Post \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHearing loss is an invisible condition. Not everyone can\nexpress the fact that they aren\u2019t hearing well, and still others are in denial.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for you to be able to identify signs that your\nloved one might not hear as well as they could and understand that other health\nconditions could lead to or result from hearing loss.  \n \n \nIf untreated hearing loss can be identified, the next step\nis often persuading your loved one to acknowledge it and take action to correct\nit. While it may seem difficult, this challenge is not insurmountable. If the\nsubject is approached from the right angle, you can successfully empower your\nloved one to improve their own overall health and happiness. \n \n \n \n Why is\nrecognizing hearing loss so important? \n \n \n \nUntreated hearing loss can often hide behind the other\ndifficulties it creates; you might notice a symptom but not understand that\nhearing loss is the cause. For example, while you may notice that your loved\none has become depressed or withdrawn, you might not think to connect these\nbehaviors with the possibility that they can\u2019t hear well or realise that\nthey\u2019re backing out of social situations for this reason. \n \n \n \nIn fact, untreated hearing loss has been connected with  many other\nhealth conditions  such as depression, dementia and cognitive decline,\nhypertension and stress, and balance issues. If your loved one is already\ndealing with these conditions, hearing loss could exacerbate them. What\u2019s more,\nconditions like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease can also affect a person\u2019s\nhearing ability.  \n \n \nHowever, using hearing aids to address hearing loss can help\nto counteract these effects. Research has shown that those who use hearing aids\nto combat hearing loss have a better quality of life. And isn\u2019t this the goal\nof every caregiver \u2013 to do everything possible to make their loved ones\u2019 lives\nbetter each day? \n \n \n \n What are\nthe most common signs of hearing loss? \n \n \n \nWe can\u2019t always rely on loved ones to tell us, or even\nrecognise, that their hearing ability is less than average. Caregivers should\ntherefore be on the lookout for common signs. It might be time for a hearing\ntest if your loved one: \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Frequently asks people to repeat what they\u2019ve\nsaid  \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Turns the phone or television up too loudly \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Seems to be withdrawn lately or shies away from\nsocial conversation \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Has more trouble with higher-pitched sounds and\nvoices than lower-pitched ones \n \n \n \n How can you\npersuade someone to address hearing loss? \n \n \nOnce you know that your loved one may have hearing loss, the\nnext step is to urge them to get their hearing evaluated and see if hearing\naids are the right solution for their needs. The problem is that trying to\nforce someone to see a hearing health professional can sometimes be like\npushing against a brick wall. It depends on the individual, but there are\nseveral different ways you can approach the subject in order to gently nudge\nthem and help them decide that they want to get a hearing test. \n \nFirst, prepare yourself for the most common objections\npeople have to addressing hearing loss. Your loved one might say they\u2019re too\nyoung to be lose their hearing, believing that it only happens to \u201cold people.\u201d\nHowever, hearing loss affects people of all ages. In fact, 60% of all Americans\nwith hearing loss are in the workforce or educational settings. \n \n \nYour loved one might also think that hearing aids are\ncumbersome, embarrassing, or otherwise interruptive to their daily life. But\ntoday\u2019s devices integrate seamlessly into any lifestyle. They also come in\ndifferent styles, some resting so far in the ear canal that they\u2019re virtually\ninvisible. \n \n \nYou can also try persuading your loved ones with facts and\nnumbers. Explain the connection with other health conditions as noted above,\nand make sure they know that they aren\u2019t alone. According to current statistics,\nhearing loss affects: \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 20% of adults in the U.S. \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 67% of people over age 75 \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 33% of people over age 65 \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 14% of people ages 45-64 \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 15% of children ages 6-19 \n \n \n \nYou can also explain to them that even if they don\u2019t believe\nthey have hearing loss right now,  annual\nhearing evaluations  are just as highly recommended as annual physician\ncheckups and semiannual dental cleanings. It\u2019s important to track your hearing\nhealth so that you can notice any changes and take action on them right away. \n \n \nFinally, it\u2019s often a great idea to go along to your loved\none\u2019s hearing evaluation and get your hearing ability tested as well. This\ncould help them feel less nervous about the process, and it will show them how\nserious you are about being proactive regarding hearing health. After all,\nannual hearing tests are recommended for everyone, remember? \n \n \nAs a caregiver, you make meaningful sacrifices and face\nhurdles every day. Hearing loss may be one of those hurdles, but it doesn\u2019t\nhave to be a big one.

I'll meet you there. \n \nWhen the soul lies down in that grass, \nthe world is too full to talk about. \nIdeas, language, even the phrase \"each other\" doesn't make any sense. \n \n Carol Levine has\nchosen stories and poems that help us to understand that caregiving is like\nLimbo, yes, but in this otherworldly place, we are as close to one another as\nhumans can ever become. \u00a0  This is a place\nin which the future is out of our control, so we cling to each other, relaxing\neventually and allowing our breathing to align.  \u00a0 In this \u2018Limbo\u2019, there is desperate struggle,\nbut there is comfort and love, too. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uJT2frqgN5E/Vc0IqRrZ7hI/AAAAAAAACSI/rTO9roHEGlk/s1600/lgcover.4780020.jpg", "http://www.vanderbilt.edu/university-press/book/9780826519702", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/08/living-in-land-of-limbo-fiction-and.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n Guest Post by Maria Ramos \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2011, the first baby boomers turned 65. Every day since\nthen, thousands more reach retirement age. By 2050, 42% of American households\nwill include someone over the age of 70. The recent once-every-ten-years  White House Conference on\nAging  took place on July 13th and could not have come at a better time. In\naddition to an address by President Obama, the conference discussed caregiving,\nfinancial security, elder justice and introduced new and promising  innovations\nin technology  that will allow seniors and their caregivers more ease, more\nsafety and most importantly, more independence. \n \n \n \nTechnology was front and center as the White House offered a\n live stream of the conference  to\nanyone who was interested in attending but could not travel to Washington D.C.\nThis set the tone for what an important role technology will play in the lives\nof those who are of retirement age. From medication management to personalized\nhome security to 24/7 access to  in-home\nhealth monitoring , technology is opening new doors for seniors and\ncaregivers that is becoming more and more necessary as  life-expectancy\nextends , and the gap between the generations narrows.  \n \n \n \nFor instance, a new development in medication management\nincludes  pill\npackets  that are pre-measured and personalized with instructions for each\ndose. For those who take, or administer multiple medications daily, it\u2019s a\ngreat way to save on time and cut down on missed doses. In addition, there are  mobile\napps and other technology  that monitor when a patient takes their\nmedications, which is extremely helpful for Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their\ncaregivers. Digital health services from  home security systems \ncan help  alert\nfamily members or caregivers , via a mobile app, of all of their loved one\u2019s\nactivities \u2014 eating, bathing, sleeping, medication and whether or not they\nleave the house. This ensures the patient\u2019s safety, while allowing them to stay\nin the comfort of their own home and maintain a certain level of independence. \n \n \n \nOf course, costs are always a consideration, especially when\nit comes to senior care. President Obama addressed how Medicare, Medicaid and\nthe Affordable Care Act have assisted with the rising costs of long-term care. The\nWhite House has also called on the  Department of Labor  to\nforgo profits in the best interests of retiring employees. In addition,\nPresident Obama tasked the Department of Agriculture to grant greater\naccessibility to affordable nutrition and the Department of Housing to ensure\nthat it reviews its policies on  HUD\naccess . The Department of Justice was also tasked to review the  VOCA Victim Assistance Guidelines  in order to\nmake certain that the support of social and legal services to elder victims of\nabuse, financial exploitation, fraud, and neglect is made available. \n \n \n \nThese innovations in technology, combined with government\ncooperation, open up possibilities and opportunities that will benefit seniors\nand their  caregivers \nfor generations to come. Utilizing technology to ensure that our aging seniors\ncan maintain their independence is the greatest way we can give back to them.\nIt\u2019s never too early to plan for your loved ones, or for yourself. \u00a0And,\nas options in the public and private sectors continue to grow, our golden years\ncouldn\u2019t look brighter.  \n \n \n \n Maria Ramos \u00a0is a writer interested in aging and technology, comic books, cycling, and horror films. \u00a0 She currently lives in Chicago with her two pet turtles, Franklin and Roy.

{"date": "", "body": "\nGuy Mitchell. \u00a0Guy Mitchell. \u00a0Guy Mitchell. \u00a0I can't get that name out of my head. \u00a0And when I think of Guy, I am afraid for my son, my mother and my future self. \u00a0I am afraid for everyone who is at risk of being vulnerable and 'cared for' by the state, behind closed doors. \n \n \n \n \n \n Guy Mitchell  had developmental disabilities and was 38 when he died in 2012. \u00a0He drowned in an outdoor cistern of freezing cold water outside his group home in Ancaster, Ontario, as he was trying to retrieve drinking water. \u00a0 A representative of Hamilton Police said officers  reported that\u00a0the conditions at the Ancaster home were some of the worst they had ever seen. There were signs of neglect everywhere, and they included no heat, or running water; no food in the fridge, soiled clothes all over the floor as well as alcohol bottles and ashtrays everywhere. \n \nYet, the home received a passing grade from the care agency Choices just days before Guy died. A number of complaints about the home over the year up to his death produced no investigations, no police reports and no reports with the ministry of community and social services. \nThe story of the Ancaster group home is a sad, cautionary tale of total failure to protect Guy and his vulnerable roommates. \u00a0When Guy entered his Ancaster residence twenty-six years ago, Bill and Karen Santor apparently ran a well kept and caring home for their charges until they died and daughter Keri-Lynn Santor assumed her parents' responsibilities. \u00a0Now missing, Keri is apparently a heavy drinker with a police record whom another family member says may be paranoid schizophrenic. \u00a0 An agency called 'Choices' received Ontario provincial funding to operate and oversee this and other group homes in the region. \u00a0Two days before Guy died, staff at Choices gave Guy's group home a passing grade.  \u00a0Dr. Jack Stanborough, \u00a0the coroner in Guy Mitchell's case was not impressed by Choices and he said so during his inquest.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \"I think Choices and its conduct is shameful,\" he said angrily in the morning to a courtroom full of lawyers while the jury was absent. \"To hide material and produce it halfway through the inquest is shameful. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I don't understand the disrespect for Guy Mitchell, for his family, for society, for this process ... Am I upset? Darn right I'm upset.\" \n \nThe sad case of Guy Mitchell is terrible but it teaches us lessons about protecting our loved ones who are vulnerable, including seniors in residences where abuse might occur. Guy Mitchell lived in deplorable conditions and died because no one was really looking at his home environment: no one in the government ministry that funded his home, no one in his family, no one in his neighbourhood, no one in the agency that operated the home. No one saw and no one knew. \u00a0 \n \nIf we want to protect vulnerable people from the isolation that can lead to exploitation, we need to create models of support that ensure caring and responsible eyes are on our loved ones and their care providers. \u00a0Agencies and governments will not love our loved ones and sometimes, tragically, they will not protect them. \u00a0Parents of children with disabilities and children of the vulnerable elderly need to visit often, ask questions, drop in, check the fridge, look at bank statements, inspect cupboards, examine medications and ask to see written records. \u00a0We need to look carefully at our loved ones and ask them questions. \u00a0If we can't be there in person, we need to assign oversight responsibilities to others and then keep in close touch. \u00a0One Vancouver-based friend had a father in Scotland whose health was failing. \u00a0It was a visiting osteopathic therapist and a neighbour who became my friend's eyes and ears. \u00a0My friend used the same online care coordination tool that we use in my family,\u00a0 Tyze Personal Networks ,\u00a0to watch over his Dad and keep him safe. \u00a0Read my friend's story in the Toronto Star  HERE . \u00a0It's a much more hopeful and reassuring story than poor Guy Mitchell's. \u00a0 \n \nIf those providing care to a vulnerable loved one won't share information or allow unscheduled visits, there is something very wrong. \u00a0We ALL have a role in being vigilant to protect our family members, neighbours, friends and colleagues receiving care. We need to advocate for support systems, businesses, governments and municipalities to make it easier, not harder, to befriend those who are isolated in our midst. \u00a0Lives depend on it.\u00a0 \n \n Post-script : \u00a0Every member of our son's staff shares information and updates with us on a daily basis. \u00a0Drop-in visits and phone calls are encouraged and regular planning meetings include family. \u00a0My Mom's paid helpers have become friends and share information with me and my sister on a daily basis. \u00a0I can't say that accidents will never happen to my son and my Mom, but I know that everyone who cares for and about them talks to each other in a coordinated circle of care. And if something bad happens, it will be an accident despite best efforts to provide excellent care. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ap20b4JWMos/VbJt5lQ3DFI/AAAAAAAACQI/mtPluye2Iag/s1600/B822038724Z.1_20150720220914_000_G191GTG38.12_Gallery.jpg", "http://www.thespec.com/news-story/5710565-no-water-no-heat-walls-coated-in-feces-a-tragic-death-at-a-hamilton-group-home/", "http://www.thespec.com/news-story/5716348-guy-mitchell-not-the-first-to-die-at-hamilton-group-home/", "http://m.brantnews.com/news-story/5728063-coroner-chastises-shameful-conduct-of-agency-that-oversaw-group-home", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2010/09/17/the_tyze_that_bind.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/07/a-tragic-death-cautionary-tale-and.html", "title": ""},

My husband\u2019s diplomatic career made us fearless about travel, even with two children, one of whom was medically complex with severe disabilities. We had an excellent treatment team at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and one day, my son Nicholas and I went there for a routine feeding tube change. The procedure was quick but painful, so I promised my boy a Happy Meal afterwards at McDonald\u2019s as a reward. \n \nWith a shiny new tube in place, we walked across the square and down the busy sidewalk to the nearest Golden Arches. We found a table that could accommodate Nick\u2019s small wheelchair and I ordered our meal. Nicholas is mostly tube-fed, but he loves to sample his favorite junk foods. We tore open the bag of food, marveled over his free toy and I began to carefully present small bites of burger and fries. \n \nA young and uniformed staff member came toward our table looking frightened and ashen. \n \n\u201cYes?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs everything all right? Is something wrong?\u201d \n \nHe gulped. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That couple over there complained about you. They said you shouldn\u2019t be here in a restaurant feeding your son. They said you should do that at home.\u201d \n \nMy eyes widened. He continued, \u201cI told them they had to move their seat. You stay here. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \n \nFrankly, as they say in England, I was gobsmacked. I looked over at the complainers. They were old (probably the same age I am now). They were\u00a0 glowering \u00a0at us \u2013 at me and my incredibly adorable 4-year-old son. \n \n\u201cUhh?\u201d Nick asked with a rising inflection. He wanted to know what all this fuss was about. \u201cThere is an older couple over there, Nick, who are not happy. I believe their mommies did not love them enough. I think they need our prayers. \n \n\u201cDEAR LORD\u2026\u201d I began with my head bowed and my voice amplified, \u201cplease forgive these very sad people who need more love in their hearts and more kindness in their actions. Amen.\u201d Nicholas was laughing his head off.

Growing up around his family\u2019s pharmacy, TJ saw the struggles of\npatients who juggled complicated medication schedules and multiple trips to the pharmacy every week. As many family owned businesses do, the Parker pharmacy identified and\ncatered to the needs of their long-term customers. The Parkers, with the help\nof TJ, created intuitive and stylish packaging technology and a seamless system\nfor filling and delivering prescriptions that allows patients and their\ncaregivers to feel in control. TJ saw the need to throw the antiquated\npharmacy model out the window and create a better, more user-friendly experience.  \u00a0 But what he didn\u2019t throw out was personal\nservice. He knew too, that customers wanted a system that could work seamlessly\nwith their insurance providers. \u00a0  This\nreinvention led him to open a company named  PillPack  with a mission to re-invent the pharmacy. \n \n \n \n WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING? \n \n \n \n \"PillPack is\neverything I was looking for to help my elderly Dad regulate his twice daily\nmedication dosages. The system is clear and simple for any and all ages to\nunderstand. The packaging is ingenious. I cannot say enough positive things\nabout the PillPack customer service and pharmacist team. Just outstanding\nattention to detail combined with extremely knowledgeable, kind and\ncompassionate staff who clearly aim to please and satisfy their patients and\ntheir families.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Recently, I joined the blogging team at  The Caregiver Network , a terrific site that's chock full of opinion, information and video links for caregivers of all types and ages. \u00a0 By way of introducing me to their site, their communications director asked me about my background. \u00a0I thought readers here in The Caregivers' Living Room might be interested to know more about me, my family and my work too. \u00a0So let's pour the tea and chat! \n \n \n \n \n \n 1.Tell us about your family caregiving responsibilities. \n \nMy husband Jim and I have two children, Nicholas (26) and Natalie (23).\u00a0 Nicholas has severe cerebral palsy and is medically complex which means he requires 24 hour one to one nursing care.\u00a0 Until four years ago, we provided that care at home.\u00a0 Now Nicholas lives in a nearby care home and we visit, telephone or skype almost every day.\u00a0 My mother is 93 and lives a couple of hours away in a seniors\u2019 home.\u00a0 She is becoming frail, so my sister and I share her care. \n \n 2.\u00a0 \u00a0 Tell us about your book\u00a0 The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I\u2019ve Learned From a Life of Caregiving \u00a0\u2013 why did you write it?\u00a0 \n \nMy experience has been one that I would describe as \u2018extreme caregiving\u2019.\u00a0 Over his lifetime, Nicholas has endured multiple surgeries, frequent illness and chronic pain.\u00a0 In spite of his challenges, Nicholas maintains a positive attitude and a strong ambition to pursue his interests.\u00a0 During the years of caring for Nicholas at home, I became progressively more isolated.\u00a0 I believed that our life was profoundly different from others\u2019 \u2026. until one day a conversation prompted me to consider writing a book.\u00a0 A friend told me about the work of Amartya Sen, an economist who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1998.\u00a0 Sen developed \u2018The Capability Approach\u2019, a way of understanding poverty in India that threw out household income as a yardstick for measuring human wellbeing and instead asked, \u201cHow can people living within circumstances of great hardship have a life they value?\u201d \u00a0With the lens of Sen\u2019s Capability Approach, I sensed immediately that our family caregiving experience fell into the realm of \u2018normal\u2019 experience.\u00a0 Everyone would like to know how to craft a life that one values, given one\u2019s unchangeable realities.\u00a0 Our family\u2019s answers to that question might help policymakers and families better support caregivers of all sorts. \n \n 3. \u00a0You talk about both disability care and elder care.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Do you think these types of caregiving are the same or different? \n \nI write about eldercare and disability care because I have personal experience in both those areas.\u00a0 But I believe that we must find common ground across all caregiving experiences in order to form a movement for change. \n \n 4. \u00a0Is it possible to be happy giving care when your loved one is struggling? \n \nYes, but I believe that happiness will be found in the moments between anxiety, sadness and sometimes even grief.\u00a0 Happiness might be found in the restful sigh of a loved one when a powerful pain medication finally takes effect.\u00a0 Or it could be in sharing a memory with your loved one that brings with it smiles and laughter. \n \n 5.\u00a0\u00a0What are the most important things you have learned in your life of caregiving?\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nCaregiving is a job that is full of thousands of small tasks. Each task in itself feels perfectly doable, especially because we (usually) love the person we are caring for. But over time, these tasks together can be exhausting. \n \n \n \u00a0You can\u2019t do it alone. \u00a0Make a decision to say \u2018yes\u2019 every time someone asks to help. \n \n \n Remember, not all friends are good at being helpful. \u00a0If you find that some friends or family don\u2019t offer, just accept that part of their personality and try to move on asap. \n \n \n Coordinate the team \u00a0using facebook, email or one of the terrific new software platforms for caregiving such as\u00a0 Tyze . \n \n \n Ensure that the whole team understands that caring for and about you, the caregiver, is a top priority. \u00a0When a baby is born, everyone instinctively understands that the mother must be cared for so that she can look after her baby. The same principle is true when giving care. Someone else should look after walking your dog and collecting your children from school so that you can be with your relative in times of crisis. \n \n \n Between crises, let the team share the care and visiting responsibilities \u00a0 so that the principal caregiver can have a break. \u00a0These breaks will enable the caregiver to hang in for the long term without burning out. \n \n \n \n 6. What\u2019s the one question you wish caregivers would ask but often don\u2019t? \n \nThe question I wish caregivers would ask more often is \u2018How can I approach my caregiving as a strong and sustainable team challenge?\u2019 \n \n 7. \u00a0What\u2019s the greatest caregiver myth? \n \nIf I don\u2019t do everything myself, I am a failure. \n \nThis is perhaps the most damaging belief for caregivers and care receivers alike. If Steve Jobs had believed he could create a computer company with no employees, Apple would not exist today. Care, like all complex tasks, is best delivered as a team. This doesn\u2019t mean that a different person needs to bathe your loved one every day or cook in your kitchen. It means that people need to support YOU, the caregiver, to thrive in your role. That support will look different for every caregiver, but the constant is that there is a team and the caregiver is the team leader. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thecaregivernetwork.ca/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YiAlQpKlB6s/VZxueGnheMI/AAAAAAAACOQ/tzVNPuXXYI8/s1600/tcn-logo.png", "http://houseofanansi.com/products/the-four-walls-of-my-freedom", "http://www.tyze.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/07/a-bit-about-me-and-my-caregiving.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n In times of hardship or pain, looking at the people we love can be powerful\u00a0medicine.  Parents and caregivers need to be on the receiving end of the loving\u00a0gaze of family and friends too. \n \n \n \n Here\u2019s what got me thinking about eye contact: I happened to notice a billboard with a photo of a beautiful but destitute young African woman holding a dangerously thin infant, who was clearly malnourished and distressed. I thought it was so odd that this young mother wasn\u2019t looking at her baby \u2013 she was gazing at something in the distance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuddenly, I recognized myself in that mother. Our son Nicholas has severe\u00a0 cerebral palsy . When he was young, he suffered from cyclical vomiting syndrome. Every attempt to spoon-feed my boy ended badly and eventually he received the diagnosis of \u201cfailure to thrive.\u201d I felt deeply wounded by my inability to nourish my son. Surgeries and time eventually enabled our boy to overcome his gastro woes, but I recall looking away from him in those dark days as I pushed the spoon toward his tiny mouth. I still feel badly about that. \n \nEye contact is a powerful kind of hand-holding. Sick people need it, people in pain need it and so do caregivers. Eye contact says, \u201cI am with you. You don\u2019t need to experience this alone. What happens to you happens to me, too.\u201d \n \nWhen Nicholas was 12, his hip dislocated and the orthopedic surgeon recommended a major reconstructive procedure. Transfusions would be necessary due to blood loss \u2013 the surgery sounded invasive and frightening. Nick was listening, holding his breath, wide-eyed. I bent down in front of him and held his hand. I asked him to look at me and I said, \u201cNicholas, you and I are the same blood type, so I am going to give you my blood for this surgery. My blood will be filled with comfort, with healing and most of all with my love. I will be with you all the time in the hospital to make sure you are fine. I promise.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLater that day, my best friend arrived at my door. She already knew about the decision and, in our entrance hall, she held my hands and looked straight at me \u2013 not for long but enough to say clearly, \u201cYou can do this and I will help you.\u201d She smiled and squeezed my hands. \n \nCaregivers look at their charges all the time\u2026scanning for signs of decline, bed sores, fevers or for changes in breathing and function. We are expert observers. But we need friends and family to look at us too. I often say that we cannot do this caring and giving alone. We need companions in our loving work. One powerful way to be a friend of a caregiver to look her in the eye. \n \n \n \n Read more:\u00a0 http://themighty.com/2015/06/one-simple-powerful-way-to-support-caregivers/#ixzz3e8NyuOIJ \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://themighty.com/2015/06/one-simple-powerful-way-to-support-caregivers/#", "http://themighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/earlyfam3.jpg", "http://themighty.com/2015/06/one-simple-powerful-way-to-support-caregivers/www.cerebralpalsy.org", "http://themighty.com/2015/06/one-simple-powerful-way-to-support-caregivers/#", "http://themighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nicksurgery.jpg", "http://themighty.com/2015/06/one-simple-powerful-way-to-support-caregivers/#ixzz3e8NyuOIJ"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/06/one-simple-powerful-way-to-support.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThere's a red book that's been sitting on my desk for months. \u00a0It's one of many that have been sent to me for book reviews. \u00a0That pile got smaller recently when I came to the cottage for a summer break of reading and relaxing. \u00a0I wish I had read this book sooner, because it has changed my thinking about living, dying, dependency and care. \u00a0And it made me cry tears of...what's the word for when you read a passage and think \"oh, oh, oh\". \u00a0That happened a lot. \n \n \n \n \n \n We Know How This Ends: Living While Dying by Bruce H. Kramer with Cathy Wurzer  is the red book. \u00a0It's mostly written by  Bruce Kramer, a professor of education  who became stricken with ALS and subsequently wrote a hugely popular blog about his transformation, both physical and metaphysical. Cathy Wurzer is the NPR journalist who interviewed and befriended Kramer. \u00a0She provides counterpoint reflections on her own father's dementia diagnosis and what it meant to her. \n \nBut this book isn't about ALS or dementia. \u00a0No, not at all! It is about what it is like to die. \u00a0And the title post-script says it eloquently - it is about living while dying. \u00a0I have often wanted to ask palliative patients, \"What's it like? What do you think about? What is the meaning of life after all?\" \u00a0Bruce Kramer tells us all that and more. \n \nIt's hard to write this review because there is so much I want to say - and my copy is marked on nearly every page with an asterisk or notation such as 'yes!'. \u00a0Kramer says, for example, \"I find great comfort in .... the ability to balance between accepting one's aging and mortality and viewing one's life realistically and without despair.\" \u00a0Kramer reflects that for him, \"ALS insists I focus on the juxtaposition of loss and growth.\" Viewing my life realistically and without despair as I focus on the juxtaposition of loss and growth pretty much sums up my most fundamental challenges as a caregiver. \n \nAnd perhaps these are not just challenges of the palliative, the infirm or the caregiver - they are the challenges of being human. And Bruce Kramer is deeply human. \u00a0He offers us guideposts to being comfortable in the human condition... being at peace with our own mortality. \u00a0Yet, he is human. \u00a0After two years of his body being ravaged by ALS, Kramer writes simply, \"The fact is that I have handled nothing.\" But then he circles around again and says, \"I can mourn each loss, but I must not allow myself to become comfortable on the new plateau where it lands me, for that is not the way of life we are granted.\" \u00a0Kramer says often that ALS is just normal living and dying speeded up and I believe he's right. \u00a0There are so many philosophical lessons here for caregiving about reconciling hope and realism, growth and decline - all conundrums I seem to wrestle with in slow motion. \n \nThere are so many true words of wisdom in this book. \u00a0I can only urge you to buy and it read it for yourself. \u00a0But, I'll leave you with this: \"I would argue that bravery goes beyond the desire for a good death. \u00a0It is trying to live a good life when your old version of life has been kicked in the teeth.\" \u00a0And I know that caregivers everywhere feel a sting in their mouths almost every day. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7WVG6JzgRtg/VaERFs-4TCI/AAAAAAAACOs/1Evi3PaFAQ8/s1600/image.jpg", "https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/we-know-how-this-ends", "http://www.weknowhowthisends.com/the-authors.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/07/the-red-book-that-is-so-wonderful.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nMy name is Michelle Thompson and I am part-time blogger and\nsocial outreach coordinator for  Parentgiving.com , as well as a mother of three,\nwife of one, and caregiver for both of my elderly parents (who live with us\nhere in Caldwell, New Jersey). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMy caregiver journey began three years ago as my father\nbegan to show subtle, then not so subtle signs of dementia. \u00a0  As I assisted my Mom in understanding his\ncondition, his outlook, and his therapies, my world (as I knew it then) was in\nfor a change. \u00a0  Over the years, my very\ncapable father had managed their finances, kept their house and landscaping in\nreasonable shape, cooked, shopped, and carried a major portion of their day to\nday responsibilities. \u00a0\u00a0  His dementia\npresented itself slowly: small, gradual signs of \"senioritis\" such as\nforgotten car keys and forgotten parking spaces and awkward, sullen gaps in\ncommunicating with loved ones de-evolved into blank stares, trouble following\nsimple instructions, medications not being taken, wandering of the hallways,\nand longer sleeping and napping periods. \u00a0\n About this time, part-time and night-time incontinence gave way to\nfull-time incontinence. \u00a0  My mother, with\nher own declining health (type 2 diabetes, poor circulation and ever limited\nmobility) did what she could, but was mentally frustrated and physically a\nwreck in trying to attend to his daily caregiving needs. \u00a0  Her caring for Dad was accelerating her own\nphysical deterioration. \n \n \n \nIn coordination with my brother (now living in California)\nwe brought in professional caregivers to assist mom, but we never seemed to\nfind the right \"fit\". \u00a0  We\ncycled through several agencies, but when Dad started needing overnight care,\nour requirements changed. \u00a0  They really\nweren't in the financial shape to move to assisted living (especially here in\nNorthern New Jersey!), and although I had some reservations, there were signs\nthat I could assist them as the dutiful older daughter: the last of my three\nkids was off to college, I had a highly flexible schedule working primarily\nfrom home for  Parentgiving.com , and my ever loving husband understood the financial\nbind my parents were in AND the emotional bind I was in as the oldest daughter\nlooking to provide care and comfort to my rapidly aging parents. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nLong story short, we sold my parent's house and began the\nnot so easy task of retrofitting our own house to accommodate two seniors with\nlimited mobility. \u00a0  Where to begin? \u00a0  With the help of our contractor neighbor, we\nconverted our dining room into their new master suite, complete with a basic\nhospital bed for Dad and a tastefully decorated twin bed for Mom. \u00a0  After 50+ years of sleeping together, it was\na hard transition for both of them to sleep apart, but keeping them in the same\nroom helped\u2026.and Dad\u2019s occasional nighttime leakage from his incontinence\nunderwear did not wake Mom for the first time in about two years. \u00a0  We also fitted Dad\u2019s hospital bed with an\nadjustable Bed Rail, to both minimize his nighttime wandering, and to assist\nhis getting to and from the bed. \u00a0  Next\nwas the first floor guest bathroom \u2013 it became \u201ctheir\u201d bathroom, and required a\nnot so inexpensive standing shower stall \u2013 converting it from a half bath to a\nfull sized bathroom. \u00a0  We also installed a\nfloor to ceiling pole (for transitioning from the shower) and various grab bars\n(inside the shower and by the sink) to assist in their bathroom mobility. \u00a0\u00a0  After Mom endured some issues in getting up\nfrom the toilet, we added a toilet safety frame to minimize middle of the night\ncalls for help. \u00a0  One of the biggest\nassists to my parents was to install motion sensor lighting \u2013 both in the\nhallways and inside of the bathroom. \u00a0  We\ndon\u2019t realize how diminished sight (especially at night) can affect a senior\u2019s\nability to safely navigate their home environment. \u00a0  My husband and I soon began to settle in with\nmy parents sleeping schedules: their nighttime bathroom runs no longer awoke us\nfrom a dead sleep, and our nocturnal selves\u2019 adjusted somewhat \u2013 deep sleep\ncontinues to elude me as I listen for any calls for help, or for when my Dad is\nconfused and wandering.  \n \n \n \nAs we ALL adjusted to the changes, I next focused my\nattention to my parents\u2019 doctor\u2019s visits, wellness checks, medications and\nmedication schedules. \u00a0  Each visit and\nsubsequent blood / cholesterol / blood pressure / blood thinner / anti-coagulant\ntest spawned a ripple effect across their respective spectrum of medications,\ndosages and effects. \u00a0  The only way I\ncould somewhat help them manage was to keep an old-fashioned journal\nnotebook. \u00a0  Once medication dosages and\nschedules were stable, I purchased a  MedCenter pill dispenser  (with Alarm) for\neach of them and this has helped greatly- and Mom is still able to manage the\nallocation of meds for both she and Dad. \u00a0\u00a0\n \n \nMy working for  Parentgiving.com  has helped tremendously in\ngetting Dad his incontinence supplies \u2013 I was able to work directly with\nCustomer Care to first sample various brands and sizes to find what fit him\nbest, and what worked best. \u00a0  (We\neventually settled on Tena Briefs for his daytime use, and Molicare Super\nBriefs for his nighttime use). \u00a0  After\ngetting a good understanding of utilization rate for these supplies, I set up a\nsubscription for both items with Parentgiving using their  Dry Direct  ordering\nsystem. \u00a0  The order ships on whatever\nfrequency we decide, and we order by the case to minimize cost \u2013 Parentgiving\nsends an email when the order is about to ship, and the shipping time is\nusually one to business days. \u00a0  We also\norder flushable wipes, latex free gloves, and  Baza Protect Cream  (to keep Skin\nDermatitis at bay). \u00a0  With Parentgiving\u2019s\nsuper-fast ship times (everything usually arrives in one to two business days),\nI am able to order as needed and the convenience of these supplies arriving at\nmy door is a Godsend. \n \n \n \nTaking care of my parents, under my roof, has not been\nwithout its challenges. \u00a0  Dad has fallen\nand still wanders at night, and we are considering bringing in a professional\ncaregiver on a part-time basis to assist for overnights. \u00a0  Going from semi-empty nesters to bringing in\ntwo additional adults (with caregiving needs) has been stressful and has\nrequired extreme amounts of patience (for which I am ever grateful to my\nhusband) \u2013 but there really is no alternative at this time. \u00a0  We know Dad (and Mom) will eventually require\nfull-time, institutional care, but the longer we hold off that reality, the\ngreater chance we can support it financially \u2013 and knowing that I did my\npersonal best to love and care for these very important people, within my own\nhome, for a good stretch of time, provides a great sense of peace. \n \n \n \nMichelle Thompson \n \n Michelle works for\nParentgiving.com when she's not caring for her father.

Miller shows that parents want to give to their children the\nsense that they are known and loved, always searching to give them the best\nlife experiences and chances as possible. Often, this relationship is mediated\nthrough material objects. When my mother passed on these dresses, she passed on\nthe hopeful sentiments that I would someday experience the same happy memories\nas she did. As McKraken explains, when things are bought or passed forward,\nthere is often a \u2018divestment ritual\u2019, whereby the traces of its passed owner\nare erased, in order for objects to be personalized by its new owner. However,\nin the case of these garments, the exact opposite of a divestment ritual has\nhappened where my mother and I both reside in the garments, both mentally and\nphysically. In reaction to passing the garments on to me, my mother stated \u201cI\ndon\u2019t see it as a loss at all, it is a gain, they have a new life through you.\nParenting is all about love, you want your child to  have , you want your child to  dream , you want your child\u2019s dreams to come true, and to give\nthem a symbol of your own dreams coming true\u201d. Here, the garments act as a\nbridge between the relationship I hold with my mother, where the narratives of\nour lives become increasingly embedded within them not in a sentiment of\ntension, but mutually constitutive. As the garments are continually worn, the\nstories accompanying that elevated experience are told, and we continually\nlearn more about one another as individuals. \u00a0(Essay \"My Mother's Dress\" by Natalie Wright, Masters in American Material Culture, Winterthur Museum and Gardens) \n \n \n \n \n \n (Bead detail from my dress that Natalie now wears.) \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n I\nam so happy that my daughter has my dresses and that we each experience such\nstrong individual and shared memories through them. \u00a0  Listening to Karolina Jonderko today reflect\non the loss of her mother, I thought about my own mother\u2019s things. \u00a0  I thought about what I will leave behind for\nmy children. \u00a0  How will our losses be\nhealed by touching our loved one\u2019s possessions? \u00a0\n Karolina Jonderko offers one way (her way) of banishing painful memories\nand replacing them with mental images of smiles, laughter and love.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://cargocollective.com/karolinajonderko/About-Karolina-Jonderko", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/04/karolina-jonderko_n_7486586.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fO4j3XG8Luk/VYrT4ihKdnI/AAAAAAAACMs/Kq_BZD_0Ptw/s1600/slide_429904_5576186_free.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GJxwgSN8i1g/VYrWPeARdtI/AAAAAAAACM4/5WdCQBjzf-g/s1600/bead.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/06/a-remarkable-story-of-banishing-grief.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n This is a really informative and helpful guest post by the writers at  TopTenReviews \u00a0that\u00a0I'm more than happy to share. \n \n \n \n \n \nChoosing how to support your parents in their golden years doesn't have to\nbe a burden. Depending on what you and your parents are looking for in care,\nyou have a choice between nursing homes and care given at home. Here are some\nbenefits and disadvantages of each method that should point you toward the best\nsolution for everyone. \n \n What Conditions Are\nBetter Managed at a Nursing Home? \nIf your parent has an advanced condition that requires constant or very\ntechnical care, their care is probably better left to a professional at a\nnursing home or hospital. Parents with degenerative disorders like Alzheimer's\nor Parkinson's that become worse over time are also suited to nursing home care.\nIn many cases, these patients will be in-home care at first, then progress to\nthe point where they need to transition to a full-time care facility. \n \n What Conditions Are\nBetter Managed With Remote Care? \nIf your parent has a high risk of infection because of a weakened immune\nsystem caused by AIDS or an auto-immune disorder, definitely consider keeping\nthem at home as long as possible. The spread of germs inside a nursing home is\nfaster than in the home because of the number of people who could be potentially\ncarry an infection. \n \nDo not underestimate a simple flu or urinary tract infection, even at home.\nAccording to the American Academy of Family Physicians, about one-third of all\ndeaths of people over 65 are the result of infection. \n \n Is In-Home Care a\nSafe Option? \nYou are in control of who you hire to take care of your aging parent. Always\nperform thorough background checks on someone before hiring them to be a remote\ncaregiver. The best way to confirm that their experience listed on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nis real is by calling references and checking up yourself. \nInstead of hiring an independent home caregiver, consider hiring through a home\ncare agency. Many of these agencies do the background checks for you. Some of\nthem even require their caregivers to become certified by passing a series of\ntests. \n \nThere is one more option. If you and/or your parent don't feel comfortable\nwith a stranger providing your parent's care, a family member can give the\ncare, instead. \n \n Is Remote Care\nSomething You Can Do Yourself? \nAnyone can become a caregiver if they are willing to learn how. It's not a\ntask for the squeamish, since caregivers deal with bodily fluids and sickness\nevery day, but if you're up to the challenge, your parent may appreciate the\none-of-a-kind attention only their child can give. Plus, your parent will get\nto stay at home instead of moving to an unfamiliar nursing home. \n \nIt will be impossible for you to offer care 24/7. For those times that you\nhave to leave a parent unattended, have a network of other family members who\ncan help, or use a  trustworthy\nmedical alert  system. \n \nKeep in mind that a large investment goes into becoming a caregiver. If you\nhave other responsibilities like a job or kids that take up most of your time,\nit may be too stressful for you to take on your parent's care yourself. In that\ncase, if you've also ruled out a home caregiver, a nursing home is probably\nyour next best alternative. \n \n What Are the\nAdvantages of Nursing Home Care? \nAs opposed to a single caregiver at home, a nursing home has an entire team\ndedicated to providing care to your parent. Nursing homes foster a community\nenvironment between staff and those requiring care. There might even be\nrecreation opportunities available to residents of a nursing home that would\notherwise be unavailable at home. \n \n What Are the\nAdvantages of Remote Care Giving? \nOne surprising advantage of home care is long-term cost. Many home care\ngivers charge very reasonable hourly rates, allowing you to save some money,\nespecially compared to a private nursing home. However, there will probably be\na bigger initial investment for home care, especially if you need expensive\nmedical equipment or renovations to the home for accessibility. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nNow that you've weighed these factors, the decision between home care and a\nnursing home should be more clear. Remember that these decisions are never\nfinal and you can always switch between remote care and nursing home care if\none doesn't work out. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.toptenreviews.com/?AboutUs", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VRAKaF0CNm8/VYg1Di14lUI/AAAAAAAACMQ/dcdwRWtvQhU/s1600/ir1.jpg", "http://medical-alert-systems-review.toptenreviews.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/06/remote-care-vs-care-at-nursing-home.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nLocal communities are great places to look for help and support for your caregiving family. \u00a0It's worth doing a search of your neighborhood - you're likely to find community assets that may be life savers for you and your loved one. \u00a0Start by identifying the schools, churches, community centres, shopping malls, municipal services and health care facilities around you. \u00a0Here's how to use that information: \n \n Schools \n \nElementary schools may have a volunteer programme for reading to children. \u00a0This might be a valuable opportunity for your elder loved one to add meaning and purpose to their week. \u00a0Schools might have an initiative for inter-generational learning or an empathy education program. \u00a0Innovative teachers use local seniors to enhance their history lessons. It's worth calling the principal to enquire. \n \nHigh schools frequently require their students to complete volunteer hours in order to graduate. \u00a0Guidance counsellors will have information on whether a student could assist with yard work, grass cutting, dog walking or snow removal on a voluntary basis. \n \n Community Centres \n \nCommunity centres are the caregiver's best friend. \u00a0At my local centre, there are programs on offer from post-stroke aqua-rehab, to zumba with inclusive child care. \u00a0There is an autism employment support and education program that trains (and pays) young adults with developmental disabilities to clean lunch tables and water plants. \u00a0For seniors, there are fitness opportunities such as 'The Silver Stars' and adult-only swimming times. \u00a0Our community centre offers to locate volunteers to swim with adults with disabilities too, during those quiet swim times. \u00a0Call your local centre to see what's on offer for you and your loved one. \u00a0If your personal financial resources are limited, ask whether they offer subsidies for membership (the YMCA offers this type of help).  \n \n Places of Worship \n \nYour local church or synagogue could be a source of support or even daytime respite. \u00a0Churches are natural places of support and belonging. \u00a0Ask your priest or rabbi whether there's an opportunity for you to worship while a volunteer cares for your loved one. \u00a0Ask if there are home visits available, if that is what you need. \u00a0Many places of worship have committees devoted to the needs of caregivers and elderly or disabled community members. \u00a0Call and ask how the worship community might help your family. \n \n Shopping Malls \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShopping malls might not seem like the most likely place to look for support, but I've noticed that those around my neighbourhood offer many programmes for seniors. \u00a0There are mall walking clubs, there's a seniors' centre at my local mall and a store-front seniors' chair yoga centre in another mall near me. \u00a0It's worth speaking with someone at the mall executive office too, about special events for seniors or for people with disabilities. \u00a0There may be volunteer or employment opportunities at the mall for adults with disabilities as well. \u00a0For example, if your loved one with a disability adores animals and often visits the mall pet store, ask whether there is a job available working with the pets or stocking shelves.  \n \n Municipal Services \n \nPeople working in your local municipal services have a responsibility to know and support their most vulnerable constituents. \u00a0Make an appointment to phone or visit your local fire station. \u00a0If you support someone with mobility challenges, they will put you on an alert registry so that in case of fire, they will be prepared. \u00a0Google your city government to see what public services are operated in your area - these could include local art galleries (often with specialized learning programmes), outdoor swimming pools, parks and even population-specific programmes such as day respite for people with disabilities or dementia. \u00a0One local community centre near my home offers a monthly recreation party night for adults with disabilities - it's hugely popular.  \n \n Health Care Facilities \n \nHospital and out-patient services might offer workshops or other support programmes that might be interesting and helpful for your family. \u00a0Call the social work office and ask to be put on a mailing list for all their programmes. \u00a0A google search of 'respite disability' or 'respite eldercare' in your city might turn up opportunities that are new to you. \u00a0If you have specialized healthcare needs for your loved one (such as foot care, for example), enquire whether your local health authority offers home visits. Even pharmacies, especially those that include a division for rehab medical needs offer information and support as well. \n \nYour community has assets that can help ease your caregiving path. \u00a0Research, investigate and never be afraid to ask what's available in your neighbourhood - you'll be glad you did! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P0mxHtTcfas/VXCRtXDVftI/AAAAAAAACKo/TQcC3J7bfm4/s1600/community-mural.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qmujSIxoxCQ/VXCSX3wRBbI/AAAAAAAACKw/srD8TbUqveo/s1600/belmont.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/06/six-ways-communities-can-help-caregivers.html", "title": ""},

Rush,  \"Grief and hope are related. \u00a0Grief need not be an unmentionable downer to be avoided at all costs. \u00a0It's a constitutive part of our lives. \u00a0When it is done well, it can be very healing, intimate, caring, authentic, growthful and loving. \u00a0It can remind us of what our living is all about in the first place.\" \n \nCaregiving With Strength by Eleanor Silverberg can be ordered  HERE .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-905dWKmDRtM/VWuOR75cUKI/AAAAAAAACKI/m2EttxBpJy8/s1600/Caregiving%2Bwith%2Bstrength.jpg", "http://www.eleanorsilverberg.com/#!book/mainPage", "http://www.eleanorsilverberg.com/#!book/mainPage"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/06/caregiving-with-strength-guidebook-for.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n I spend a lot of time reading about how families manage caring for\nloved ones all over the world. \u00a0  Today, developed\nnations share common challenges \u2013 \u00a0aging populations, more people trying to\nbalance employment with caregiving, and governments trying to get the most out\nof family caregivers. All while trying to manage their governments' over-stretched\nhealthcare budgets. \u00a0  The UK, the US and\nCanada are all experimenting with combining health\nand social care into \u2018baskets of services\u2019, giving cash to patients and families\nto buy their own care and finding ways to support the legions of family\ncaregivers whose unpaid labour everyone agrees is essential.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Last week, the  Ontario Minister of Health and Long Term Care, EricHoskins , announced his  plan to transform community care  in Ontario. \u00a0  The ten point plan for change included these\nthree recommendations: \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n 4. \u00a0Move forward with Bundled Care \n \n Ontario is helping health care\norganizations provide better and more integrated care for patients and their\nfamilies, with a new payment model called Bundled Care. This coordinated\napproach will help patients transition more smoothly out of hospital and into their\nhome. It also builds on the success of St. Joseph's Health System's Integrated\nComprehensive Care Demonstration Project where integrating funding across\nmultiple providers and care settings improved the patient experience, reduced\ntime spent in hospital and decreased the number of emergency room visits. \n \n 5. \u00a0Offer self-directed care to give patients more control \n \n Over the next two years,\nOntario will pilot different approaches to giving eligible Ontarians more\nchoice over who provides services in their home and when these services are\ndelivered. The goal is to empower patients and caregivers by giving them more\nflexibility and control over their care plans by involving them more in the\nplanning, organizing and coordination of care they receive. \n \n 6. \u00a0Expand caregiver supports \n \n Caring for a loved one can be\nrewarding. It can also be challenging, both emotionally and physically. The\ngovernment recognizes the important contributions of caregivers and will\nprovide more support for caregivers, including training and education, improved\naccess to information and respite care. \n \n \n \nThese are all great ideas that will only succeed if service\nproviders, health care professionals, clients and family caregivers  TALK  to\neach other. \u00a0  Bundled care means multiple\nservice providers across health and social service sectors will be involved\nwith the same family. \u00a0  When important\nmessages need to be shared within the larger group, who will be responsible for\ncommunicating across agencies? \u00a0  How will\nclients and families tell everyone in the circle of care about an important\nhealth event without spending hours on the telephone? \u00a0  Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto has identified\nthis challenge for its patients in the community and they\u2019ve come up with an IT\nplatform called  MyChart. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1.

{"date": "", "body": "\nCaregiving is a complicated role, full of joy and sometimes grief and frustration. \u00a0Caring for those we love is laden with human drama and is hard enough without imposing beliefs and standards upon ourselves that make it harder. \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \n \nHARMFUL BELIEFS: \n \n 1) My role is to give care, not receive care. \n \nAnyone giving or receiving care is in a relationship with the other. \u00a0As in partnerships of any kind, there is fluidity in the give and take. \u00a0Why, then, do we sometimes believe that caregivers only ' give  care'? \u00a0Of course, there is one person in a care relationship who will need assistance with particular activities of daily living. \u00a0But that doesn't mean that a loved one never gives care in return - a frail senior can pat an adult child's hand or offer words of wisdom. \u00a0Sometimes, care comes in more ephemeral ways such as a smile or even an hour of peaceful silence. \u00a0Friends or extended family members might offer to fill a shift or cook a meal. \u00a0Caregivers are care receivers, too. \n \n 2) \u00a0I will be happy only if others show me I am loved. \n \nThis belief is very harmful to caregivers because frequently our loved ones cannot offer positive reinforcement for our private caring acts, and why should they? \u00a0Caregiving is by nature, very personal. \u00a0The purpose of care is to enable a loved one to be healthy and do whatever he or she would like to do. \u00a0Happiness and fulfilment are emotions that must be generated by the caregiver within herself. \u00a0Most successful long-term caregivers have become expert at locating life satisfaction within.  \n \n 3) \u00a0If I don't do everything myself, I am a failure. \n \nThis is perhaps the most damaging belief for caregivers and care receivers alike. \u00a0If Steve Jobs had believed he could create a computer company with no employees, Apple would not exist today. \u00a0Care, like all complex tasks, is best delivered as a team. \u00a0This doesn't mean that a different person needs to bathe your loved one every day or cook in your kitchen. \u00a0It means that people need to support YOU, the caregiver, to thrive in your role. \u00a0That support will look different for every caregiver, but the constant is that there is a team and the caregiver is the team leader. \n \n 4) \u00a0I must appear calm and in control at all times. \n \nCaregiving is emotional. \u00a0There are highs and lows as well as long stretches of quiet repetition. Many caregivers feel that it's wrong to express frustration or grief - that a show of emotion to medical professionals is 'unprofessional' or worse, a betrayal of their loved one. \u00a0Some caregivers worry that tears will elicit an unwanted pity response in friends or that if they begin to cry, they might not be able to stop. \u00a0Caregivers need to express emotions, including painful ones. \u00a0Julie Keon, in her new book  \"What I Would Tell You\"  expresses this human need acutely:  \n \n \"Grief can be our silent companion, something to be tended and nurtured. Think of grief as a person knocking on your door who really wants to see you. They knock incessantly...When the knocking starts, instead of hiding, you can take a deep breath and welcome this person into your home...\u00a0 You set a few reasonable boundaries as to how much time you have to give and then you put the kettle on.\u00a0 You settle in for some hot tea and conversation. As the visit progresses, you notice it isn't as bad as you thought it would be. You are discovering that this person you had always hidden from is wise and has much to offer.\" \n \n 5) \u00a0Work at home is not as important as work for pay. \n \nWrong! \u00a0Work at home is vital and it has great worth. \u00a0In Canada, family caregivers contribute over 5 billion dollars in unpaid labour annually to the national health care system. \u00a0The next time someone asks \"so, do you work?\", answer \"oh yes! \u00a0I work as my mother's caregiver. \u00a0And what do you do?\" \n \nTry turning these harmful beliefs into positive ones:  \n \n My role is to both give and receive care. \u00a0I can be happy and fulfilled if I choose to be. \u00a0I give the best care when I work in a team. \u00a0I pay attention to my emotions and sometimes, I feel better after a good cry. \u00a0My work is valuable and important.\u00a0 \n \n NOTE: \u00a0I wrote the foreword to Julie Keon's wonderful book 'What I Would Tell You' and I'll be telling you more about it in the weeks to come. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-plY_Cm_6HEQ/VUa1T0I-ZbI/AAAAAAAACGE/yMvpH5t0Tcs/s1600/ImproveSelfEsteem_thumb.png", "http://www.whatiwouldtellyou.com/book-preorder/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/05/five-bad-beliefs-that-harm-caregivers.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nGUEST POST by a Staff Writer at  Dry Depot \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBeing a caregiver is a difficult task and many of us will\nface extreme physical and emotional challenges as we care for our loved ones.\nHowever, we continue to go about our tasks, as it is an important part of our\ndaily lives even if it can lead to frustration. \n \n \n \nAs a caregiver you are a compassionate and kind human being,\nand when frustration mounts it can feel overwhelming. \u00a0The last thing we want\nto do is take it out on the ones we love. So how can we manage our own\nemotional wellbeing while caring for a loved one? There are many ways to maintain\npositivity through a tough day, and we have outlined five steps to help you\nstay positive while caring for your loved ones. \n \n \n \n Don\u2019t Focus On The\nPast- \n \nIt\u2019s easy to get sidelined by thoughts of the past, and\nfocus on what life was like before taking care of a loved one was part of your\ndaily routine. This can lead to emotional distress and while life might have\nbeen different before becoming a caregiver, staying focused on the present is\nessential to maintaining a positive outlook.  \n \n \n \n Focus On Education- \n \nIt\u2019s important to continually educate yourself about your\nloved ones condition. From physical care best practices, to what new scientific\nadvancements can help you and your loved ones live with a debilitating\ncondition. If we learn about the condition our loved one is living with, it will\nalso help us become more compassionate and understand how we can best be of\nservice. \n \n \n \n Research Products And\nServices- \n \nThere are many products, services, and new technologies that\ncan make life as a caregiver much easier. Whether it\u2019s a shower seat or adult\nincontinence products, investing in some of the tools that make a caregivers\nlife easier will offer some much needed relief. New technological advances such\nas video doctor appointments, pre-programmed cellular devices, and adult\ndiaper delivery services have made it easier for caregivers to maintain a\npositive outlook and not get bogged down with stress. \n \n \n \n Go Outside- \n \nMore than likely as a caregiver you spend a lot of time\nindoors with your loved one. It\u2019s important to take breaks in order to soak up some\nVitamin D and rejuvenate your spirits with fresh air. \u00a0This will do wonders for your psyche.\nWhether you can take short breaks or can take your loved with you, make time\nfor the outdoors whenever possible. \n \n \n \n Take A \u2018Me Day\u2019- \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThis is the most essential of all of the steps when it comes\nto maintaining positivity and emotional wellbeing. Everyone needs a \u201cme\u201d day,\nand you should schedule in personal time whenever you have the chance. We are\nbetter caregivers when we take personal time. Being a caregiver can be\noverwhelming at times, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t still set personal goals or enjoy\nyour time away from your duties. For many caregivers the thought of leaving our\nloved ones can be difficult, but just keep in mind that when you take time for\nyourself, everyone benefits. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://drydepot.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qM-mZ-sZu4k/VUkN1W9_HeI/AAAAAAAACGY/8ctrGIRL3V4/s1600/Untitled.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/05/how-to-stay-positive.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nSometimes, even the best laid plans fall apart. \u00a0And life feels very, very unfair. \u00a0Every caregiver has a story about a high school reunion or an anniversary dinner that had to be cancelled at the last minute because of a loved one's illness or worse, bad weather. \u00a0Sometimes, the Gods just don't want us to have a break. \n \nCaring over time requires patience and resilience. \u00a0We must reconcile the fact that we are not in control of our agenda and that our primary task is one of service. \u00a0We must find a way to be OK when plans are cancelled for dates that are very important to  us .  \n \nManaging disappointment is on the job description of the caregiver. \u00a0It's not at the top of the list, but it's there. \u00a0I remember once when my husband was travelling on business and we'd arranged that I would have a nurse live in for a week so I could join my spouse for a much-needed, exotic break abroad. \u00a0I had dreamed about this holiday, shopped for special clothes, packed, booked my flights and spent many hours daydreaming about this week away with my beloved. \u00a0As the departure date drew near, the realisation dawned that our son was unwell. \u00a0Trembling in his body and stiffness in his left leg prompted me to call the neurologist. \u00a0An examination of his spinal cord pain pump confirmed the worst: the catheter delivering medication to our son's spine was blocked and emergency surgery was the only recourse we had to correct it. \u00a0Travel was out of the question. \n \nAt first, I didn't have time to be disappointed. \u00a0Adrenaline kicked in and I rose to the occasion. \u00a0But afterwards, I felt sad and exhausted. \u00a0For a few days, I was even bitter that my holiday had been cancelled. \u00a0But I knew that those negative feelings would just multiply if I let them and so I decided to do two things: accept what had happened and make new plans.  \n \nI knew that travelling abroad wouldn't happen again - that opportunity had come and gone. \u00a0But a weekend away with my husband might be possible if our son could be cared for in a respite home and our daughter could stay with relatives. \u00a0I remembered reading a quote from an article about street people that had stayed with me: \u00a0\"You can live without money, but you can't live without plans.\" \u00a0I decided to make plans.  \n \nNowadays, my Mom and I make plans. \u00a0When they fall through, we make new plans. \u00a0Planning is fun, it's hopeful and it's action-oriented. \u00a0My Mom is 93 and frail, but we're getting her a passport. \u00a0She wants to see to her old summer home of Kennebunk Port in Maine and you never know, she may get there yet. \u00a0We're planning. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f9VF1BvfMyI/VWqGKysgWZI/AAAAAAAACJ0/w1RX7Jst5uU/s1600/disappointment-expectation-reality.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ET32rDClZKg/VWqFyM9qY5I/AAAAAAAACJs/C9Q1mGK8Thc/s1600/8534-Travel-planning.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/05/what-next-what-best-laid-plans-fall.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nGUEST POST \n \nMy parents turned 70 a few years ago. It was a wonderful celebration full of friends, laughter, food, and dancing the night away. I must admit even I, an only child who often ran away at the sight of parents\u2019 friends, had a lot of fun. But though this celebration was great, by the very next day my parents had retreated and transformed back into their old habits\u200a\u2014\u200alonely, isolated, and comforted only by the glow of their TVs and iPads. \n \nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. My parents used to be quite social and active, but when retirement hit it was as if their life came to a grinding halt. In the years since, I slowly watched them become more isolated and retreated. Sitting on the couch became their favorite pastime and the need to consume TV shows became their obsession. The worst part was watching their health slowly deteriorate, and their minds becoming numb. No matter what I tried to do to encourage activities in their lives, from Wii to FitBit to mind stimulation books, nothing seemed to work. My mother became more frail and developed muscular and gastric ailments that doctors couldn\u2019t explain while my dad succumbed to his hypertension and worsening heart condition and ultimately receive an angioplasty. Worst yet was the toxic moods and environment that developed at home that made life increasingly uncomfortable for not only them but also family and friends. \n \nI too began to wane and came close to giving up when something miraculous happened. My parents downloaded an app onto their smartphone called  WeChat. \n \n \n \n \n \nYears ago, I bought my parents smartphones, not because they were digital mavens or even cared about technology, but because it was the only type of phone available. For years they simply used it as a dumb-phone. No apps, no text messaging, only for calls. But as luck would have it, one of their friends introduced them to  WeChat  a year ago. It was as if someone breathed new life into them. The moment they started using this app, they simply couldn\u2019t put it down. It completely transformed their life. \n \nWeChat is a messaging application available for iPhone, Android, and others. Like similar apps out there, WeChat helps you easily connect with friends\u200a\u2014\u200aallowing you send and receive messages, voice notes, photos, etc. \n \nWhat made this app particularly relevant and exciting for my parents is something we in the industry call:  NETWORK EFFECT . People are naturally social. The bigger the network of people using something, the more likely someone new will join. \n \nThis was particularly true for my parents and WeChat. It wasn\u2019t the bells and whistles that my parents cared about, it was the simple fact that all of their friends were using it. Now all of a sudden, by downloading and installing one app, my parents had instant access to their friends. They no longer had to wait for someone to call or turn on the computer to check email. Their smartphone now linked them to an online community where their friends are always virtually present. They can choose to watch messages fly back and forth, engage in one-on-one conversations, or even socialize with entire groups at a time. \n \nThis level of engagement and participation started to completely transform their behavior. Age, retirement, and \u201chome captivity\u201d were no longer a barrier to social life. With their newfound virtual connectedness, they began to talk about daily life, share moments, and even self organize into activities. They started going out to more social gatherings, dancing parties, and even started hosting events at home. The variety of social engagements is simply amazing, a level that emailing and older platforms have simply never achieved. \n \nFor the first time in years, my parents are happier. They\u2019re healthier. They now finally understand why the rest of society, for better or worse, is completely attached to their phones. For them, WeChat has become their obsession. For me, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief and not worry about them ever feeling lonely or isolated again. \n \nWeChat is a great app and a great way to connect with people, but isn\u2019t necessarily the right app for everyone. What\u2019s most important is finding an app for you or someone you care about is first knowing what your friends and family are already using. Do that and it\u2019s one step closer to never being alone and isolated again. \n \n \n \n \n \nA few messaging apps options that will work for you - available on most iPhones via  iTunes App Store \u00a0and on Android smartphones via  Google Play Store : \n-  WeChat \u00a0 (Free, requires Data plan): a social messaging platform that allows you to easily message others one-on-one or in a group, share photos, and even send voice messages. Requires your friends and family to all use WeChat. \n-  Facebook Messenger \u00a0(Free, requires Data plan): for those who already use and love Facebook. You already have a lot of friends on there so it's all the more natural to start a conversation. \n-  Google Hangouts \u00a0(Free, requires Data plan): for those who email a lot and happen to use Gmail. Chances are most of your friends already use Gmail. Guess what - that means they're already on Hangouts too ready to start a conversation. \n- Text Messaging (Free, requires SMS messaging plan): Yes it's \"old fashioned\", and while it's not an app per say and may not sound like anything special but sometimes you don't need the confusion of getting everyone to download and use something new. Start with just a text message to a friend or loved one. Everyone has a phone. \n \nA healthier, better you begins with a conversation. \n \n \n \nby Mike Hua \nMike is the co-founder of the start-up  Ola Health , an anonymous support community for health, life, and caring for others, available on your smartphone. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://wechat./", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RSpVcwG0umc/VVPlvD9c8GI/AAAAAAAACHc/Zzscc019Bjo/s1600/Wechat-Screenshot.jpg", "http://www.wechat.com/en/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xI6z0wYy-IE/VVPlgo59GzI/AAAAAAAACHU/twnJJwaJac8/s1600/app_logos.jpg", "https://itunes.apple.com/", "https://play.google.com/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wechat/id414478124?mt=8", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facebook-messenger/id454638411?mt=8", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hangouts-free-messaging-video/id643496868?mt=8", "http://www.olahealthapp.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/05/never-feel-alone-again.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nVS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A day or two ago, I was driving along the highway enroute to visit Nicholas, my young man who lives in a truly cozy and pleasant care home.\u00a0 Nick is 24 and has severe cerebral palsy as well as a myriad of other complicated medical conditions.\u00a0 He is blessed with fantastic nursing care to keep him safe as well as family and friends who love him. \u00a0 Nick moved out of our home last year and we are all still finding our way to being comfortable with this new way of living. \n \n \n \n So as I was saying, I was driving along, listening to the radio - an interview with a certain Christy Wampole who had written an opinion piece for the New York Times that seemed to be getting a lot of attention in cyberspace.\u00a0 The title of Dr. Wampole\u2019s article was \u201c How to Live Without Irony \u201d.\u00a0 I began to listen intently and almost missed my turn.\u00a0 I sat in the parking lot when I arrived at Nick\u2019s just to catch the last bit and since then, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about irony. \n \n \n \n Dr. Wampole is a professor, so she\u2019s in the company of young people a great deal of the time.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2018hipsters\u2019 she skewers in her article - young people who prize cynicism and disguise it as wit.\u00a0 Here is Wampole\u2019s description of a hipster: \n \n \n \n The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies relentlessly, foraging for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things. \n \n \n \n I found out during the interview that Wampole had received some 200 emails in the first 24 hours after the blog publication and in a mere three days, garnered almost 800 online comments.\u00a0 Clearly, the armor of irony is important to lots of people.\u00a0 Here\u2019s another nugget from the article:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u00a0Ironic living is a first-world problem. For the relatively well educated and financially secure, irony functions as a kind of credit card you never have to pay back. In other words, the hipster can frivolously invest in sham social capital without ever paying back one sincere dime. He doesn\u2019t own anything he possesses. \n \n \n \n Wampole paints an accurate picture of young people who scour vintage shops to find clothes that look geeky.\u00a0 They adorn themselves with styles that are a comment on a comment. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n As I listened, I remembered something I had heard the neurologist/author Oliver Sachs say years ago:\u00a0 \u201cPeople with disabilities are condemned to always being themselves\u201d.\u00a0 Yes, I thought, it\u2019s impossible for Nicholas to be a hipster, or for me to be one for that matter.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t love irony as a form of humour, especially British wit.\u00a0 But I am rubbish at pretending it\u2019s a pillar of my personality, and I\u2019m betting that\u2019s true of every other caregiver too. \n \n \n \n This is what Wampole says about the likes of us: \n \n \n \n Nonironic models include very young children, elderly people, deeply religious people, people with severe mental or physical disabilities, people who have suffered, and those from economically or politically challenged places where seriousness is the governing state of mind. My friend Robert Pogue Harrison put it this way in a recent conversation: \u201cWherever the real imposes itself, it tends to dissipate the fogs of irony.\u201d \n \n \n \nSometimes caregiving feels like love and sometimes it feels like war. \u00a0But it's always, always real. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P8DbrKHnCbM/UK61sehscaI/AAAAAAAAAgU/D-igeRjUt54/s1600/hipster+3.jpeg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Er0qzG_0c58/UK62-FU7QJI/AAAAAAAAAgc/kKZExbiUSj8/s1600/P1050772.JPG", "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/06/from-treasure-chest-how-to-live-without.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Last night, Jim went over to Nick's to watch the hockey game, leaving me free to watch my choice of television shows with dinner on my lap. \u00a0I went straight to PBS and found  'Rx: The Quiet Revolution' , a documentary film on healthcare transformation in America. \u00a0I was particularly interested because recently, I worked on a committee looking at home and community care in Ontario. \u00a0Our report was titled ' Bringing Care Home'  and many of the challenges we discussed were similar to those examined in the film. \u00a0Here's a description of the documentary from the PBS website:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n A staggering 50 percent of American adults suffer from a chronic disease such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity and arthritis \u2014 and one in four has two or more chronic health conditions. In\u00a0 Rx: The Quiet Revolution , you\u2019ll travel across America to discover a quiet revolution happening in medicine. From Maine to Mississippi, Alaska to California, see physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals placing the patient at the center of their practice \u2014 transforming the way medical care is delivered while lowering costs and improving outcomes. \n Rx: The Quiet Revolution peels away the clinical barriers to 'knowing' patients and instead proposes a relationship-based model involving house calls, real conversations and even hand-holding. \u00a0The  NUKA model of care  from Anchorage, Alaska, is profiled in the film as an innovative example of improved patient outcomes together with health economic benefits. \u00a0Dr. Douglas Eby, the pioneer of NUKA says positive change resulted from clinicians developing and deepening 'friendly, professional' relationships with patients or 'customer-owners of care', as they are called in Anchorage. \u00a0I've been a fan of NUKA for years and have written about it in my book and here, in my  blog . \u00a0 \n \n Although there are many, many good and hopeful messages in this film, there is one aspect that is glaringly absent - the role of family in community care. \u00a0We all need the changes depicted in Rx: The Quiet Revolution. \u00a0We need compassionate doctors who take time to talk because \u00a0we need them to understand what our illness means to us. \u00a0 \u00a0 We need doctors to make house calls when can cannot get to their offices. \u00a0And we need medical professionals to work in inter-disciplinary teams so that chronic illness can be treated in the community. \u00a0 But there is a vital message missing in this film - patients (even when they are called 'customer-owners') do not live in a vacuum. \u00a0They survive at home with the help and support of friends and family who are integral in the circle of care and key to enabling the wellbeing of their loved one. \u00a0 \n \n From 'Bringing Care Home':\u00a0 \n \n When services are provided in an individual\u2019s home, other family members, including the extended family, friends\nand neighbours, are often involved in providing care. The residents of Ontario told us that they want the family to be\nthe \u2018client\u2019 and the planning and delivery of care to be truly client and family-centered. Although policy makers and\nproviders have long supported the principle of family-centered care, home and community care continues to look\nmore like it is focused on what the providers want, rather than on the needs and preferences of clients and families.\u00a0 \n \nToo bad that the creators of Rx: The Quiet Revolution did not include the family in their vision of community health care transformation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://video.pbs.org/program/rx-quiet-revolution/", "http://health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ccac/docs/hcc_report.pdf", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6cQk2SIYewI/VS_hdrrO33I/AAAAAAAACDg/yHSafnYNVVY/s1600/mezzanine_672.jpg.fit.750x422.jpg", "https://www.southcentralfoundation.com/nuka/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/04/re-imagining-care-at-home.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThis week, I've watched trailers for three terrific new films about caregiving. \u00a0I hope these are just the beginning of a new trend in movies and story-telling about giving and receiving care at home. \n \nThe first is a feature-length documentary airing on  PBS  in May (check your local listings), titled  Caring For Mom and Dad . \u00a0Meryl Streep narrates.  \n \n \n \n \nCARE is a Ford and MacArthur supported feature documentary still in the editing suite but coming soon. \u00a0The filmmakers need $50,000 to complete the final edits to this important documentary and you can contribute to the Kickstarter campaign  HERE , but hurry because the campaign ends on May 16th. \n \n   Care TRAILER  from  Deirdre Fishel  on  Vimeo . \n \nFinally, let me tell you about a gorgeous short doc ( 40 min.) about family caregiving titled  'Minding Our Own'. \n \n   Minding Our Own - TRAILER  from  STUDIO IGY  on  Vimeo . \n \n \n This morning, I interviewed the writer and director of Minding Our Own, Inaya\u00a0 Graciana\u00a0 Yusuf.\u00a0 Inaya is a young American of Indonesian heritage.\u00a0 Her maternal grandfather suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is cared for by his wife, Inaya's grandmother , with the direct supervision and help of her two uncles . A few years ago, Inaya's grandparents moved back to Indonesia and when her grandfather's needs increased. \u00a0More recently , her parents who live in Indonesia took on the responsibility of caring for them. \u00a0 Growing up in a multi-generational household or living in close proximity with\u00a0family members in Indonesia is quite standard. Younger generations feel a moral imperative to care for their parents, siblings and close relatives because they are exposed to it constantly. \n \n Q:  \u00a0What are the key messages in your film? \n \n \n Inaya:  \u00a0I wanted to highlight the importance of families staying together when someone needs care.\u00a0\u00a0It's important to show the impact of giving and receiving care on the whole family. In fact, I felt the urgency to indicate \u00a0that even though caring is not for everyone, it has the potential to enhance relationships.\u00a0 Giving and receiving care involves empathy and sympathy. I think in families, it pushes the boundaries of intimacy.\u00a0 This film unveils what it truly takes to care for another person. \n \n Q:  \u00a0What do you think are the differences in attitudes towards family caregiving between your Indonesian culture and that of our culture here in North America? \n \n \n Inaya:  \u00a0In my Indonesian culture, caregiving in the family is just a given.\u00a0 We believe that because our parents raised us, we owe it to them to care for them in their old age.\u00a0It is a cycle, and it is how one would perceive life. \u00a0 Here in the States, I believe we have a culture of nursing homes.\u00a0 Putting an older relative in residential care can sometimes be an 'easy out'.\u00a0 Of course,\u00a0 this is generally speaking and without doubt because as we all understand,\u00a0 every family situation is unique and not everyone is cut out for caregiving.\u00a0 Not to mention, it all depends on the best possible options.\u00a0However,\u00a0 I think we need to\u00a0 at least try\u00a0 look after those we love 'as much as we can' at home.\u00a0\u00a0 I do think that it is crucial that we \u00a0need to know our limits as caregivers, too.\u00a0 Being a caregiver is like being a project manager.\u00a0 Caregivers need to\u00a0 delegate what responsibilities they can handle and which ones to pass on. \u00a0Both parties need to learn not to be stubborn about negotiating care.\u00a0 \n \n Q:  \u00a0What are the barriers you see to people wanting to give care to family members? \n \n \n Inaya:  \u00a0I think it's so easy to back away from emotions.\u00a0\u00a0 We distance ourselves from family members and generally speaking, our surroundings - some people live far away from their parents.\u00a0 I was lucky to be brought up having close proximity with my paternal grandparents in Indonesia, but I also had the opportunity of spending my winters and summers with my maternal grandparents in New York. I was able to experience even the slightest changes and witness\u00a0 how people who love each other can be equally vulnerable... to have 'that moment' of care in a natural environment.\u00a0 At the end of the day, I think it is about breaking down that wall. Every single person has built some type of barrier to shield themselves from emotion. It boils down to human capacity. \n \n Q:  \u00a0Why did you title your film 'Minding Our Own'?\u00a0 Are you judging those who do not or cannot 'Mind Their Own'? \n \n \n \n Inaya:  \u00a0No!\u00a0 Not at all.\u00a0I think the title itself is a multi-layered experience. I wanted to play with and explore the meaning of those words. \u00a0'Our own' could mean 'ourselves' and 'our time' as caregivers too.\u00a0 That's why I emphasised knowing one's limits as a caregiver and then being able to ask for help and delegate. \u00a0 As I said before, it is not for everyone. Thus, \u00a0I wanted to celebrate caring for our own family members at home too and to underscore that care at home has very great value.\u00a0Caregivers \u00a0are our modern day superheroes. \n \n \n \n Minding Our Own, will be premiering in NYC at The Art of Brooklyn Film Festival, May 15th, 2015 at 6:15pm at St. Francis College, Maroney Theater.

The Every Australian Counts movement emerged in\nresponse to conditions similar to those in Canada (underfunded support\nprograms, long waiting lists, inequitable access). Through grassroots\norganizing, cross-disability coalition building, and comprehensive research\nthey built the awareness and political pressure necessary to have a national\nsupports program created. \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0What are the benefits to Canadians? \n \n \n \n While we don't have exact\nnumbers (yet), we know the waiting lists for support programs across Canada are\nlong and provinces are spending a lot on crisis interventions rather than\ninvesting in sustained supports, which are cheaper over the long-term. We also\nknow many family caregivers and individuals are out of work because of unmet\ndisability support needs, which is shrinking our workforce and tax base.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n This program will benefit\nALL Canadians by investing taxpayer dollars in early intervention, sustained\nsupports that grow our workforce, improve personal outcomes, and remove\nhigh-cost crisis spending. It will also ensure any Canadian who is born with or\nacquires a long-term disability through accident or illness has all essential\nsupport needs covered so they do not fall into crisis. No matter their income,\nwhere they live, or their ability to self-advocate, every Canadian will be\ncovered. \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0How far along is\nyour organization in realizing this dream? \n \n \n \n Based on the experience in\nAustralia, we expect the advocacy process to take five years, and we are one\nyear in. At this point, the Coalition is\u00a0steadily gaining new members from\nacross the disability spectrum and attracting public supporters from across\nCanada. We have brought together leading Canadian research organizations\n(Centre for the Study of Living Standards,\u00a0Canadian Council on Social\nDevelopment, Canadian Centre on Disability Studies, and The Caledon Institute)\nto build a comprehensive research agenda to inform development of a program\nmodel for Canada. The Coalition has also begun to identify politicians who will\nchampion ECC's vision at both the provincial/territorial and federal levels. \n \n \n \n This year (year 2) we plan\nto focus on fundraising to build our core organization's capacity to support\nCoalition work, to produce new advocacy and education materials, and to further\ndiversify our membership and support base. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Q: \u00a0What about seniors? \u00a0Are their needs covered in your vision? \n \n \n \n The model in Australia only serves the ageing population\u00a0 if \u00a0they enter the program prior to age 65. Those who develop disabilities later in life are not eligible. It's becoming a controversial issue there and it's something we've noted will need to be explored in advance (so creating two models: one that includes people who are older than 65 years of age with disabilities and one that doesn't, to compare costs). In terms of serving the population that ages with a disability, this model\u00a0 should \u00a0serve them better than the old system as disability supports are fully integrated into long-term care.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0What would be the cost to Canadian taxpayers to implement Every Canadian Counts?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n As for the cost to Canadians, the method for funding this program would need to be determined by the federal government in partnership with the provinces/territories. In Australia the population did agree to a 0.5% medicare tax increase (which per household, on average, totals about $350 per year). We could look at a tax levy in Canada to fund this program, but the Coalition suspects the federal portion of the funds can be drawn from the existing tax base. This would just mean shifting funds around, and the most effective options for this need to be fully explored. \n \n \n \n My research didn't reveal any new ideas for national long term care insurance in the USA. \u00a0Readers, let me know if I've missed something! \u00a0It's worth adding though, that the wonderful Howard Gleckman in his Forbes column today muses on the future of individual long term care insurance. \u00a0Read his excellent article  HERE .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://everycanadiancounts.com/", "http://www.ndis.gov.au/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E2hQA-gq5B8/VSu_lISx-EI/AAAAAAAACDE/TOh3wQlgeKQ/s1600/copy-copy-ECC-Homepage-Banner_Ex31.jpg", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2015/04/09/the-long-term-care-insurance-industry-ponders-its-future-seven-trends-to-watch/?utm_source=followingweekly&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20150413"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/04/national-community-care-insurance-whats.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt was months ago that I added to my reading list  'Not Exactly As Planned: A Memoir of Adoption, Secrets and Abiding Love' by Linda Rosenbaum . \u00a0But it was just this morning that I turned the last page and regretfully said goodbye to the Rosenbaum-Christmas family of Toronto Island.  \n \nLinda Rosenbaum and her husband Robin Christmas have two adopted children, but only one, Michael, who struggles with the effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder, or FASD. \u00a0Michael Christmas is a young man now, an accomplished wood carver who has learned how to be in the world through the love of his parents and sibling - a love that is imperfect but unwavering as in all the families I know who are raising children with developmental disabilities. \n \nI cannot tell you how much I loved this book. \u00a0Linda Rosenbaum doesn't just tell us the story of her adoption or of raising a child with learning and behaviour challenges. \u00a0She tells us the story of her life and what meanings her family disability narrative held for her. \u00a0We learn the secret of Linda's maternal grandmother's mental illness. \u00a0We learn the vital importance of rites and rituals in bringing calm and order to families burdened by chaos and unpredictability.  \n \nBut there's a more personal reason that I loved this book. \u00a0I too have a family history that impacted the way I felt about Nicholas' diagnoses. \u00a0Witnessing my father having a post-stroke grand mal seizure when I was 17 made me paralyzed with fear when Nick received a diagnosis of epilepsy. \u00a0I too struggled with serious depression and anxiety when I was a young student (I blogged about that part of my life  HERE ). \u00a0We are all a product of our experiences and that fact is revealed in harsh light when mothers and fathers struggle to be good parents to their children with developmental disabilities.  \n \nSo many of Rosenbaum's words resonated with me. \u00a0Take this reflection, for instance: \u00a0\"Parents often differ, but with a disabled child, the stakes feel higher. \u00a0We continuously wanted to 'correct' or teach or model. \u00a0We we had the power to 'fix'. \u00a0Every move counted.\" \n \nOr this: \u00a0\"I began sobbing. \u00a0What if my tears never stopped? \u00a0This is something for serious criers like me fear: that once we let ourselves go, we may never come back. \u00a0Shouldn't we know by now that crying, like life and a good story, has a beginning, a middle and an end? \u00a0Yes, perhaps I should have known. \u00a0But it's hard when I never know where the story is taking me next. \u00a0I kept crying.\" \n \nI wager that every mother of a child with disabilities has experienced the panicky, out of body experience of sobbing long and hard, fearing it will never stop. \u00a0I have.  \n \nThis book is not just about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and it's not just about adoption. \u00a0It's about family, personal histories and the effects of disabilities on our children and all who love them. \u00a0I urge you to  buy this book  and then to look at Rosenbaum's website as I did this morning. \u00a0Her family photos and stories are a wonderful adjunct to her book.  \n \nNOTE: \u00a0I am honoured to serve on the board of  NeuroDevNet , a Canadian Centre of Excellence that funds research into neurodevelopmental disabilities, including FASD.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O3N-nmS18zw/VUKe428nz2I/AAAAAAAACFk/I8EU2y4L3M4/s1600/51Zei7GaMGL._AA324_PIkin4%2CBottomRight%2C-54%2C22_AA346_SH20_OU15_.jpg", "http://www.lindarosenbaum.com/buy-the-book.html", "http://www.lindarosenbaum.com/buy-the-book.html", "http://www.neurodevnet.ca/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/04/not-exactly-as-planned-must-read-book.html", "title": ""},

These individuals, called Shahbazim, partner with\nnurses and other clinical team members to create an empowered clinical care\nteam of excellence. The Shahbazim report to a Guide, who is responsible for\nproviding the team with the support, accountability and resources necessary for\nsuccess in their role. \u00a0  The PSW role,\nreinvented as Shahbazim, gives care workers responsibilities for carrying out\nall activities of home life for elders. \u00a0\n This means cooking, personal care, ordering of supplies and\ncleaning. \u00a0  Shahbazim report very high job\nsatisfaction. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n CONGREGATED CARE \n \n \n \n Some jurisdictions are experimenting with congregated\ncare. \u00a0  Service provider agencies that\nstaff the needs of several clients within one residence are looking at new ways\nof bringing in a single PSW to serve several clients in the same building. \u00a0\u00a0  In my mother\u2019s seniors\u2019 residence, multiple\nPSWs from both private and government funded agencies come in to assist through\na revolving door. \u00a0  The travel time and\nlack of coordination amongst clients and staff in a single location must have a\nhuge and unnecessary cost. \u00a0  It\u2019s\nencouraging to hear about models that make life easier for both clients and\nitinerant care staff. \u00a0The congregated care model offers greater job security for PSWs and has the potential of lowering costs for clients through group purchase of service. \n \n \n \n NEXT UP - NATIONAL and PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE PLANS \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n There is another answer to full-time, fairly waged\nemployment for PSWs that would also be affordable for those who need care \u2013 a long\nterm care national insurance plan. \u00a0  That\u2019s\nthe subject of my next post.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1VKRr-GnHqo/VRnVP5R9q_I/AAAAAAAACBw/ApzDtQ4mE0M/s1600/psw_sildes_002.jpg", "http://mypsw.ca/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-av0u9fT-wQI/VRnTOlySUzI/AAAAAAAACBk/PmxB8mi1iAU/s1600/mypsw_logo_long.png", "http://www.silverchain.org.au/wa/health-care/palliative-care-hospice-care-service/", "http://thegreenhouseproject.org/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/03/whats-new-for-those-give-and-receive.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nOver the years, our family has relied on the help,\nfriendship and dedication of personal support workers, both for our son\nNicholas and more recently for my mother who needs assistance due to her\nage. \u00a0  These support workers worked\npart-time for low wages. \u00a0  More often than\nnot, they were women who were immigrants with skillsets and qualifications not\nrecognized in our country. \u00a0  Once, we had\na physician from Haiti who worked for us through an agency for $11.00 per\nhour. \u00a0 Another time, we had a home support worker from the Philippines who helped with Nick's care while her sister looked after our helper's two young children back in her homeland.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Personal Support Workers, or PSWs, are starting to fight back, but their wage increases equate to worry for clients, families and service provider agencies. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLast week, an article by always erudite  Howard Gleckman caught my eye.\u00a0 He wrote in Forbes: \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Should the aides who provide home care for frail elders and\nyounger people with disabilities receive a living wage and decent\nbenefits? \u00a0  If they do, how can families,\nwho often are unable to afford care today, be expected to pay those higher\nwages and benefits? \u00a0  Should the market be\nallowed to set these prices, or should government intervene through minimum\nwage and mandatory overtime laws? \u2026. These questions have set off an enormous,\nbut largely unnoticed, political firestorm. \u00a0\n In some states, they have pit states against the federal government,\npeople receiving care against their aides, and large home care agencies against\nindependent direct care workers.  \n \n \n \nIn Ontario, exactly the same questions are being asked. This\ntime last year, the then Ontario Liberal Health Minister Deb Matthews and\nFinance Minister Charles Sousa announced an election promise of an increase in the minimum wage for 34,000 publicly paid Personal Support Workers to $16.50 an hour\nby April 1, 2016, up 32 per cent from the current rate of $12.50. \u00a0  Implementation of that promise hasn\u2019t been\neasy. \u00a0  \u00a0 According to the Canadian Union of PublicEmployees (CUPE) ,\u00a0some home and community care agencies have chosen not to implement the wage\nincrease or they exclude sick leave, vacation and training hours in the new\nhourly wages. \u00a0  The sum total effect, says\na CUPE spokesperson, is that most Ontario PSWs have yet to receive a wage\nincrease. \n \n \n \nThe real lives of personal care workers are documented in a\nnew film titled CARE, due for release later this year. \u00a0\u00a0  The trailer is riveting and I recommend\nwatching it  HERE\u00a0 for a clear picture\nof the human side of our crisis in home and community care. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe care workers depicted in the film are all women. \u00a0  They are mothers and daughters who have left\ntheir own families behind in more impoverished countries in order to care for more affluent strangers in the United States. \u00a0  Many care\nworkers in Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand match this description.  \u00a0 Eva Kittay drills down into the issues\nsurrounding immigrant care workers and the role they play in a larger, profit\ndriven dynamic. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n The migration of care\nworkers is caused both by a pull, the need for care workers, and a push, the\nneed of these women to provide for their families. If the pull is the creation\nof demographics, of women\u2019s entry into the labor market, of the insufficient\nresponse of men to the demands of care, of inflexible work structures, and of\nlevels of mobility that spread family members far and wide, the push is created\nby deeply unjust global economic forces that include a heavy indebtedness of\npoor nations, by the structural adjustment policies that cut services, gut\npublic education, and drive the middle-class civil servants lower on the\neconomic scale, by the various forces that have been responsible for increasing\neconomic inequality globally, by governments that view the exportation of care\nworkers as a significant source of revenue, to mention but a few. The push, in\nshort, is created by forces of global injustice.  \n \n Eva Feder Kittay\u2018From the Ethics of Care to Global Justice \n \n \n \nThe truth is that people need care and care workers must be able to earn a living wage. \u00a0My next post will explore innovation to address these dual realities. \u00a0Stay tuned! \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_LuskJL8OXg/VRMO78o3I4I/AAAAAAAACA8/1oGmzzCeIxY/s1600/personal_support_workers.jpg.size.xxlarge.letterbox.jpg", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2015/03/18/what-the-battle-over-home-health-care-worker-pay-is-really-about/?utm_source=followingweekly&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20150323", "http://cupe.ca/haphazard-rollout-stymieing-psw-wage-increase-approved-ontario-budget", "http://caredocumentary.com/trailer/", "http://www.igs.ocha.ac.jp/igs/IGS_publication/journal/14/113-120.pdf"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/03/a-fight-between-psws-clients-and-agency.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday I presented at a Carleton University conference titled  'More Than Getting By: Putting Daily Life at the Heart of Our Struggles' . \u00a0 I was one of the few non-academics - most were scholars in the areas of political economy, women's studies, sociology or social work. \u00a0 My session was titled 'The Costs of Care' and presenting alongside me was Mary Jean Hande who talked about 'Survival and Resistance in Austere Times: Care Work, Disability Justice and Revolutionary Praxis. \u00a0As well, Anna Przednowek talked about 'Caring for the Carer of Adults with Intellectual Disabilities: A Policy Anomaly'. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt was fun. \u00a0Talking about the deeper meanings in our personal lives, especially delving into the hardest challenges and placing that experience within the context of philosophy and economics is my idea of a good time. \u00a0The general thrust of the morning was 'how can we think about care so that families are supported by their communities and by their country?' \n \n \n \nMy topic was 'The Capability Approach - A Policy Lens for Extreme Caregiving'. \u00a0Here's what I said: \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am an extreme caregiver and what I have learned is this: trying to keep our son alive while maintaining my own physical and mental health was an impossible task when I tried to do it alone. \u00a0One of the greatest sources of my personal stress was trying to negotiate with service providers to access what little help was available - help that wasn't really what we needed in the first place (but it was better than nothing). \u00a0I had to find a different policy tool that would enable families to be supported in ways that suited them, given their givens. \u00a0What I found was  Amartya Sen and the Capability Approach. \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998 for his development\nof the Capability Approach, a tool to assess freedom and wellbeing within\ncircumstances of extreme poverty.\u00a0 In his\nNobel address, Sen said, \u201c The Capability\nApproach sees individual advantage not merely as opulence or utility, but\nprimarily in terms of the lives people manage to live and the freedom they have\nto choose the kind of life they have reason to value. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The basic idea here is to pay attention to\nthe actual \u201ccapabilities\u201d that people end up having.\u00a0 These capabilities depend both on our\nphysical and mental characteristics as well as on social opportunities and\ninfluences (and can thus serve as the basis not only of assessment of personal\nadvantage but also of efficiency and equity of social policies.\u201d\u00a0  (Nobel Prize Address, 1998) \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 For me, Sen\u2019s\nCapability Approach represents a lens through which I can assess the value of\nmy life, understand my choices in relation to programmes, services and policies\nthat affected us throughout our son\u2019s life. \u00a0\n Sen speaks of the \u201cfreedom to live the life you value and have reason to\nvalue\u201d. \u00a0  I had a life mapped out for\nmyself before Nicholas was born, a life that I imagined I valued. \u00a0  The circumstances of our family life with\nNicholas forced me to reconsider my values and my reasons to hold those values.\n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmartya Sen has focused on issues relating to poverty and justice, but\nhe has also spoken about disability.\u00a0 At\na World Bank Conference on Disability in 2004, Sen lamented the failure of\ntheories of justice to adequately address the issue of disability.\u00a0 In his keynote speech at that conference, Sen\nexplored the relationship between wealth, disability, freedom and justice.\u00a0 \u201cWealth or income is not something we value\nfor its own sake.\u00a0 A person with severe\ndisability need not really be judged to be more advantaged than an able-bodied\nperson even if he or she has a higher level of income or wealth than the\nthoroughly fit person.\u00a0 We have to\nexamine the overall capability that any person has to lead the kind of life she\nhas reason to want to lead, and this requires that attention be paid to her\npersonal characteristics (and this includes her disabilities, if any) as well\nas to her income and other resources, since both can influence her actual\ncapabilities.\u00a0 To ground a theory of\njustice on the informational foundation of opulence and income distribution\nwould be a confusion of ends and means:\u00a0\nincome and opulence are things that we seek \u201cfor the sake of something\nelse\u201d (as Aristotle put it). (Keynote Speech, Second International Disability\nConference, World Bank, 30 November \u2013 1 December 2004.\u00a0 See www.worldbank.org)  \n \nHere, Sen is\ndistinguishing between \u201cearning handicaps\u201d and \u201cconversion handicaps\u201d, or how\none is able to convert money into good living.\u00a0\nGiving someone with disabilities, or their caregiver a million dollars\ndoesn\u2019t give them a good life if the money stays in the bank and the individual\nsits at home unable convert his riches into enjoyable living.\u00a0 It is easy to see why, for people with\ndisabilities and their families, this line of thinking is extremely helpful in\nunderstanding how anyone giving or receiving care can begin to identify and\nexercise practical choices that nudge individual circumstances toward a life\nthat one values and has reason to value.\u00a0\u00a0\nPolicies that enable people to exercise their capabilities, such as\nindividualized funding, and accessible public transportation, for example, help\npeople to exercise choice and experience life satisfaction.\u00a0  \n \nIn our family, I\nwanted to be good mother and I wanted to be supported in that role.\u00a0 But the demands on me resulting from Nick\u2019s\ndisability combined with the demands of the medical, social and educational\nsystems conspired to make me feel overwhelmed and desperate.\u00a0 The support systems that did exist seemed\ndesigned to support themselves, rather than Nicholas, me, and our family.\u00a0  \n \nOur family\nsurvived, but only because of perseverance, a solutions-based approach and\ninnovative and willing community partners who partnered in our advocacy\nefforts.\u00a0\u00a0 I would say that our family\nremained intact by the skin of our teeth.\u00a0\nWe are the embodiment of the saying \u2018what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you\nstronger\u2019.\u00a0 But we should never have had\nto fight so hard in isolation to achieve what most people call normal.\u00a0\u00a0 In my opinion, the Capability Approach is a\ngood place to start in redesigning a policy framework to support children and\nadults with disabilities together with their families giving care.  \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://carleton.ca/fpa/cu-events/getting-putting-daily-life-heart-struggles/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p-DQ2-YzIOc/VQ1dNwtH9MI/AAAAAAAAB94/C4MIqRtQ55U/s1600/logo-150by150.fw_-143x143.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/03/a-policy-framework-to-support-caregivers.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThere may be parents of children with disabilities who travel as a family during spring break, but I'll leave that subject for another post. \n \nToday, I would like to talk about making preparations to care from afar when you leave on holiday and your loved one does not travel with you. \u00a0Spring break is an important time for many families to bond with able-bodied siblings or reignite the romance in marriages. \u00a0Taking a break from your loved one at any time of year is a very good thing, as long as it's managed carefully for all concerned. \n \nCoordinating care from afar requires planning and coordination. \u00a0But once you've got that in place, you can relax on holiday. \u00a0Skype is a blessing for travellers and their loved ones, too.  \n \nHere's a sample check list that you can use to begin your distance caregiving planning: \n \n1) \u00a0Make a list of people you trust to do just one job on a regular basis while you are away. \u00a0Think of extended family (even if they don't live nearby - they could call your loved one regularly). \u00a0List all the friends who have ever offered to help and include them on your list if you trust them to follow through on a small commitment. \u00a0Identify a neighbor who will check in once a day if your loved one lives alone. \n \n2) \u00a0Use a diary to write down the tasks that you would normally perform for your loved one on the days you plan to be away. \u00a0Don't forget to include yard work or snow shovelling if that will be necessary. \u00a0Now, add in the 'extras' that you think your loved one would enjoy - perhaps an outing to a museum or just a visit at home. \u00a0Don't forget to assign someone to keep YOU up to date on \u00a0Share this diary with your friends and family and ask them to commit to one or two tasks in the diary. \u00a0You could even put names to tasks if you think a particular individual is well suited to home visits or outings. \n \n3) \u00a0Consider using a technology to keep everyone in the loop while you are away - something like  Tyze Personal Networks  or  Lotsa Helping Hands . \u00a0These platforms are designed to help people share the care. \n \n4) \u00a0Ensure that your loved one has access to  skype  technology. \u00a0Perhaps this will mean that one friend or relative is a 'skype friend' who visits with an Ipad and logs on at agreed times to visit YOU. \u00a0We gave my Mom an Ipad for her 90th birthday and she can use it pretty well. \u00a0When we are away, we skype our son Nicholas every day.  \n \n5) \u00a0Check that there are enough supplies and medications to last through the time you are away. \u00a0You may want to contact the pharmacist to help you with this. \u00a0Make sure your loved one has enough cash and food to last throughout your time away. \n \n6) \u00a0Write a 'Contact Information' sheet of your travel details, with flight numbers, dates, hotel contact information, emergency contacts, doctor's phone number, etc. \u00a0Share this document amongst all friends and family.  \n \nBeing well prepared and keeping in touch while you're away are the keys to a stress-free holiday. \u00a0Bon voyage! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yn5oPUPvODA/VO3ev4h7s9I/AAAAAAAAB58/hyRmYtFcBgs/s1600/fbv.jpg", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.lotsahelpinghands.com/", "http://www.skype.com/en/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/02/preparing-to-care-from-afar-during.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday, I read an excellent blog post titled  \"Asking for Help\" on the Caregiver Space . \u00a0The article is chock full of good ideas and practical advice. \u00a0It was the comments that got me thinking, though. \u00a0Many sounded like this: What if no one asks if they can help? That\u2019s my problem\u2026.. I\u2019m here 24/7, if someone would ask if they could come stay here for a little while for me to get out, I might take them up on it, but nobody offers that\u2026.. It\u2019s hard\u2026..it\u2019s been 3 years\u2026.. A lot of people say\u2026.call me if you need anything\u2026.. But that\u2019s not the same as a real offer\u2026. \n \n Others on the Facebook posting of the blog said they did ask for help, but the response from siblings was 'I think I'm busy'. \u00a0 \n \n So, what's going on with caregivers who aren't getting the help they need from family and friends?\u00a0 \n \n FEAR OF ASKING FOR HELP \n \n \n \n \n \n There's a cop in the head of many caregivers and that cop repeats things like,  'you should be able to do this alone. What's the big deal with doing laundry or shopping or banking for Mom?'  \u00a0Many caregivers believe that they are shirking their obligations and actually betraying the love they feel for a dependent loved one if they ask for help. \u00a0It feels like an admission of failure in the most important job of your life. \u00a0 \n \n Caregiving websites are littered with blog posts, resources and inspirational sayings about self-care. \u00a0We've all heard that we must care for ourselves in order to care effectively for our loved ones. \u00a0So, why is it so hard to ask for help? \u00a0And why do people say no when finally the request is made? \u00a0 \n \n One answer could be that by the time a request is made, the caregiver is so exhausted and angry that the request  sounds  angry. \u00a0And a caregiver who is overwhelmed is not going to be asking for something small, the request is likely to be for someone to come and 'take over' for a few days. \u00a0That's not unreasonable when one sibling (or parent) is doing the lion's share of care. \u00a0But there may be a good reason that even someone who  wants  to help will say no in this situation. \n \n FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN \n \n Caregivers who aren't used to asking for help often don't share the details of their caring lives with family and friends. \u00a0Not sharing stories and information is part of the 'Oh, I can do it myself, it's all fine\" modus operandi of the caregiver who is locked in the time bomb of 'look after your own' mentality. \u00a0Family and friends who are asked to help someone  in an emergency  whose needs they know nothing about will be afraid to help, especially if the request sounds angry or desperate. \u00a0 \n \n HOW TO GET THE HELP YOU NEED \n \n Change the words of the cop in the head - say instead,  \"I need my family and friends to be on my team. \u00a0I need to help train them. And that training will take time and encouragement.\" \n \n Begin training on a good day, when everything feels under control. \u00a0Think of what members of your family naturally like to do or talents they might have. \u00a0The agenda is to familiarise your future team members on the needs of your loved one. \u00a0Remember, every caring task by itself is perfectly doable. \u00a0But taken together and over time, caregivers become overwhelmed trying to do everything alone. \u00a0Pick one task you think a friend or relative might be able to do. \u00a0Ask that person to do that task once a week for a month with a promise to re-evaluate on both sides after the trial period. \u00a0Some caregivers might not have the words to make that first request. \u00a0Try saying, \"I know you love cooking and we always love all the treats you prepare. \u00a0I don't have time to cook a healthy meal every night, so I wondered if you would like to make us a meal once a week for a trial period of month or so? \u00a0You could pick a day of the week that works for you and we can check in after a month to see if that day works for us all. \u00a0What do you think?\" \n \n THE REALITY \n \n The reality is that most people  want  to help, but they don't know how. \u00a0And they see the danger of becoming overwhelmed. \u00a0That's why it's important to choose small tasks that people can absorb into their lives and feel good about helping in a way that exploits their talents without feeling out of control. \u00a0Once family and friends have some experience in helping that feels good, they will be much more likely to help out in an emergency. \u00a0They'll be your teammates in caregiving. \n \n \n \n \n My book, The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving \u00a0(House of Anansi Press, 2014) is available from all major booksellers in the USA and Canada.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thecaregiverspace.org/caregiver-survival-asking-for-help/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MJDxb0jzLVU/VNDlpSv1YUI/AAAAAAAAB4g/O7rgxNw--L0/s1600/fears_11.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VeFJj92S8Nk/VNDmnI5HWJI/AAAAAAAAB4o/W-dWkxDyWC4/s1600/team.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/02/why-some-people-wont-help-and-what-you.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n Recently, I've seen a trend that worries me. Social media disability support groups are commonly hosting conversations in which independence is trumpeted as an aspiration. \u00a0That's OK, except that independence is simultaneously being presented as the most necessary ingredient to human worth. \n \n The disability movement has always been fractured. \u00a0There are parents who seek safety and security in segregated settings, while others fervently defend their loved one's right to study and live in community mainstream settings. \u00a0There are parents of children with autism who seek a cure for the symptoms that cause suffering in their families and others who staunchly maintain it is society that must change and adapt to accommodate diversity, including disabilities such as autism. And of course, there are people with disabilities whose primary concern is employment and accessibility. \u00a0Seniors with care needs have a strong lobby. Jockeying for limited funding resources can pit the interests of various disability communities against each other, a situation in which there are no real winners. \n \n For the most part, the choices we made for our son fell into the community inclusion camp. \u00a0But my husband and I have always truly based our choices for Nick on the best available arrangements matched up with what we thought our boy needed. \u00a0The one thing we always agreed on was that our solutions for adult living had to taken into consideration that Nick is medically complex and requires human assistance for every aspect of his life. \u00a0 \n \n I've noticed lately that public discussions within the disability community inclusion movement are not welcoming to people asking questions or seeking solutions that are not easily addressed by a model of support that is best suited to individuals with mild to moderate disabilities. \u00a0And it's not the lack of home support services that is the problem, but rather the individual's inability to learn skills that will make them more independent. \u00a0If a candidate for a housing project, for example, lacks the abilities to ensure success of that project, the person will not be welcome. \u00a0And that's not a bad thing in itself unless proponents of that project maintain that people who are not fit for purpose are selling out to a lower moral order. I am hearing people being blamed for their dependency needs. \u00a0On the other hand, if a person is perceived to have hidden talents that are valued by society generally (such as in the case of 'savants'), that person is welcome. \u00a0Where do the concerns of people with severe cognitive or complex physical care needs fit into this complicated hierarchy or worthiness?\u00a0 \n \n For many people with disabilities as well as frail elders, independence is a fiction. \u00a0For caregivers who love those who will always need the care of others, we seek to find solutions that maximize dignity, function and social opportunities. \u00a0But the first order of business will always be meeting the requirements of basic care for health and safety, life and limb. \u00a0 \n \n The discussion about how to accommodate a good life for our loved ones with care needs doesn't have to be fractious. \u00a0Communities that support the wellbeing of people with disabilities as well as our ageing citizenry must locate common agenda items and work together collaboratively to achieve broad, positive change.  \u00a0The Stanford Social Innovation Review provoked lively discussion in 2011 with an article titled 'Collective Impact'.  \u00a0In it, the authors propose that non-profits join forces on issues where they agree broad change must occur. \u00a0To achieve Collective Impact, organizations must engage in this process: \n \n \n \n Collaborating organizations must create a common agenda. \n These organizations must also share a measurement system that tracks indicators of success. \n Stakeholders must work together in mutually reinforcing activities. \n They must also engage in continuous communication. \n There must be a backbone support organization that coordinates, supports, and facilitates the collective process. \n \n \n \n \n \n We must find a way forward in which all are welcome and dependency is not seen as either a weakness or a lack of imagination in problem-solving challenges. \u00a0We can do this by searching for consensus and drowning out divisive voices where the agenda does not reflect the greater and common good. \u00a0We can do this by insisting that our charitable non-profits engage in Collective Impact.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ezinearticles.com/?Collective-Impact:-A-Game-Changing-Model-for-the-Social-Sector&id=7420565", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1gtwdsSJdN0/VPEEenns9MI/AAAAAAAAB6U/ERz-GMLgPsY/s1600/collectiveimpact2.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/02/ableism-community-living-and-myth-of.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nBy Jennifer Tucker, Vice-President,  Homewatch CareGivers International , a home care brand whose locations provide care and support to elders so they can age safely in their own homes. \n \n \n \n \n \nGoing home for the holidays can be a joyous time of celebrating and reminiscing with loved ones. \u00a0It's also a time to check in with relatives, and make sure everyone is doing well, especially elder relatives who are living on their own. \u00a0The holidays are sometimes the only time the entire family is together, free from the usual daily distractions of work and responsibilities out of the home. \u00a0This creates an ideal time to sit down and have some tough conversations. \u00a0Talking openly and honestly with your loved ones this holiday season is the first step in figuring out the best options for their long-term care. \n \nTake this opportunity to be caring and observant for any potential problems that your elder loved one may have a difficult time expressing to you. \u00a0Is the food in the kitchen fresh or are there items past past their expiration date in the fridge? \u00a0Is the mail being opened and properly sorted? \u00a0Do they seem confused about your name or get you mixed up with other family members? \n \nAs an adult child, this is a pivotal point in your relationship with your parents. \u00a0The first questions we often ask are: what can I do? \u00a0How do I make sure they receive care? How are they going to pay for the support they need? \u00a0It is, however, important to remain calm and understanding of your parents' wishes and needs. \u00a0Providing loving support and a promise to walk this next road together can help both of you make the best possible decisions. \n \n \n \n \n \nSet aside a private time away from the holiday festivities to ask your relatives how they are doing. \u00a0Remember to listen. \u00a0Rather than offer to 'help', talk with them about their needs. \u00a0From there, you can work together to find solutions to meet these needs. \u00a0Maybe there are medical issues, which will need to be addressed by a doctor. \u00a0Help provide them with the resources necessary to find one they trust and offer to drive them to an appointment or arrange a ride for them. \u00a0Or perhaps they need a little assistance around the house with basic chores. \u00a0Offer to help them research home care companies, or interview care providers. \u00a0Taking a collaborative approach to this situation, rather than an intrusive one, can help to leave your loved ones feeling empowered, instead of demeaned by the experience.  \n \nOnce the concerns are sufficiently established, the next step is figuring out how to pay for things such as long-term care, if that is needed. \n \nWhen talking to loved ones about their current and future long-term care needs, ask if they might have a long-term care insurance policy. \u00a0Surveys show that the majority of older adults prefer to live in their homes as they age instead of relocating to an assisted living facility and long-term care insurance has the potential to support this desire. \n \nMost modern long-term care policies are created based on the preferences of the person, so if your relative has a policy and wants to age at home, there is a good chance their policy reflects that, and covers home care. \u00a0Home care providers can offer support in activities - such as bathing, toileting, dressing, meal preparation, cleaning and transportation - that can be the key to keeping your loved one in their home.  \n \nOne of the greatest gifts you can give this holiday season, is one of love and caring for your family's wellbeing as their needs change. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.homewatchcaregivers.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c7QB7NHDBKo/VIB47-g2jcI/AAAAAAAABzA/9AjWnyR7XMY/s1600/Grandma%2Bxmas.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Qm7fxN15Bs/VIB5zy172AI/AAAAAAAABzI/BEWYGyu05Fc/s1600/stock-footage-elderly-african-american-couple-talking-home-with-adult-son.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/12/talking-turkey-about-eldercare-over.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nLet me tell you about a perfect caregiver I know. \u00a0Her name is Glenna and she looks after my Mom for a couple of hours on Wednesdays and Saturdays. \u00a0Mom's home care agencies are littered with support workers she's thrown out - my mother resents needing help and quite often, she takes it out on her unsuspecting caregivers, especially if they are patronising. \u00a0But Glenna is different. \u00a0She's quiet, but smart. \u00a0Sensitive, but direct. \u00a0Respectful, but not fawning. \u00a0When Glenna is home, you wouldn't know it, except that the laundry is done, the kitchen is tidy, there is a sandwich and fruit plate prepared in the fridge and Mom is dressed with her hair styled.  \n \nEva Kittay, the philosopher and disability Mom, describes the perfect caregiver as a 'transparent self': \n \n A transparent self does not allow its own needs or vision of the good to cloud its \n perception of another\u2019s needs, and so offers no resistance to its response to \n another (except, of course, when such a response would be in direct violation of a \n well considered and deeply held moral belief or conception of the good). The \n perception of and response to another\u2019s needs are neither blocked by nor refracted \n through our own needs and desires. A transparent self attempts to intuit and \n respond to the other\u2019s own sense or understanding of their own good, and does so \n for the other\u2019s own sake. (2007, 53) \n \nGlenna is transparent when she gives care. \u00a0For example, a couple of days ago, I visited Mom and when I arrived, Glenna was there along with my sister Karen. \u00a0We all converged on Mom because we knew that she didn't feel well and might have pneumonia. \u00a0I watched as Glenna knelt at Mom's chair-side and asked quietly, 'would you like a dressing gown? \u00a0It's a bit chilly in here.\" \u00a0She didn't ask about putting a glass of ice water on the table, she just did it. \u00a0Glenna would never, ever 'show off' her caregiving skills or her friendship with Mom to us, the daughters. \u00a0She knelt beside Mom to establish eye contact and be heard without disturbing conversation in the room (Mom is slightly hard of hearing). \u00a0Glenna never draws attention to Mom's frailty or needs - her assistance makes Mom seem more  able and less dependent  than she is. \n \nGlenna is a perfect caregiver and we are very, very grateful to have her in Mom's life. \u00a0But as I say in my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom ,  \"The extent to which a carer has to become \"transparent\" in order to provide good care, acutely listening and watching for signs of need or distress, cannot and should not be sustained without reward and rest.\" \n \nTransparent caregivers are perfect caregivers, but they are fragile. \u00a0We all need to support the integrity, strength and health of the perfect caregivers in our lives - our own future wellbeing as care receivers depends on it. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://houseofanansi.com/products/the-four-walls-of-my-freedom", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jZIk0m5C_20/VKsQWzsjlTI/AAAAAAAAB2A/4wHxrDGpAMI/s1600/Angel%2Btransparent.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/01/the-perfect-caregiver.html", "title": ""},

This week, I'm travelling three days out of five.  \n \nThis is how I described the satisfaction I derive from activism in my book,  'The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving': \n \n \n    \n     \n      I have always advocated strongly for whatever I thought\nNicholas needed at each stage of his life. But I have only\nrecently begun to understand what this advocacy role has\u00a0 provided to me in return. Having a baby whom I could\nnot feed or soothe easily made me feel sometimes like a\ndesperate failure as a mother, but becoming an expert on\ntherapies and political advocacy strategies helped me to\nexperience a sense of strength and control. \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n Rosalyn Benjamin Darling points out in her research\non parents of children with disabilities: \u201cWhen parents\ncontinue to encounter needs that cannot be met by existing societal resources, they may embark on a prolonged\ncareer of seekership. The goal of seekership is  normalization , or the establishment of a lifestyle that approximates\nthat of families with only nondisabled children. Seekership\nresults in advocacy and activism when certain situational\ncontingencies or  turning points  occur.\u201d 27  Such activism\nDarling calls \u201centrepreneurship.\u201d One has to be socialized\ninto the role of entrepreneur, and socialized I was. The\nconfluence of the changing role of women, opportunities\nfor our higher education and the booming economy all\nprovided fertile ground for the flourishing of my skills as\nan entrepreneurial activist. Darling continues: \u201cFor most\nparents, active entrepreneurship ends after they reach\nwhat they consider to be normalization,\u201d while for some\nit continues to \u201ccrusadership.\u201d These are the parents who\ncontinue to work for disabled children and adults even\nwhen the needs of their own children are met. 28\n \n\n      \n Darling is right, at least as far as I am concerned, that\nactivism offered me a sense of power, control and usefulness. Activism was and continues to be a core part of my\nsense of being a good mother. The opportunity to pursue\u00a0 entrepreneurship in the form of activism did afford me a\nsense of normalization and provided me with a sense of\nbeing a good mother to my son. It still does.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nFor most of my adult life, I did almost nothing but look after my family. \u00a0Now, I'm drawn by other work that has impact for younger families and people looking after their elders.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nHere\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been pondering this week: can\nexcellent caregiving be taught? \u00a0  Imagine\nthe perfect caregiver\u2026 someone who listens with their whole being, someone who\nenables the disabled with quiet dignity and humor, someone who puts their\ncharge in the spotlight, while they retreat to the shadows. \u00a0  Can these skills and talents be taught to our\nnext generation of humankind?  \n \n \n \n Howard Gleckman spoke in his Forbes blog this week  about a\nradical new approach to Alzheimer\u2019s care. \u00a0\u00a0\n He was exhorting the virtues of Dr. G. Allen Power\u2019s book,  DementiaBeyond Disease  in which Power calls for us to \u2018see people with dementia as\nhaving experienced a change in their world view. \u00a0  We must not try to change them, but rather\nmeet them where they are, without drugs.\u2019 \n \n \n \n \u00a0 Gleckman: He (Power) is, for instance, an\noutspoken critic of segregated dementia units (often called memory care) that\nhave become the standard in many residential care facilities. At the same\ntime,\u00a0he offers many practical ideas for helping those with dementia. \n \n Imagine someone\u00a0who is extremely agitated. You can\ncontrol her aggression with medication. Or you can identify the cause of her\nupset, and change it. Maybe she is in pain, or troubled by loud noises. She may\nnot be able to describe in words why she is distressed. But if you know what to\nlook for, you can learn from her body language. \n \n \n \n \n If we\nagree with Power and Gleckman, we will certainly need to be able to teach good\ncaregiving. \u00a0  People  are required to carry out this approach. \u00a0  And paying for those people will depend on\nhow much we value the altered world view and experience of those we love with\ndementia. \n \n But,\nperhaps it\u2019s a spiritual poverty that we healthy, younger folks feel that will ultimately\ndrive us to teach and train excellent caregiving skills to the masses. \n \n The\nvery wise New York Times columnist  David Brooks wrote an OpEd  last week that\nignited a lively discussion in my family. \u00a0\n Here\u2019s what he said about a good definition of \u2018meaning\u2019 in peoples\u2019\nlives:  \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Yet what do we mean when we use the word\nmeaning? \n \n The\nfirst thing we mean is that life should be about more than material success.\nThe person leading a meaningful life has found some way of serving others that\nleads to a feeling of significance. \n \n Second,\na meaningful life is more satisfying than a merely happy life. Happiness is\nabout enjoying the present; meaning is about dedicating oneself to the future.\nHappiness is about receiving; meaningfulness is about giving. Happiness is\nabout upbeat moods and nice experiences. People leading meaningful lives\nexperience a deeper sense of satisfaction. \n \n In\nthis way, meaning is an uplifting state of consciousness. It\u2019s what you feel\nwhen you\u2019re serving things beyond self. \n \n \n \n But Brooks went on to\ndiscredit the current, more new-age seeking of meaning with its hallmarks of\nself-regarding emotion and immediate gratification. \u00a0  He worries that our society lacks a hierarchy\nof values and moral architecture \u2013 that\u2019s where the discussion in our family\nstarted: should we impose a system of moral values that is rooted in justice\nfor the common good, or is personal freedom more in need of protection? I\nbelieve it\u2019s a balance. \u00a0 \n \n One thing is for\nsure. \u00a0  We won\u2019t have any caregivers for\nour generation or the next if we define meaning only in the most individual\nterms\u2026.especially if we choose to treat our loved ones with a human touch rather\nthan drugs. \u00a0Society's next big challenge is to create a language and culture of care that gives meaning to all our lives. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2014/12/29/a-provocative-new-way-to-think-about-dementia/", "http://www.edenalt.org/store/DEMENTIABDISEASE", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Njv0l1a0VGo/VLKwsXXhW8I/AAAAAAAAB2Y/M999RaFf9TA/s1600/Dementiabeyond.jpg", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/opinion/david-brooks-the-problem-with-meaning.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fdavid-brooks&_r=0"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2015/01/can-we-teach-caregiving-to-masses.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n By Guest Blogger, Fay D. Wein \n \n \n Introduction:   According\nto a recent study headed by  Susannah Fox , associate director of the Pew Research Center's Internet\nand American Life project, Americans are living longer not only due to advances\nin medicine, but as a result of the excellent care that is being provided by\nadult caregivers upon their release from the hospital. Although we now have\nmore life extending treatment than ever before, seniors are often released from\nthe hospitals in very fragile states, and it is the at-home caregivers that are\nthe first line of defense. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A quick glance at the\nstaggering numbers:  \n \n \n Almost  70 million  adult children provide care to an elderly relative\naccording to recent stats. The majority of these selfless caregivers provide at\nleast  20  hours of weekly care\nwithout compensation. About  50%  of\nthese family caregivers work full time jobs  in addition  to their caregiving duties and  11% worked part time jobs.  \n \n The amount of money this care saves the\ngovernment is something to the tune of $450 billion as  estimated\nin an AARP study ,  and the phenomenon is only growing. Clearly, family\ncaregivers are an indispensible asset in our great country, and it behooves us\nto take a closer look at the needs of both the caregivers and recipients for\nthe benefit of society at large. \n \n \n \n CAREGIVER NEEDS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Emotional support. \u00a0 Caregiver burnout\nis unfortunately all-too-common and the importance of a strong support system\ncannot be overstated. There are many aspects when it comes to receiving the\nemotional support one needs, including family support, social circle and\nsupport groups. \n \n \n \n When family members pitch in\nand help one another, even when one adult child takes the brunt of the load on\ntheir shoulders, it can have a great impact on the emotional well-being of the\ncaregiver. Many times all one has to do in order to receive that helping hand\nis to ask for it. While a caregiver is an everyday hero, he or she is not\nsuperman. By delegating responsibilities, the caregiver gets some much needed\nrejuvenating respite.  \n \n \n \n Those in the caregiver\u2019s social\ncircles will generally offer to pitch in with a vague \u2018if there is anything I\ncan do just give me a ring.\u2019 \u00a0  It is not\nalways easy, but as a caregiver-take them up on it! Full time care giving is no\neasy feat, and spreading some of the duties beyond the family can make a real\ndifference.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Support groups are\nan invaluable resource for the emotional well-being of a caregiver. Just the\nknowledge that there are others in a similar situation can work wonders in\naddition to the indispensible advice, insights, and coping tips that can be\nlearned. There are programs that offer day care or other volunteer services\nwhich can be very helpful, as well. Ultimately, reaching out to others for\nsupport will benefit both you and your loved one. \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Personal needs: \u00a0Care giving can\ntake up a life of its own, and lead to the neglect of the caregiver's personal needs\nand family. Many caregivers have had their health deteriorate as a result of\noverextended care,  according to a NAC\nstudy.  Care must be taken not to allow caregiver\nduties to infringe on one\u2019s work schedule or to neglect one\u2019s own family needs or\nhousehold duties.  \n \n \n \n If a caregiver begins to see an\nunhealthy pattern of personal neglect, depression, lack of sleep, etc. or that\nthe loved one requires more intensive care, it may be time to consider other\ncare options, such as a skilled nursing facility. Sometimes the help of a professional\nMedicaid planner is recommended when one is at that critical juncture and  needs\nprofessional guidance  with Medicaid-sponsored nursing\nhome care which can be quite pricey when paid out of pocket. \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Financial help.  In some states Medicaid\noffers a  Cash\nand Counseling program  that will cover in-home care\nfor those below the asset and income levels for that particular state. Health\ncare professional are aware of the many benefits of a family member proving\ncare to their loved one and allow for payouts to be made to the senior to pay\nfor their own care as they see fit.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 This policy comes as opposed to the\ntraditional Medicaid coverage method where they collaborate with professional\nhome care agencies that do not always provide the care on a consistent basis\ndue to bureaucratic backlog and switching of caseworkers. \n \n \n \n This program is available in 15\nstates and some other states offer funding for in-home care for those just\nabove the income or asset limit for Medicaid. Caregivers should thoroughly\nresearch their options and find out if their state offers this type of funding.\n \n \n \n \n CARE RECIPIENT NEEDS: \n \n \n \n Safety and security. \u00a0 A\u00a0senior receiving\ncare needs to have their safety and security needs met first above any other\nneed. They need to be able to safely go up and down the stairs in their own\nhome, get in and out of the bathroom, have access to any emergency device they\nmay need and, in case of a fire, be physically able to leave the premises in a\nsafe manner. \n \n \n \n They also need to be secure in\nthe knowledge that all their physical and medical needs are being met, such as,\nthey are eating their daily meals, taking their medication on schedule and do\nnot have to worry about getting lost around the corner of the house they\u2019ve\nlived in for the better part of their lives. \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dignity.  It is common for caregivers of\na loved one with dementia to revert to a parenting role and talk down to the\nperson they are caring for. It is important to separate the dementia from the\nperson suffering from it by keeping a picture of the victim before dementia in\nmind and speak to them accordingly \n \n \n \n Caregivers need to be careful\nwith their tone of voice to make sure that they are not treating seniors like a\nchildren, and exercise caution with word choice as well for things like diaper,\nbib and potty, substituting these for more dignified variations, like padded\nunderwear, apron and using the restroom. \n \n \n \n Use therapeutic \u201cfibbing\u201d. This\nis the process of not telling the whole truth to a person with dementia due to\nthe pain it may cause them. So for example, if your elderly dad wants to get into\nthe car and drive to the pharmacy hide the car keys or offer to drive him\ninstead. Do NOT tell him that the doctor advised against it which will only\ncause pain and resentment. These are just some of the areas in which we can\nmaintain the dignity of our elders while provide for their care. The key is: be\nsensitive to their feelings. \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A smiling face.  The affect of\nadministering care with love and a smiling face, has been proven to help those\nwith dementia, maintain a sense of emotional balance and it enhanced their self\nimage, especially those in an early stage of dementia. This has helped them\nexperience less anxiety and get more satisfaction out of life. \n \n \n \n Conclusion:  Family care-giving is an important part of the senior health care\nsystem. Many suffer financial setbacks in their careers as a result of\nbalancing their work and care-giving schedules and a large percent has opted to\ngive up their job altogether in order to care for their parent.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n These men and women deserve to be saluted for\ntheir humanitarianism and be offered the support and information that can help\nthem fulfill their duty more easily.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Fay D.

{"date": "", "body": "\nThis week, I had the pleasure of chatting with other caregivers about how we prepare for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  \n \nI had this online chat on the wonderful site Caregiving.com which led me continue my reflections on holiday preparations yesterday: \n \n \n \nI sent this video chat to another caregiver friend to begin a personal conversation about how we prepare for the holidays. \u00a0My friend is the mother of two adult children with severe disabilities. \u00a0Sadly, one of her boys passed away a few years ago and she misses him still. \u00a0Her surviving son requires 24/7 nursing care, so holidays are very different for her family than they are for most. \n \nHere's what she said: \n In the old days, every single room in our home was decorated to the maximum. It looked like the Christmas Store exploded in our house. I made numerous fresh floral arrangements (as I was into that for a few years as therapy). I baked. I made candles, pouring wax into assorted forms and decorating them when finished to give as gifts. I hosted parties for our close friends for gift exchange, and made huge meals for the occasion. All of this, I did as a single parent. In our graduate student days, when we were poor, I baked pecan pies, and drove in the freezing snow on icy roads to deliver them in person to our friends. My pies were famous, so I was usually greeted at the door with fork-wielding friends! My Uncle and Aunt had the largest home, so my Aunt insisted that she hold both Thanksgiving and Christmas. That meant that I got to haul my boys and their chairs, their meds, diapers, changes of clothes, books, toys, and whatever else, along with my pot luck contribution of veggies, and at Christmas ~ all of our Christmas gifts to the family. Then I drove an hour to their house ~ Load, unload, load, unload, arrive home after midnight, put the kids to bed and collapse. When I insisted that I wanted to host Christmas, my Aunt said, \"We're just trying to make it easier for you.\" I explained that it was far easier for me to cook dinner in my home than it was to haul everything down to their home and back again. So what happened on Christmas Eve night the first time I hosted? One son had pneumonia, and at 3 a.m., he, my other son, and I were driving to ER in the fog. Got home at 6 a.m. Put the turkey in. Got the boys settled, tended to them, and when the family arrived on Christmas afternoon, I was ready. I pulled it off. Not anymore. Now, I decorate a bit, with maybe a touch here or there in the living/dining room/kitchen. I don't have the strength or energy to decorate ~ unbox, put out, take down, rebox, put away. It's a lot of work. The Christmas decorations are on the top shelf in the garage, a precarious reach on the ladder for my husband. A broken hip isn't worth the festive ambiance! Just the little decorating we do for the boys is tiring enough for us. As long as we honor them and bring beauty and sparkling, meaningful surroundings to them, we have celebrated Christmas exactly as we should. We are just so grateful to spend Christmas at home, as we've spent a few in the hospital; Christmas 2004/New Year 2005. In 2010, our young man was released on Christmas Eve from ICU, but he was not ready to be home, and was sick that weekend, while we waited for a nurse. He was back in ICU by January 24 2011 for 40 days (we watched the Super Bowl in ICU).\u00a0 Choose any holiday, and we've been in the hospital with one of our boys. Easter, Valentine's Day, Fourth of July, all of them ... When that happens, I bring the holiday to them. I wear Christmas sweaters, or I bring in a stuffed bunny from the gift shop, or balloons, or some appropriate decoration for that holiday. As you said in the podcast, we're different. Even after 45 years, my remaining family members don't quite grasp how different we are. That's because I spent so many years trying to be Super Woman, attempting to make everything as normal as I possibly could. And, as situations changed, we changed with them. We adapted. Because every day here is like the other for us, I have to work a little harder to make sure we acknowledge any holiday. I want to continue to be as normal as we possibly can, regardless of our situation. In addition to our challenges as caregivers, my husband and I are grieving parents. The holidays are exceptionally difficult for us, because we miss our son. To help us through the holidays, we incorporate our angel son into everything we do. His room holds our tree and family ornaments and presents.\u00a0 I guess I've always felt our difference, but it is never more profound than during the Thanksgiving-Christmas holidays. It is such an effort to try to be normal, while also cherishing our difference. It's been an unusual life. To say the very least. \n \n My friend's holiday home experience made me think, \"Every year, our celebrations shrink a little. \u00a0Soon, we celebrate in one room with just our small family. \u00a0But that's OK. \u00a0There is love in that room and we know that everyone is comfortable with what we cannot and cannot do. And we are grateful.\" \n \n \n Nick's designed his own 'manly' Christmas tree for his room. \u00a0Note the World Wrestling Entertainment decorations and crushed beer can for a 'star'. \u00a0All the gifts under the tree are from him to us and his helpers.\u00a0 \n \n My book, The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Lifetime of Caregiving (House of Anansi Press) is available now from all major booksellers in the USA and Canada. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-feRFTy2q7oE/VHSLSk9osPI/AAAAAAAAByA/ycfvBx7ArEg/s1600/Nickxmas.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-loDOWLe1o9E/VHSMlqG6fzI/AAAAAAAAByM/Lm7HbpiDsGc/s1600/Newbookcover.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/11/preparing-for-holidays-caregivers.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nThis week, I was honoured to contribute an article to  The Home Care Technology Report , a publication of  Rowan Consulting Associates . \u00a0Tim Rowan is a consultant and information broker on everything to do with home care and technology. \u00a0I'm pleased to tell you that I've had a huge and positive response to this article from caregivers and health providers alike. \u00a0Thanks, Tim! \n \n CLINICIANS IMPROVE OUTCOMES BY CONNECTING TO A CIRCLE OF CARE \n \nToday, my family uses technology to coordinate our son\u2019s complex care in the community, but it wasn\u2019t always so. Nicholas is 26 years old and resides in a small care home in our neighborhood. He is non-speaking and medically complex, requiring one-to-one nursing care 24/7. For the first 22 years of his life, Nick lived at home with us and I struggled to communicate important messages between home and the multitude of home care workers and medical professionals who were part of his care team. \n \nI do not have that struggle anymore. A software program called\u00a0 Tyze Personal Networks \u00a0now effectively connects everyone who cares for and about Nicholas. Tyze is owned and offered by\u00a0 Saint Elizabeth Health Care , a Canadian not-for-profit organization that has been supporting people at home for more than a century. Tyze is a private and secure online network that was developed to combine the efforts of family members, friends and professional supports in a circle of care. It is free to individuals but becomes more valuable when supported by a healthcare organization. \n \nEach personal Tyze network is password-encoded and not publicly searchable. It has enough data storage to allow for a virtual filing cabinet of medical records and even highly sensitive documents such as wills and end of life directives.\u00a0 Healthcare provider organizations in Canada, the US, and beyond use Tyze to reach out to their clients, inviting them to start their own care networks. Most importantly, Tyze gives organizations the ability to share information with all network owners \u2013 for example, education materials, newsletters, videos, updates, and events. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LIFE BEFORE TYZE \nBefore we were introduced to Tyze, Nicholas had a bedside, hospital-style chart where caregivers recorded both health and personal information. There was also a separate drug chart where staff signed for medications given. If Nicholas\u2019 morphine dose changed, I couldn\u2019t be sure that staff would see the notation in the bedside charts, so we installed a white board above Nick\u2019s bed. There, we wrote important messages in large red lettering, hoping that new directives begun by one caregiver would be followed by the next one, especially if I was not home to point them out at shift change. Too often, a part-time health aide would give the old dose of anti-seizure medicine or morphine, assuming that nothing had changed since the previous week. They simply didn\u2019t see the notes we had left.  \n \n LIFE AFTER TYZE \nToday, we still use the bedside charting, but we do not rely on it to communicate messages of change in care protocols or important appointments coming up in the diary. Tyze Personal Networks shifts the responsibility for care from an individual model to a network model. A traditional, individual model of care looks like this: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn individual model of care assumes autonomy on the part of an able-bodied patient \u2013 someone who is verbal and capable of following through on measures for treatment compliance at home. This was not the case for Nicholas.\u00a0 No single individual could keep Nick alive and healthy \u2013 he needed a team. Tyze gave us the communication tool we needed to effectively function as a network of care, which looks more like this: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe home page of Nicholas\u2019 Tyze site includes all his front-line workers, members of our immediate family, executive staff members at the care home where Nick resides, and his family physician. Staffing agency case coordinators are part of the Tyze network too, and when there are last minute HR issues to be solved, everyone can offer to help and stay in the loop. \n \nTyze has many features that enhance both social opportunities and continuity of care. For example, specialist medical appointments as well as recreational outings are entered into the calendar feature and network members receive timely reminders on their smartphones. Network members report feeling group solidarity because everyone has shared and equal access to information about Nick. Tyze has made it easy to share resources, to ask for help and problem-solve within the group. \n \n OVERCOMING BARRIERS & ACHIEVING SUCCESS \n\"How did you persuade medical professionals to be part of a Tyze network?\" is a question that many curious friends ask. The answer is not straightforward. In the case of Nick\u2019s GP, he understood immediately that an online tool would help him to manage complex care involving multiple players but he was concerned that he would be bombarded with messages. He was relieved when we assured him that only the head nurse would send him private messages via the Tyze site.\u00a0 Plus, recent changes in allowable physician billing codes mean that our doctor can now be paid for the time he engages with Nick\u2019s Tyze network. \n \nThe trickier barrier to getting Tyze up and running was compliance on the part of frontline care staff, especially after Nick moved out of our home and into a care facility. Every agency or institution has its own in-house communications linkages such as an intranet. At first, it was necessary to remind staff that their intranet excluded Nick\u2019s family members but, eventually, everyone realized that the corporate knowledge of complex care was better managed as an integrated team with equal access to information shared by family and paid staff. Everyone began to appreciate the benefits of a single communication tool. \n \nLike any tool, Tyze is only helpful if users populate it with pertinent information. When frontline staff members forgot to input appointments, I reviewed all my communications strategies and looked for ways to improve compliance. I realized that posting \u2018need to know\u2019 information on Tyze, such as staff shift rotas and holiday schedules would draw people to Tyze. Eventually, Tyze became the go-to site for all Nick-specific information. Now, if Nicholas has an emergency hospital admission, his network members know they have access on their phones to his medications list as well as his care plan. \n \nNicholas does not use Tyze himself, but it is only because he would rather use his laptop and iPad as sources of sports news and social media. Still, Nick reaps the benefits of being cared for by a well-coordinated team of people who love him and share his care. And for that, we are all grateful to Tyze. \n \n Donna Thomson began her career as an actor, director and teacher. \u00a0In 1988, when her son Nicholas was born with severe disabilities, Donna embarked on her second career as a disability activist, author, consultant and writer. She is the Special Advisor for Caregiving at Tyze Personal Networks and is the International Advisor to the PLAN Institute for Caring Citizenship. \u00a0She is the co-founder of Lifetime Networks Ottawa, a PLAN affiliate and is a member of the Cambridge University Capability Approach Network. \u00a0Donna is also an instructor at the Advocacy School (Ottawa, Canada), teaching families how to employ best practice political advocacy tools when advocating for care. Donna holds degrees in Fine Art (Theatre), Education and Theatre in Education. \u00a0Donna\u2019s interest in new modes of social engagement for marginalised families led her to sit on numerous boards such as the London International Festival of Theatre, Women for Women International Leadership Circle and Dovercourt Community Association.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nBy Jacob Edward \n \n \n \nAs Americans, we tend to forget that care giving has existed\nfor almost as long as humans have been around. Recently, with the recession in\n2008, more people are living in multigenerational homes. In many other\ncountries, multigenerational living is the norm, but for us we\u2019re still working\nout the kinks. Maybe you became a caregiver gradually, or maybe you were forced\ninto the position by a sudden medical emergency with an older parent or in-law,\nwhatever the case, here are some quick tips to ease you into care giving\nduties.  \n \n \n \n Create a Schedule:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSome people find it easier to cope with their new care\ngiving job by writing down a schedule directing them in their daily duties. A\nschedule could include which pills to take, which activities to do, or dietary\nplanning. Research has shown that mind stimulating activities can help people\nstay healthy longer. The schedule could be hour by hour or portioned off into\nmorning, day, and night. Set goals you want to complete each day and you\u2019ll see\nyou\u2019ll become much less frustrated with your loved one. Older people still need\nto be treated with the same respect they have received throughout their adult\nlives. Frustration often leads to them feeling as if they are being reduced to\nthe state of a child because of their mental or physical decline. If you are\nworking and care giving, make sure to talk to your employer about flexible\nhours and possible leave in case an emergency strikes. Creating a schedule is\nespecially helpful in reminding you to constantly monitor and note your loved\none\u2019s health changes. Early detection, rather than negligence, can often\nprevent much larger problems down the road. Also, a schedule can minimize daily\nchanges which are oftentimes upsetting to elderly people suffering health\nconditions.  \n \n \n \n Don\u2019t be afraid to\nask questions: \n \n \n \nIf you are unsure about something, say the level of care\nyour charge may require, don\u2019t hesitate to contact their doctor. Also, you can\nask the patients themselves whether or not they feel you are doing an adequate\njob. Most times, people are caring for aging relatives so even though you are\nin each other\u2019s lives in a different way now; don\u2019t forget the familiarity\nyou\u2019ve always shared with them. If you have very specific concerns, however,\ndon\u2019t hesitate to call a social worker or a care giving professional.  \n \n \n \n Fall-proof the home:  \n \n \n \nYou may be moving into their house or they may be moving\ninto yours, but whatever the case, it\u2019s important to fall proof the home to\navoid falls. Make sure there are no worn or loose carpets, no exposed cords,\nand no clutter. Maintaining a clean environment is not only important for peace\nof mind, but can also benefit the patient greatly if they are still able to\nwalk on their own. Also, install handle bars in the entrance to the shower,\nnon-slip mats on any floors that tend to get wet or slippery, and adequate\nlighting throughout the house. Dim areas, especially for someone who can\u2019t see\nvery well, can prove to be dangerous. If you regularly leave the house for any\nextended periods of time, you may want to purchase a medical alert so your\nloved one can alert the authorities if they do happen to have an accident.\nFalls, especially when not dealt with quickly, can mean the quick demise of a\nperson.  \n \n \n \n Know when it is time to\nmake the transition into assisted living:  \n \n \n \nWe like to think we can do it all, but sometimes caring for\na loved one just becomes too much.  \n \nIf your loved one has dementia, especially in a more\nadvanced case, and they begin to wander, it\u2019s time to get help. You\u2019d never\nleave a child unattended around a swimming pool, and similarly, people who\nbegin to wander need constant supervision. Even a quick trip to the bathroom or\na shower taken by the caregiver can prove to be dangerous for an elderly person\nwho wanders. The chance of injury increases greatly.

{"date": "", "body": "\nTelling the difference between good friends and toxic friends is especially important for caregivers. \u00a0Caregivers simply don't have the dual luxuries of boundless time and energy to invest in friendships that are not reciprocal. \u00a0So, here's a quick guide to recognising good friends and toxic friends. \n \n TOXIC FRIENDS \n \nFor caregivers, there are two common types of toxic friends; the troll and the narcissist. \u00a0The troll is someone who calls and visits often. \u00a0He or she will ask many questions about your loved one and may even visit in hospital to chat over coffee or lunch. \u00a0They will appear warm and concerned, while inquiring into the minutiae of your loved one's symptoms and treatments. \u00a0This type of toxic friend does not offer help of any kind. \u00a0They simply want to  know . \u00a0The human drama of a caregiver's life provides vicarious interest and fodder for their dinner table chat, but that is all. \u00a0This type of friend cannot make the intellectual leap between listening to your experience and offering to sit with your loved one or doing your grocery shopping. \n \nThe second type of toxic friend is the narcissist.  \n \n \n \n \nNarcissists rarely, if ever, ask how you or your loved is doing. \u00a0They are bored by others' experiences, so constantly direct the conversation back to themselves. \u00a0No matter how difficult a caregiver's situation may be, it will always be worse for a narcissist - and despite their healthy family status, they will want you to listen and sympathise. \n \n GOOD FRIENDS \n \n \n \n \n \nCaregivers soon find out that longstanding friendships don't necessarily translate into good friendships when the going gets tough. \u00a0Some lifelong friends do show their loyalty and generosity, while others suddenly become too busy to call or drop by. \u00a0The messy and often sad events in caregivers' lives may be too difficult for some people to witness and absorb. \u00a0The fact is, not everyone is cut out for helping others through the toughest times. The trick is to determine quickly who will be a good friend for the long haul and who may be limited in their ability to walk with you through your caregiving journey. \u00a0Wise and experienced caregivers will advise forgiveness in the case of friends who disappear upon hearing your loved one's diagnosis. \u00a0Holding on to bitter feelings will only make it more difficult to spot new friends who genuinely want to help. \n \n \nThe  extraordinary  friend is one who intuits your needs, listens without judgement, visits often and always brings food. \u00a0The  new  friend is an acquaintance who, upon hearing that you are giving care, offers help that is truly helpful. \u00a0The kindness of new friends is always a surprise - often the most helpful friends are those you would least expect. \u00a0Whether a good friend is old or new, it is clear that your friends are those who truly want to help. \u00a0Friends will want to give what they can. \u00a0Some may not cook, but their keen wit can suddenly flip fear into hilarity - that is a gift to a caregiver. \n \n KEEPING FRIENDS \n \nCaregivers have the obligation of reciprocating friendship, too. \u00a0Most often, this means saying thank you. \u00a0The sincere expression of gratitude is not a sign of weakness or evidence that the caregiver is miserably incapable of handling a loved one's needs independently. \u00a0The gracious acceptance of help and friendship in the full knowledge that love flows both ways, is the key here. \u00a0Good friends say, \u00a0\"You look tired. Here, let me help you.\" \u00a0That's just what good friends do. \n \n My book, 'The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving' (House of Anansi Press) is now available from all major booksellers in the USA and Canada \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A_qTLf_dF98/VG49k69zWsI/AAAAAAAABxA/YTqFs6bzqoE/s1600/Patsy.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EWD4lhqQ04w/VG5UG3mMYpI/AAAAAAAABxQ/Z5Z4eDEtDKM/s1600/best-friend-quotes-157.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3uybjWktHys/VG5pZhwZgFI/AAAAAAAABxg/Ca1vEYgtdq4/s1600/anansibookcover.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/11/good-friends-vs-toxic-friends.html", "title": ""},

He is g-tube fed and communicates via facial expressions as well as laughing, or crying. \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0What do you love about caregiving? \u00a0 \n \n We don't really think about this question. \u00a0To us, it's just \"uber-parenting\" (parenting turned up a few notches). \u00a0But w e feel rewarded and honoured knowing that we are here to help him live his life in the best possible way. \n \n \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0What do you find most difficult about caregiving? \n \n It is never ending and there are no breaks. \u00a0 Even though we have help with nursing at school and at night (we've had the night nursing since Ethan was 9, which has been a Godsend), and other short term care workers , we are always \"ON\". \u00a0 Even when we are not with him, we are always in a hyper-vigilant mode. \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0Do you have any life lessons or truths about family/community you would like to share? \n \n We have proven that we can do this. \u00a0Joe calls it \"battle-tested parenting\". \u00a0However, we have had support from others, and we are very thankful for that . \u00a0Many helpers (care workers, nurses) who have come to support Ethan began working with our family\u00a0 during Ethan's most difficult days. \u00a0Many continue to support us. \u00a0 We felt and continue to feel very blessed. \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0Tell us a story. \u00a0What was a lovely and intimate moment that you shared with Ethan recently.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n After planning a summer trip to Portugal for the 3 of us this past year, which included many things (such as arranging private duty nursing, a hospital bed, etc.), Ethan got double pneumonia. \u00a0It was July, 2014. \u00a0He was very ill and ended up being on oxygen at home for 9 days. \u00a0We didn't think that we would be able to go on our trip, but on the\u00a0 24th of July ,\u00a0 we literally put Ethan on the plane - with oxygen. \u00a0It was a horrible plane ride, but we got there, and he healed beautifully in the ocean air. The most amazing moment was when a local cafe in Torreira, Portugal (Cafe da Praia) let us try out their beach wheelchair! \u00a0With the help of 2 lifeguards, Ethan was able to get down to the ocean's edge and put his feet in the water (something that he has not done since he was very small). \u00a0That's when we all took a moment, and reflected on how awesome it was that we had made the trip. \u00a0 And we felt especially thankful for the help of strangers - the lifeguards - who didn't even know us.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0How do you think\u00a0caregivers can be better supported by their communities and their governments? \n \nAs for communities; it's so great to see Inclusion becoming more common in society today. \u00a0We feel very thankful that our son was born in this day and age, not in the mid 1900s! \n \nRegarding governments; it took a long time for us to get the okay for overnight nursing, an essential service in our family. \u00a0It was only after Ethan was found unconscious at 2 different times within 5 months when he was 9 years old, that we were finally granted night nursing. \u00a0Although we are very glad for it, we just wish we had had it a lot sooner. \n \n \n \n Q: \u00a0Take this opportunity to share anything else you would like to say about your caregiving experience! \n \n We are so thankful when, at the end of each day,\u00a0 all is \" stable\" with Ethan and with both of us. \n \n \n \n My book, 'The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving' (House of Anansi Press) is available now in the US and Canada from all major booksellers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qptG2yHAs4k/VGUmQQUreVI/AAAAAAAABvc/1uf6DeP-1E0/s1600/Fonseca%2B1.jpg", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xKL5McjK_0A/VGUmm93BtqI/AAAAAAAABvk/J_Yya1ztMb0/s1600/Fonseca%2B2.jpg", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qd9BQ8gPNKs/VGUm620PxJI/AAAAAAAABvw/JWLwCia-kqA/s1600/Fonseca%2B3.jpg", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xt5l4-A-rkw/VGUom2asL-I/AAAAAAAABv8/Onfwfhb2n4s/s1600/anansibookcover.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/11/a-caregiving-story-fonseca-family.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nNovember is National Caregiving Month, so I could think of no better reason than to tell you about two new trends in caregiving. \u00a0And they're both good news for families. \n \nThe first is called  The Greenhouse Project . \u00a0It's an international movement in humanising eldercare, but it was a small project in Wyoming that caught my eye. \u00a0Green House Living for Sheridan (Wyoming) is about as far from a traditional nursing home as you could imagine, and the residents of Sheridan like it that way.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n From the  Green House Living for Sheridan website : \u00a0\u00a0 We envision homes in every community\u00a0where elders and others enjoy excellent quality of life and quality of care; where they, their families, and the staff engage in meaningful relationships built on equality, empowerment, and mutual respect; where people want to live and work; and where all are protected, sustained, and nurtured without regard to the ability to pay. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So what makes Green House Living for Sheridan (and other Greenhouse Projects) different? \u00a0A list of core guiding principles will give you an idea of how radical this project is: \n \n \n Elders rule \n \n \n \n This is the person\u2019s home. \n \n \n \n The individual is not the sum total of his/her age and\nailments. \n \n \n \n No decision is taken without first asking \"Would a person have this in their own home? Would they do\nthis?\" \n \n (Typical day: based on elders \u2013 eg. When people wake up, they\ncan wake up whenever they want. They can have breakfast at 10am and choose\nwhatever they want. They sit at a long table like \u00a0  a family.) \n \n \n \n \n \n Eldercare Solutions That Respect Family Relationships \n \n \n \nEveryone dreads aging and becoming dependent. \u00a0Why? \u00a0We envision being isolated from our family, being forced into nursing homes where cries for help go unanswered. \u00a0Loving family caregivers worry about what will happen when dependency needs become to great to manage at home. \u00a0The founders of the Greenhouse Project designed living for elders with these concerns in mind - have a look at this video (sorry, it's Vimeo and I couldn't figure out how to embed it, so you'll have to click the link):\u00a0http://vimeo.com/102882205 \n \n \n \nActivities must be meaningful, not just made to pass time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe name Shahbazim is given to house managers (Greenhouse trained Certified Nursing Assistants) and they decide how the house will run. \u00a0 Registered\u00a0 Nurses partner with house managers as experts, so medical model power relationships are flipped in the day to day running of the Greenhouse. \u00a012 elders live in each home. \n \n \n \nMiddle management is diluted and the Shahbazim are trained to be\nfull care professionals, so they manage the home as well as individual care of elders. \u00a0In the Greenhouse model, there is no dietary department or housekeeping staff. \u00a0The Shabazim multi-task as family members would at home - they are the midwives of eldercare. \u00a0Because families and community medical experts respect this model and this role, the Shahbazim have a respected and meaningful career path. \n \n \n \nBut how is it paid for? \n \n Financing for Green House homes \u00a0comes in a\nvariety of forms.\u00a0 In addition to commercial loans, Green House homes have\nbeing developed using bonds and government backed loans, as well as\nnon-traditional loans. Through our partnerships with RWJF, AARP Foundation and\nThe Weinberg Foundation, we are able to provide special financing for\norganizations serving low income elders.\u00a0 To learn more about financing\nopportunities,\u00a0 visit The Green House website \n \n \n The second model of care I want to tell you about today is from the UK. \u00a0 U-SHED  is a cooperative, a bit like AARP - each member pays the small amount of 4 Great Britain pounds to join and that money forms a fund to help seniors top up old age pensions and pay for basics that they need. \u00a0It's a model based on seniors helping seniors. \u00a0 \n \n From the website: \n \nUSHED was formed by senior citizens for senior citizens to enable us to help ourselves and make life easier without relying on the government who seem unwilling to recognise us. \n \nBy registering you become a member and we would hope to build an organisation where we can rise up and be able to offer senior citizens savings on everyday essentials and commodities. The funds will sit in a central \"pot\" and will be used to buy from source and subsidise services for members. \n \nRegistration forms will be available at GP offices, Post Offices, in newspapers and online. \n \nInterested? Then please take the time to complete the\u00a0 registration . \n \nShown below is a break-down of the services of U-SHED:- \n \n For a small monthly membership fee we will enable members to save between 10 and 50% on everyday essentials such as food, insurances, community tax, gas, electric, water e.t.c. \n Mobile dentists, opticians and audiologists could make these routine examinations much more accessible to elderly, immobile and infirm. \n Funds could be used to buy larger items from source and offer them to members with substantial discounts rather than going to the high street companies who do not offer special rates for pensioners. \n A lot of the older generation do not like using computers or shopping online. It is rare these days to find somewhere which offers the facility to call and be able to buy in confidence. \n It is hoped that we will grow and eventually have enough funding to enable us to sponsor hospital wards and care homes. \n \n \n The cost of the above benefits is \u00a34 per month. \n \n \n The more members we have the more savings we will be able to offer. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Stan Stearman is the founder/creator of  U-SHED  and he told me that UK municipal governments have begun to take a real interest in the project and are supporting it. \u00a0The fund is already helping seniors become more connected to their communities while staying in their homes longer. \u00a0 \n \n \nAs family caregivers, we want our loved ones to have a good life. \u00a0We want to support them, but we cannot do it alone, especially when their needs increase over time. \u00a0Knowing that some communities are creatively rising to the challenge of helping families keep their senior loved ones safe, secure and happy is 'chicken soup for our caregiver souls'.  \n \n My book, The Caregivers' Living Room: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving is available in Canada and the USA from all major booksellers. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thegreenhouseproject.org/", "http://www.sheridangreenhouse.org/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5FjysTw0gK8/VF9pLrenekI/AAAAAAAABuM/5k83q20DjoM/s1600/Green-House-Home-1202.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mNPBSprcwZU/VF9rfdCw73I/AAAAAAAABug/ApdYVIhe3Qo/s1600/Green%2BHill%2BSubmittal.JPG", "http://thegreenhouseproject.org/", "http://ushed-coop.com/index.html", "http://ushed-coop.com/contact-us.php", "http://ushed-coop.com/index.html", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-D5zLsbEGMKg/VGNw9FVJtOI/AAAAAAAABvM/hlc5rJRj6Ko/s1600/Newbookcover.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/11/helping-family-caregivers-face-future.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nThis is the second in our National Caregiving Month series of blog posts from YOU, our readers and fellow caregivers! \u00a0Judy Fox and Andrea Hurley are the co-authors of one of my favourite eldercare blogs, \" When The Table Turns \". \u00a0Thank you for telling your story here at the Caregivers' Living Room, Judy!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt happened suddenly\u2026from one moment to the next, my then 93\nyear old mother went from living independently \u2013 driving, cooking, shopping and\nplaying bridge \u2013 to being hospitalized with a restricted aortic valve. She came\nout of the hospital forever changed. From that time onward, my mother began to\nlive with a professional Aide, Pat. \u00a0Mom stopped all the activities she was doing before\nand just let go. Surprisingly she didn\u2019t seem to miss her previous life. It was as though she was waiting to be able to just stop. When that happened 5 \u00bd years\nago, I began to live with her for longer and longer stints of time until about\ntwo years ago, after she had a massive stroke and could no longer walk. \u00a0I moved\ndown to Florida permanently. She is now 98 years old.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt\u2019s been quite a journey. There are many details which I\nhave left out, but I am sure there is much that overlaps to some degree with\nall caregivers \u2013 the times when there are many medical decisions to make, so\nmuch  uncertainty ; \u00a0  the times of intense\nanxiety and worry and the times when the clouds part and light streams through, and everything in-between. \u00a0I am also aware that everyone\u2019s situation is unique\nbut it seems that for many of us caregivers, we are unprepared for what initially\nunfolds. How could we prepare for so many possible scenarios?  \u00a0 My experience is, and I\u2019m sure that I am not\nalone, that I had to plunge in and learn fast. \u00a0It was not easy. \u00a0Luckily, I\nhad friends and relatives to support me. \n \n \n \nIn many ways, being in a caregiving position, as I live with\nmy mom 24 hours a day, has forced me to  slow down - literally and metaphorically.\nI have had to slow down to tune into my mother\u2019s needs, moods and on-going\nchanges. From being in this position I appreciate so much more the role that a\nmother plays. I realize that caring for another human being does something to\nour psyche. It really does change one and hopefully for the better. Over this\ntime, I have developed patience, a quality that never was so strong in me, and\nan ability to step back, observe and reflect. There are always subtle and then\nnot so subtle changes happening all the time that need to be responded to when\nyou hold another being\u2019s life in your \u201chands.\u201d \u00a0\n My mother is so fragile now in a way that \u201cforces\u201d me to be more\nsensitive. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA story to tell you about that just happened today. My\nmother has been eating less and less as so often occurs with the very aged. She\ndoesn\u2019t see, taste, or smell very well and basically lying in bed all day, she\nhas very little appetite. This is a radical change from the Jewish mom who\nloved to feed her children and loved to eat as well. The challenge, as you can\nimagine, is to find food she will eat and at the same time not force her in any\nway. It\u2019s a balancing act. So today I was thinking about what to give her for\ndinner \u2013 something she hasn\u2019t eaten for a long time which might entice her. I\noffered to make blueberry pancakes and she said \u201cYes,\u201d to my surprise. \n \n \n \nNow, I am a bad pancake-maker \u2013 always have been \u2013 never\nlearned the trick to making them and hardly ever eat them myself, but I found a\nrecipe and we had frozen blueberries so I proceeded to make them. The first one\nwas a total disaster, but the next few came out reasonably okay if you didn\u2019t\nmind how they looked. The good news of this story is that my mother ate the\nwhole pancake and liked it. \u00a0Given that at this point she hardly ever likes\nanything, I was SO happy. The happiness of a nourishing \u201cmom,\u201d whose child has\nnot been eating and finally does. That is how it felt. And that is when I\nthought about how the  psyche really does change  when one cares for another.  \n \n \n \nThis has been so much the journey that I am on. As my mother\nhas changed, softened and in many ways sweetened, so have I and so has our\nrelationship. \u00a0  It\u2019s of course challenging,\nintense and difficult at times but the rewards far outweigh the difficulties. A\nlove has blossomed between us that I would never have thought possible and I\nlive in gratitude for my life that has been forever changed and enriched. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Judy Fox  is an artist. She was born in 1947 in New York City. For twenty-five years she worked for a nonprofit educational organization helping with graphic design and overseeing the print production of books and magazines. Previous to that, she taught English as a second language and got seriously involved with Buddhist meditation practice. For many years she worked at retreat centers in the US and UK. This spiritual interest, sparked initially by Buddhist practice, has continued throughout her life manifesting in many different forms. \n \n Over twenty five years ago, she became the primary caregiver for her older brother who was dying of Aids and spent literally eight months by his side. From that experience, she understood the choiceless nature of caring for someone who you love deeply and because of her spiritual background she was able to gain a priceless perspective that helped so much during this very challenging time. \n \n For the past five years, Judy has been helping to care for her 98 year old mom. Two years ago, she started a blog site with her good friend Andrea Hurley called\u201d When the Table Turns\u201d ( www.whenthetableturns.com ) where they write heartfelt philosophical essays on the care and love for their elderly moms. Recently they have expanded their contact with other caregivers and started a virtual caregiver\u2019s circle ( www.whenthetableturns.com/ caregivers-circle-virtual ).

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n By Felicity Dryer \n \n \n \n Being a caregiver is usually not easy. You have\nto be emotionally, mentally and physically strong so that you can support those\nwho require your care. \n \n \n \n Your food choices can both help you excel in your\nline of work, as well as be beneficial to keep in mind for those under your\ncare. \n \n \n \n Here are some nutritious superfoods to add to\nyour regular diet. \n \n \n \n Blueberries \n \n \n \n When you\u2019ve been working long hours and you\u2019re\nexhausted, blueberries can help you to perk up because they\u2019re high in   antioxidants . They\u2019re\nhealthier than reaching for sugar-loaded foods that will just zap your energy. \n \n \n \n Beans \n \n \n \n Keeping your energy levels up  is important. Beans have a low glycaemic index, so they\u2019re a slow\nrelease  of energy to sustain\nyou through the day. \n \n \nSalmon \n \n \n \n This fish should be eaten   at least twice a week  because\nit\u2019s packed with protein and omega-3 fatty acids that lower inflammation and\neradicate body aches and pains. \n \n \n \n Coconut\nOil \n \n \n \n You can  tackle\nfatigue  by consuming coconut oil. Because it  gets rid of harmful organisms  in the\nbody, it can decrease stress, helping your immune system to work more\nefficiently. \n \n \nSteel-cut Oats \n \n \n \n If you\u2019re stressed or tired, reach for steel-cut\noats. They contain many nutrients, such as Vitamin E, B-vitamins, and protein.\nOats are also   feel-good food , thanks to how\nthey make the brain produce serotonin that helps to improve your mood. \n \n \nGreek Yogurt \n \n \n \n Sometimes you need a healthy snack on the go to\nkeep hunger at bay, and that\u2019s why  Greek yogurt  is so good. It\u2019s\ngot lots of calcium and protein to keep you feeling fuller for longer. \n \n \n \n Sweet\nPotato \n \n \n \n Eating sweet potatoes can   contribute to your Vitamin C intake . This nutrient is important because it\u2019s an  essential building block of collagen , which benefits your skin,\nblood vessels, bones and tissues. \n \n \n \n Kale \n \n \n \n Insufficient levels of folic acid can be   linked to depression , so make\nsure you get enough of this vitamin. It can be found in leafy green vegetables\nlike kale. \n \n \nCocoa \n \n \n \n Dark chocolate could be a good snack every now\nand then - just make sure it\u2019s at least 60 per cent cocoa as it has   eight times more antioxidants  than strawberries! It also lowers your bad cholesterol. \n \n \nEggs \n \n \n \n Working long hours can be exhausting so start the\nday with eggs. They contain a molecule known as   phenylalanine , which the body\nuses to produce dopamine. This chemical makes you feel more alert! \n \n \n \n Olive Oil \n \n \n \n If you want to   fight inflammation  that can\ncause joint pain, olive oil can help. It contains oleocanthal, a compound\nthat\u2019s a  natural painkiller . \n \n \n \n Avocado \n \n \n \n Avocado is rich in fibre, which helps to keep\ndiabetes at bay because it lowers your blood sugar. It\u2019s also got   good fats  the body needs\nto lower your cholesterol and decrease your heart disease risk. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Chia\nSeeds \n \n \n \n These seeds   absorb a lot of water  so they\nkeep your body hydrated for longer, while preserving   electrolytes  in the body. \n \n \n \n Pomegranate \n \n \n \n You don\u2019t want the onset of colds and flu to keep\nyou down, so eat pomegranates. They contain a substance known as   punicalagin  that helps to\nfight the flu. \n \n Tea \n \n \n \n Too much caffeine is not good for you, so enjoy   green tea  instead. It\nhelps you concentrate by working as a mild stimulant and boosts your\nantioxidant levels. \n \n \n \n Pumpkin \n \n \n \n Pumpkin seeds are great for topping up on your   magnesium levels  - this\nmineral is a must if you want to  improve\nyour mood and beat depression . \n \n \n \n Flaxseed \n \n \n \n This seed has shown promise for treating\narthritis. It contains omega-3s that produce   prostaglandins , substances that\ncan decrease inflammation in the body. \n \n \n \n Acai\nJuice \n \n \n \n Acai berries contain   bioflavonoids , plant pigments\nthat relieve varicose veins while keeping blood vessels healthy. This is\nimportant if you\u2019re on your feet all day. \n \n \n \n Walnuts \n \n \n \n Research  has found that\nwalnuts can  reverse signs of brain aging .\nJust a handful a day can give you the brain boost you need to help you function\nat your peak. \n \n \n \n Spinach \n \n \n \n By   keeping your red blood cells healthy , spinach\u2019s high iron content improves oxygen transportation through\nthe body which boosts your energy and overall health. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Eat more of the above superfoods to keep you\nstrong and healthy so that you can  care for those  who aren\u2019t. \n \n \n \n And here's a SuperFood Guide for Super Seniors! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Originally born in Flagstaff, Arizona, Felicity Dryer was raised by her parents (more or less modern-day hippies) to always make her health a top priority.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n I live in a quiet suburb of Ottawa, Canada. \u00a0The  tragic and shocking events in our nation's capital  this week shook all Canadians to the core and there's almost no one in my city whose life wasn't touched by the cruel aftermath of the now infamous murderous rampage. \u00a0Of course, we all searched news reports for any bits of information that would give us clues about how to make sense of this tragedy. \u00a0One thing quickly became clear:  no one knew  the killer. \u00a0He was a homeless loner who was addicted to drugs, racked with guilt and in search of redemption in the strictest elements of the Islamic faith. \u00a0Even his estranged mother had no kind words to say about her son. \n \n\n In contrast to the killer, the victim,  Nathan Cirillo , was known and loved by his family as well as many friends and work colleagues. \u00a0His tragic loss is felt most keenly by those who were closest to him.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n Michael Zehaf-Bibeau may not have deserved the love of friends or family, but Nathan Cirillo did not deserve to die. What could we as a society have done to prevent this crime and what can we do to prevent similar future crimes? As politicians wrangle over security measures, perhaps there are more personal pre-emptive actions we could take.\u00a0 \n \n The  PLAN movement  was founded to create and sustain a good life for adults with disabilities after their parents die - the model is built around the ethic that  caring relationships are the key to safety, security and a good life . \u00a0Apparently, the killer had no caring relationships in his life and he certainly wasn't safe or secure. \u00a0 \n \n Perhaps our medical and even our judicial systems should have the ability to make a formal diagnosis of social isolation. \u00a0Treatments and assistive programmes to treat this diagnosis could be made mandatory for those whose social isolation is deemed to be a potential threat to society. The  Circles of Support and Accountability  model has been used to re-integrate sex offenders into society and their track record for preventing recidivism is impressive. Maybe there is a role for a circle of support and accountability in preventing crimes perpetrated by loners like Zehof-Bibeau. COSA describes their work as follows: \n \nThe Core Member (ex-offender) and three to five trained and screened community volunteers comprise the Circle.\u00a0 They meet as a group and individually\u00a0on a regular basis to: \n \n Support the Core Member\u2019s community integration by facilitating his practical needs (i.e. access to medical services, social assistance, seeking employment/affordable housing, etc.) and by providing a consistent network of emotional support; \n Develop constructive and pro-social strategies and solutions to everyday problems and concerns; \n Challenge the Core Member\u2019s behaviours and attitudes that may be associated with his offending cycle. \n Celebrate successes. \n \n \n We know that  social isolation has disastrous health consequences  for otherwise able-bodied people. \u00a0This week, we learned it can have tragic consequences for many when left untreated. \u00a0Everyone has a civic responsibility to identify and act on knowledge of extreme social isolation in people with mental illness and possibly addictions. \u00a0The prevention of future tragedies like this one is everyone's business. \n \n \n \n Our family uses Tyze Personal Networks to Coordinate Medical Supports and Personal Supports of Friends and Family \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/ottawa-shooting-mps-tell-of-chaos-on-parliament-hill-as-gunfire-rang-out-1.2067835", "http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/23/details-of-michael-zehaf-bibeaus-life-paint-a-picture-of-a-man-troubled-by-drugs-and-crime/", "http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/10/23/cpl_nathan_cirillo_loved_life_especially_being_a_dad_former_girlfriend.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ib4wxFveDVE/VEwZNMu2wSI/AAAAAAAABsA/4xsPfuUHQwM/s1600/o-NATHAN-CIRILLO-facebook.jpg", "http://www.plan.ca/", "http://cosa-ottawa.ca/", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200308/the-dangers-loneliness", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tz4vqiZL3L4/VEws9ACrTCI/AAAAAAAABsQ/8yY2wiTiBkw/s1600/tyze-logo.png"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/10/searching-for-reasons-aftermath-of.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n November is National Family Caregiver Month. \u00a0Here in the Caregivers' Living Room, we are celebrating by publishing your stories. \u00a0If you have a story to share, please send it to me at donna4walls@gmail.com. \u00a0Let's celebrate our lived experience by storytelling! \n \n \n \nMy name is Susan Buro Hamm. \u00a0 Included in my family is my hunky husband Abe, my lovely daughter Lexi(21), our twins who are 7, and a kinship foster baby who is 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI am a caretaker for them all. I call myself a domestic Goddess, I enjoy canning, baking, cooking and loathe laundry. In reality, I can't work outside my home, and sometimes, that choice breaks my heart. \n \n \n \nYou see, I am the caretaker for not just my family's needs but for Lexi's complex medical care. Lexi has epilepsy, metabolic disease, \u00a0and cerebral palsy. As if that combination isn't difficult enough, we add in some very challenging mental health issues. The reality is that I am her unpaid case manager, navigating through the world of adult developmental disabilities services. I spend numerous hours on the phone, writing emails, faxes, and talking with agencies, service providers, doctors, balancing budgets, seeking funding, and arranging schedules of workers. \n \n \n \nHere are our beautiful girls - Lexi is the oldest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI think that is the hardest thing about taking care of Lexi's needs and in taking care of my family's needs, is that I get lost in the shuffle. Everything else seems to take more importance and I often find it hard to balance. I don't mind being a mother; I love it in fact! \u00a0But what happens in my life goes way beyond normal parenting. It's above and beyond. I do it selflessly, whatever comes my way..I simply make more room on the plate. I rarely complain about my lot in life. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSome place amidst it all, I exist. I would love to have a career. I never in my life dreamed I would be a stay-at-home mom, but most employers are not understanding of family crises that could strike at any moment. So, I am trying to bloom where I am planted, so to speak. I try to be the best possible caretaker I can. That includes never ever giving up on Lexi or what she needs to be successful and balancing the rest of my family's needs. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n I have learned  Advocacy  in the last 20 years. I can honestly say I am a phenomenal advocate, I don't take no for an answer. I have learned minute details of government function. I have learned how to sail thru agencies and service providers.I have worked on learning those lessons 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the last 21 years. \n \n \n \nI do it with a great deal of learned patience, a lot of love and laughter, and plain old stubbornness. My rate of pay never changes, the holidays are few and far between, but the benefits and perks are pretty incredible! \n \n \n \n I think the one thing I want the world to know about is  grief . We all plan and dream when our children are newborns. We want them to achieve, be successful, be independent, be strong. \u00a0We all have those dreams. When those dreams are robbed from you bit by bit, it is devastating. The grief never leaves, it is quieted for long periods of times but it never leaves you. Every stage of life seems to bring the grief forward, only to be quieted again when my feelings get sorted. \n \n \n \nI remember when Lexi was young, and very ill, we were driving to a doctor's appointment. \u00a0My mom was with us chatting with Lexi about the future. Lexi was stating she wanted to be a doctor or something along those lines. I remember looking at the trees blurring by, overwhelmed by an incredible sadness, knowing there was no possible way she would ever be able to do that!! I almost said something like \"Lexi..that's not possible\". But I caught myself. \u00a0A new resolve appeared and I swore that she would never be robbed of her dreams as I had been. It is not my job to burst her bubbles, it is my job to help her build them!!! If she couldn't be academic, she could be creative. If she couldn't ride a bike, she could ride a horse. If she didn't have a voice, I could give her one!! \n \n \n \nThat is how I became a phenomenal advocate, I empowered Lexi and myself by being her voice. I have learned to give Lexi a very loud voice. I have held news conferences to shame the government for their neglectful care of young adults with developmental disabilities. I have helped other families and those in need by founding a support group for parents of special needs children. While I am supremely frustrated with government services, I am not sitting around waiting for them to offer up solutions.

{"date": "", "body": "\nThis is my  guest post on the wonderful blog \"LOVE THAT MAX\"  the inspiring and informative blog by Ellen Seidman. \u00a0I am so grateful to Ellen for hosting my family story of caregiving.  \n \n \nWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2014 \n \n \n \n \n5 secrets of special needs parent happiness \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This guest post is from\u00a0 Donna Thomson , author of the new book\u00a0 The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I\u2019ve Learned From a Life of Caregiving . Donna is mom to Nicholas, who has cerebral palsy; they live in Ottawa, Canada. Donna began her career as an actor, director and teacher. In 1988, when Nicholas was born, Donna began a second career as a disability activist, author and consultant. Nick is 25 now and, Donna says, \"He finds meaning and purpose by writing his hockey blog. He is active on Twitter and Facebook. His favorite activity is managing an online fantasy hockey pool.\" \n \n Nick is looking to get a job, she continues, and recently created and delivered a resume to his local community ice-hockey arena; he's hoping to be hired for a part-time volunteer job. \"This particular dream is still a work in progress, but he's determined to succeed,\" says Donna. She is married to James Wright, a retired career diplomat, and is also mom to Natalie. \n \n I was alone with the doctor in the hospital playroom when she gave me the news about our six month-old baby son. \"Never be normal\" are the words I recall. I also remember \u201cgeneralized cerebral atrophy.\" Pea brain, I wondered? \u00a0\"Esophageal reflux,\" she continued, listing his challenges as her eyes welled up. \"Nothing to keep food down where it belongs. Common in cerebral palsy. Pain similar to heart attack.\" I stared unblinkingly at the blue stripes on her blouse. I looked down and something red caught my eye. Blood was oozing from the edge of my thumbnail where I had bitten it. \u00a0 \"Now I will be able to feed my child,\" I thought. Nick had never managed to suck or swallow efficiently, and his efforts to feed were punctuated with gasps and coughs. He spat up most of what he did manage to ingest. Suddenly, I was convinced that if I could learn to correct my feeding technique, all would be well. \u00a0\"I will become an expert,\" I thought. \"I will apply myself to becoming a great mother, and my baby will grow into someone perfectly perfect.\" Passing the ward desk, I noticed the nurses half turned, whispering, their pitying eyes fixed on us. I scooped up Nicholas, deposited him into a stroller and paraded up and down the hospital halls, back straight, eyes fixed ahead.But I was not all right. I wrote in our baby book: \"February 22-25, 1989: Nick admitted to hospital. Cat scan, PH probe and digestive barium x-rays. All abnormal\u2026trying to absorb this terrible news.\" Over the twenty-six years of our son Nicholas\u2019s life, I have learned lessons about what it takes to thrive against all odds. These are five building blocks of happiness I\u2019ve learned along our rocky path: \nAccept the unacceptable.\u00a0 \nFrom the moment of Nicholas's diagnosis to the instant we realized that it was time for a wheelchair, we have been forced to accept the unacceptable. When it became apparent that Nicholas would never express himself verbally, a conversation with another Mom helped me reframe my thinking. \"We don\u2019t do our own dry cleaning or make our own soap,\" she said, \"so what's the matter with a computer helping Nick to speak?\" After that, assistive devices became our friends, not our enemies. Nick has taught me to trade my definition of success for his. \nEmbrace interdependence.\u00a0 \nStriving to be independent and self-reliant is a strong message in our society. And it's a toxic one: An inability to achieve independence is seen as a moral failure of personhood and if we believe that, we don't see our own frailty or that of everyone we love, especially our children. We are meant to be inter-dependent. Nick's network of support includes our family, his paid helpers, his friends and his doctors. \u00a0Together, we all help Nick to live a good life on his terms. We rely on each other as any winning team does. \nDesign your life intentionally.\u00a0 \nA wise friend told me recently that our most vital challenge in contemporary family life is to be intentional. Intentional about asking our children what a good day looks like for them, intentional about asking for what we need, even intentional about being happy instead of miserable. At Nick's neighborhood school, the other children were friendly, but brief in their conversations. One day, when I was volunteering in the classroom, I noticed an impulsive boy with a fiery temper was transformed into a caring, model student when paired with Nick. This young lad became a daily after-school visitor and frequent dinner guest. I learned how to engineer social opportunities for Nicholas by watching for signs that others needed something Nick and our family had to offer. \nKnow that a good life is possible.\u00a0 \nEveryone has different idea of what they need to be happy. In our family, we began by asking ourselves, \"Given our realities, what is a life that we value and how can we create it?\" For me, this meant learning to be mindful and grateful at home, but to begin planning for a retirement from giving full-time care to our son. Living in the moment gave me joy, but planning my own future gave me hope. \nStop time with special time.\u00a0 \nWhen Nicholas was young, he did a kind of non-directive communication therapy called \"Special Time.\" During the hour, the therapist did not speak herself, except to reflect back to Nick what she saw him do and what it might mean. It was an hour of intense intimacy and heightened listening. Special Time had many communication benefits for Nicholas, but it had benefits for me, too. I learned the value of stopping time in order to listen intently and exclusively to those I love. Even ten minutes a day of special time with a son, daughter or spouse enriches family life. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You may also like... \n \n The true joys of special needs parenthood The special joy we get from our kids Should kids with special needs get special sports treatment?

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nThe world of illness, disability and caregiving is peppered with terminology from the battleground. \u00a0We 'battle' cancer. \u00a0We 'fight' to get our loved ones the services they need. \u00a0We don't invite friends over because our houses look like 'a bomb went off'. \u00a0When the going gets very tough for caregivers, it certainly feels like we're operating in a war zone.  \n \nThe other day, I was listening to a banker talking about the volatility of financial markets. \u00a0She used a word I hadn't heard before -\u00a0 VUCA . \u00a0It's a military term used by forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and it stands for 'Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous'. \u00a0\"Wow\", I thought, \"there must be lessons here for caregivers!\" \n \nSo, I googled VUCA and found a\u00a0 website about using military lessons learned for corporate leadership . \u00a0And my intuition didn't steer me wrong - these lessons really are absolutely relevant to caregivers. \u00a0Because our world is always volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. \n \n \n \n \n \n According to Impact International, a business consulting firm in the area of organisational development, here are the indicators for successful leadership in a VUCA world: \n \n Always retain a clear vision against which judgements can be made, with agility to flex and respond appropriately to rapidly unfolding situations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Provide clear direction and consistent messaging against a backdrop of continually shifting priorities, supported with the use of new virtual modes of communication where necessary. \u00a0 \n Anticipate risks but don\u2019t invest too much time in long-term strategic plans. Don\u2019t automatically rely on past solutions and instead place increased value on new, temporary solutions, in response to such an unpredictable climate. \u00a0 \n Think big picture. Make decisions based as much on intuition as analysis. \u00a0 \n Capitalise on complexity. If your talent management strategy is working, then you should be confident that you have the right people in the right place. This will enable you to rapidly break down any challenge into bite size pieces and trust in the specialist expertise and judgement of those around you. \u00a0 \n Be curious. Uncertain times bring opportunities for bold moves. Seize the chance to innovate. \u00a0 \n Encourage networks rather than hierarchies \u2013 as we reach new levels of interconnection and interdependency collaboration yields more than competition. \u00a0 \n Leverage diversity \u2013 as our networks of stakeholders increase in complexity and size, be sure to draw on the multiple points of view and experience they offer. Doing so will help you expect the unexpected. \u00a0 \n Never lose focus on employee engagement (here, think of the doctors and home nursing team, if you have one - even your extended family). \u00a0Provide strategic direction, whilst allowing people the freedom they need to innovate new processes, products and services. \u00a0 \n Get used to being uncomfortable. Resist the temptation to cling on to outdated, inadequate processes and behaviours. Take leaps of faith and enjoy the adventure. \n \n \n Each of these elements of VUCA has great resonance for caregivers. \u00a0Some are easier than others to implement, but many of them tell us what we already know (but forget in a crisis or in a moment of self-doubt). \u00a0'Get used to being uncomfortable' is a lesson all caregivers must learn and re-learn every day. \u00a0But taken together, all these elements of VUCA give us reassurance that being uncomfortable is A-OK and just a natural way of being when dealing with adversity.\u00a0 \n \n My book, 'The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving' (House of Anansi Press), is available now from all major booksellers in the USA and Canada.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity", "http://www.impactinternational.com/blog/2012/01/leadership-vuca-world", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XkaTIJ_75do/UPWDe1D6fsI/AAAAAAAAAnk/nivR-4RLlc8/s1600/two-us-soldiers-aiding-wounded-vietnam.jpg", "http://www.impactinternational.com/blog/2012/01/leadership-vuca-world", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ryz5MMGKkc4/VD_VZB5KrxI/AAAAAAAABqI/nreYxrrAITU/s1600/Newbookcover.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/10/managing-chaos-lessons-for-caregivers.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nUntil very recently, I have never met a parent of a child\nwith disabilities who didn\u2019t worry about the future. \u00a0  \u201cWhat will happen to my child after I\ndie? \u00a0  Where will my child live? Who will\nlove my child and keep him safe?\u201d \u00a0  These\nare the anxieties that make restful sleep impossible for ageing parents.  \n \n \n \nRecently, I spent the weekend at a family conference outside\nof Brantford, Ontario. \u00a0  Children with\ndisabilities and their parents sat with me around the campfire and told me\ntheir stories. \u00a0  One young man relaxed in\nhis wheelchair while younger children sang songs or lounged on the lap of a\nparent. \u00a0  All the children at this\ngathering suffer from an intractable form of epilepsy called  Dravet Syndrome .  \n \n \n \nAnkie Werdekker is the mother of Gavin, an engaging pre-teen\nwho was born with this genetic anomaly.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnkie is a Brantford native and the conference organizer.\u00a0 She's also the Secretary of the Canadian Association, ' Dravet.ca '. \u00a0She told me about \u2018 Peace Haven \u2019, a disability\nsupport initiative founded by members of her church,  The Free Reformed ChurchAssociation . \n \n \n \n\u201cWhat will happen to Gavin when he grows up?\u201d I\nenquired. \u00a0  Ankie told me that Gavin\nattends a church school and often spends his \u2018holidays\u2019 (aka respite for Ankie\nand her husband) at Peace Haven. \u00a0  \u201cWhen\nthe time comes for Gavin to move away from our family home,\u201d Ankie said, \u201cWe\nhope and expect that there will be a permanent place for him at Peace\nHaven.\u201d \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe respite programme at Peace Haven doesn\u2019t only serve\nchildren and adults with Dravet Syndrome \u2013 all are welcome from the special\nneeds church family, including those with San Filipo Syndrome, Down Syndrome\nand Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. \u00a0\u00a0  A wide\nrange of supports can be offered in family homes, as well. \u00a0  Service is flexible and based on individual\nneed. \n \n \n \nAfter my morning keynote address, I asked if anyone could\ntake me to see what this local church community had built for its member\nfamilies supporting children with disabilities. \u00a0\n Ankie and her husband Jack introduced me to Margaret Heemskerk, the\nDirector of Peace Haven. \u00a0  Margaret is a\nfireball who offered immediately to show me the two small supportive homes she\nand her team operate. \u00a0  A short drive from\nthe conference led us to a modern and leafy neighborhood with two stone and\nbrick bungalows side by side \u2013 \u201cThese are our two Peace Haven homes\u201d, Margaret\nsaid proudly. \u00a0\u00a0  I was shepherded in to a\ncozy and beautifully decorated living room flooded with light. \u00a0  In the adjoining kitchen, a resident was\nmaking soup with her helper. \u00a0  Down the\nhall, I was invited to peek in three distinctively different bedrooms \u2013 each\nfilled with colours and artwork reflecting the character and tastes of its\nresident. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u201cHere is the bedroom of one young resident who\nis medically complex and is non-speaking. \u00a0\n His adapted bath adjoins his bedroom.\u201d \u00a0\n I was struck that another resident had much less visible needs. \u00a0  She needed some support with banking and\ngetting to and from her part-time job. \u00a0\n The management of Peace Haven is committed to creating a home that meets\nof their residents, no matter how high or how subtle.  \n \n \n \n \n \nI asked Margaret if I could tour the twin home next\ndoor. \u00a0  \u201cSure!\u201d she said, \u201cCome on\nin!\u201d \u00a0  In the living room of the second\nPeace Haven home, I had the opportunity to chat with a resident. \u00a0  Sandra Spysma smiled as she described her\ndaily routine. \u00a0  A talented musician,\nchoral singer and crafter, Sandra has many opportunities to share her interests\nwithin her church community and beyond. \u00a0\n Sandra\u2019s mother manages the house operations and keeps an eye on her\nvulnerable daughter as well as the home\u2019s other two residents. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nAs Margaret and I drove back toward the conference through\nthe rolling hills of Brant County, I mused about how it might be possible to\nreplicate this cradle to grave community support system for vulnerable children\nand their families. \u00a0  How, for example,\ndid the home\u2019s operations remain immune from institutionalization? \u00a0  Margaret explained that three residents is\nthe maximum allowed before provincial government authorities take a more active\nrole in oversight, something the church community wanted to avoid. \u00a0  The question of family trust in the\noperations of the homes seemed moot \u2013 folks in this small community are friends\nand members of the same church. \u00a0  Parents\nof residents support the daily activities and upkeep of the homes. \u00a0  There are no secrets.  \n \n \n \nFor Peace Haven, the church community behaves like a\nsupportive extended family. \u00a0  Ongoing\nfunding is ensured by a collective commitment to the project. \u00a0  Fund raising is complemented by an ethic of\nvolunteerism, so paid staff in the home are used to being assisted by church\nmembers/friends.  \n \n \n \n Today on Facebook my respected friend, fellow disability Mom and executive activist,  Sue Swenson , wrote this:  \n \n \u00a0 Here's to a day when a loving mother has options other\nthan 'a group home,' options that provide gentle teaching and positive support,\nand that those options strengthen her connection to her son even if he lives\nelsewhere, and they do not make her feel that she is abandoning her beloved\nson, or abdicating her responsibilities, but rather the options allow her to\nfeel that she is deserving of having her own life even as he is deserving of\nhaving his. Here's to that day. \n \n Here is also to that day when parents who are desperately seeking\nsolutions to how to get through the day and the night find answers beyond what\nthey learn in animal husbandry or corrections, and when our communities are\nrich enough for someone else to know and care what that family is up against,\nand that there are resources to help them escape the expectation that they\n'take care of it' without help. Here is to manageable struggle, and ordinary\npeople who come together to help when the struggle becomes unmanageable. Here's\nto a civilization that is actually civilized. Here's to that day. \n \n Here's to the day when\npeople who work in human services have the tools and resources they need to\nprovide services that are humane and that support families without first\nneeding to require the families to be sacrificed. Here's to the day when we\nrecognize that human service workers are human, too, and are not built to stand\nby and watch disaster happen to others. May their empathy be supported. Here's\nto that day. \n \n \n \n \n To Sue, I would respond, \u2018Here\u2019s to the day that we\nall have the future certainty of a Peace Haven\u2019 in our lives. Now that we\u2019ve\nseen it, we can build it, but we cannot do it alone.\u00a0 It takes a village, so let\u2019s begin to imagine\nour neighbours, friends and local businesses as co-creators of our children\u2019s\nsecure future.\u00a0\u00a0 Here\u2019s to that day.\u00a0\u00a0  Bottom\nof Form \n \n \n \n \n My book, The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving (House of Anansi Press) is available now from all major booksellers in Canada and the USA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Top of Form \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/what-is-dravet-syndrome", "http://dravet.ca/", "http://www.peacehaven.ca/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Reformed_Churches_of_North_America", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l27Wky5mFyE/VC3JfFVAkpI/AAAAAAAABmw/ro-wELBQILE/s1600/stamps_peacehaven.ca.jpg", "http://dcpartners.iel.org/speakers/swenson", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6i3gCTQwIKQ/VC3LwtCJtrI/AAAAAAAABm8/39xZ0VRzWLY/s1600/BookcoverAnansi.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/sue.swenson/posts/10152744154038914?comment_id=10152744471468914&offset=0&total_comments=29&notif_t=feed_comment_reply"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/10/a-dream-come-true-how-one-community-is.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n Marilynne Robinson  is a great American novelist and essayist who mines contemporary society for meaning. \u00a0Her themes are expansive and biblical in their proportions. \u00a0This what she said in a\u00a0 New York Times Magazine \u00a0interview recently: \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cPeople,\u201d Robinson said, pausing before she defined that familiar word in original terms: \u201cBrilliant creatures, who at a very high rate, predictably, are incomprehensible to each other. If what people want is to be formally recognised in society, to have status, to have loving relationships, houseplants that don\u2019t die, the failure rate is phenomenal. . . . Excellent people, well-meaning people, their lives do not yield what they hoped. You know? This doesn\u2019t diminish, at all, the fact that their dignity is intact. But their grief . . .\u201d \n \n \n \n \nI've been thinking a lot about grief lately, especially the grief of being inadequate to meet the needs of our loved ones. \u00a0When I can't soothe Nick's pain or when I hear my Mom (who lives in a different city) tell me over the phone that she hasn't eaten breakfast because her caregiver never arrived. \u00a0And I've been thinking about if and how my son and my mother are formally recognized in society - are they at all? \u00a0Robinson's mind seems to have wandered in the same direction as mine. \u00a0Here's what she said about human worth:\u00a0 \n \n The idea is that there is an intrinsic worth in a human being. Abuse or neglect of a human being is not the destruction of worth but certainly the denial of it. Worth. We\u2019re always trying to anchor meaning in experience. But without the concept of worth, there\u2019s no concept of meaning. I cannot make a dollar worth a dollar; I have to trust that it is worth a dollar. I can\u2019t make a human being worthy of my respect; I have to assume that he is worthy of my respect. Which I think is so much of the importance of the Genesis narrative. We are given each other in trust. I think people are much too wonderful to be alive briefly and gone.\u00a0 \n \n We are given each other in trust - that is something I  feel , absolutely. \u00a0I've given a lot of thought to the notion of human worth, especially that of people who require care. \u00a0What about someone like Nicholas who will never be employable and will always need total care? \u00a0I love him, but how can I publicly defend his worth? \n \n Many parents will identify with me when I talk about\nNicholas\u2019 contribution to the quality of my life, especially\nto my spiritual wellbeing. I  am  a better person for loving him and caring for him. But certainly I cannot say\u00a0 that because I have cared for my son, and consequently\nincreased capacities for selflessness in myself by virtue of\nattending to his needs, that either of us would wish to\nclaim  that  as his contribution to life in general. \u00a0As the special needs Dad and theologian\u00a0 David A. Pailin \u00a0said,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThose who are looking for a reason to justify caring have\nnot understood that love is a self-justifying and all-sufficient ground for certain types of behaviour. Those who\nremain puzzled by love (and even cynical about references\nto it) should therefore consider whether the contributory\nworth notion of value has blinded them to what is good\nin itself.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Some activists in the disability movement defend the\nworth of those with cognitive disabilities by pointing to\u00a0 the \u201ccontribution of being.\u201d But that stance is rooted in\nwhat positive effects might be experienced by an able-bodied person while spending time with someone who\nseems unresponsive. \u201cI love spending time with my aunt\nwho has advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease because we just\nsit together. I have a busy job and she helps to slow me\ndown\u201d is one story I heard to back up this theory. \u00a0\u00a0 But, what if this aunt had no visitors who enjoyed\nsitting with her? Does this woman\u2019s worth diminish the\nlonger she lives without her capacity for reason? What if\nall her relatives were killed in an accident and there was\nno one left who remembered this elderly woman before\nthe onset of her disease? In the case of the severest forms\nof disability, it may be too difficult to  imagine  an individual ever having capacity. How do we rate the worth of\nsuch souls? The  theological anthropologist Hans Reinders \nexpands on the idea of received love as the scorecard for\nworthiness. \u201cThe gift that profoundly disabled human\nbeings have received is the gift of being, which is derived\nfrom the freedom of judgement. No entrance tickets are\nneeded, no exams have to be passed. ...The gift of being is\nnot an abstraction; it is the gift of being what you are.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen I was researching my book and casting around for a theory of human worth that would include my son, I had a conversation with the distinguished professor and academic,  Melanie Walker . \u00a0I told Melanie that the best theory I'd found so far was a religious one, but I worried that it wouldn't be inclusive for anyone who didn't believe. \u00a0\"Well, you'll have to find a theory that's not religious\", she said, shrugging. \u00a0\"Try reading  Eva Kittay .\"  \n \nEva Kittay is a philosopher, but she's also a disability Mom. \u00a0Kittay's daughter Sesha has a severe cognitive impairment. \u00a0Kittay has a wonderful theory of human worth that includes her own daughter, Nicholas and my Mom. \u00a0\"We are all some mother's child\", she maintains.  \"Our dignity, I want to argue now, is bound both by our capacity to care for one another and in our being cared for by someone who herself is worthy of care.\"  \u00a0This idea is perfectly personified by the mother and newborn baby. \u00a0This relationship of dignified, perfect care and pure love, is at the root of equality in human dignity and civil society itself. \n \nRecently on Facebook, I saw that Eva Kittay had started an innovative project to persuade young academics from varied gender, economic and racial backgrounds into graduate work in philosophy. Her \u00a0inclusive project is called  PIKSI . \u00a0With women and even people with disabilities entering graduate careers in philosophy, perhaps we'll have more inclusive theories of human worth that resonate with me and other families like mine.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilynne_Robinson", "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/magazine/the-revelations-of-marilynne-robinson.html?partner=socialflow&smid=tw-nytmag&_r=0", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BgyINf30T6s/VC9as_9IcuI/AAAAAAAABnQ/qFD5yPw51Ws/s1600/Marilynne_Robinson.jpg", "http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=E2EE221C69698E5DFF630047491B4889.journals?fromPage=online&aid=2424644", "http://www.faithability.org/person/hans-reinders", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/educationresearchprojects/developmentdiscourses/projectresearchteam.aspx", "http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/philosophy/people/faculty_pages/kittay.html", "http://philpapers.org/archive/KITEDA-2.pdf", "http://rockethics.psu.edu/education/piksi"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/10/the-worth-of-vulnerability.html", "title": ""},

Anger anger anger. \n \n \n \nAnger is an emotion that all primary caregivers know too\nwell. \u00a0  Witnessing the unfairness of our\nloved ones suffering, combined with a sense of unwanted labour forced upon us\nsometimes swirls into a toxic stew of seething resentment.  \n \n \n \nRighteous anger that spurs us on to defend the interests of\nour vulnerable loved one is energizing \u2013 it is a positive force.  \u00a0 But bitterness is negative. \u00a0  It sucks the life out of our best selves and\nit feeds on inertia. \u00a0  It\u2019s hard to move\nforward constructively when you feel consumed by resentment.  \n \n \n \nThe primary caregiver may have a network of close family and\nfriends around her (or him), but there will be some days that the leadership\nrole takes its toll. \u00a0  An angry, resentful\nattitude doesn\u2019t attract friends. \u00a0\n Bitterness sends potentially helpful well-wishers scurrying back to the\nsafety of their peaceful homes. \u00a0  It\nisolates. \n \n \n \nSo, what can be done with these feelings when they stalk us\nthrough the day and night? \u00a0  For years, I\nheld my anger inside when I felt it, and I certainly don\u2019t recommend that as a\nstrategy. \u00a0  Looking back, I wonder how I\ngot through many of the toughest times. \u00a0\n They say hindsight is 20/20 and I\u2019ve combed through the memories of my\nlife to find strategies that worked sometimes for me, even though I may not\nhave realized it at the time. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nIn my book, The Four Walls of My Freedom, I wrote about how\nI thought of our family life as a swim marathon across a large body of open\nwater. \u00a0  Jim was in the safety boat \u2013 he\nneeded to be there, because to survive, we couldn\u2019t have everyone in the\nwater. \u00a0  During storms, I cried for him to\nlet me give up the marathon and let me into the boat, or to have him jump in with\nme. \u00a0  But the lucid part of me knew that we\nneeded Jim\u2019s salary and that personally, I needed to have one person in the\nfamily who grounded us with a sense of order. \u00a0\n \u201cEverything will be all right\u201d, he said. \u00a0\n \u201cYou are a great mother.\u201d \u00a0  \n \n \n \nI\u2019m no longer swimming the marathon. \u00a0  Nicholas is healthy and happy at the moment\nand I have retired from nursing him. \u00a0\n Others do that now. \u00a0  My Mom is\ndoing OK and our entire family pitches in daily to ensure she feels safe and loved. \n \n \n \nWhat did I learn about swimming a marathon of caregiving\nthrough unsettled waters? \u00a0  I learned that\nthere is an end to the marathon, even though it is beyond the horizon \u2013 it\nexists. \u00a0  Every caregiving experience has\na beginning, a middle, and an end. \u00a0  I\nknow that changing your swimming \u00a0  stroke\nis a strategy that works for the long haul. \u00a0\n Floating on your back to rest and look at the stars means you stay in\nthe water, gathering energy to swim hard the next day. \u00a0  Getting through a long stretch means switching\nfrom butterfly to side-stroke. \u00a0  It\u2019s\nold-fashioned, but it\u2019s what our mothers taught us and it\u2019s energy\nefficient. \u00a0  I know that staying in the\nwater with lots of people on the boat passing snacks and throwing a life-belt\nare the difference between drowning and mastery of the waters. \u00a0  And sometimes, in long stretches of calm\nwater, it\u2019s essential to trade places with a strong swimmer on the boat. \u00a0  It was hard to trust that others could swim\nor that they would stay the course if I looked away, but it was a necessary\nlesson. \u00a0  I learned that it\u2019s always\npossible to jump back in and swim strongly after a rest and a change of\nperspective, especially when swimming against the current.  \n \n \n \nThe biggest lesson about anger a life of caregiving has\ntaught me is that resentful anger is not my friend. \u00a0  Treating it like a friend only hurt me more,\nevery time. \u00a0  Changing my stroke, changing\nmy perspective\u2026 those are the strategies that worked for me to banish\nbitterness.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n My book, The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving (House of Anansi Press, 2014) is available from all major booksellers in Canada and the USA. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nQbO3ywMeb0/VDgkJ4W2EUI/AAAAAAAABn0/iUd-32yKk3I/s1600/Fotolia_460773_XS.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOQI2pGsAWc/VDgjq7lLWVI/AAAAAAAABns/j67x6BqRb1Q/s1600/anansibookcover.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/10/anger.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n How Can Yoga Help Dementia Patients? \n \n \n \n by Camille Leavold \n Yoga is a popular form of\nexercise that has a variety of health benefits, which have gained attention\nfrom the general public and medical professionals alike. Benefits of yoga\ninclude improved strength, flexibility and posture, improvement in balance, a\nreduction in aches and pains and an improvement in depression. In recent years,\nits potential as a tonic for memory has become known. The Annals of Internal\nMedicine published a study that found that healthy people who exercise\nregularly cut their risk of developing dementia by 30-40%. For people who do\nget dementia, exercising may delay the onset for several years. Because of\nthis, activities like yoga could be helpful in maintaining the cognitive health\nof people with dementia. \n \n \n \n \n \n Why Yoga is\ngreat \n Elderly people with dementia\nliving in a care facility were enrolled in a  12 week yoga training programme  to\nassess its effect on their health. The residents who took part in the programme\nhad: \n \n Lowered blood pressure \n Lowered respiration \n Improved heart and lung function \n Better flexibility and strength \n Improved balance \n Improved range of motion in the joints \n A reduction in depression \n A reduction in behavioural problems. \n \n The yoga programme benefited both\ntheir physical and mental health. This is important because people with\ndementia can become depressed or confused at their loss of memory. Other\nresearch shows similar findings and dementia care specialists and nursing\nagency staff are so impressed with the positive effect that yoga has on\ndementia patients that they are introducing it in assisted living facilities,\nnursing homes and other long term care settings. \n Johanna, who does yoga with her\nmum diagnosed with Dementia two years ago, finds that it has many benefits. Her\nmother\u2019s blood pressure has improved and it also helps with coordination and\nbalance. She says that it also has a \u2018calming\u2019 effect, which might be due to\nthe fact that her level of anxiety reduces after attending her bi-weekly yoga\nclass. \n \n Yoga for the\nDisabled \n Yoga can also help people recover\nfrom injuries faster and sleep better and special \u2018in chair\u2019 yoga has been\ndeveloped for those with physical limitations. Sometimes it is even possible to\ngain in height due to the stretching that yoga involves! Poses can be used to\nstretch and strengthen ankles, hips and hamstrings and to improve the posture\nof the back and reduce lower back pain. Yoga can calm the nervous system and\ninflammation and help prevent arthritis and rheumatism. All this can help the\nelderly avoid falls and other injuries commonly associated with growing older. \n The physical activity and\nincreased circulation may also have the added benefit of keeping you looking\nyounger for longer. Regular yoga enthusiasts could look only 50 when they reach\n70 (according to personal accounts). Yoga may prevent incontinence, a problem\ncommon with the elderly or sick. The special focused breathing exercises that\nare done in yoga classes can ease the stress that is sometimes experienced by\npeople with disabilities including dementia. The deep breaths release tension\nand concentrate the mind to centre the person and help keep their self-esteem\nat a healthy level. Yoga is an ideal form of exercise for disabled people\nbecause complete beginners can try it and can do the exercises that they are\ncomfortable with while still reaping the benefits. \n \n How to\nChoose a Good Yoga Class \n If choosing a yoga class for yourself\nor your loved one, you should make sure you pick a reputable class. You should\nask what experience the instructor has working with the elderly and disabled. A\ngood instructor will always ask what illnesses or injuries a person has to\nensure the person\u2019s safety. The class should be slow paced and focused on\nproper alignment. \n You can find yoga classes at\nhealth clubs, leisure centres, educational facilities, hospitals and care\nhomes. \n \n \n Author Bio: \n Camille Leavold is managing\ndirector at a leading  health care assistant provider  in the UK. It specialises in\nproviding care services like  dementia care support , elderly care, respite care for children,\nlearning disability nursing and much more.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nToday I hugged one of my oldest and dearest friends. \u00a0I hugged her for a long time, because this was the day of her husband's funeral. \u00a0Kathleen Campbell Jordan married Bill Jordan 47 years ago, ten years before Jim and I tied the knot. \u00a0Kathleen and Bill have three grown children - Christopher, Geoff and Suzanne. \u00a0Chris has disabilities. \u00a0Suzanne came to the cottage with us one summer to help us look after Nick and Natalie. \u00a0Our two family experiences are intertwined in many ways. \n \n \nTwenty-six years ago and the day after we received Nicholas' diagnosis of severe brain damage, Kathleen arrived at our door. \u00a0Here's how I wrote about that day in my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom: \n \n \n At that time, my husband Jim was on loan from Foreign Affairs to the\nPrime Minister\u2019s office and would come home near bedtime to feed Nicholas,\nstill suited, watching the news. \u00a0  Word\nspread in our family about the \u201ccondition\u201d. \u00a0\n A cousin came over with a friend to give advice. \u00a0  The friend\u2019s business card read \u201cVolunteer\nConsultant to Families with a Child with a Disability\u201d. \u00a0  Her name was Kathleen Jordan and she had a\nson of sixteen with incomprehensible difficulties. \u00a0  He was blind, had cerebral palsy, Tourettes\nsyndrome and epilepsy. \u00a0  I started to\nexamine this blonde woman in my living room. \u00a0\n Her nails were beautiful; they were glossy red and perfectly\nrounded. \u00a0  I asked, \u201cHow is it you have\ntime to do your nails?\u201d \u00a0  I really wanted\nto know. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Kathleen had a\nhuge pile of papers with her. \u00a0  She patted\nme and said \u201cI have some information here, but I completely understand if you\nwant to look at it some other time\u201d. \u00a0\n \u201cNo!\u201d I cried, \u201cGive them to me now! \u00a0\n All of it.\u201d \u00a0  Years later, I heard\nthe expression \u201ccognitive lifeboat\u201d. \u00a0  In\nthat moment, I found mine, and, gasping, climbed aboard. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \u00a0Kathleen Jordan would become my mentor in parenting and advocacy. \u00a0With Kath at the helm, together we toiled night and day to put \" Lifetime Networks Ottawa \", or LNO, on the map in our city. \u00a0LNO was (and still is!) a family-driven social enterprise designed to help parents plan a safe and secure future for their adult child with disabilities. \u00a0(It is an affiliate of  Planned Lifetime Advocacy Networks in Vancouver .) Part of our family's future planning always included a retirement for Jim and me. \u00a0I knew that we would crumple under the weight of Nick's dependency needs as we aged, so transitioning out of a primary caregiver role was for us, do or die. \u00a0But Kathleen has always been a caregiver - first to her own mother and mother in law, to her dear family friend Doris, then to her husband Bill until he died this week. \u00a0And until recently, Christopher. \u00a0Two days before Bill passed away, Chris celebrated his 40th birthday. \u00a0 Nowadays, he lives with a helper in his own apartment .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0Kathleen created those arrangements for Chris after years of trials and errors. \u00a0Christopher has good days and bad days - on good days, he can direct his own care, tell his helpers which medications he needs, call friends and carry out many activities of daily living without assistance. \u00a0On bad days, Chris needs almost total care. \u00a0Kathleen always wanted supportive housing arrangements that would allow Chris the flexibility to be in charge of himself on good days, but give him intensive care when he needed it at other times. \u00a0Arrangements like that don't exist in our system, hence the failures that occurred in the past. \u00a0But Kathleen and Bill persevered and now Chris has a good life. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n Bill Jordan was a rather old fashioned man of values. \u00a0A larger-than-life man of great wit, Bill only ever had eyes for one girl; Kathleen. \u00a0He was a deeply loyal and loving family man of faith and character.  \u00a0Today at Bill's funeral, the church was filled with legions of Chris' former caregivers. \u00a0Some of them refer to Bill as \"Dad\" - all are extended family. \u00a0 \n \n With Christopher settled in to his apartment and Bill gone, what will Kathleen do? \u00a0Who are any of us if we are not caregivers? \u00a0This was the question I asked myself as I hugged Kath. \u00a0Over the coming months, once again, I will learn from watching my friend. \u00a0As Kathleen begins her new journey of self-discovery, I will be there for her as she has always been there for me. \u00a0 Rest in Peace, Bill . \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0FqvHtOs4VU/VBNRnnQpeKI/AAAAAAAABlQ/mt7csRcutnE/s1600/Kath.jpg", "http://www.houseofanansi.com/The-Four-Walls-of-My-Freedom--P2274.aspx", "http://www.citizenadvocacy.org/programs/lifetime-networks/", "http://www.plan.ca/", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/disabled-adults-find-match-in-personal-care-worker-roommates-1.1400888", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jgIiVoYltBA/VBNPu75uLII/AAAAAAAABk8/VClkpk56xxM/s1600/si-ott-chris-jordanscott-22.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GDmT24D-dn4/VBNQSIbzyCI/AAAAAAAABlE/5pe5dwJY8d8/s1600/Billy.jpg", "http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ottawacitizen/obituary.aspx?n=william-jordan&pid=172427906"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/09/after-caregiving-tribute-to-dear-friend.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nThe other day, a newspaper headline caught my eye: \u201c The Joyof Not Reading \u201d, it read. \n \n \n \nIt was an opinion piece about a man whose immigrant parents\nhad told real bedtime stories to him and his brother as they grew up. \u00a0  \u201cMy brother and I shared a bedroom as kids,\nand Dad would often come up before lights out and tell stories.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0  The author\u2019s father told tales of a peasant\nlife, coming to Canada, homesteading in Northern Ontario and his mother\u2019s\nthirst for a better life in the city. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nThe writer laments that he never told his own children his\n\u2018real\u2019 stories. \u00a0  \u201cI\u2019d love to say I\nfollowed my father\u2019s storytelling tradition, but it just never occurred to\nme. \u00a0  I read to my kids before bed, and\nnow I see it was an opportunity lost.\u201d \n \n \n \nThe writer worried that his suburban North American\nupbringing would contain no stories worth telling. \u00a0  But as his own old age approaches, he\nreflects, \u201cThe more I reminisce about my own life, the more I see it was rich\nwith experience, with plenty of opportunities to get into tangles.\u201d \n \n \n \nStorytelling is a potent medicine for the heart and\nmind. \u00a0  This article got me thinking about\nhow in contemporary society, we believe we have no stories to tell. \u00a0  But we DO have stories to tell \u2013 all of\nus! \u00a0  And I have vowed to myself to take\nthis author\u2019s advice and begin telling them to my children, to my mother and\nnow, to you. \u00a0  So, here\u2019s a story that\nhappened to me when I was twelve years old. \u00a0\n Perhaps you will think of a story to share with your loved one today \u2013\nwe are never too old for \u2018storytime\u2019. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nIt was the fall of 1967. \u00a0\u00a0\n In time to begin the new school year, our family had reluctantly moved\nin late August from Montreal to a small town in Southern Ontario. \u00a0  My Dad had accepted a job with a big company\nand it was a promotion. \u00a0\u00a0  So we waved goodbye\nto Expo 67 and the excitement of Montreal\u2019s World\u2019s Fair to greet a farming community\nand new friends in a small city called Brantford. \u00a0  Of course I wanted to fit in and I soon found\nout that not many people moved in and out our town in those days. \u00a0  Tall for my age, I stuck out in more ways\nthan one. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nSo one day, a new friend shook the long bangs from her eyes\nand announced seriously that she had \u2018colored her hair\u2019 using lemon and then\nthe rays of the sun. \u00a0  Standing around her\nunder the light in the girls\u2019 washroom, we nodded that yes, we definitely saw\nhighlights. \u00a0  That instant, I wanted\nlemons more than anything.  \n \n \n \nYou have to understand that my Mom hates to cook. \u00a0  She\u2019s not even that interested in\neating. \u00a0  In our fridge, we had minute\nsteak, stewed tomatoes, iceberg lettuce and white bread. \u00a0  But nothing so exotic as a lemon! \u00a0  I scavenged through our cupboards. \u00a0  Aha! There it was \u2013 Hawes Lemon Oil for\nFurniture. \u00a0  \u201cThis will do\u201d, I thought and\nproceeded to pour the contents through my hair over the kitchen sink. \u00a0  Next, I pulled out a lawn chair from the\ngarage, arranged it on our front lawn and looked up at the sky. \u00a0  It was cloudy, but there was enough light to\ngive my dark brown hair golden highlights, I was sure. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nAn hour later and bored, I climbed the stairs to our second\nfloor bathroom. \u00a0  I put my head under the\nhot shower and only then did I begin to realize I might have made a mistake\nwith the lemon oil. \u00a0  The water ran off my\nhair like water off a duck. \u00a0  It beaded\nand failed to even penetrate to my skull. \u00a0\n A large bottle of Breck Shampoo for oily hair would do the trick, I\nthought. \u00a0  Five shampoos later, there was\nno change. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nEventually of course, the lemon oil came out of my hair and\nI never did get blonde highlights. \u00a0  A few\nyears later, my Dad\u2019s company closed and we moved back home to Montreal. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nNext week, I\u2019ll visit my Mom and I\u2019ll ask her to \u201ctell me a\nstory!\u201d \u00a0  My Mom\u2019s stories are the\nfunniest ones. \u00a0  And when I see Nicholas\nand Natalie, I will ask them for something from their past as well. \u00a0  Maybe it\u2019s my own advancing age and wanting\nto replay the events of our family life, but I\u2019m definitely sold on \u2018the joy of\nnot reading.\u2019  \n \n \n \nThat said, I hope you won\u2019t give up reading altogether,\nbecause my book has just been released in the US! \u00a0  (It\u2019s already available in Canada.) \u00a0  There are lots of stories of caregiving in\n\u201cThe Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I\u2019ve Learned From a Life of Caregiving\u201d\nas well as reflections on the meaning of a \u2018good life\u2019 for families involved in\ngiving and receiving care.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/facts-and-arguments/the-joy-of-not-reading/article20330453/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/09/why-we-shouldnt-read-sometimes.html", "title": ""},

With a\none-year certification course and the right licensure, you could make between\n$30,000 and $60,000 a year performing these tasks professionally. Your\nexperience will probably help make the learning process easier as well. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Registered Nurse \n \nIf you\u2019ve collaborated with doctors to create care plans for\na loved one, are used to monitoring behavior and reaction to medications, and\ncan administer medication, you might consider a career as an RN. You\u2019ll need to\nspend longer in school, earning the equivalent of a bachelor\u2019s degree. This is because\nan RN\u2019s job also involves a lot of work with medical equipment, performing\ndiagnostic tests, and analyzing test results. \u00a0\n On average, RNs earn between $45,000 and $95,000 a year. Take an  in-depth\nlook  at different nursing options to see what field might be best for you. \n \n \n \n Personal Support\nWorker \n \nAnother career option for those who help with daily\npersonal needs is that of a personal support worker. \u00a0  PSWs work directly with patients, providing\nhousehold and personal care support, overseeing the patient\u2019s condition, and\nproviding informal counselling as needed. A certification is not an absolute\nrequirement for this job, but many institutions require one. Retirement homes\nand community care centers often hire PSWs, so if you have experience with and\nenjoy working with the elderly, this might be a great career move. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Choosing the Best\nCareer for your Skills \n \nWe learn best from personal experience.

{"date": "", "body": "\nA date night with my husband Jim doesn't happen often. \u00a0We have fallen into our habits of cooking dinner together, followed by reading or watching a British television drama. \u00a0Sometimes, though, a movie or play catches my eye and I peek out of my turtleshell long enough to organize an escape from my comfy chair at home.  \n \nThis week, we saw Richard Linklater's new film, 'Boyhood'. \u00a0I'd seen the word 'masterpiece' attached to the project, but it was the idea of a film being made about a boy growing up over twelve years that captivated me. \u00a0At first, Mason (Ellar Coltrane who plays the boy) is aged five and after 2 and half hours in a darkened theatre, he has matured to age 18. \u00a0Mason's compacted boyhood shows us ourselves and presents to us the richness of 'normal' family life. \u00a0For me, it was a powerful reminder that the entire moral universe is contained within the ordinary.  \n \n \n \n \nI am 59 years old. \u00a0Jim has retired from his demanding diplomatic career. \u00a0Over the past couple of years, we have learned hard lessons of trust as we tentatively put our son Nick's care into the hands of others. \u00a0Our daughter Natalie has moved to Delaware in order to pursue her studies. \u00a0Today, we are contemplating selling our family home in Ottawa in favour of a country lifestyle on the water about 20 minutes away. \u00a0As I look at our basement full of children's sleds, baby clothes and disorganized boxes of old photos, I reflect on the themes in 'Boyhood' and what they mean to me. \u00a0(Caution - there might be a few spoilers here. \u00a0You may wish to see the movie before you read this.) \n \n Loving Relationships: Joy or Incarceration? \n \nA young and beautiful Patricia Arquette (the single mother) explains to her impatient date that the babysitter has cancelled. \u00a0\"Don't you think I WANT to go out sometimes?!\" she wails. \u00a0\"I have responsibilities! \u00a0I lived at home with my parents' rules and then I had babies... I have NEVER been able to just go out!!\" Next, we see this young mother with her children snuggled into bed together (her date has given up and left) as she reads a storybook infused with an intimate, secret code of affection.  \n \nMy book is called \"The Four Walls of My Freedom\" - the title comes from a quote by the American philosopher and Trappist monk,  Thomas Merton . \u00a0In his diary,  The Seven Story Mountain , Merton describes the moment that he entered a monastery to find spiritual enlightenment this way: \"Brother Matthew locked the gate behind me and I was enclosed in the four walls of my new freedom.\"  \n \nBeing 'responsible' for vulnerable loved ones certainly felt like a prison sometimes to me. \u00a0There were days that I felt furious and impotent with my inability to make personal choices or to act spontaneously... ever. \u00a0But I was always seduced again into laughter and optimism by the smell of my children's hair, the touch of their fingers on my arm or the whispers of their secrets in my ear. \u00a0These are ordinary ideas and experiences that mothers talk about all the time. \u00a0They are rarely examined in film, probably because we don't count them as important. \u00a0But, they are. \n \n Holding On and Letting Go \n \nChildhood. Adolescence. Adulthood. \u00a0Parenthood. \u00a0These life stages contain roles we constantly struggle to hold tight or to release. \u00a0The complicated transitions of growing up are closely examined in this film and made plain by symbols and metaphors. \u00a0As Patricia Arquette packs up her young children and drives away to a new (better) life in another city, the boy muses about their lonely collection of toys abandoned on the front lawn. \u00a0\"They were not worth bringing with us, but they were too good to throw away.\" \u00a0The poignancy of the toddler's plastic basketball hoop left behind wasn't lost on me. \u00a0Boyhood is fleeting. \n \nWhat are the meanings in our normal life transitions? \u00a0What objects can we keep to remind us of those meanings? \u00a0When we let go of our childhood mementos or our dependent relationships, what is left? \u00a0In her last scene as the mother, Patricia Arquette has broken free of her 'responsibilities' and her 'four walls'. \u00a0Her children have grown and gone. \u00a0But, what remains for her except old age and death, she wonders.  \n \n Normal is Noble \n \nThere was a scene in 'Boyhood' when Ethan Hawke (the actor who plays the birth father of the boy and his sister) lectures his teen daughter about contraception. \u00a0\"Oh\", I nodded, \"here's the foreshadowing of an unwanted pregnancy drama.\" \u00a0But the girl didn't get pregnant. \u00a0Near the end of the film, the boy (now 18 years old) is driving down a highway on his way to a new life, apart from his family home. \u00a0\"Right. \u00a0Get ready for the car crash.\" But it never came. \u00a0No, these are good (not great) kids living a normal life. \u00a0But here's the thing - normal isn't boring. \u00a0It's fascinating... riveting, even. \u00a0This film compels us to find the meaning in everyday life, specifically family life.  \n \nRecently, I had a conversation with a wise colleague in the social change movement,  Vickie Cammack . \u00a0Vickie was telling me about an interview she gave for radio. \u00a0The host asked her what was required for people to survive and be happy now and into the future. \u00a0\"Being intentional. \u00a0Intentional about our relationships and the way we live our lives,\" was Vickie's response. \n \nI felt wistful at the end of 'Boyhood'. \u00a0I felt that perhaps this boy and his family had not be intentional and that their way of moving through life was like a leaf being blown by the wind. \u00a0Perhaps that expectation that fate will take care of us is at the root of our collective contemporary discontent. \u00a0I'm convinced that Vickie is right - we need to be more intentional. \u00a0What would 'Boyhood' look like with that overlay? \u00a0I'm not sure, but the characters in this film are a testament to the old adage that you don't know what you've got till it's gone. \n \nAfter the film, Jim and I went to a local diner for tacos and beer. \u00a0Brown paper was the tablecloth and a couple of crayons invited us to leave our mark. \u00a0Jim scribbled his name on the table as we waited for our order to arrive. \u00a0I wrote 'Donna' beside his name and drew a heart around us. \u00a0Between our names, I crayoned the number 37. \u00a0That's how long we've been married.  \n \nHave we let our lives waft along unnoticed? \u00a0Have we spent time wishing to be apart, free and somewhere else? \u00a0Yes, I think we have sometimes. \u00a0But we have sought meaning in our daily lives too, and we've found it there. \u00a0Like in a movie date with my husband and father of my children. \u00a0People like us who spend a great deal of time caring for the needs of others are natural miners for meaning in life. \u00a0We exist in 'the spaces in between'.  \n \nMy Mom used to stand in my bedroom doorway, hands on hips and scan the jumble of clothes and books on the floor. \u00a0\"What is the meaning of all this, young lady?\" she would demand. \u00a0\"I don't know\", I would tell her now. \u00a0\"But I'll watch Boyhood again and maybe I'll have the beginning of an answer.\" \n \n \nPregnant with Natalie in 1991.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLondon, 2010\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vt1JJeC5yek/U_QTL5fxVaI/AAAAAAAABic/O2gTUVQQe7E/s1600/Boyhood_film.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Merton", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Storey_Mountain", "http://tyze.com/about/our-team/vickie-cammack/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xVxH5AxqCao/U_Qd2znFQpI/AAAAAAAABi0/WIDIYV67hUs/s1600/sterlingweddingmeandjimbest.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UEZ8HPhwLHY/U_T6TvoLIeI/AAAAAAAABjk/jdwdHnPdW3Y/s1600/earlyfam3.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-khewYo7xCkE/U_T6PN8stjI/AAAAAAAABjc/tZw20_PVAwk/s1600/earlyfam2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yteyL8gLeH0/U_SQdpgqYOI/AAAAAAAABjE/HW5RFTTzXao/s1600/earlyfamily.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-opLSgTEBK-0/U_SQmj8NoSI/AAAAAAAABjM/VUaoOW4nnE0/s1600/familygrossq%232.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/08/the-film-boyhood-reflections-on-holding.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nA friend of our family passed away from meningioma, so I was pleased to host a guest post about caring for a loved one with this type of brain tumour.  \n This is a Post by Jan Vespremi \n \n Treatment Options For Meningioma \n \n \n \nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the science. As a caregiver, understanding the\nscience of meningiomas\u2014while it doesn\u2019t negate the stress that comes with what\nwe do--can help alleviate some of the emotional issues that come up, especially\nwith meningioma patients. \n The Science \nMeningiomas are intracranial tumors that originate from arachnoid cap cells\nin the thin, spider web-shaped membrane surrounding the spinal cord and brain.\nAlthough the majority of these tumors are non-cancerous, untreated and\nundiscovered, they can slowly grow and, in some locations of the body, can be\ndisabling or even life threatening.  According\nto \u00a0the\u00a0National Cancer Institute, meningioma accounts for 27\npercent of all brain tumors; and 30.1 percent of all CNS (central nervous\nsystem) and primary brain tumors. \nGenetic factors are the biggest cause for meningiomas, with radiation\nexposure following not far behind.  Some\nresearch \u00a0says that changes to hormones (estrogen and androgen) during\npregnancy could accelerate the development of meningiomas. It is also thought\nthat previous head traumas could lead to the condition at the injury site; and\nviruses could encourage the development and growth of the tumor. They can also\nbe found in places with skull fractures, and those where the surrounding\nmembrane is scarred due to an injury. \n Symptoms \nMost of the time, the symptoms brought on by meningioma are a direct result\nof the location of the tumor. For example, someone who has  optic nerve meningioma \nwill have to deal with vision loss (most commonly in his or her peripheral\nvision), while someone with an olfactory groove tumor will have issues with his\nor her sense of smell and, potentially, vision problems. \nAs a caregiver, it is the parasagittal and falx tumors\u2019 symptoms that will\nmost likely impact how you care for and relate to your patient. This is\nbecause, depending on which part of the brain these tumors set up shop, your loved one could experience seizures, numbness or weakness and problems with cognitive\nability like memory and reasoning. \n Caring for Someone with Meningioma \nOne of the hardest things for someone who is diagnosed with this type of\ntumor is that, often, it is inoperable. Radiation therapy can help shrink the\ntumor and slow down its growth but, ultimately, it will keep coming back,\nsymptoms will recur and there isn\u2019t anything that the patient can do about it.\nThat can cause many patients to become very depressed, which is understandable.\nAfter all\u2014would you want to have to go through radiation therapy over and over\nagain for the rest of your life?  \nIt\u2019s also likely that your patient will be very angry. These tumors, because\nof how they are formed and where they like to set up shop, are often\nmisdiagnosed when symptoms first appear. Your patient may have spent years\ndealing with misdiagnoses and failed treatments and they may be looking to lash\nout at someone. Caregivers are often seen as the safest people to lash out (as\nyou already know!). \n Tips for Coping \nTry to remember that, in some cases\u2014as much as this is cribbed from Grey\u2019s\nAnatomy\u2014it really will be \u201cthe tumor talking.\u201d If you are new to caregiving,\nthis can take some getting used to. It is hard not to take the lashings out of\nsomeone personally.  \nBe proactive. The biggest issue with meningioma patients, as already\ndiscussed, is that their symptoms reoccur and are often misdiagnosed. Work with\nthe patient\u2019s doctor and family to figure out what is \u201cnormal\u201d behavior and\nwhat might be a sign that the patient needs to be seen earlier than his or her\nnext follow up.  \nDon\u2019t forget to take care of yourself! Caregivers\u2014whether professional or\nfamily or friends who are taking this on for the first time\u2014often put their own\nneeds absolutely last. But, just like with child care, you cannot offer the kind\nof care you need to offer if you are operating at a deficit. Use the  Cancer.org\nDistress Assessment  to help keep track of your own self-care.\u00a0 \n \nJan Vespremi \u00a0is a freelance writer and work from home mother.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nGuest Post by Juliet Martin \n \n \n When your parents\nget to an age that you believe they would be better off living away from their\n(or your) home in order to receive the care they need, when they need it,\nyou\u2019ll find many  nursing homes \navailable to you, but the question is; what should you look for when comparing\nthese homes between one another? \n \n \n \n It goes without\nsaying that you want the best possible care for your parents. Price is, of\ncourse, always a consideration, but in general so long as the fees for any\nparticular nursing home seem fair and relative compared to what your parents\nwill get in return, you should put price out of your mind for a moment so you\ncan concentrate on the features of any one nursing home in order to make your\ncomparisons between them that much easier. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n To help you get\nstarted, below we\u2019ve detailed five of the key areas you should explore when\nlooking up homes online, and eventually visiting them in person. Some of the\npoints below may be more important to you than others, but in general the home\nyou end up choosing should incorporate all of these points to some degree. \n \n \n \n 1) Person-Centred\nCare \n \n \n \n Person-centred\ncare is a type of care-giving that,  according to The Health\nFoundation , \u201csees patients as equal\npartners in planning, developing and assessing care to make sure it is most\nappropriate for their needs.\u201d Any nursing home you choose for your parents must\nput them, and you, at the very heart of all matters regarding their personal\ncare; with your parents being treated as individuals, rather than simply\nresidents. \n \n \n \n Regardless of any\nillnesses your parents may have, if a nursing home practices person-centred\ncare they will treat your parents as adults at all times, on an equal footing\nto themselves, and you. \n \n \n \n 2) Clear\nPreventative Safety-Measures \n \n \n \n Safety prevention covers a wide spectrum \nand can include anything from the quality of the food your parents will be fed\nat their nursing home to their ability to easily access exercise equipment and\njoin in on recreational activities (see point five) at their home. \n \n \n \n Other\npreventative safety-measures you should look out for when visiting different\nhomes is whether there are\u2026 \n \n \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n handrails along the walls, \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n wheelchair-accessible doorways\naround the home, \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n tidy floors, dry and free of\nlitter, \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n fire extinguishers throughout the\nfacility, \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n call buttons in the apartments and\nthroughout the facility, \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n adequate heating and air\nconditioning systems. \n \n \n \n 3) Happy, Helpful\nStaff \n \n \n \n It\u2019s been said\nmany times that  people who are happy in\ntheir work are, unsurprisingly, better at their job \nand put more time and effort into their job. This is exactly what you want from\nthe members of staff who work at a nursing home that your parents may\neventually live in. \n \n \n \n When you\u2019re\nvisiting different homes you should pay close attention to the staff, both when\nthey\u2019re talking to you and when they\u2019re speaking with individual residents,\nunaware that you\u2019re watching. Ask yourself: \n \n \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Do they seem to genuinely care\nabout and respect each resident they interact with? \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Do they answer your questions\nhonestly and in depth? \n \n - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Is there a generally pleasant\natmosphere about the home? \n \n \n \n 4) How Homely it\nFeels \n \n \n \n This point seems\nso obvious that it often slips people\u2019s minds when looking around potential\nhomes for their parents. \n \n \n \n As your parents\nwill be living there full time, any nursing home they end up moving into has to\nhave a homely feel about it, meaning it\u2019s decorated in a fashion that they\nwould like (and maybe even have in their current home), and it has all the\nstandard homely pieces of furniture, such as armchairs, sofas, and coffee tables,\ndotted around the facility and in the individual apartments. \n \n \n \n 5) Wide-Ranging\nRecreational Activities \n \n \n \n Despite their\nadvancing years, your parents can and will enjoy being at a nursing home more\nwhen they have a wide-range of recreational activities available to them. These\ncan include sporting activities, social activities, and (of course) therapeutic\nactivities. \n \n \n \n When visiting a\nnumber of homes ask the staff outright what activities they\u2019re currently\nproviding to their residents, and at what frequency.

{"date": "", "body": "\nPerhaps you fear losing the parent you care for. \u00a0Or maybe, you fear your own death as you care for your dying relative. \u00a0Maybe you just don't know who you will be when your loved one passes and leaves you alone in the world, without the identity of caregiver. \n \nClaudia Chowaniec has wrestled all these demons to the ground and lucky for us, has imparted her experience in \" Memoir of Mourning: \u00a0Journey Through Grief and Loss to Renewal .\"  \n \n \n \n \nThis is a book about an intense and co-dependent caregiving experience - one that lasted many years. \u00a0As a teenager, Chowaniec cared for her mother through bouts of manic-depressive illness. \u00a0This was followed by more intensive caring when the elder Mrs. Chowaniec developed severe Alzheimer's and eventually succumbed to that terrible disease, leaving her daughter filled with guilt (Claudia was on holiday when her mother suffered a health crisis that would prove fatal).  \n \nThis book is the product of diaries kept over years. \u00a0Chowaniec describes her writing process this way: \n \n \"Memoir of Mourning is based on memories and excerpts from the journal I began before Mom's death. \u00a0I scribbled down my thoughts - raw, intense and immediate - on what was happening in the hospital as I tried to communicate with the medical team,  Is Mom dying ?\u00a0I recorded the end-of-life decisions I struggled to make, when out of the blue, the doctors told me they were discharging Mom because there was nothing more they could do for her and she needed palliative care. \u00a0The journal became the only witness to my anxious bedside vigil,  What will death be like ? as I watched her breathe, one breath, then another, and then no breath at all.\" \n \nThere are many reasons to recommend this book. \u00a0First, it is a diary, so if you want to know what witnessing death is really like, you will have a clear idea after reading Chowaniec's urgent prose. \u00a0There's poetry too, though. \u00a0Chowaniec is someone who writes everything down in order to understand it - and I for one, am glad she did. \u00a0The journey of love, dependency, identity, mortality and finally resilience is one that should be told first hand, not through the lens of imagination and memory. \u00a0The author shares what  really  happened, always in the present tense. \u00a0And it's easy to like Claudia Chowaniec and her mother. \u00a0The author generously shares their stories, their fears and their humour. Chowaniec's mother was a war bride who had fearlessly cajoled German soldiers into allowing her past a checkpoint with stolen groceries to feed refugees housed on her family farm. \u00a0This story and more, Claudia wrote down and as her mother's Alzheimer's progressed, she read them back to replay the events of her mother's life and keep memory alive. \n \nI had lunch with Claudia Chowaniec recently and we talked about our mothers, about death and dying, and about caregiver identity. \u00a0We talked about the benefits of counselling and the satisfaction in counselling others. \u00a0I was sad to learn that after her mother died, Chowaniec's husband had been diagnosed with cancer. \u00a0Her caregiving journey is not over. \u00a0As we mused about our next books, I said a silent prayer that my new friend's spouse would fully recover after his latest round of treatment.  \n \nThe intense personal drama of tending to a dying loved one is not a subject for dinner table chat. \u00a0It is life-changing and yet frequently, we do not have the experience or knowledge to decipher the many meanings in it. \u00a0Claudia Chowaniec has done the work and shared it for all who walk that path. \u00a0I am grateful that she did. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Memoir-Mourning-Journey-through-Renewal/dp/0991962028", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U3X-nK1jUPQ/U9aCSJ57I-I/AAAAAAAABgU/eCtiBzBr3_k/s1600/memoir.jpeg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/07/memoir-of-mourning-journey-through.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nToday's guest post is by\u00a0 Derek Hobson, BA. \u00a0Derek is the editor for \u00a0 ConciergeCareAdvisors.com ,\u00a0a senior care referral agency. He developed a passion for elder care when he became the primary caregiver for his grandmother. Since then, he has sought to inspire fellow caregivers as \u201cthere is no success without hardship.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen I was 20 years old, my grandmother was diagnosed with a slow progressing form of dementia. She didn\u2019t need care immediately, so we had time to research options. We read books and countless articles, we swapped knowledge over dinner, and frequently talked to our grandparents about how everything would work out given our lifestyles. And yet, when the time came to provide care for her, I could not have been more unprepared. \n \nAlthough I had a job, I was a full-time student, so work was primarily for a disposable income. Since the rest of my family had full-time jobs and my grandfather didn\u2019t drive, I received all the phone calls and texts. I suffered from more stress than I\u2019d ever experienced before. It seemed like my phone was buzzing incessantly and it was always to help my grandmother. I had to cut back my hours at work; I didn\u2019t have time to spend with friends; I was falling behind in my studies. To make matters worse, I had no one to talk to about it. \n \nI felt like I was not making a difference and that mindset was like a poison, making me grow more and more resentful \u2013 of my grandmother and my family. My family only called me if they needed something for my grandmother. I wasn\u2019t getting enough sleep and ate more fast food than I care to admit. I did not understand sacrifice. \n \nDespite all of the time I dedicated to figuring out how my day-to-day routine would change, none of it prepared me for how my lifestyle changed. And the only reason, my livelihood improved was because I started talking about it. From that, I\u2019ve learned a few things to pass on to new caregivers. \n \n Tell Your Employer \n \n \nNo matter what your job is (and even if you don\u2019t cut back on your working hours), tell your employer about the change in your life. If you do get that emergency call to help your loved one, they will be infinitely more understanding. \n \n Nap When You Can \n \n \nSleep becomes a challenge, especially if your elder is suffering from dementia like mine was. Their sleep schedule changes too \u2013 some of the worst emergencies happen during the early morning hours or mid-evenings. \n \nSo if you come home from work or school and someone else is taking care of your elder, then nap \u2013 you\u2019ll be glad you did. \n \n Make Time For Yourself \n \n \nThere\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re not taking enough time for yourself. Even if it\u2019s just a 15-minute walk every day, you need the air \u2013 plus, turns out a\u00a0 15-20 minute walk \u00a0does wonders for your heart. \n \nMy situation was a bit different since my whole family was working together. But you can always ask your in-home caregiver to stay an extra few minutes while you walk or a trusted neighbor. Don\u2019t skimp on yourself. \n \n Eat Right \n \n \nI\u2019m not the only one who didn\u2019t eat right. It\u2019s a crisis among caregivers! If you talk to fellow caregivers, you\u2019ll find that \u2013 for a time \u2013 no one eats well. However, making healthy meals and continuing to cook helps you regulate your time and you\u2019ll feel better \u2013 believe me! \n \n Be Vocal And Ask For Help \n \n \nThis is the perhaps the most crucial for new caregivers. You need to talk about it. And I mean really talk about it \u2013 not just complain\u00a0 at\u00a0 someone. If you ask for help, you\u2019ll get it. And you need to ask because It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a caregiver support group or a\u00a0 senior care service , we all feel selfish and guilty when about asking for help. We feel doubly guilty when we ask for help taking care of our elders, because we all know that eventually it is going to be rewarding. \n \nYet, one of the worst parts was reading about how rewarding being a new caregiver is and feeling like I\u2019m the only one shouting, \u201cWhen is it going to be rewarding?!\u201d \n \nBut I\u2019ve since learned that the reward isn\u2019t something you get immediately and oftentimes, you won\u2019t even feel it while you\u2019re the caregiver\u2026 but when my grandmother passed away, I knew I did everything I could for her. I spent quality time with her that I would never have had a chance to otherwise. And there were days where she gripped my hand or smiled that old, familiar grin that let me know she was going to be alright. \n \n \n \n \n \n That \u00a0was rewarding. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://conciergecareadvisors.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IBJz-y6IeLo/U87NIfEOLHI/AAAAAAAABfo/Dho_6IVgOso/s1600/hands.jpg", "http://www.npr.org/2012/05/09/152336802/stand-up-walk-around-even-just-for-20-minutes", "http://www.conciergecareadvisors.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/07/advice-for-new-caregivers.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nAbout 20 pages into Susan Allen Toth's caregiving memoir,  \"No Saints Around Here\" , I decided I didn't like the author. \u00a0Not one bit. \u00a0\"How can a wife sigh loudly in front of her Parkinson's disease-suffering husband just because she can't have a second cup of tea in the morning?!\" I fumed. \u00a0I kept picking up this book, reading a little, getting annoyed and then slamming it down. \n \n \n \n \n \nThis book really got under my skin. \u00a0So one day and about a third of the way through the book, I was helping my dear friend and caregiving mentor  Kathleen Jordan  pack her cupboards for a move into a smaller apartment. \u00a0Kath has spent her lifetime giving care to those she loves - she's the mother of three children, one with cerebral palsy complicated by mental illness, epilepsy and a visual impairment. Kathleen also looked after her mother until she died and more recently, her husband Bill. \u00a0Bill suffers from a myriad of serious ailments and is now palliative in a care home.  \n \nAs I loaded jars and dishes into a box, I railed against \"No Saints Around Here\" and it's author. \u00a0Kathleen put her hand on my shoulder and said, \"so you are comparing the way the author feels to what you felt looking after Nicholas, your child. \u00a0But Donna, it's so different caring for a spouse. \u00a0In a way, it's much harder, especially when you're older.\" \u00a0I looked at Kathleen, my teacher, and later went home to read again and consider my prejudices. \n \nThe thing is, at first I thought \"No Saints Around Here\" was shaping up to be a glib tale of care given, but with resentment and cynicism. \u00a0What I didn't understand was that I was reading the words of a woman/wife/companion who was livid at her loss and flailing with incompetence in the face of the Parkinson's that attacked her life and her love in some new horrible way every day.  \n \nNo, this was a woman who loved her husband James - achingly, desperately, quietly, sadly loved him. \u00a0Nearly half-way through the book, the author describes visiting prospective nursing homes with her beloved. \u00a0It's almost too painful to read. \u00a0No nursing homes are anywhere near worth considering, so life goes on at home. \u00a0 As James' condition worsens and crises loom on a near-daily basis, Toth writes about a friend's wisdom this way:  \n \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0\"A devoted Zen disciple, Mimi told me, \"My biggest test is when I'm cleaning a toilet. \u00a0I turn the task into a meditation. \u00a0I pay attention to my work, every gesture, every moment.\" \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wish for a touch of Mimi in the morning. \u00a0Rather an savor the moment, I often feel as though time has alarmingly telescoped. \u00a0I have just finished clearing up after breakfast and now I need to get James into his pyjamas. \u00a0Where did the day go? \u00a0How did I disappear? \u00a0Why am I on this frozen tundra?\" \n \nOne fascinating tell-tale sign of the journey of the caregiver's heartbreak is the shift in possessive pronouns when the author talks about her home helpers. \u00a0At first, she talks about 'our aide', but then I notice she uses \"my aide\" and finally, \"James' aide.\" As James' disease progresses, Toth reveals her loneliness by becoming subsumed by her beloved's needs and losing the 'our' and 'my' in her language. \u00a0Only 'he' remains. \n \nBut the reader of \"No Saints Around Here\" will not have to read subtle signs of the caregiver's emotions - the author tells us everything. \u00a0This is a diary, after all. \u00a0Toth writes poignantly about the helplessness that every caregiver feels one day or another: \n \n \"I feel as though I am about to fall off my balance beam. \u00a0I picture every caregiver on one, usually performing with an outward calm, like a confident acrobat, but concealing an inner terror: \"What in the world will I do now?\" \u00a0For many of us, this must require both courage and faith, because I am often dizzy and close to gasping as I edge my way forward. \u00a0The balance beam hangs in an enveloping haze.\" \n \nYes, Susan Allen Toth, we all DO feel as you did. \u00a0In 2012, our family had recently moved from our home in the UK back to Ottawa, Canada. \u00a0 This is what I wrote :\u00a0 During the past few months, I described to a friend how I felt about the onslaught of change in my life - \u201cit\u2019s as if someone has removed all the floorboards from my house\u201d, I said. \u201cIt\u2019s like I am walking on just the narrow joists and I worry about falling\u201d. \n \n \n \n Susan Toth was lucky to have good friends who were kind and generous in sharing their own experience of nursing spouses through Parkinson's. Perhaps Toth's friend Dorothy summed up the truth about caregiving best: \"You know, you do what has to be done. \u00a0And isn't that maybe the base line? \u00a0What it all comes down to? \u00a0You love someone, so you do what has to be done.\" \n \n \n \n I changed my mind about this book. \u00a0I don't hate it, I love it. \u00a0Tonight at dinner, I told my husband that if he ever needed care, I would get out Susan Allen Toth's book as a reference because, I said smiling, \"There are No Saints Around Here!\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/No-Saints-around-Here-Caregiver%C2%92s/dp/0816692866", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j7JqvnxHxpQ/U7tVVxLZRTI/AAAAAAAABd0/jWsNZ6-eaBA/s1600/no+saints.jpg", "http://plan-31.myshopify.com/products/the-ties-that-bind", "http://www.aletmanski.com/al-etmanski/2012/01/donna-thomson-what-are-you-skating-towards-defence.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/07/no-saints-around-here-book-review-do-i.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n When my son Nicholas was born with severe disabilities in 1988, my husband and I struggled to care for him on our own. \u00a0Nick turns 25 at the end of this month and all these years of giving care have taught me one great big lesson. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n Caring alone is not a good idea. \u00a0Caring TOGETHER is a much better way to look after my son and my mother who needs me too. \u00a0Mom is still feisty, but she is 92 and frail. \u00a0She needs help with cooking, banking, cleaning, and errands. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n Society tells us to \u2018look after our own\u2019 and we want to care for those we love best in the world. \u00a0But caregiving is a job that is full of thousands of small tasks and over time, taken together, the caregiving role can erode physical and mental health. \u00a0It can make a longtime caregiver feel invisible, sad and constantly inadequate. \n \n \n \n I have learned that those in our extended family and our friends WANT to help look after our son and my Mom. \u00a0They do want to take some small role, but they don\u2019t know how to parse a huge need (as in the case of our son) into a small, reasonable and helpful task that any non-professional could do. \u00a0 Nick had his first major surgery at the age of two and afterwards, he was in desperate straights. \u00a0My mother-in-law was shocked by the distress in our whole family, but didn\u2019t know how to respond. \u00a0She said, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing I could do!\u201d \u00a0Somehow, I found the wherewithal to respond, \u201cActually, could you maybe make us a banana bread?\u201d \u00a0She was so relieved and happy to have a task that didn\u2019t involve complicated and overwhelming nursing duties.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Clever innovators in the world of health and long-term care have been working on how to give form and structure to taking sole responsibility for complex care off the shoulders of family members. \u00a0 One such inventor is Dr. Douglas Eby at Southcentral Healthcare Foundation in Anchorage, Alaska. \u00a0Dr. Eby and his colleagues created the  \u201cNuka\u201d system of care . \u00a0Dr. Eby describes how Nuka works with a fictional, but typical patient called \u2018Frank\u2019. \u00a0Frank is 87 years old and suffers from diabetes and angina. \u00a0His daughter lives in another city and visits frequently to help Frank organize his home, medications and medical appointments. \u00a0Nevertheless, Frank calls 911 frequently and keeps a bag packed for the hospital at the ready. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n When the Nuka model of care was created, Dr. Eby changed \u2018Frank\u2019s\u2019 primary diagnosis to one of \u2018isolation\u2019. \u00a0On the treatment plan was putting Frank\u2019s daughter in touch with an outreach nurse who would coordinate with Frank and a community center to ensure that Frank filled his prescriptions, took his medications and attended a social group twice a week. \u00a0A network of family and professionals was formed to care for Frank in a coordinated and respectful way. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n We have such a network for our son Nicholas. \u00a0We don\u2019t live in Alaska, but we are able to emulate the Nuka model using an online tool called  Tyze Personal Networks \u00a0(www.tyze.com). \u00a0Tyze is a FREE care coordination tool that facilitates seamless communication between professionals involved in Nick\u2019s life with family members and best friends. The unique aspect of Tyze is the data security - it's the same as online banking, so it's accessed only by password and individual sites are not searchable on google. \u00a0This data security means that medical professionals, including doctors and nursing agencies can work together with family caregivers in a single, online network. Our GP as well as nurses and therapists participate in our son's Tyze network. \u00a0Other excellent and free online care coordination tools for friends and family are  \u2018LotsaHelpingHands\u2019 ,  Caring Bridge \u00a0and  Caring Ties . \u00a0 \n \n \n \n The important message is that sharing the care is a good thing. \u00a0It is a loving act to ensure we are there for the long term with those we love who need our help. \u00a0Because rested, happy, healthy caregivers make great caregivers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ln5t519Psg8/U6LrI6TropI/AAAAAAAABcQ/wRCZIh6v8mk/s1600/Menicknewborn.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-H7xDYjeH9_s/U6LrfFfQfKI/AAAAAAAABcY/05ez-XHShps/s1600/Momandmerose.jpg", "https://www.southcentralfoundation.com/nuka/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.lotsahelpinghands.com/", "http://www.caringbridge.org/", "http://caringties.com/free-tools-caregivers/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H5pkQk_ykSQ/U6LuGW3MswI/AAAAAAAABck/WAkGW_SKgi4/s1600/400302_10150433434131227_503011226_9055387_720609862_n.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/06/sharing-care-online-can-it-really-help.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n Recently, I gave an interview to Kris Bone, a writer with  the Puritan Magazine  (a Canadian literary journal). \u00a0Here's his article about my book, \"The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving\" (House of Anansi Press, 2014). \u00a0My book is available everywhere in Canada and for pre-order in the USA via all major booksellers.\u00a0 JUNE 23, 2014 \nAn Interview with Donna Thomson, Author of\u00a0 The Four Walls of My Freedom \n \n \n \nDonna Thomson on Being a Caregiver of Disabled Individuals //\u00a0 Kris Bone \n \n \n Donna Thomson and her book, The Four Walls of My Freedom (House of Anansi) \n \nWhen it comes to Canadians with severe disabilities and the people who care for them, a suspicious opacity surrounds them in the public consciousness. Fundamental misconceptions about the nature and benefits of the relationships between people with disabilities and their friends, families, and caregivers\u2014as well as underestimations of the immense cost and work that go into providing adequate care\u2014act as impediments to positive change. That is exactly why a book like\u00a0 Donna Thomson \u2019s\u00a0 The Four Walls of My Freedom \u00a0 ( House of Anansi ) is such an important one: it gives readers access to all facets of the life of a caregiver, even the ones we\u2019d rather not think about. It also reminds us that in omitting to think about these issues, whether intentionally or not, we are doing some of the most vulnerable people in Canada a dangerous disservice. \n \nTo approach the importance of Thomson\u2019s book in a slightly different way: there is one incident relayed in the text that has stuck with me since reading it months ago. \n \nDuring a panel discussion at Stony Brook University in 2008, philosopher\u00a0 Eva Kittay \u00a0was posed a question that, in her own words, induced in her \u201ca feeling of nausea.\u201d As a staunch defender of rights for those with disabilities and as the mother of a woman with severe cognitive disabilities, Kittay was asked to speak to the \u201cmorally significant\u201d ways in which the profoundly disabled are \u201csuperior to pigs or dogs or animals of that sort.\u201d Kittay proceeded to give her audience a glimpse into the complex relationship between her and her daughter, and the relationship between any disabled person and their friends and family: \u201cThere\u2019s so\u00a0 much\u00a0 to being human. There\u2019s the touch, there\u2019s the feel, there\u2019s the hug, there\u2019s the smile \u2026 there are so many ways of interacting. I don\u2019t think you need philosophy for this. You need a\u00a0 very good writer .\u201d \n \n \n Eva Kittay, staunch defender of rights of persons with disabilities \n \nKittay\u2019s answer speaks to the need for accurate and available representations of the lives of people with disabilities and their caregivers if any sort of understanding is to be achieved. Thankfully, this is exactly what Thomson\u2019s\u00a0 The Four Walls of My Freedom \u00a0 provides. \n \nIn 1988, Thomson\u2019s son\u00a0 Nicholas \u00a0was born with cerebral palsy.\u00a0 The Four Walls of My Freedom\u00a0 grew out of the ensuing struggle that Thomson and her family endured in trying to provide both a full, dignified life, and adequate care for Nicholas. If\u00a0 The Four Walls of My Freedom \u00a0was only a predictable book about one family\u2019s difficulties, though, with a Hollywood-friendly happy ending, it wouldn\u2019t nearly be so powerful a narrative. The real strength in Thomson\u2019s text comes from two sources: the first is her frankness. Thomson does not hesitate to call attention to her own faults, insecurities, and mistakes. Navigating Nicholas\u2019 needs is a job more than any one person, mother or not, could be expected to handle, and Thomson does an admirable job of framing the magnitude of what she, and all those in her position, are up against. It is not the story of a super-mom and her amazing single-handed victory over the opposition; it is a story of small victories and a lifetime of learning how to meet the needs of her son, and of all Canadians with disabilities. \n \nThe second strength is that the content of the book does not limit itself to just the story of Thomson, her son, and their experiences. Thomson dips into various other theories and approaches to caregiving throughout, while also drawing parallels to issues like eldercare*. The book\u2019s subtitle, \u201cLessons I\u2019ve Learned from a Life of Caregiving,\u201d is almost deceptively narrow when alluding to the content of the book\u2014more than just lessons learned while providing care, the text contains lessons from a life spent researching and considering caregiving, much to the benefit of the reader. Drawing on material from thinkers like Nobel Prize-winner\u00a0 Amartya Sen \u00a0(whose \u201ccapability approach\u201d plays a major part in Thomson\u2019s personal philosophies) or the aforementioned Eva Kittay, the book is complex and multi-faceted, and uses an effective blend of the personal and the theoretical to bring the uninitiated reader up to speed on caregiving. \n \n The Four Walls of My Freedom \u00a0is a hopeful book, but it is a book that tempers a hopeful outlook on Canadian attitudes on disabilities by underscoring it with the absolute necessity of greater awareness. Thomson makes it clear that Nicholas is not someone to be pitied\u2014but he does have needs that need to be met if he is to participate as an equal citizen. Thomson makes an important distinction, a la Amartya Sen, between\u00a0 equality \u00a0and\u00a0 equity , between a medical model of disability and a formulation where personal freedom and happiness is the goal. If nothing else, this book performs one of the most important functions of any writing: it helps us to understand the lives we don\u2019t lead. \n \nAs part of a group of editors and writers who often put a lot of thought into what it means to encourage diversity and equality in the work we write, read, and publish, I thought it would be an enlightening experience to ask Donna Thomson a few questions about the writing of her book, and about her life as a caregiver. The following interview was conducted via email during the Spring of 2014. \n \n Kris Bone: Donna, much of your book,\u00a0 The Four Walls of My Freedom , deals with the struggles that you and your family underwent both to acquire suitable care for your son, Nicholas, and to find a measure of balance in your lives while managing your dual roles as loved ones and caregivers. The material feels particularly intimate, and you certainly don\u2019t shy away from the tougher realities of having a child with disabilities\u2014a seemingly endless schedule of surgeries and medical emergencies, a never-ending search to find the best care for your child (be that medically or academically), and the infinite number of adjustments and accommodations that your family has fought to make in order to ensure that Nicholas can experience the world as an equal citizen. \n \n In some previous interviews, you mentioned that even discussing your experiences with neighbours or friends was all but impossible because they simply could not relate to the things you were going through, and that the experience became very isolating. Was writing this book, then, a liberating experience, or was it more difficult to find the words?\u00a0 \n \n And now that you\u2019ve given talks about your experiences, how has the response to the book been? In the talk you gave at the MaRS center here in Toronto in March, there were many people in the audience who seemed to express a similar sense of isolation and frustration surrounding the way our society treats caregiving and disability. Have people been supportive of your narrative, either within the disability community or outside of it? Have there been negative reactions to your book? \n \n Donna Thomson: \u00a0It\u2019s true that caring for Nicholas (who was in nearly constant crisis) as well as for my daughter was isolating for me. My life was very different from other peoples\u2019, and when someone continues to be ill or in pain over time, friends and family feel helpless. By the time Nick was a teenager, I felt that I had nothing interesting or pleasant to say to anyone. Nick\u2019s health had stabilized somewhat when I began to research the book. At that point, I was searching for meaning\u2014the meaning of my life experience, that of Nicholas, my husband Jim, and our daughter Natalie. I thought perhaps I had found an idea (Amartya Sen\u2019s \u201cCapability Approach\u201d) that might give our lives meaning and might define us as equal members of society, rather than outsiders. For me, the philosophical ideas of what constitutes moral personhood and a \u2018good life\u2019 were really, really compelling. The ideas I was exploring helped me understand a new way of seeing dependency and how our society can be organized to support us. That was not liberating so much as thrilling. It was like finding a treasure. I didn\u2019t want to simply tell our story\u2014I wanted to use snippets of our story to talk about dependency and care from birth to death, across abilities. I wrote about the ideas first, and then reviewed my memories to find family anecdotes that would illustrate my points. Often, I wrote in the middle of the night\u2014that\u2019s my creative time. \n \nYou asked how families have responded to my book. I have had many letters and messages from parents. I am always so grateful when readers take the time to share their experience of my book and tell me what it means to them. Most readers tell me that they found my book mirrored their own experience of relentless caregiving, sleepless nights, and loneliness as well as the intimacy and joy that dependency work inevitably brings. Some parents worry that they cannot feel the hope that I express, especially if their son or daughter has a degenerative condition. \n \nMy conversations with families south of the border reveal a cultural difference in values about care. Many U.S. parents feel that \u2018families should look after their own\u2019\u2014they are mystified by my assertion that the government should have a role in supporting citizens with care needs. And yet, they too are overwhelmed, so we have many day-to-day experiences to share. Some family members who write to me are caring for elderly parents suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia. Like me, they are trying to come to grips with the complicated ethics of asking for and receiving help. They seek conversation with someone who has shared something of their experience. There have been one or two negative reactions to the book (there may be many more, but those readers haven\u2019t told me)! I have heard from some parents that my book was too \u2018political\u2019\u2014that it wasn\u2019t simply the story of struggle and redemption in disability parenting they hoped for. On one occasion (this was at the event you attended), a parent worried that my story was not inclusive of the experience of families living with poverty or the challenges of being from a visible minority. My book does not resonate with everyone! \n \n KB: In the very first chapter of the book, you mention that when Nicholas\u2019 test results were first returned and you were informed that your son was severely disabled, you felt \u201ca lightness, a sense of relief and purpose,\u201d because you felt that at least you could increase your own knowledge of the conditions Nicholas was living with\u2014and thereby help him \u201cgrow into somebody perfectly perfect.\u201d \n \n In those first months, what sort of material did you find that dealt with family life and disability? Outside of functional medical information, which resources did you draw from? Did you find that there were sources that prepared you for the reality of life with a child with disabilities, or were narratives like that harder to come by\u2014and are there any things you wish you could have known then that were not available to you? \n \n Donna Thomson:\u00a0 In the early days, I remember finding two great resources that helped me move from a state of despair and paralysis to positive action: the first was information about a therapy called Conductive Education. It wasn\u2019t the therapy per se that was so heartening; it was the feeling that there was something I could teach Nicholas that could help him overcome the effects of his disability. The other resource was a book by Helen Featherstone called\u00a0 A Difference in the Family . Featherstone wrote a sensitive and intelligent family memoir\u2014it gave me some insight into the desperate love I felt for Nicholas and how our life together could be simultaneously rich, joyful, fearful, and sad. These resources, along with the friendship of other parents, began to offer me the beginnings of a roadmap about how to live a life very different from the one I had always imagined. \n \n \n Donna Thomson with her son, Nicolas \n \nAre there things I wish had been available to me: I would say that the Internet is something I wish I had had in the early days. I sought information and connections to other parents who were going through something similar to our family. As Nicholas began to exhibit symptoms that mystified doctors, I struggled to research similar cases. I borrowed articles from medical journals from other parents\u2014a sort of underground press (samizdat of medical literature). It\u2019s so much easier now, with my laptop. \n \n KB: Building on your answer to my first question a little bit, in Chapter Six of your book, you quote the following from American Philosopher Eva Kittay from a 2008 conference at Stony Brook University: \u201cthere is so\u00a0 much \u00a0to being human. There\u2019s the touch, there\u2019s the feel, there\u2019s the hug, there\u2019s the smile \u2026 there are so many ways of interacting. I don\u2019t think you need philosophy for this. You need a\u00a0 very good writer .\u201d \n \n The quotation from Kittay refers to the experience of parenting a child with a severe disability, and to the difficult to capture uniqueness and beauty of that relationship. In your own book, you do a great job of fleshing out that same dynamic, and showing us what the dual parent/caregiver role can be. My question is: How well, in your experience, do we represent that caregiver/parent role in the media (print, television, film, etc.)? Have any representations of caregiving and disability that you\u2019ve seen been accurate to your experience?\u00a0 \n \n In your book, you make clear that we simply do not, societally, take caregiving (and support thereof) seriously enough\u2014would better/more representation of these roles in popular media help us take the issue more seriously? \n \n Donna Thomson:\u00a0 I do think that we need a more compelling and more accurate narrative in the media. Dr. Pamela Cushing, a professor of cultural anthropology and disability at the University of Western Ontario, is someone I spoke with recently about the void of caregiving stories in our society. I wonder if we need a very creative advertising agency to design a campaign! Certainly, there are many narratives out there that misrepresent us and our loved ones\u2014stories that depict us as \u2018saints\u2019 and our children with disabilities as \u2018heroes,\u2019 for example. These representations just aren\u2019t true, and they serve to perpetuate a rarefied view of our families that is ultimately exclusionary. The way that people give and receive care in their families is as individual as the colour of their eyes. There have been sensitive portrayals of family caregiving in film, although my sense is that the best ones are not products of North America. Generally, I don\u2019t think the subject of dependency is prime-time material in our country. That said, Sarah Polley\u2019s film\u00a0 Away from Her \u00a0struck me as a nuanced and truthful portrayal of the effects of dementia on a married couple, so of course there are exceptions. \n \n KB: One point made at your talk that really stuck with me was that as the population of our country ages, elder care is soon to be a much bigger issue than many people are ready to admit or think about. Are there other essential truths about care and caregiving that you wish more people knew? Are there some common misconceptions you\u2019ve faced that you wish were easier to clear up? \n \n Donna Thomson: \u00a0I wish people knew that much of what makes most of us happy can be found in dependency relationships. Looking after people we love and receiving care are occupations rich in opportunity for intimacy, laughter, sweetness, and relaxation. That said, caring and being cared for is often a struggle. \n \nDavid Brooks, in a recent\u00a0 OpEd piece \u00a0in the\u00a0 NY Times \u00a0wrote, \n \n \n\u201cPeople shoot for happiness, but feel formed through suffering. Recovering from suffering is not like recovering from a disease. Many people don\u2019t come out healed; they come out different. They crash through the logic of individual utility and behave paradoxically. Instead of recoiling from the sorts of loving commitments that almost always involve suffering, they throw themselves more deeply into them. Even while experiencing the worst and most lacerating consequences, some people double down on vulnerability. They hurl themselves deeper and gratefully into their art, loved ones and commitments.\u201d \n \n \nMost people seek meaning in their lives. They seek intimacy. They want to be known and loved. All these aspects of life satisfaction are byproducts of caring and receiving care. \n \n \n \n* As one of the attendees at the official launch pointed out, eldercare will eventually have a bearing on everyone. Even if a layperson does not understand why it is important to provide care for people with disabilities, few people will ever deny that providing care for their aging parents is a priority for them. As the attendee in question so aptly phrased it: \u201cIf someone tries to tell me that they don\u2019t like their taxes going to caregiving, I ask them which health service they would cut from their mother\u2019s care first. That shuts them up pretty quick.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://town-crier.ca/the-writing-life/an-interview-with-donna-thomson-author-of-the-four-walls-of-my-freedom/", "http://town-crier.ca/the-writing-life/an-interview-with-donna-thomson-author-of-the-four-walls-of-my-freedom/", "http://www.houseofanansi.com/", "http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/philosophy/people/faculty_pages/kittay.html", "http://town-crier.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/kittay_laudatio.jpg", "http://thehockeyambassador.blogspot.ca/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen", "http://books.google.ca/books/about/A_difference_in_the_family.html?id=8bRa2I-mJGkC&redir_esc=y", "http://town-crier.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Donna-Thomson-with-son-Nicolas-April-2012.jpg", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491747/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/opinion/brooks-what-suffering-does.html?smid=fb-share&_r=4"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/06/an-interview-with-me-about-caregiving.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThis summer, I'm participating in a blog hop. \u00a0The first topic of discussion is 'My Connection to Disability'. \n \nIt was 1972 and I was seventeen. \u00a0I remember it was hot and humid on the day that the loudspeaker crackled to life and called my name, telling me to go to the office immediately. \u00a0I remember feeling a bit special. \u00a0I recall my heart beating a little faster with a sense that life had picked me out for something out of the ordinary on this dreary day at school. \u00a0The sun streamed through the principal's window. \u00a0A bluebottle buzzed against the glass. \u00a0\"Your father has had a stroke. \u00a0He's in the hospital.\" \u00a0I don't remember what happened after that, except that I knew I'd made a big mistake wishing so hard for something large, romantic and possibly catastrophic to happen in my small town life. \n \nMy Dad suffered two more strokes before he passed away in 1975. \u00a0I didn't know then that our son would be born in 1988 with severe cerebral palsy. \u00a0I've often reflected on how witnessing my Dad losing his speech and his mobility would give me the first rudimentary tools to give care as a mother and powerful advocate for our son. \u00a0From my Dad, I learned to listen more carefully. \u00a0I caught a glimpse of loving someone wholeheartedly by finding moments that could build bridges across abilities.  \n \nFor most of our son Nicholas\u2019 life, I looked after him myself. But now that he has full-time care in a home away from us, I have the opportunity to reflect on our family experience and what it may mean to the rest of society. It's the big questions that interest me. For example, I wonder if, when presented with a tax bill that includes some of the costs of my son\u2019s care, a taxpayer in another province will ask \u201cWhy should I care? Why should I pay?\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \nTo that taxpayer, I want to answer that to give and receive care is good for all of society. It is a life-enhancing activity. And I want to explore the wider consequences of saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care and I won\u2019t pay\u201d. \n \nReflecting on my personal experience has prompted me to ask myself, \u201cWhat do I want my family to be? What do I want my community and my country to be? What is the relationship between someone who is not perceived as contributing to the economy and the state? \u00a0If an ethic of independence is not a worthy aspiration, what is? \u00a0How can we shift attitudes towards dependency for the benefit of seniors, people with disabilities and their families?\u201d \n \nThese questions do not only relate to disability \u2013 they relate to mothers and children, the chronically unemployed, the aged AND people with disabilities. They relate to anyone in the community who is vulnerable to social exclusion and in need of extra help from someone else to thrive. \u00a0These questions probe the heart of who we are and how we care for each other in families. \u00a0As Roslyn Carter said, \"There are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need caregivers.\" \u00a0This is a discussion that impacts everyone. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VbTrQ7SVOZw/U6guiXjJB7I/AAAAAAAABc0/NJ8V2p-NcJ0/s1600/nickpartybest.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/06/blog-challenge-week-one-my-connection.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nAfter my Dad passed away in 1975 following his third stroke, I was angry. \u00a0Really, really angry. \u00a0I would sit in church, look at Christ on the cross and fume, \"why does everyone go on and on about YOUR suffering?! \u00a0That was NOTHING compared to what my Dad endured!\" \u00a0All these years later, the anger has waned, but I still haven't come to terms with what happened back then. \u00a0My father was too young. \u00a0He was from a generation that abhorred dependency, so he suffered great humiliation. \u00a0I felt somehow abandoned by 'the rock' of our family, so I floundered personally. \u00a0The wounds are scarred over, but they're still there. \n \n \n \n \nNick's disability is different. \u00a0The first of my two gorgeous children, he was born with cerebral palsy in 1988. \u00a0In my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom , I wrote about receiving Nick's diagnosis this way: \n \n \n The white haired doctor\nstooped to look closely at Nicholas and asked \u201cHas anyone spoken to you about\nyour son\u2019s development?\u201d \u00a0  \u201cNo\u201d, I\nanswered, \u201cHe is small because he was a bit premature at 33 weeks. \u00a0  Someone crashed into the back of my car at 26\nweeks and they think that\u2019s why he was born early\u201d. \u00a0  Only later I learned that \u201cdevelopment\u201d meant\ncerebral palsy or mental retardation.  \n \n \n \n Three months later,\nNicholas was admitted to hospital so that tests could be performed. \u00a0  The doctor asked me if I would like to hear\nthe results. \u00a0  I nodded. She closed the\nward playroom door for privacy. \u00a0  We were\nalone. \u00a0  She in her lab coat was sitting\nin a sturdy mother\u2019s wooden rocker.  \u00a0 I was\nsqueezed into a plastic child\u2019s chair. \u00a0\n Around us lay discarded toys and empty chunky bright tables and chairs,\nall toddler sized. Tears glistened on the doctor\u2019s cheeks as she told me my\nbaby was severely disabled. \u00a0  \u201cNever be\nnormal\u201d are the words I remember. \u00a0  I also\nremember \u201cgeneralized cerebral atrophy\u201d. \u00a0\n Pea brain, I wondered? \u00a0\n \u201cOesophageal reflux\u201d, she said, \u201cNothing to keep food down where it\nbelongs. \u00a0  Common in cerebral palsy. \u00a0  Pain similar to heart attack\u201d. \u00a0\u00a0  There were blue stripes on her blouse. \u00a0  I looked down and something red caught my\neye. \u00a0  Blood was oozing from the edge of\nmy thumbnail where I had bitten it. \u201cWell, I\u2019m in the right place\u201d, I thought.  \n \n I stood up and felt a lightness, a sense of relief and purpose. \u00a0  \u201cNow I will be able to feed my child\u201d, I\nthought. \u201cI will become an expert; I will apply myself to becoming a great\nmother, and my baby will grow into someone perfectly perfect.\u201d \u00a0  Passing the desk, I noticed the nurses half\nturned, whispering, their pitying eyes fixed on us. \u00a0  I scooped up Nicholas, deposited him into a\npram and paraded up and down the hospital halls, back straight, eyes fixed\nstraight ahead. But I was not alright. \u00a0  I\nwrote in our baby book: \u201cFebruary 22-25, 1989 Nick admitted to hospital. \u00a0  Cat scan, PH probe and digestive barium xrays \u00a0  All abnormal \u2013 we trying (sic) to absorb this\nterrible news.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n I remember hearing a radio\nnews report a long time ago about a terrible road accident in rural\nEngland. \u00a0  A young family \u2013 parents and\nthree children - had all perished. \u00a0  The\ngrandfather\u2019s public response was \u201cI don\u2019t understand \u2013 we brought them up so\ncarefully so nothing like this would ever happen\u201d. \u00a0  I felt like this grandfather - the experience\nof falling victim to random tragedy and a serious derailment of one\u2019s life\nplans caused such profound shock and questioning of all I believed was solid\nand true. \n \n Now Nick is 25 and living a rich, busy and engaged life with full-time care in a home away from ours. To me, his disability is as normal for him as being able-bodied is to me. \u00a0That said, his disability  did  derail all my life plans. \u00a0But, you know what? \u00a0I'm OK with it - I'm happy with the way my life has turned out. \u00a0Perhaps I wouldn't be writing those words if Nick was ill or in pain, but he's not. \u00a0Just a disability by itself can't hurt us. \n \n My Mom doesn't have a disability per se, but she is getting wobbly on her feet, she's getting very, very tired and she has trouble mustering up the energy to do things for herself. \u00a0When I think of my mother, I think \"well, it's natural... all this getting old and needing help. \u00a0It's part of nature.\" \u00a0 \n \nDad's disability didn't feel right or natural and neither did Nick's at certain points of his life. \u00a0But in my mind, their disabilities are beginning to melt into my Mom's 'natural way' of needing help as she ages into infirmity. \u00a0Maybe the cooling embers of my youthful fire of 'unfairness' are due to my own aging. \u00a0I'm 59 years old and this morning, I noticed my back is a little sore and my knees quite stiff. \u00a0I shrug and pour myself a coffee.\u00a0 \n \n This blog post was the second in this  Summer Blog Challenge  - the results will be turned into an e-book. \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3KTIDyXVkQc/U61mv0D5ciI/AAAAAAAABdI/3_is3kjSuaE/s1600/DadMe.jpg", "http://www.meriahnichols.com/summer-blog-hop-series-challenge/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/06/coming-to-terms-with-disability-in-my.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nAfter twenty-five years of intensive caregiving, the most important thing I've learned is that giving good care over time requires a team. \u00a0Trying to manage alone and without the help of others inevitably leads to exhaustion, depression, ill health and even family breakdown. \u00a0But with a coordinated 'network of support', it is possible to locate the possibility of a 'good life', even with disability or chronic illness in the family. \u00a0A support team can be large or small - it can be comprised of both medical professionals, family members and best friends. \u00a0But without a tool to coordinate communication, even people with the best of intentions will be frustrated in their efforts to help. \n \n Tyze Personal Networks \u00a0uses social networking technology to oil the wheels of small, real-world networks of support, which can include paid staff alongside family and friends. \u00a0I've long been a huge fan of Tyze and how it can transform the caregiving experience from desperate to doable. \u00a0In our family, we use Tyze to coordinate our son Nicholas' care and we have a Tyze site for my Mom, too.\u00a0 \n \n So, what does  Tyze  do?\u00a0 Tyze is a  FREE  online social media platform that is completely private - it even has a vault to securely store sensitive medical documents. \u00a0Watch this video to get a closeup look at what Tyze can do! \n \n \n \n\u00a0 The most unique aspect of Tyze is that it bridges formal supports (doctors, therapists) with informal supports (family, close friends). \u00a0On our son Nicholas' Tyze site, we organize his schedule of appointments and ensure that they don't conflict with important sports events in his life. \u00a0His GP can correspond with his nurses or me about side effects of a new anti-seizure medication. \u00a0When Jim and I took a holiday to the Bahamas a few months ago, we checked Tyze every day to for a glimpse into Nick's medical profile as well as his leisure activities. \u00a0Last year, Nick posted his Christmas wish-list on Tyze and family or friends 'claimed' gifts to ensure that no duplicate presents were purchased. \u00a0We use Tyze as a tool to coordinate medical care, but many other Tyze users employ it to help their vulnerable relative to be more involved in their community, either through social clubs, churches or informal visits. \u00a0Therapeutic goals can be monitored, tasks assigned, schedules made and information shared with loved ones and professionals alike. \u00a0 Tyze  is a Godsend for anyone giving or receiving care and that's a fact. \n \n THE FOUR WALLS OF MY FREEDOM: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving (House of Anansi Press, 2014) is available everywhere in Canada and will be released on August 12th in the USA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jm8_6u-Oei8/U8McUw7RaZI/AAAAAAAABeg/fBlQ1gZ0EyY/s1600/BookcoverAnansi.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/07/my-best-caregiving-tip.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nI\u2019m on a plane now, reading over the notes I\u2019ve made from\nthe last four days. \u00a0  I\u2019ve just come from\na week of listening, sharing and thinking about how society can be shaped and\nshifted to support family caregivers.  \u00a0 I\nwas thinking too, about how care is at the heart of social change.  \n \n \n \n The SIX (Social Innovation Exchange) Vancouver Summer School \nbrought together social innovators from across the globe. \u00a0  The place of care in social change was a\ntheme that ran through every discussion and workshop and we were nudged to\nthink about care through the cultural lens of Canada\u2019s First Nations.  \n \n \n \nDay One began at the  Musqueam Community Centre  where a\nnative woman welcomed us at the doorstep by sweeping our bodies with a cedar\nbranch. \u00a0  A Musqueam choral group in\ngorgeous, traditional regalia sang us into the meeting room as the blowing tall\ngrass framed the sea outside the windows. \u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat had this to do with caregiving? \u00a0  I listened as our Musqueam hostess told us\nabout finding herself through her culture. \u00a0\n Learning a forgotten language and studying the cultural traditions of\nelders had given meaning and personal power to her life. \u00a0  \u201cLanguage is culture\u201d, she said. \u00a0  I asked myself, \u201cDo we caregivers have a\nlanguage that gives us meaning and power? \u00a0\n Have we forgotten our language? \u00a0\n Did we ever have one, or do we need to invent one?\u201d \u00a0  I reflected on how difficult it is to find\nthe words for asking for help or offering it. \u00a0\n \n \n \n \n Frances Westley  in conversation with  Vickie Cammack  began\nthe day. \u00a0  Frances is unique amongst\nrespected academics in that she has two feet in the real world. \u00a0  \u201c Getting to Maybe \u201d, her book on the dynamics\nof social change is as easy to read as it is profound and full of\npossibility. \u00a0\u00a0  But Frances is also a\ncaregiver. \u00a0  Her adult daughter suffers\nfrom a serious mental illness, so Frances looks after her four year old granddaughter. \u00a0  Her personal experience permeates her work. \n \n \n \nFrances began by inviting us to consider silently where we\nstood on a happiness scale of one to ten at that very moment.  \u00a0 \u201cThis exercise can give you a sense of what\nyou improve in your life\u2026 in your day. \u00a0\n Examine both the positive and the negative\u201d, she said. \u00a0  \u201cIt gives you an idea of what can be\nchanged.\u201d  \u00a0\u00a0 I vowed to share this idea\nwith caregivers and to practice checking in with myself regularly. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nFrances reflected on the pressures of our contemporary world\n\u2013 what pulls us away from being present in caregiving and being aware of our\nown true selves. \u00a0  She described being pulled\nbetween connecting (networking such as caregiving, chatting or emailing) and\ndoing (working such as tasks at home or producing a report at the office). \u00a0  Connecting with people is the great time\nconsumer, but we tell ourselves it is not \u2018real work\u2019. \u00a0  Our sense of what constitutes worthy labor is\nfrom a bygone era, Frances lamented. \u00a0  And\nso, we experience a sense of unrest and anxiety. \u00a0  We try to squeeze in caring for the people we\nlove between times when we are actually \u2018working\u2019. \u00a0\u00a0  \u201cAnd yet\u201d, Frances said, \u201ccaring for each\nother IS our real life. \u00a0 Shouldn't work \u00a0be\nfor the sake of THAT?\u201d \n \n \n \nVickie asked Frances about the role of resilience and vulnerability in igniting social change. \u00a0\n Frances began with resilience; \u201cI have observed that resilient people\nhave usually experienced some form of isolation and they\u2019ve figured out how to\novercome it. \u00a0  They\u2019ve cracked the\ncode. \u00a0  Then, they\u2019ve been able to figure\nout how to facilitate collaboration.\u201d \u00a0  I\nthought about the successful and strong caregivers I know and how they fit that\ndescription perfectly. \n \n \n \nVickie reminded us that both vulnerability and resilience\nwere necessary ingredients of innovation. \u00a0\n I wondered whether vulnerability was the opposite of resilience, but my\nquestion was answered when Frances stated that they\u2019re not. \u00a0  She described how vulnerability is only\nnegative if there is no engagement. \u00a0  If\nboth or all parties recognize their own and each others\u2019 vulnerability,\npositive change can occur. \u00a0  She described\na phenomenon called \u2018catastrophic de-humanisation\u2019; a relationship of true\nexclusion where one party fails to recognize the value of the other. \u00a0  \u201cAnd this is getting worse in our society\u201d,\nshe said. \u00a0  \u201cWe are so busy that we feel\nhollow. \u00a0  We don\u2019t feel connected to\nourselves, much less to other people. \u00a0  We\nare afraid to stop because we\u2019re afraid to be confronted by our own \u2018desert\nspaces\u2019. \u00a0  Our fear of the other actually\ngoes up. \u00a0  So, we become more afraid of\nthe vulnerability outside of ourselves and we become isolated.\u201d I began to\nrealize that because care is not valued, those involved in care relationships\nare often catastrophically dehumanized by members of society who are\ndistracted, fearful and hollow. \u00a0  Frances\nsummed her message up this way: \u201cWhatever challenge comes into our life (something\nthat provokes fear of the unknown)  SIT\nWITH IT  for a while. \u00a0  Admit the\nvulnerability in yourself and in other people, too. \u00a0  That\u2019s the way we can see that we all want\nsimilar things. \u00a0  Because, cynicism will\nbe the response if you don\u2019t recognize the vulnerability in yourself and in\nothers, and cynicism is the enemy of change.\u201d \n \n \n \nMy colleague and mentor  Al Etmanski  inspired in an afternoon\nsession titled \u201cThe Sacred Headwaters of Social Innovation.\u201d \u00a0 (Keep an eye out for Al's new book coming out soon!)\u00a0 Al is a disability Dad who co-founded  PlannedLifetime Advocacy Networks  in Vancouver, a model of support for caregivers and\ntheir vulnerable children that has been replicated around the world. \u00a0  Love and necessity are at the headwaters of\ninnovation, said Al. \u00a0  People invent\nsolutions to their problems because someone or something they love is\nstruggling or in pain. \u00a0  But they can\u2019t do\nit alone. \u00a0  The disruptive innovator may\nbe the person with the original idea for change who shouts loudly about it and\nattracts attention to the idea. \u00a0\u00a0\n Bridging innovators support, identify allies and sometimes give\nmoney. \u00a0  Receptive innovators work the\nsystems within agencies and governments to push a good idea forward. \u00a0  That\u2019s the changemaker team that helped Al\npush through the  Registered Disability Savings Plan  \u2013 a Canadian innovation that\nprovides a tool for creating personal wealth to families raising children with\ndisabilities. \u00a0\u00a0  The headwaters of change\nare pure love and pure necessity. \u00a0  It\u2019s\nup to us to ensure that the waters remain true to their origins as they flow\ndownstream and into everyone\u2019s water supply. \u00a0\n We must protect the intentions of our fragile models of change for\nvulnerable families and we must ensure that love is always the navigator. \u00a0  This is why, says Al, that care is always the\nimpetus and the guide for social innovation. \n \n \n \nIn my next post, I\u2019ll tell you about love, power and\nlearning at the SIX Summer School. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.socialinnovationexchange.org/global/six-summer-school-2014-vancouver", "http://www.musqueam.bc.ca/gallery/community-centre", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fra-FaB1rjQ/U4tT3ijHQmI/AAAAAAAABaQ/_8RzN33WQS0/s1600/musqueam.jpeg", "http://sig.uwaterloo.ca/profile/frances-westley", "http://tyze.com/about/our-team/vickie-cammack/", "http://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Maybe-How-World-Changed/dp/067931444X", "http://www.sigeneration.ca/about-us/people/sig-people-3/", "http://www.plan.ca/", "http://rdsp.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/06/innovating-for-caregivers-at-six.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nThere is a secret club amongst caregivers. \u00a0Sometimes the experience of caregiving is so extreme, painful, dangerous and exhausting that it cannot easily be described to 'normal' friends and family. \u00a0And when that extreme experience constitutes family life over time.... years, even.... that is when caregivers become secretive. \u00a0They give up on explaining their lives.  \n \nAuthor, father and caregiver Eric Fischer has written a book of poetry about this secret club titled \" I am a Broken Man, You Can't Break Me .\" \u00a0I was a on plane when I read Fischer's book. \u00a0I was forced to rummage around for a pen - I needed to star and underline passages that shot like a needle into my heart. \u00a0Take this, for example, from Fischer's introduction: \n \n \"The (caregiving) journeys take varied paths but all delve into a brutal spring of short and troubled, yet exquisite existence. \u00a0Some of whom inspire me are parents to extremely disabled children fraught with complex medical issues. \u00a0Others, adults, who have had to live vicariously abbreviated moments knowing their confrontation with mortality was at hand. \u00a0All have honed my belief that through sharing our innermost fears, exposing our weaknesses and delving into this role as caregiver, on the deepest level, our spirits are strengthened.\" \n \nOr this from this piece of fearless short prose called \"Valor\" - \n \n How can I feel, after all these years of selfless caring for destitute son, that he is now an apparition I have been chasing? \u00a0 \n Trying to convince others of his existence; that they should care as I do. \u00a0Where is he if not only in my mind? \u00a0...... \n And, I keep my hair neatly cropped for fear of appearing disheveled, controlling more so those things since control is awash in fear. \u00a0How I long for that fine lather of contentment, not brought out of necessity but rather from a lack of necessity.\u00a0 \n \nAnd the poetry is beautiful too.  \n \n Cohorts on this path of love; \n Rewarded \n Slowly \n Graciously \n \nAnd finally, I have to share this poem. \u00a0This is the one that really got me. \n \n A Kiss \n \n I kiss his hand. \u00a0It is damp as he flickers in and out of troubled consciousness. \n Do you understand? \u00a0I'm here, watching him, watching over him. \n He seems everywhere, in everything and yet I must keep\u00a0 \n him contained, in this tiny little life where anything is \n everything. \n \nPlease  buy this book  for yourself, or for someone you know who shares this secret life of extreme caregiving. \n I AM A BROKEN MAN \n YOU CAN'T BREAK ME  - Collected Works of Poetry 1995-2014 \nby Eric Fischer \nAn Anthology of Poems on Extreme Disability, End of Life and Caregiving \n \nEric Fischer blogs at\u00a0http://iamabrokenmanyoucantbreakme.blogspot.ca/ \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q6hfIMdqyF8/U4Hc4xiEwlI/AAAAAAAABZw/36H8Ymke70M/s1600/Brokenman.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/broken-man-you-cant-break/dp/1495425835/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401019397&sr=1-1&keywords=i+am+a+broken+man+you+can%27t+break+me", "http://www.amazon.com/broken-man-you-cant-break/dp/1495425835/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401019397&sr=1-1&keywords=i+am+a+broken+man+you+can%27t+break+me", "http://www.amazon.com/broken-man-you-cant-break/dp/1495425835/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401019397&sr=1-1&keywords=i+am+a+broken+man+you+can%27t+break+me", "http://www.amazon.com/broken-man-you-cant-break/dp/1495425835/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401019397&sr=1-1&keywords=i+am+a+broken+man+you+can%27t+break+me"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/05/for-secret-club-of-extreme-caregivers.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n\"Experimenting with Enemies and Strangers\" was the provocative title of a workshop I attended as part of the  SIX Social Innovation Exchange Summer School  in Vancouver last week. \u00a0Three seasoned  'change lab'  leaders took the stage to tell us about how they had been faced with a particularly difficult social problem and what techniques they'd used to solve it. \u00a0 Caregivers  suffer from a lack of support from all sectors of society, so I was especially interested in how change labs could assist us. \n \nThe model of  'change lab' or 'solutions lab'  is one that I believe has great promise for caregivers and our vulnerable loved ones. \u00a0How to support adults with disabilities in times of austerity, for example is one intractable social nut that  Joeri van den Steenhoven , Director of the  MARS Solutions Lab \u00a0in Toronto is trying to crack. \u00a0I am participating in one of Joeri's labs - we are grappling with finding solutions for supporting adults with developmental disabilities in Ontario. \u00a0It is a fascinating process and one which began with us brainstorming about hidden assets in families, communities, government and the private sector.  \n \nBack at the SIX Conference, Adam Kahane described trying to bring warring factions together to create peaceful communities in Columbia. \u00a0Kahane writes about shape shifting difficult social problems in his inspiring book, \" Power and Love: A Theory and Practice of Social Change .\" \u00a0He writes,  \"A character in RENT, Jonathan Larson's Broadway musical about struggling artists and musicians in New York City, says, \"The opposite of war isn't peace, it's creation!\" \u00a0To address our toughest social challenges, we need a way that is neither war nor peace, but collective creation. \u00a0How can we co-create new social realities?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n Jesper Christiansen of Mindlab  in Copenhagen joined his co-presenters in reminding us that to overturn embedded and unhelpful systems in society, we need to begin with not only friends, but also strangers and enemies. \u00a0The change lab model brings together a group, each of whom fall into one of these camps. \u00a0Participants begin their difficult task of dreaming up new ways of achieving a shared goal - from ending knife violence in a social housing project to assisting people with mental illness find affordable, supportive housing. \u00a0Once a few possible new ideas are co-created, trials in the community can begin. \u00a0The good ideas that stick may then be scaled up to other communities where needed.  \n \nLater, we engaged in some real life problem solving ourselves. \u00a0Around a table, a colleague from the UK described her work with a charity aimed at creating better lives for people with developmental disabilities experiencing poverty and social isolation. \u00a0 Our colleague explained, \"We're a charity that's been brought in to see if we can work creatively with a community the national government has named  'troubled families' . \u00a0We have a time limited contract to create a template for change that can be adopted by all the government funded service providers in our city. \u00a0But I'm afraid that for lots of complicated reasons, we'll do our work and go away, but nothing will change in a lasting way.\" \u00a0 We heard that this is a community with a thriving daycare, run by local people, but enjoys little else in the way of hope or growth. \u00a0Fear, paranoia and unemployment seemed to be the daily realities of this very disadvantaged pocket of England.  \n \nAs our presenting colleague turned her chair away from us (to better listen, but not engage with our problem solving process), we began to reflect on what lasting good could be forged from the charity project. \u00a0We began to focus on the town's thriving daycare operation. \u00a0Eventually our colleague turned back to us and shaking her head, declared, \"As I was listening to you discuss my conundrum, I realized that the answers are within our community. \u00a0I knew this, but perhaps I had forgotten. \u00a0Perhaps I was just very focussed on trying to locate the levers for change through our charity. \u00a0We'll begin with the community assets and those lie in our daycare.\" \u00a0It was what most people would call an 'aha' moment. \u00a0I reflected on how this technique resembled a mini-solutions lab. \u00a0Perhaps this could be a way to solve problems in my community and even in my family.  \n \nLater in the day, we gathered in a large banquet hall. \u00a0Adam Kahane stood up to reflect on the conference proceedings through the lens of 'love and power'. \u00a0Kahane defines love as the drive toward self-realization and power as the drive towards unity. \u00a0As I reflected again on this idea,  David Diamond of Theatre for Living  persuaded us to 'make a statue out of our body to represent what we had learned from the conference'. \u00a0My body image was of a torch, the image of power in Kahane's book illustrations. \u00a0I decided that caregivers have love to spare, but we need power - power in our language, in our posturing, and most of all, in our families and communities.  \n \n \n \n \nWhat did I learn for caregivers from leaders in international social innovation? \u00a0I learned that we must forge a movement to place power in the language of caregiving. \u00a0As I said in my last post, 'language is culture' and a culture that is silenced is no culture at all. \u00a0So, in my next post, I'll introduce the beginnings of a new language of power and caregiving. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.socialinnovationexchange.org/global/six-summer-school-2014-vancouver", "http://www.sig.uwaterloo.ca/highlight/what-is-a-change-labdesign-lab", "http://www.sig.uwaterloo.ca/highlight/what-is-a-change-labdesign-lab", "http://www.marsdd.com/bio/joeri-van-den-steenhoven/", "http://www.marsdd.com/systems-change/mars-solutions-lab/", "http://www.amazon.ca/Power-Love-Theory-Practice-Social/dp/1605093041", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nSxdqOluErg/U470GkYr-5I/AAAAAAAABak/WN-nKlTfMjs/s1600/changelab.jpg", "http://www.mind-lab.dk/en/about_mindlab/team/jesper-christiansen", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Families", "http://www.headlinestheatre.com/staff.htm", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i_TcOyxHGak/U470fWJFkDI/AAAAAAAABas/yu05o9DsSrs/s1600/lovepower.jpeg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/06/innovating-for-caregivers-at-six-summer.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nRecently, a friend and colleague railed at our collective lack of empathy for homeless people living on the street. \u00a0\"What kind of a society do we live in where we step over another human being lying on the sidewalk?\" she demanded. \u00a0 I visualised myself on the street, seeing a human shape huddled under a blanket in a doorway. \u00a0Then, I see myself turning away and hurrying by, afraid to speak.  \n \n\"What stops me from making eye contact or from speaking to a homeless person?\" I wondered as I shifted in my chair. \u00a0\"Alright\", I thought, \"If I did stop and say hello, what exactly would I say? \u00a0Excuse me, Sir... or.... May I help you? (do they look as if they need 'help'?) or.... Would you like something to eat? \u00a0(I don't want to accompany this person to a restaurant, I'm on my way to an appointment!) Oh, forget it. \u00a0I don't know what to say.\" \u00a0So, in my mind, I keep walking. \n \nI've been thinking a lot about the language of giving and receiving care. \u00a0It's so difficult - have we forgotten it? \u00a0Did we ever have it, or do we need to invent a new language of expressing need and gratitude?  \n \n \n \n \nI've begun to think about the purpose of our language in caregiving. \u00a0So much talk is given to helping our loved ones be more 'independent'. \u00a0But is that what they (or we) really want? \u00a0One thing I know is that independence is not what it's cracked up to be. \u00a0Independence is a cruel fiction for many of our loved ones and even for those who are more able, it's just an idea that equates to loneliness. \u00a0'Interdependence' is a much better guide post for our actions and policies to support both caregivers and their charges, but that word hasn't caught on as many of us had hoped. \n \nI think it's dignity that must drive our search for the language of care and most often, dignity can be equated to contribution. \u00a0Everyone wants to feel useful and to have the opportunity for being empowered to act, even if their physical or mental capacities are very diminished. \u00a0So perhaps, it's 'enabled autonomy' that we strive for in our caring relationships. \u00a0Let it be so for the purpose of this line of thinking. \n \nIf we want to help someone be autonomous (even if they need assistance to get through much of the day), what are some ways of offering help? \u00a0Perhaps the first way is to be silent and observe closely. \u00a0Is your loved one struggling to do something? \u00a0Is that the moment to ask, \"Want some help with that?\" \u00a0Next time that task comes up, does it seem appropriate to mention, \"I saw in a magazine recently these really nice sweaters with zippers instead of buttons. \u00a0I'll pick one up for you to try, but in the meantime, I could help with these buttons - they are so annoyingly tiny!\" \n \nFacilitating people to be autonomous with dignity is time consuming work of the human heart. \u00a0Caregivers know perfectly well that it's much quicker and easier to just do the task for the person while prattling on about a different topic in order to distract 'the patient'. \u00a0And there may be times when that is necessary, but can't we be honest about it? \u00a0Our loved ones deserve the dignity of an honest exchange during their care activities.  \n \nOffering assistance when it's unwelcome can be tricky. \u00a0Sometimes, \"I'm here if you'd like a hand with that\" can result in watching in painful silence while a loved one tries and fails to manage eating a bowl of soup from a spoon held in a trembling hand. \u00a0If inserting dignity into the situation, rather than dealing with the mess (or eating the soup) is the objective, perhaps it's not so hard. \u00a0Make the soup texture the common enemy - \"look at how they make the soup so runny these days! \u00a0It's probably a cost cutting measure. \u00a0Let's see what's in the fridge - maybe we can use that soup as a base for stew. \u00a0Mashed potatoes here we come!\" \u00a0Because dignity is the objective and enabled autonomy is the means to the end, the words come out in ways that are conspiratorial, empathetic, light-hearted and conversational. \n \nBut, what of asking for help? \u00a0Should we expect our charge to be aware of preserving dignity in herself as well as her caregiver? \u00a0I believe we should. \u00a0Take the case of our son. \u00a0He has very severe cerebral palsy, but that hasn't stopped him exercising terrible manners over the years. \u00a0A disability is no excuse for rude or self-centred behavior in our house. \u00a0So, when I walk into his room in the morning and it's Mother's Day, for example, I might hear a demand to change the channel on television. \u00a0I want to correct, but not demean, so Nick will laugh as he tells people that my response will be \"Nick, I'm going to walk out of your room and walk in again. \u00a0We're going to say good morning properly next time so repeat after me, 'Good morning, Mom! You look especially fantastic today!' (I jazz up the compliments so we can both laugh, but he gets the point of the exercise.) \u00a0And for those who aren't aware, Nicholas is non-speaking. \u00a0But his language comprehension is near-perfect and if he manages to blow me a kiss the second time around entering his room, I take that as a respectful morning greeting.  \n \nI still don't know how to begin a conversation with a homeless person I've never met. \u00a0I don't know how I would end that conversation, if I ever did manage to begin. \u00a0The language of care is very tricky and fraught with emotion. \u00a0But one thing that my gut tells is right: we must begin with love and dignity. \u00a0Perhaps the words will follow. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-N_8pNN5B1y0/U5ckyGkMMAI/AAAAAAAABbI/XuQgLbK6qtw/s1600/a-man-asking-for-help1.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/06/the-language-of-care-have-we-lost-it.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nDo you ever have days when you feel like you are the only person who cares about kindness? \u00a0When you begin to think that maybe EVERYONE else is thinking always and only about their own interests...about their own money, their own home, their own job.... \n \nYesterday was such a day for me. \u00a0First came the fallout in the  news of Toronto city council member Doug Ford's comments  about a suburban group home for young adults with disabilities.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Ford is on record  saying that a group home housing three young adults with developmental disabilities has 'ruined the neighborhood' and that property values have plummeted in the area. \u00a0The Toronto Star reported: \" Some neighbours living near the Etobicoke home told the Star Sunday that they agreed with Ford. \u201cI think they should go,\u201d said Gord Ardron, 69, who claims to hear screaming coming from the house after dark. \u201cI think they should be in a place by themselves.\u201d \n \n Then, yesterday evening, another news story broke...  \"Mother Threatens to Leave Disabled Daughter at Minister's Office.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Linda Murphy of Arnprior, Ontario, packed her bags and hustled her 20 year old daughter Ashley Corbett into the car. \u00a0They drove to Toronto and parked outside the offices of the Provincial Parliament where the distraught mother planned to abandon her daughter. \u00a0After seven years on a waiting list for a group home opening, Mrs. Murphy took drastic action. \u00a0As it happened, a temporary group home space near the family home was located and Murphy took her daughter back to Arnprior.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n There's an election on in Ontario right now, so the politicians all made statements and the public weighed in with their comments on the news stories. \u00a0Some members of the public blamed the current crisis in adult developmental services on the closure of institutions. \u00a0Others blamed inclusive education. \u00a0 \n \n Yesterday, I felt sad and afraid for the future of our society. \u00a0Is this the way we really want to think about our vulnerable brothers, sisters, daughters and sons? \u00a0What about our parents with Alzheimer's or our spouses with multiple sclerosis? \u00a0Do we want to move them off our street, far away 'in a place by themselves'? \u00a0 \n \n So today, I calmed down. \u00a0I began to prepare for a conference in Vancouver where I'm co-presenting on the subject of a caring society. \u00a0Here are a few quotes I typed into my notebook: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \u201cAn ethic of care can be characterized by a set\nof virtues, foremost among these are attentiveness and responsiveness to\nanother\u2019s needs and vulnerabilities.\u00a0\nSuch responsiveness requires a self that sees itself in a relationship\nwith the other.\u00a0 It is a self that can\nattend to the other and make itself permeable to the needs of another through\nan empathetic identification with the other.\u201d \u00a0 Eva Feder Kittay (Beyond Autonomy and Paternalism: The Caring, Transparent Self) \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \u00a0\u201cThe gift that profoundly disabled human\nbeings have received is the gift of being, which is derived from the freedom\nfrom judgment.\u00a0 No entrance tickets are\nneeded, no exams have to be passed\u2026 the gift of being is not an abstraction; it\nis the gift of being what you are.\u201d \n Hans Reinders \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \u201cThose who are looking\nfor a reason to justify caring have not understood that love is a\nself-justifying and all-sufficient ground for certain types of behavior.\u00a0 Those who remain puzzled by love (and even\ncynical about references to it) should there consider whether the contributory\nworth notion of value has blinded them to what is good in itself.\u201d  \n David Pailin\u00a0 \n \n Now, I feel better. \u00a0I spent the afternoon in the sunshine at the park with Nicholas and Jim. \u00a0We laughed and I kissed my young man on his cheek. \u00a0Jim and I held hands. \u00a0I will keep caring for the people I love and I know others will, too. \u00a0Recently, someone asked me to identify a single message I would share with other caregivers. \u00a0I said, \"Tell your stories. \u00a0Talk about your caregiving. \u00a0Tell your neighbors, your co-workers, the members of your extended family and members of your church. \u00a0Tell people about the joys and the challenges of caregiving.\" \u00a0We need to change the world into a place that supports caregivers and the way to do it is through storytelling about love and kindness.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2014/05/18/doug_ford_defends_comments_that_youth_group_home_ruined_community.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bqDY7KPR9s4/U30g58B4JlI/AAAAAAAABZI/Lke38076qlk/s1600/doug_ford.jpg.size.xxlarge.promo.jpg", "http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2014/05/18/doug_ford_defends_comments_that_youth_group_home_ruined_community.html", "http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/news/story/1.2648179", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nF1ue0ybjfw/U30hG-yk7dI/AAAAAAAABZQ/g8e7SmreByA/s1600/linda_murphy.jpg.size.xxlarge.promo.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/05/standing-up-for-love-when-we-feel.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n Mother's Day 2014 got me wondering how we learn to be good caregivers - what lessons about caring did we learn from our own mothers? \u00a0I asked friends and colleagues who are caregivers on social media to tell me what they learned from their Moms and this is what they said: \n \n Susan:\u00a0 Fierceness..is that a word? My mom has always been extraordinarily protective and supportive of us. God forbid anyone harm us or dare lay a hand on us, or say anything malicious. She would turn from a gentle, sweet-humoured lady into an assertive tigress in the blink of an eye. I carry forth that same fierceness, it has done me well in advocating for my handicapped child. I don't give up,I don't accept any sort of maliciousness or injustice. I, too, become assertive in the blink of an eye. I'm 46 and fierce, while my mother has mellowed in her golden years. Well, unless you try to mess with one of her brood!! \n \n Anchel:\u00a0 My mom always handled tough situations with grace. A lot of grace. \n \n Kara:\u00a0 Strength. \n \n Jana-Marie:\u00a0 \u00a0 How to question doctors and nurses and not be afraid to ask anything, as well as good hand washing with health issues. \n \n Amina:\u00a0 Faith, my mom taught me that I can try to control my life and my kids' and plan to avoid anything that can harm them. But I won't always succeed. So when I feel hopeless and everything around me is going wrong I should remember that we are all like leaves in the wind, yet we should have faith that we shall never be blown too far to come back. Miss you so much mama. \n \n Brianne:\u00a0 Always see the good in everyone and be your child's biggest strength, voice and cheerleader. \n \n Kim:\u00a0 My mom was an RN and I witnessed her nurse my sister who had severe asthma...that was the foundation, but the fill was when she had the four of us and took on my cousins for a year...being open and doing your best! \n \n \n \n Julie:\u00a0 My mother was (is) very nurturing...making sure we had warm pajamas, warm feet, clean, cozy, loved. \n \n Marie:\u00a0 Mother's Day is always emotional and painful for me. My mom is on the schizophrenia spectrum. What I learned from her is to question, cite, fact check, cross reference EVERYTHING: even things I think I know. To accept different neurologies as a part of natural diversity. To forgive myself -- I did not cause her schizophrenia, nor did I cause his autism. To sift through hyperbole and hysteria and find facts. All of these often put me at odds with other parents -- in particular other moms. I have been through this type of grieving already, and am on the other side. I appear like a know-it-all, but I am not. I just had a very different mom, and that changed me forever. \n \n \n \n Diana:\u00a0 My Mother told me that there are no guarantees in life. That what comes our way, we have to accept, embrace and do our best. Skip the 'pity parties', everyone in life is dealing with something. She said love unconditionally. She also told me that ever y day to do three good deeds without expecting anything back; that just in doing those things it would make your day go better. It has helped in parenting and in life in general. this was all said before I became a parent \n \n Karen:\u00a0 Suffering builds character. \n \n Tammy:\u00a0 To always look at the positive side. Things could always be worse than they are. \n \n Alison:\u00a0 I think the biggest lessons she taught me was to be patient and live with grace. I just wish that my natural temperament was more in keeping with her lessons because I find both of these things more than a little challenging. I fail often, but I never stop trying (a lesson from my daddy). \n \n Paula:\u00a0 I learned everything from her. For when nana went blind she moved in with us and her sister too. When grampa got sick out went the dinning room table and in came the hospital bed...This is how I learned. \n \n Beth: My mom wasn't afraid to question a teacher or a doctor or whoever was \"in charge.\" In an era when that just wasn't done. She liked to say \"I am the MOM, I am the ultimate authority on this child.\" and that has helped me greatly when I needed to do the same. \n \n Me: \u00a0I loved\u00a0hearing about caregiving lessons passed down from mothers to daughters. \u00a0And so of course, I've been reflecting about the\u00a0lessons my own Mom taught me. \u00a0I've\u00a0written about my Mom before - she's a very\u00a0feisty character. \u00a0For a start, Mom\u00a0always worked outside our home (she couldn't stand housework and coffee parties) - she was an anomaly in our 1950's\u00a0neighbourhood! \u00a0What did I learn from my Mom? \u00a0I learned self-reliance, a deep sense of appreciation, a passion for making wrongs right. \u00a0I learned how to really laugh when life throws curve balls and most of all, I learned how to forcefully put one foot in front of the other to keep going, every day.\u00a0 \n \n We all learn lessons of nurturing and caring from our mothers and today I want to celebrate that legacy. \u00a0Happy Mother's Day, everyone! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z2lzNDUatVM/U2y2eF1ED4I/AAAAAAAABYM/IfirX9cqvDU/s1600/Momandmerose.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/05/what-did-you-learn-about-care-from-your.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Today, a Forbes blog post caught my eye. \u00a0Maybe it was the title:  \"Informal Caregiving? \u00a0Free Caregiving? Seriously?\"  ... or maybe it was because I always enjoy reading what  Howard Gleckman  writes. \u00a0He's the author of a wonderful book called\u00a0 \"Caring For Our Parents\"  and he's a fellow at the  Urban Institute . \u00a0Here's what he said followed by what I said. \n \n In a nice\u00a0 blog post \u00a0the other day, AARP\u2019s Lynn Friss Feinberg reminded me of one of my great pet peeves: The way some so-called experts describe the help family and friends provide loved ones with care needs. Lynn called them out for using the phrase \u201cinformal caregiving,\u201d as if this were merely some sort of casual relationship. You know, something like old pals getting together every couple of weeks for tennis. \n \n The phrase itself acknowledges how\u00a0people misunderstand\u00a0what family caregivers do, or their connection to those they are helping. Can you imagine describing a parent\u2019s care of a child as informal? It would be beyond bizarre. Yet somehow, it is a widely accepted way to label an adult child helping a parent, or a wife assisting her husband. As Lynn asks, \u201cIs there anything casual about an adult daughter helping her father use the toilet?\u201d \n \n In part, the phrase is a clumsy attempt to distinguish between family support and paid aides. But it is\u00a0also reflection of how little some\u00a0value the role family members play in supporting relatives with chronic conditions or disabilities. But language that dismisses family caregiving also helps frame in unhelpful ways the policy debate over how we deliver and pay for long-term supports and services. \n \n \u201cInformal caregiving\u201d isn\u2019t even the worst of these descriptions. That award goes to \u201cfree caregiving.\u201d The implication: There is no cost to the support that child gives to her parent, or a wife provides for her frail husband. \n \n The cost, in fact, is enormous. Anybody who has done it (and both Lynn and I have) knows about the price they pay\u2014physically, emotionally, and financially. \n \n Take just the financial cost. One\u00a0 survey reports \u00a0typical caregivers spend $5,500-a-year out of pocket to assist a family member. \n \n And that is just the tip of the iceberg. A 50-something woman who quits her job to care for a parent will forego more than $300,000 in lifetime income. Not only will she reduce her current wages, but she\u2019ll also give up retirement income by contributing less to her 401(k), losing her employer match, and diminishing her future Social\u00a0 Security \u00a0benefits. \n \n People who talk about \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cinformal\u201d care really mean is that no money changes hands for family care. Nobody is paying for home health aides, assisted living, or a nursing home.\u00a0Specifically, neither government nor private insurance is paying.\u00a0Families just do it and somehow absorb the cost. Lynn and her colleagues\u00a0at AARP\u00a0 estimate\u00a0 that economic value of family caregiving topped $450 bill in 2009. \n \n And that\u2019s why this language really matters. \n \n If family caregiving becomes widely described for what it really is\u2013rewarding for sure, but also very hard\u2013people might demand help. That\u2019s what happened in Japan. \n \n Working women who were also caring for their mothers and mothers-in-law gave their own label to what they were doing: Caregiver hell. That\u2019s a long way from \u201cinformal caregiving.\u201d And\u00a0it had a powerful effect,\u00a0driving\u00a0the government to create a national social insurance program for long-term care. \n \n Here, policymakers live in mortal fear that family caregivers will similarly demand help. If, for instance, everyone eligible for Medicaid benefits took them, the cost of the program would explode. But people don\u2019t, since it often means moving to a nursing home. \n \n Make the program too good and people will use it. They even have a name for the phenomenon: The woodwork effect. Like cockroaches, people will come out of the woodwork to apply for benefits. Offended yet? \n \n \n \n \n \n Similarly, private insurers understand that many families will continue to care for their aging parents without paid help, even if they have long-term care insurance. This phenomenon is so widespread, it is built into rates. Without it, already-high premiums would increase even more. \n \n So, we blithely talk about informal care and free care. Makes it sound so easy.\u00a0As if the issue will just float away. \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom Donna Thomson:\u00a0 \n \nWith respect, there\u2019s a tone to your remarks that I find\u2026 sad. I am a lifelong caregiver \u2013 our son is 25 and has multiple, severe disabilities. I also help to care for my mother who is 92. I am an author, consultant and speaker on caregiving issues. As in the disability community, we in the caregiving community are struggling to identify a vocabulary that accurately reflects both the struggles and the joys of caring for our vulnerable loved ones. I have used the terms unpaid care, family care, informal care, natural care and loving care at various points in my writing and speaking. I don\u2019t think any of these captures the myriad of caregiving experiences that individuals face on a daily basis. But \u2018caregiver hell\u2019 is one term that excludes the powerful reality of the love we feel for our family members who need help getting through the day. This is one descriptor for my job that I will not be using. That is not to say that I am not a strong political activist for due attention to be paid to the needs of those giving care \u2013 I am. But I will always lobby (no matter how I refer to family caregivers) for a broad societal support that includes the help of extended family, friends, neighbors, employers, the medical community and all levels of government. I don\u2019t mean to imply that I have never experienced \u2018caregiving hell\u2019 \u2013 I most certainly have and it was always when I was unsupported by others. But even in the darkest moments, my love for my son never wavered. I talk about the ethics and economics of caregiving on my website www.donnathomson.com and I strongly support secure personal support networks for caregivers (www.tyze.com). You will see throughout my work a strong determination to tell the true stories of the caregiving experience, a call for broad support and a narrative of the love that drives us. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2014/05/14/informal-caregiving-free-caregiving-seriously/?commentId=comment_blogAndPostId/blog/comment/1699-1279-535", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2014/05/14/informal-caregiving-free-caregiving-seriously/#", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2014/05/14/informal-caregiving-free-caregiving-seriously/#comment_reply", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2014/05/14/informal-caregiving-free-caregiving-seriously/", "http://howardgleckman.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Caring-Our-Parents-Inspiring-Solutions/dp/B004JU1SNA", "http://www.urban.org/", "http://blog.aarp.org/2014/05/01/family-caregiving-theres-nothing-informal-about-it/", "http://www.caregiving.org/data/Evercare_NAC_CaregiverCostStudyFINAL20111907.pdf", "http://www.forbes.com/security/", "http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving/info-07-2011/valuing-the-invaluable.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/05/he-said-she-said-is-caregiving-hell.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThis morning, I was scanning caregiving news online and came across an article titled  \"The Grandma Effect: A Little Caregiving Sharpens the Brain - A Lot Dulls It.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 It turns out that scientists in Australia have shown that grandmothers caring for grandchildren one day a week scored excellent results on cognitive tests. \u00a0But another group of grannies who cared for their grandchildren five days per week had much lower scores for cognition, memory and mood. \u00a0It seems that as we age, high levels of caregiving are actually bad for our health.  \n \nThat got me thinking. \u00a0Legions of middle aged North Americans are engaged in caring for very elderly parents, many who suffer from Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. \u00a0Lots of parents of adult children with disabilities are struggling to cope with the effects of their own ageing, as they continue to give high levels of care 24/7 to their dependent offspring.  \n \nSo, what's a mother (or father) to do? \u00a0Well, one place to start is with forging an agreement about the ethics of caregiving and ageing. \u00a0How can we begin to think about what is fair to expect of older people caring for grandchildren, their very elderly parents or their adult children with disabilities? \u00a0The Australian study cited above gives us evidence that too much caregiving in older adults is damaging to cognitive function. \u00a0In my book,  \"The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Lifetime of Caregiving\" , I argue that we should expect from people what nature intended - that is, much higher levels of caregiving in the childbearing years and easing off later on. \u00a0Grandmothers who have raised their own children should not be coerced into giving levels of care that would be expected of younger parents. \u00a0I call this the 'natural trajectory of care' and I argue that programs and services should be accessible to caregivers based on this principle. \u00a0A mother of an adult child with severe disabilities should expect to have a 'retirement' from her caregiving responsibilities. \u00a0There should be a public recognition that it is improper for her at age 80, to change her 55 year old son's soiled briefs.  \n \nOf course, there are many exceptions to every rule and there will be older adults who choose to give high levels of care. \u00a0They will be happy, fully functioning and thriving in that role. \u00a0But if this Australian study has a broad, international application, we can assume that most older people want some caregiving responsibilities, but they want to take a smaller role. \u00a0It's only natural. \n \nThe public expectation that families will 'take care of their own no matter what' should be recognised as dangerous to the health and wellbeing of all concerned. \u00a0Care is better when it is shared. \u00a0Caregivers are better when they are appreciated and supported. \u00a0And certainly, no one should have 'so many children that they don't know what to do.\" \n \n The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Lifetime of Caregiving (The House of Anansi Press) is available now everywhere in Canada and for pre-order in the USA from online booksellers.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rhw0EC1ZO58/U0WYSBZ_HKI/AAAAAAAABWs/1LRyV1y1X0w/s1600/Oldwomanshoe.jpg", "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/04/the-grandma-effect-a-little-caregiving-sharpens-brain-a-lot-dulls-it", "http://www.houseofanansi.com/The-Four-Walls-of-My-Freedom--P2274.aspx"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/04/a-little-care-is-great-too-much-is-toxic.html", "title": ""},

We need to stop the clock in order to listen to our loved ones. \u00a0  That different pace of\nobserving each other closely and patiently is a skill we have honed and one\nthat people in the  Slow Movement  aspire to attain. \u00a0  The Slow Movement advocates a cultural shift\ntoward slowing down the pace of daily life. \u00a0\n One proponent, describes the philosophy this way:  \n \n The only thing for certain is that\neverything changes. The rate of change increases. If you want to hang on you\nbetter speed up. That is the message of today. It could however be useful to\nremind everyone that our basic needs never change. The need to be seen and\nappreciated! It is the need to belong. The need for nearness and care, and for\na little love! This is given only through slowness in human relations. In order\nto master changes, we have to recover slowness, reflection and togetherness.\nThere we will find real renewal. \n \n EvaFeder Kittay  is a philosopher and someone whose work I admire. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nShe is also the mother of Sesha, her daughter\nwho is now 35 and has severe cognitive impairments. Eva\nwrites that to be a good caregiver for someone like Sesha, one must become\ntransparent. \u00a0  She describes the\nwholehearted listening that Sesha commands and the delights that await anyone\nwilling to suspend their ego and their busy agenda in order to commune in that\nhumble and quiet way. \u00a0  Eva told thisstory about an important moment of learning:\u00a0 \n \n \"I had been with Sesha in Central\nPark and I was working on some walking exercises that the folks at Sesha\u2019s\nearly intervention programme had assigned. \u00a0\n I was working terribly hard trying to get Sesha to cooperate and do what\nI was supposed to get her to do. \u00a0  I sat\nher down on her stroller and I sat on a park bench. \u00a0  I realized that I was simply exhausted from\nthe effort. \u00a0  I thought, how on earth am I\ngoing to do this? \u00a0  How can I possibly do\nthis job? \u00a0  When I looked down at Sesha\nand saw her little head pushed back against her stroller and moving first to\none side and then to another, I couldn\u2019t figure out what she was doing. \u00a0  Until I traced what her eyes were fixed\non. \u00a0  She had spotted a leaf falling and\nshe was following its descent. \u00a0  I said,\n\u201cThank you for being my teacher, Sesha. \u00a0\n I see now. Not my way, YOUR way, slowly.\u201d \u00a0  After that, I fully gave myself over to\nSesha. \u00a0  That forged the bond.\" \u00a0  \n \n \n \nThis\nstory is important because it underscores the beginning of an understanding and\nacceptance of a \u2018new normal\u2019 that is driven by love, vulnerability, patience,\nrespect and resilience. \u00a0  A quick scan of\nthe media will reveal a hunger for this knowledge, because beside every advice\npage about spiritual growth and life satisfaction will be articles about\nexploding health and social care needs due to the numbers of people aging into\ndisability and people with disabilities aging. \u00a0\n These demographic trends are unprecedented and the only group with first\nhand experience in coping is ...  us . \u00a0  But\nwe have been so busy giving care that we haven\u2019t yet figured out all\nof the policy and business solutions to ensure a future good life for ourselves\nand our loved ones. \u00a0  For that, we will need\nto forge partnerships and think creatively. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs\nfor technical knowledge, I wager that I am not the only caregiver online today who\nknows how to change a gastrostomy tube, empty a catheter bag or discreetly soothe an anxiety attack. A recent study published by the American Association for Retired\nPersons showed that more than half of family caregivers polled were performing\ncomplex nursing care on a daily basis. \u00a0\u00a0\n More than two thirds were giving medications, including those delivered\nby injection or IV. \u00a0  Thirty years ago,\ntube feeding would have been a nursing need requiring hospitalization. \u00a0  Today, families are expected to roll this\ntask into their day alongside walking the dog and fixing school lunches.  \n \n \n \n Each of us has a caregiving experience that is unique. \u00a0  Our lives are\noften punctuated by the extremes of emotion and many of us describe our family\nlife as a \u2018roller coaster\u2019, reeling between hope and despair, grief and\njoy. \u00a0  The constant though, is love. \u00a0  Individually and collectively, we embody\nresilience, compassion, generosity, hospitality and ingenuity. \u00a0  We embody those qualities partly because of\nthe care that we give, but also because we are constantly presenting our loved ones to the world as we see them - whole and beautiful, but with exceptional\nneeds. \u00a0  At the same time, we have to see\nour dependent loved ones as others see them, because if we didn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t be able to\nmake those fine adjustments necessary to ensure their dignity remains intact. \u00a0  Our knowledge and experience give us a crash\ncourse in becoming fully human. \n \n \n \n \n \nBesides\nknowledge and experience, the final component of wisdom is the ability to judge\nand act fairly. \u00a0  How can we galvanize our\nknowledge and experience to forge partnerships that will enable us to co-create\ninnovative solutions to our loved ones' future-building challenges? \u00a0  How can we create communities that will\nfuture-proof ourselves and our dependent charges? How can we teach our fellow citizens to act fairly?  \n \n \n \nThat will be the subject of my next blog post, so stay tuned! \u00a0But for today, know that we caregivers are rich in wisdom, knowledge, compassion, creativity and humanity. \u00a0If there is a 'secret' to happiness and what it means to be human, caregivers are likely to know it. That's why it's important to tell our stories and be known in wider society..... because we are  all  caregivers at some point in our lives. \n \n \"The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving\" (House of Anansi Press, 2014) is available now from all Canadian booksellers and available for pre-order in the U.S. from online sites. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W5B9Phf9qSI/UzJIQAhyTLI/AAAAAAAABVU/9VgkpQd05tU/s1600/wisdom.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Movement", "http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/philosophy/people/faculty_pages/kittay.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-84koK4V4VEo/UzLNzNaWjgI/AAAAAAAABVk/q1Tf8CsQ51c/s1600/EvaandSesha.jpg", "http://books.google.ca/books?id=yebcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=eva+feder+kittay+not+my+way,+sesha,+your+way,+slowly&source=bl&ots=PwzHmIaIHa&sig=FWPBz0M-UTWhoNjCeJk2w-Fh_iw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l9EyU9TsMuvE2QXd14G4CA&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=eva%20feder%20kittay%20not%20my%20way%2C%20sesha%2C%20your%20way%2C%20slowly&f=false"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/03/the-wisdom-of-caregivers-part-1.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nRecently, I  wrote about the wisdom and knowledge of caregivers . \u00a0Families giving care sometimes feel that they are operating in a vacuum - that the only compassionate place is the home because societies in which we live are driven by an ethic of individualism, consumerism and the perpetual growth of a paycheck. \u00a0So, how can we nudge our neighbours, institutions and governments to value and support our caregiving life? How can we create communities that will 'future-proof' our vulnerable loved ones and ourselves? \u00a0How can we teach our fellow citizens to behave with compassion and be allies in 'judging and acting fairly'? \n \n \n \n \n \n AdamKahane, in his book \u201cPower and Love\u201d  wrangles with society\u2019s toughest\nchallenges. \u00a0  He writes about joining\nhands across divides to co-create solutions to difficult social problems. \u00a0  He writes \u201cIn order to do that, we have to\nwork with two distinct fundamental forces that are in tension: power and love. \u00a0  Kahane defines power as \u201cThe drive of\neverything living to realize itself, with increasing intensity and\nextensity.\u201d \u00a0  So power in this sense is\nthe drive to achieve one\u2019s purpose, to get one\u2019s job done, to grow. \u00a0 Much of our consumer driven society functions on that operating system. \u00a0 He defines LOVE as \u201cthe drive towards the\nunity of the separated. \u00a0  So love in this\nsense is the drive to reconnect and make whole that which has become or appears\nfragmented. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \nKahane says we need a little love AND a little power if we want social change. \u00a0I believe that our caregiver advocacy\nmovement is dominated by love and that we could all use a dose of power. \u00a0  If we are dominated by love, governments are dominated by power. \u00a0\n They are so fragmented that for many, applying for assistance is more\nbother than it's worth. \u00a0  My years of\napplying for respite and homecare funding have led me to believe that the\nstarting question for bureaucrats who design these social programmes must be,\n\u201cHow can we make this programme accountable?\u201d rather than, \u00a0  \u201cHow can we make this programme helpful?\u201d \n \n \n \nListen\nto what Kahane says about balancing love and power to achieve social change: \n \n People\nwho can understand the concerns of others and mix those concerns with their own\nagenda have access to a power source denied to those who can push only their\nown interests. \u00a0  In this fuller\nunderstanding, power is a verb meaning to give and take, to be reciprocal, to\nbe influenced as well as to influence. \u00a0\n To be affected by another in relationship is as true a sign of power as\nthe capacity to affect others. .... As you become more powerful, so do those in\nrelationship with you. \u00a0  As they become\nmore powerful, so do you. \u00a0  This is power\nunderstood as relational, as power \u2018with\u2019, not power \u2018over\u2019. \u00a0  Deep\nchange, Kahane maintains, calls for a balance of these two forces because\nsystems based on just one of those forces alone will result in stagnation. \u00a0  And this carries the risk of the overall\nfailure to respond to the chaotic changes that are the natural fallout of human\nrelationships. \u00a0  \n \n \n The impetus required to reinvent the most deeply\nembedded habits is called for when the results of ineffective systems are a\ngreat enough irritant to the majority, that a general consensus to throw in the\ntowel ensues. \u00a0 \n \n \n This happened in Anchorage Alaska when Dr. Doug Eby\nand his colleagues became so frustrated with the poor outcomes of traditional\nwestern medicine that they invented an entirely new blueprint for delivering\nhealthcare. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n The  NUKA Model of Care  was born out of the realization\nthat the \u201cowner/users\u201d, as their patients are called, held a good deal of the\npower for achieving decent health outcomes. \u00a0\u00a0\n Particularly in the case of chronic care, \u00a0  it is often patients who decide whether or\nnot to fill a prescription or to take a full course of medical treatment. \u00a0  The NUKA model of care retained a traditional\nmodel of ICU care, because in that setting, patients need systems to take\nover. \u00a0  But Dr. Eby describes the design\nof traditional health care delivery for chronic conditions as akin to throwing\na stone at a target on the wall. \u00a0  In the\nmessy business of dealing with people, he says, it is not a stone you are\nthrowing at the target, but a bird. \u00a0  No\nmatter how hard you throw that bird at the target, it still may veer off in\nanother direction before it hits the wall. \u00a0\n Systems that are rooted in the respect for freedom, yet offer support\nfor our failings or changed trajectories, will result in better outcomes. \u00a0Dr. Eby worked with aboriginal elders in Alaska to reinvent a healthcare system that balanced love with power. \u00a0NUKA's operating system is designed to work within the messy realities of real life and real caregiving.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nKahane\u2019s\nideas and the NUKA model of care combined with our knowledge and experience give us an inkling of how to\nbegin thinking differently about crafting a future for ourselves and most\nimportantly, our vulnerable loved ones. \u00a0\n What are the forces that have power over us and prevent us from reaching\nour goals? \u00a0  One force is our own\ninclination to diminish the value of our needs. \u00a0\n Instead, we look at programme requirements and funding eligibility and\nstay awake nights trying to squeeze our family circumstances into those narrow\nparameters. \u00a0  I remember years ago,\nfilling out a form for home help. \u00a0  An\nolder, more experienced Mum was sitting beside me at the kitchen table and she\nasked, \u201chow much are you asking for?\u201d. \u00a0  I\nreplied, \u201cTen hours a week, that\u2019s the maximum.\u201d \u00a0  \u201cBut that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said my friend. \u00a0  \u201cYou need at least thirty hours a week. Write\n30 hours.\u201d \u00a0  I began to realize that day\nthat Nick\u2019s needs were not something imaginary. \u00a0\n Certainly, I did not need to apologize for the manpower it required to\nkeep him alive, well and happy. \u00a0  And if\ngovernment did not provide me with the help we really needed, well, I would\nlook elsewhere. \u00a0\u00a0  I would begin to\nimagine what network centred care might look like for my family and how,\ntogether, we could invent solutions for future proofing Nicholas.  \n \n \n Here's something new: our family (like many others) is using technology to share the care, wisdom and knowledge. \u00a0\u00a0 We use an online social\nnetwork called  Tyze , a kind of highly specialized version of Facebook. \u00a0 Regular readers of my blog will know that I am a huge fan of  Tyze  - I have written often of the benefits of online care coordination and the capacity of technology to help families share the burden of care. \u00a0 \u00a0 Let me\ntell you a bit about how we use  Tyze  in our family. \u00a0 We began by inviting \u00a0members of our\nfamily to the site, simply to keep them up to date on the health and daily life\nactivities of Nick. \u00a0 At that time, \u00a0Nicholas\u2019 nursing needs were very\nhigh. \u00a0  We were running a home hospital\nand trying to ensure important messages got through to all his care staff was\nincreasingly difficult and frustrating. \u00a0\n I would leave notes about medication changes or other critical\ndirectives in a bedside chart, on a white board above Nick\u2019s bed and still they\nwould be missed. \u00a0  I began to think that perhaps\nI could use Tyze for caregivers, our doctor, social worker and any other\nprofessionals on an as-needed basis. \u00a0\n Now, we keep the family in touch with Nick\u2019s news via emails and\nFacebook. \u00a0  Tyze became, for us, a secure\nway to let everyone know about medical or rehab issues, to alert the team to\nthings like skin breakdown and bowel protocol, and to keep a daily seizure\nrecord. \u00a0  We are very fortunate that\nNick\u2019s GP agreed to participate in our Tyze site - he can check in anytime to\nsee how Nick is doing, especially if there are fluctuating symptoms, which\nthere often are. \u00a0We a Tyze site for my Mom's care too. \u00a0In her case, we use it to coordinate the support she needs between members of our extended family. \u00a0If and when her needs increase, we'll invite paid caregivers to her network.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Technology\nis a gift that connects us to our past, our friends and our\nneighbourhoods.\u00a0 I use a blog and a\nfacebook page to advocate for families who give care to someone who is\nvulnerable. Our story-telling online is vital because it will, over time, shift\nopinions in the wider society about the value of giving and receiving care. The caregiving narrative in all its forms is the most fundamental tool in shifting attitudes about our knowledge and wisdom in wider society.\u00a0 \n \n I have never met another caregiver who did not know what they needed to thrive as a family. \u00a0  We know that paid care together with the love\nand support of friends, family and neighbours is for us, the  key to a good\nlife. \u00a0  This is a future we must build for\neveryone, including those with differing abilities. \u00a0  We must balance our love with power. \u00a0  We must ally with anyone who shares our\nvision for an inclusive society and must build a future where care is valued\nand shared. \u00a0 Our future depends on it.\u00a0 \n My book, \"The Four Walls of My Freedom: Lessons I've Learned From a Life of Caregiving\" (House of Anansi Press, 2014) is available now everywhere in Canada and for pre-order online in the US. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GuMD3JH36sI/Uz7DCZa-IzI/AAAAAAAABWY/AxA_qx_4TK8/s1600/familycaregiviing.jpg", "http://www.amazon.ca/Power-Love-Theory-Practice-Social/dp/1605093041", "https://www.southcentralfoundation.com/nuka/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.tyze.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/04/the-wisdom-of-caregivers-part-ii-our.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nYou can see in Susan Beayni's eyes just how much she loves her daughter, Rebecca. \u00a0Love, contribution, friendship and community have been the pillars upon which Susan has built her personal and her professional life. \u00a0My interest is in how longterm caregivers use their experience to teach, to inspire and sometimes, to create a career. \u00a0Susan Beayni is the Coordinator of Family Supports at  Partners for Planning  in Toronto, Canada - she taps into the wisdom she's gained from her own caregiving to advise and support others. \n \nSusan Beayni is the mother of two young women - Rebecca (31) and Nicole (28). \u00a0Rebecca lives in her own apartment that adjoins the family home where Susan and her husband Simon reside. \u00a0Susan and Simon tell their story of nurturing a good life for Rebecca in a marvellous video titled  DANCE IN THE SHADOW \u00a0(viewing the video is free on the  Partners for Planning  site, you just have to register first). \n \nEven as a girl growing up in Ontario, Susan felt a connection and a calling to Africa. \u00a0In 1979, she travelled to Nigeria as a newly graduated teacher and there, she met her husband to be. \u00a0Simon Beayni hailed from Lebanon and when the couple married, they left Nigeria and returned to Simon's birthplace. \u00a0Lebanon in 1980 was under siege and when Susan fell pregnant with Rebecca a couple of years later, she boarded a British container ship carrying evacuees to safety in Cyprus. \u00a0Eight months pregnant, Susan made it eventually back to Canada in time to deliver Rebecca in Toronto.  \n \nNot wishing to be separated from Simon, Susan flew back to still war-torn Lebanon with her new baby and slowly, it became clear that Rebecca had disabilities. \u00a0Rebecca had suffered the effects of a virus contracted early in Susan's pregnancy. \u00a0\"In the midst of so much hatred, our baby girl was our peaceful anchor\", Susan says. \u00a0\"She changes the whole fabric of the environment. \u00a0She calms people down - she makes people joyful and grateful. \u00a0Her fragility and vulnerability are her greatest gifts. \u00a0She gives others the permission to be vulnerable, too.\" \n \n \n \n \nI asked Susan about her own professional life and aspirations as Rebecca's mother, over time. \u00a0At first a full-time mother ministering to her two children's daily needs, Susan tried supply teaching when her girls were teenagers. \u00a0But, working proved difficult with Rebecca's many medical appointments and unpredictable illnesses. \u00a0Then, as luck would have it, an opportunity to use her knowledge and skills presented itself. \u00a0A professional committee was being formed at  Holland Bloorview Kids' Rehabilitation Hospital  to assist families transition from children's services to adults'. \u00a0Susan was hired on a five year contract to gather information about families' needs and to develop a curriculum and resources. \u00a0When that contract ended, Susan reflected on what form her future contributions might take. \u00a0\"I just want to be with families,\" was her conclusion. \n \nWhen Susan met Jeff Dobbin, the Executive Director of  Partners for Planning  (formerly PLAN Toronto), she knew that she had found a match. \u00a0Jeff's talent was in applying the business approach to assisting families build a safe and secure future for their son or daughter with disabilities. \u00a0But he needed someone with the skills, knowledge and wisdom to support families in building support networks as well as offering them information and compassion. \u00a0Susan was hired. \n \nNow, Susan draws her own strength from her exploration of indigenous peoples and their traditions of acceptance and inclusion. \u00a0She says, \"From the time Rebecca was born, I worried that she would die. \u00a0So, I finally came to rest in the unknowingness - in the unpredictability of our life course. \u00a0I embrace the African idea of  Ubuntu  that Nelson Mandela described so well.\" \n \nSusan Beayni's life as a caregiver has led her from a dream of Africa, to mothering a young woman with severe disabilities to inspires her many friends and neighbours to be fully human, to eventually finding a role in teaching and supporting other families. \u00a0Susan's life is rich and full of love and meaning. \u00a0Her story nudges us all to readjust our lens of hope and expectation in life - it is not impossible to embrace the 'unknowingness' we all experience every day. \n \nNOTE: \u00a0 Partners for Planning  is a fantastic resource for families supporting a loved one with disabilities. \u00a0I urge you to check it out!

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThere's a story about Hogewey, a  village in The Netherlands  that's gone viral on social media recently. \u00a0It's a closed village (ie. it's got walls around it and there's an air lock system to get in and out). \u00a0The residents are people with advanced dementia or Alzheimer's and their carers. \u00a0In this village, shops have goods but no cashiers. \u00a0Nurses have no uniforms and accessibility is the norm. \u00a0It is an environment designed to provide maximum freedom as well as support to those made vulnerable by their cognitive impairments.  \n \nWhen I first read this article, I thought of the 60's BBC cult TV show \" The Prisoner \" - a creepy tale of a sinister walled village somewhere in the UK ruled by an invisible dictatorial force. \u00a0By all accounts, folks in this Dutch village have reduced levels of anxiety as well as more discernible joy and meaning in their lives. \u00a0Comments on Facebook were almost uniformly positive, proclaiming this model to be an innovative, compassionate and effective alternative to traditional nursing homes. \u00a0It may be all those things, but it's not  normal. \u00a0 I can't decide if it's human or inhuman. \n \nThis story got me thinking about the value of segregated settings - are they EVER a good thing? \u00a0When our son Nick was small, I was a tireless advocate of inclusion for children with disabilities at school. \u00a0That is, until we moved to the UK and decided to put Nick in a special training institute for a type of therapy called  Conductive Education . \u00a0To me, that decision was akin to sending Nick to ballet or hockey school. \u00a0Nicholas was there to learn specific skills that were not available in the mainstream and the education on offer was intensive. \u00a0After two years of that training, we realised that Nicholas had accomplished all that he was able and was ready to move back into the mainstream. \u00a0All to say that I am not against segregated settings per say, but I'm wary of them. \n \nBut the Dutch village is a long way from being an environment to teach specialised skills. \u00a0It is a rarefied version of life itself, somehow akin to ' The Truman Show '. \u00a0And yet. \u00a0My mother does not suffer from Alzheimer's, but if she did, wouldn't I choose a closed village for her as an alternative to a nursing home? \u00a0I believe I would, but only if there was no third alternative. \u00a0The question that persists in my mind, is \"can't we accommodate our loved ones with advanced forms of dementia within society? \u00a0Do we really need to construct an alternate and separate reality for them?\" \u00a0 Jean Vanier  understands the need to reconcile the needs of vulnerable persons with safety and inclusion. \u00a0His \" L'Arche \" model leverages the assets of compassionate citizens seeking meaning in their lives who wish to live with, not apart from, people with high needs, including sometimes challenging behaviours. \u00a0But doesn't any inclusive solution by its nature limit the freedoms of people with cognitive impairments? \u00a0The Dutch village seems to offer freedom of safe movement within city walls, that is certain. \n \nI am glad that people around the world are developing new ways of caring for our most vulnerable citizens and I think compassionate models are all worth a try. \u00a0For my family, I hope that we will live together, without walls or air-locked entrances. \u00a0I hope we can find a way to do that. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OUIN1UIZYwU/Ux8bu-1_fYI/AAAAAAAABUE/MDAKDN0L9J8/s1600/dementia-village-cc-ouple-010.jpg", "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/27/dementia-village-residents-have-fun", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_education", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Vanier", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Arche"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/03/a-dutch-village-prison-or-paradise.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nWhen Nicholas was very young, I decided that my task was to help him live his life in a way that approximated 'normal'. \u00a0For us, that meant finding ways for Nick and his sister to help with chores around the house when they were able. \u00a0Natalie swept the kitchen floor in a haphazard fashion, gripping the broom to keep it from falling on top of her. \u00a0I put a sponge in Nick's hand and helped him wipe his wheelchair tray after dinner. \u00a0Living according to a natural trajectory also meant encouraging independence, resilience, kindness and creativity in both our children. \u00a0I studied what other children Nick's age were doing and tried to help him do it, too.  \n \n \n \n \n \nIt was only later that I began about applying that line of thinking to myself. \u00a0I was past middle age and still nursing Nick, helping him with every aspect of his daily living. \u00a0But what were other mothers my age doing? \u00a0My mind began to meander into the future. \u00a0What if I were 85 and still repositioning a 60 year old Nicholas every hour overnight? \u00a0What would become of us?  \n \nI made a decision to apply the same line of thinking I'd used as a guidepost in Nicholas' life to my own. \u00a0I knew that I would be putting Nicholas at risk if I didn't create an exit strategy for us both - an exit strategy that allowed me to be his Mom, but not his nurse into my old age and Nick's middle age. \n \nI asked myself that key question, \"What would Nicholas be doing if he was an able-bodied young man?\" \u00a0The answer that came to me was, he would be working, he would be living on his own, seeing friends during his spare time and he would be indulging his passion for sports. \u00a0I knew that Nicholas wanted his own apartment, ideally sharing with good friends who are also his caregivers. \u00a0But, with Nick's complex care needs, I knew that this was a housing solution that was impossible, given the current funding arrangements in our region together as well as his requirement for multiple caregivers, including backup. \u00a0So, I began to research supported housing options in our neighbourhood that could provide nursing and a the promise of a good life for someone as young as Nick. \u00a0For our family, the stars aligned and we found a wonderful solution. \u00a0Nicholas now lives in his self-described 'man cave', with carers who are his age and share his interests. \u00a0He  blogs about sports  and has a twitter account (@wright_nick)\u00a0with many followers. \u00a0These pursuits constitute his 'job'.  \n \nOur family still sees Nick more than another family might visit a young working son of 25. \u00a0But we each call or visit to reach our comfort level with one another's company. \u00a0When it feels right, we give each other space. \u00a0If Nick is ill, I'm there to sleep on a sofa near his room.  \n \nI know other parents of adult children with disabilities whose guiding idea is \"I will look after my son or daughter in our home until we die.\" \u00a0I know other families, too, that would like an independent life for their child with disabilities, but haven't the resources to create it. \u00a0But, every life is better with a plan and every plan begins with an idea. \u00a0What is your future plan idea?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hlaAUBC6WLg/UyL97UhuqKI/AAAAAAAABUY/CyCQTYRyZm0/s1600/kids.jpg", "http://thehockeyambassador.blogspot.ca/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/03/trying-to-be-normal-mom-crafting-my.html", "title": ""},

\u00a0  How does this lesson\ntranslate to other roles I have in my life?\u201d  \n \n BREAKDOWNS : \u00a0  When things go terribly wrong, Ozioma advises\ncaregivers to cry together with their loved one. \u00a0  Breakdowns are inevitable and sharing them is\nthe way to move forward. \u00a0  \u201cYou are not at\nodds with your loved one!\u201d Break down can also mean to pull apart\nintentionally. \u00a0  Ozioma suggests that\ncaregivers make a habit of breaking down responsibilities into goals and from\nthere, into small actions. \u00a0  In her talk,\nshe reminisced about constantly having a pad and pencil in hand, ready to make\nnotes about how to turn a gigantic challenge into a reasonable to-do list.  \n \n \n \n 3) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n BALANCE \n \n \n \n \u201cHold your dreams together\nfor yourself and for your loved one. \u00a0  Ask\nyourself, \u2018what is essential here?\u2019 \u00a0\n Allow time and space for both your dreams and your loved one\u2019s\nneeds. \u00a0  Sometimes, the balance of those\nis tipped to one side. \u00a0  But when the\ncrisis eases, go back to your dreams!\u201d Ozioma held on the dream of building  her own business  throughout her caregiving journey. \u00a0 \n \n Part of achieving balance in\nthe face of sometimes very painful and chaotic circumstances is determining\nwhat is essential. \u00a0  Ozioma suggests the\nfollowing technique. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Create an Effort List \n \n Fold a piece of paper in half\nevery morning. \u00a0  On the first half, write,\n\u201cWhere do I need to place my effort?\u201d \u00a0  On\nthe second half of the paper, write, \u201cWhat role do I need to play?\u201d \n \n \n \n Example: \u00a0  Effort is \u2018calling doctor to receive test\nresults.\u2019 \u00a0  Role to play: \u2018loving\nnurturer\u2019 \n \n \n \n Another example: \u00a0  Effort is \u2018cleaning the apartment\u2019  \n \n Role to play is \u2018the singing\nstreet sweeper\u2019 \u00a0Thoughtful imagination is the rule here! \n \n \n \n 4) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n BELIEVE \n \n \n \n Believing in caregiving starts\nwith one, simple question \u2013 \u201cWhat if I knew that I was capable?\u201d \u00a0  Asking yourself this questions allows you to\nbelieve that you ARE capable of meeting any challenge life throws at you and\nyour loved one. \u00a0  Ask too, \u201cWhat if my\nloved one was capable of giving me something every day?\u201d \u00a0  Believing in personal capacity is the key to\na healthy \u2018care eco-system\u2019. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n \n Ozioma suggests that every\ncaregiver can be an innovator. \u00a0\n Capability in caregiving means inventing new ways of giving care. \u00a0\u00a0  It means inviting and enrolling others to\nparticipate. \u00a0  By keeping the focus on\ncreating an enjoyable caregiving journey from beginning to end, it is possible\nto inspire allies. \u00a0  But, says, Ozioma, it\nis important to accept everyone as they are. \u00a0\n Each ally will have different gifts and unique contributions. \u00a0  Using the body as a metaphor, not everyone is\nan arm! \u00a0  But those who are willing will\nhave something to contribute. \n \n \n \n I am inspired by the 4 Bs - Breathe, Break, Balance and Believe. \u00a0I hope you are too. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5WXmXqmgKAo/UvzR4cJeUkI/AAAAAAAABRw/-pP1Q8bQuyc/s1600/dreams-may-come-motivational-evening-ozioma-egwuo-76.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/in/ozioma", "http://www.carenovatemag.com/", "http://burnbright-lifeworks.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/02/how-to-keep-your-soul-alive-while.html", "title": ""},

Seizing her chance \u2013 and her meager Social Security check \u2013 Carrie sets out on an unforgettable quest to make peace with her past. \u00a0Carrie Watts has a weak heart, but a determined and hopeful spirit. \u00a0It's a beautiful movie about dreams\u00a0realised, against all odds, at the end of life. \n \n \n \n \n It's the dreams of my Mom and my son that got me reminiscing about \"The Trip to Bountiful.\" \u00a0When Nick was small, he wanted to climb on the monkey bars in the park. \u00a0I held him up high, his legs dangling in the air, his hands reaching to grasp a bar. \u00a0Later, he expressed every Canadian boy's dream - to become an NHL hockey star. \u00a0I knew that most kids would learn the game before other interests overtook that particular dream, so I phoned around to locate an after school ball hockey team. \u00a0Jim took Nick to the park in his wheelchair for 'pick up' games in the evenings at our local outdoor rink. \u00a0Sometimes, Nicholas' dreams were within the realm of possibility IF I tried hard enough and called in enough\u00a0favours from friends or family. \u00a0Often, when I couldn't make his dream come true, I felt terrible.\u00a0 \n \n Now, my mother sighs when she can't canoe on our lake. \u00a0The air is blue when she talks about not driving. \u00a0Lately, she's been missing ski trips to the mountains in Quebec. \u00a0Mom is 92 and it 'makes her crazy' that she can't have her athletic, independent youth back. \u00a0I don't blame her - my Mom was a great tennis player, a terrific skier and a spitfire on the road. \u00a0But should I be aiding and abetting her dreams and if so, which ones? \n \n It's hard when someone you love expresses an important dream that you cannot deliver on. \u00a0No waving of a magic wand will take away Nick's disability or give Mom back her\u00a0strength and vitality. So,\u00a0what is the correct response when dreams can't\u00a0 realised? \u00a0In my family, I've found it's been important to understand the deeper meanings behind the dreams. \u00a0Is this something that my loved one really wants? \u00a0Or, is expressing the dream meant to express a sadness or anger about loss? \u00a0My response will depend on how I\u00a0read my love ones' expression of dreams. \u00a0Sometimes, even if a dream  could \u00a0be\u00a0realised, I cannot help them achieve it. \u00a0I'm just too old, too tired, or too busy. \u00a0But other times, I nod and agree that getting old just sucks. \u00a0I add a swear word to Nick's speaking computer and prompt him to 'speak' that word again and again as we rail against the barricades blocking his greatest wishes coming true.\u00a0 \n \n Sometimes, I can make the dreams come true for those I love and sometimes, I cannot. \u00a0When I can't, I concentrate on easing their sadness and banishing my guilt. \u00a0We just join hands, shrug and flip the bird to reality. \u00a0It's the best we can do.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090203/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h56pUqIeQtw/UxjtOH2L5PI/AAAAAAAABS8/7g6acHfUD88/s1600/The_Trip_to_Bountiful_.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/03/big-big-dreams-and-caregiver-guilt.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nMarcy White was like just about every other young mother-to-be. \u00a0She was excited, nervous, happy and brimming with the anticipation of seeing her new baby boy.  \n \nBut when her baby boy Jacob was born, something didn't seem right. \u00a0Ten long months passed as Marcy tried in vain to soothe her baby's crying and to feed him so carefully, so as not to evoke a vomiting episode. \u00a0During Jacob's first year, Marcy White devoted herself to trying to find any clue to what might be causing her baby's distress until finally... a diagnosis.  \u00a0Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease , or PMD, is the name the doctors gave to the genetic condition that afflicted Jacob. \n \nPMD is nasty - it is a progressively debilitating disability caused by a genetic anomaly. \u00a0The prognosis is dire, but then again, the doctor who wrote that medical textbook never met Jacob Trossman... or his mother. \n \nMarcy White is Jacob's Mom and she has written a raw, sensitive and illuminating book about her transformation from a career as a successful financier who was catapulted into being a full-time mother and fierce advocate for her son. \u00a0Here's just a snippet of Marcy's writing: \n \n \u201cJacob is amazing and I adore him. There is nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for him. But being his mother can be so hard at times\u2014emotionally draining and physically exhausting. And I never feel like I\u2019m doing enough. I always think I can do more. When a new idea comes to mind, I berate myself for not thinking of it sooner. Because small things can have a huge impact on Jacob\u2019s life and a few months can make a difference. Maybe. \n When Jacob was younger, I diligently dragged him to various therapy appointments. I held out hope that someone would teach him to walk, play with a toy or eat. If physiotherapy was prescribed twice a week, I wanted him to go four times.\u201d \n \nMarcy's writing style is both urgent and intimate. \u00a0Reading her story of Jacob, I felt I could have been reading my own story - I wonder how many of us share difficult experiences that we very rarely discuss. \n \nHere's a conversation that I had with Marcy about her life and her book: \n \n ME:  \u00a0When you decided to write your book, did you have a particular social or political change agenda in mind? \n \n MARCY:  \u00a0Yes! \u00a0I hoped (and still do) that medical professionals, educators and policymakers will read the book. \u00a0Despite their best intentions, these people only see a tiny fraction of our lives - the small window of time we are in their offices or classrooms. \u00a0My intention with The Boy Who Can was to give a thorough description of my life with Jacob, the good parts and the challenges, so that they can have a better idea how their actions and inactions affect us. \n \n ME:  \u00a0How do you think telling our stories of family life with disability helps all of us, as a community? \u00a0How does our storytelling help society as a whole? \n \n MARCY:  \u00a0I hope it can give other families like ours strength and hope that they, too, can create full lives for their children. \u00a0Almost everyone knows families like ours. \u00a0I hope The Boy Who Can can help these people- friends and colleagues of parents of kids with special needs - understand some of our experiences and challenges. \u00a0And realize that we need our friends more than ever before. \n \n ME:  \u00a0How has your life changed since writing your book? \n \n MARCY:  \u00a0It hasn't..... yet. \u00a0My intention is to use the book as a starting point to find opportunities to talk to large groups of people about my experiences. \u00a0Our lives are hard and there are many ways people of influence can bring about change. \u00a0 I want to reach these people and help put a face to the issues. \u00a0It's harder to ignore if people know the faces and stories of the families. \n \n ME:  \u00a0Can you give us an update on your family? \n \n MARCY:  \u00a0All most parents want is for their children to be healthy and happy. \u00a0Jacob is as healthy as he can be. \u00a0He's a very happy boy whose disease is not contagious.... but his laughter is! \n \nThis is a terrific book for anyone who is new to disability parenting. \u00a0The voice of Marcy White will assure you that you are not alone. \u00a0 \u201cThe Boy Who Can \u2014 The Jacob Trossman Story\u201d \u00a0is available as an  E-book through iBooks . \nAlso, order via  Amazon in Canada  and the  USA . \u00a0Also available at  Chapters Indigo  in Canada. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nkl5k-e5668/U3F4xGfRayI/AAAAAAAABYs/iphu1aPapSQ/s1600/Marcy.jpeg", "http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/pelizaeus_merzbacher/pelizaeus_merzbacher.htm", "https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=0626712284E2D4F77C0194B7F64B1058.", "http://www.amazon.ca/The-Boy-Who-Can-Trossman/dp/0992143608", "http://www.amazon.com/The-Boy-Who-Can-Trossman/dp/0992143608/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1399993283&sr=1-1", "http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/the-boy-who-can-the/9780992143602-item.html?ikwid=the+boy+who+can+marcy+white&ikwsec=Books&ikwidx=0", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7_-Xu0ZSrvI/U3F4cJWa8AI/AAAAAAAABYg/W4tsloTjddk/s1600/Theboywhocan.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/05/the-boy-who-can-by-marcy-white.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nTwo stories in the news this week caught my eye. \u00a0The first was really an OpEd in the Guardian (UK) paper, penned by the Head of Policy at a very good charity for the deaf/blind called  SENSE . \n \nSue Brown titled her piece \" Tackling Loneliness is a Job for Professionals, Not Just Neighbours .\" \u00a0Anyone following social care trends in the UK press will be used to seeing stories about David Cameron's (some would say failed and misunderstood) concept of \" The Big Society .\" \u00a0The \"BS\" as it got nicknamed almost immediately was a call for widespread civic action and neighbourly behaviour. \u00a0The fact that deep cuts to social services followed the rallying cry for volunteerism did not go down well with many who were dependent on relatively generous pensions and all forms of social assistance. Brown cites personal choice and freedom as a reason for those with disabilities (or the aged) to rely on the kindness of neighbours:  \n \n This also comes down to personal choice. As someone who is physically active and doesn't have a\u00a0 disability \u00a0I have the choice whether or not to engage with my neighbours. I can ask them to look after my cat while I'm on holiday, offer to babysit in emergencies. But if I don't want to I don't have to. Why should we expect disabled or\u00a0 older people \u00a0to be any different? They may not want to rely on those who live next door for company and indeed we cannot guarantee that those who are inclined to offer this support live next door to those who need it. \n\u00a0The author pits the politics of Big Society or civic engagement made personal against the defense of decent professional services paid for by the government.  \n \nIn my opinion, Sue Brown has it wrong. \u00a0We need both. \u00a0Brown has conflated these two issues. \u00a0Of course, one should not expect the lady next door to create a speaking computer or deliver an IV medication. \u00a0But community building and every form of personal kindness should be encouraged by everyone, all the time. \u00a0Sue Brown missed the boat. \n \nSo, then I read an Atlantic Monthly article titled \" The US Economy Does Not Value Caregivers \" by the erudite Anne-Marie Slaughter. \u00a0This author doesn't conflate anything - she's got it right. \u00a0The modus operandi of the United States with its ethic of competition, excellence and survival of the fittest is in tension with, if not in opposition to, an ethic of care. \u00a0This is how Slaughter explains her point of view: \n \n \n I\u2019m all for competition\u2014in its place. But we have lost sight of the care paradigm, which is the necessary complement to competition. As Bill Gates put it, \u201cthe two great forces of human nature are self-interest and caring for others.\u201d \n \n \n \n The care paradigm starts from the premise that human beings cannot survive alone. Our progress as a species flows from our identity as social animals, connected to one another through ties of love, kinship, and clanship. Success is defined not as individual victory but as group progress, whether the group is family, clan, community, company, or any particular subdivision of society. In the care paradigm, the individual does not disappear; the progress of the group advances the individual as well. All members of the group also have the security of knowing that whether they are young or old, ill or weak, they will be cared for in their turn. Caring is part and parcel of building community. \n \n \n \nI agree with Anne-Marie Slaughter - caring IS part of building community and it is care that keeps us safe and secure. \u00a0It is loving care that banishes loneliness, not the visits of professionals. \u00a0But make no mistake, we need both. \u00a0You can't replace love with clinical services and you can't replace essential, life sustaining services with love and good intentions. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sense.org.uk/", "http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/jan/08/tackling-loneliness-professionals-not-neighbours", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Society", "http://www.theguardian.com/society/disability", "http://www.theguardian.com/society/older-people", "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-us-economy-does-not-value-caregivers/282887/?utm_source=pulsenews"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/01/tackling-loneliness-for-love-money-or.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Recently, I came across a fascinating interview on YouTube. \u00a0It was The Times UK reporter John-Paul Flintoff speaking with the author of \"Ghost Boy\", \u00a0Martin Pistorius. \u00a0Pistorius is a non-speaking wheelchair user with an incredible life story. \u00a0Flintoff wanted to know about a conversation that changed everything for Pistorius and it is that conversation I would like to talk about today. \u00a0But first, here's a little about the book and the author: \n \n \n \n Published on\u00a0 Sep 23, 2013 \n \n \n www.ghostboybook.com They all thought he was gone. But he was alive and trapped inside his own body for ten years. In January 1988 Martin Pistorius, aged twelve, fell inexplicably sick. First he lost his voice and stopped eating. Then he slept constantly and shunned human contact. Doctors were mystified. Within eighteen months he was mute and wheelchair-bound. Martin's parents were told an unknown degenerative disease left him with the mind of a baby and less than two years to live. Martin was moved to care centers for severely disabled children. The stress and heartache shook his parents' marriage and their family to the core. Their boy was gone. Or so they thought. Ghost Boy is the heart-wrenching story of one boy's return to life through the power of love and faith. In these pages, readers see a parent's resilience, the consequences of misdiagnosis, abuse at the hands of cruel caretakers, and the unthinkable duration of Martin's mental alertness betrayed by his lifeless body. We also see a life reclaimed\u2014a business created, a new love kindled\u2014all from a wheelchair. Martin's emergence from his own darkness invites us to celebrate our own lives and fight for a better life for others. \n \n \n \nIn Flintoff's interview, Pistorius talks about his life-changing conversation in terms of a choice that he needed to make, but was unable to. \u00a0The author needed to choose an augmentative communication device, one that would cost most of a precious inheritance that his father had received. \u00a0The decision was so great, so life-changing for good or for bad, that Pistorius was paralyzed and unable to act. \u00a0But a conversation with his father changed everything, giving Pistorius 'the permission to get it wrong'. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFeeling paralysed by the gravity of a decision is a state that most caregivers will know well. \u00a0We make decisions on behalf of our loved ones, sometimes involving life and death. \u00a0Medical professionals sometimes press us for a decision that we are not ready to make. \u00a0Often, we feel unprepared to make life changing decisions on the part of our loved one, just as Martin Pistorius felt when faced with his need to choose his speech generating software.  \n \nI like the advice of Pistorius Sr. \u00a0This father's remark, \"Sometimes you just have to choose, even if it turns out badly\" changed his Martin's vantage point and freed him to finally act. \u00a0Like Martin Pistorius, I am a serial information gatherer. \u00a0But certainly there have been times in our family life when, even with mountains of data, I could not make up my mind about a surgery for Nicholas or a strategy to support my mother.  \n \nThe next time I find myself stuck at a crossroads, I'm going to choose, even if it turns out badly. \u00a0And if it does turn out badly, I must remember not to feel guilty - that's the implied 'other half' of Pistorius Senior's advice. \u00a0Because moving forward is always better than being paralysed by fear. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/01/overcoming-fear-by-moving-forward.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nDr. Donald Winnicott (1896-1971) was a British pediatrician and psychoanalyst who developed the theory of the \"good enough mother\" - a theory that, in my opinion, is highly relevant to caregivers of all ages.\u00a0 \n \nWinnicott described his theory this way: \n \n \"The good-enough mother...starts off with an almost complete adaptation to her infant's needs, and as time proceeds she adapts less and less completely, gradually, according to the infant's growing ability to deal with her failure\"  (Winnicott, 1953) \n \nWinnicott is using the word 'failure' to represent those instances when the mother, or caregiver doesn't meet every need of her charge, but rather allows her child to try and perhaps fail. \u00a0It is these 'failures' of the mother that allow the child to become adapted to the world, self-sufficient and free of total dependency on another. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nCaregivers move back and forth between supporting and letting go all the time. \u00a0At times of crisis, we are 'perfect mothers'. \u00a0But in times of relative calm, we let go a little and become 'good enough'. \u00a0Winnicott describes how damaging it is for the child when the mother is not capable of being 'good enough' - ever. \u00a0He thought that the true self of the child and the mother could be discovered in the trusting space of possibility when all parties are relaxed enough to play.  \n \n There's a pretty good  Wikipedia page  on Winnicott and I had to share this snippet for its delicious applicability to caregiving:\u00a0 \n \n A central theme running through Winnicott's work was the idea of play. \u00a0Winnicott thought that playing was the key to emotional and psychological well-being. By \"playing,\" he meant not only the ways that children of all ages play, but also the way adults \"play\" through making art, or engaging in sports, hobbies, humor, meaningful conversation, et cetera. At any age, he saw play as crucial to the development of authentic selfhood, because when people play they feel real, spontaneous and alive, and keenly interested in what they're doing.\u00a0 \n \n Winnicott must have been a superb caregiver himself. \u00a0By all accounts, he was a great listener and a compassionate man. \u00a0He was a nurturer and an enabler. \u00a0He certainly knew what it meant to 'hang out', to 'be real', to wile away the hours with a shared interest over a cup of tea.\u00a0 \n \n\n\n \n \nFor Winincott, the self was a very important part of mental and emotional well-being which played a vital role in creativity. He thought that people were born without a clearly developed self and had to \"search\" for an authentic sense of self as they grew. [38] \u00a0\"For Winnicott, the sense of feeling real, feeling in touch with others and with one's own body and its processes was essential for living a life.\" \n \nCaregivers intuitively feel 'real' and we are naturally aware of our own bodies in relation to others'. \u00a0We are in touch with others constantly and so feel 'real'. \u00a0I've  blogged before about being real as a caregiver  and how irony is not part of our natural state of being. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWinnicott wrote: \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n a mother is neither good nor bad nor the product of illusion, but is a separate and independent entity: The good-enough mother ... starts off with an almost complete adaptation to her infant\u2019s needs, and as time proceeds she adapts less and less completely, gradually, according to the infant\u2019s growing ability to deal with her failure. Her failure to adapt to every need of the child helps them adapt to external realities. 4 , 5 \n \n \nDr Winnicott\u2019s teachings boiled down to the fact that a good enough mother was better than the perfect mother. \u00a0Sometimes caregivers, especially in the case of Alzheimer's or dementia, move through a journey going in the opposite direction. \u00a0We may begin with 'good enough' and end in a pull towards 'perfection'. \u00a0But what if 'good enough' was the gold standard for all caregivers? \n \n \n \nWhat if, in leaving space for possibility, for failure, for authentic exchange, we may preserve our true selves and that results in good care? \u00a0Reading Winnicott, I want to go out and play. \u00a0I want to risk something for the sake of living in the moment. I want to seek out those intimate moments when I trust enough to let go my loved one's hand or to look away as they attempt a new skill. \u00a0Because at the end of the day, there is dignity in enabling imperfect humanity.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott#cite_note-38", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654842/#b4-0550239", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654842/#b5-0550239", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SxW84--yC1E/UsyVqRYXhNI/AAAAAAAABPg/T9-YK8cCEEU/s1600/goodenough.jpeg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/01/the-good-enough-motherdaughtercaregiver.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n Special needs children and their parents often have a long road ahead of\nthem, and in many areas, facilities and the overall understanding of special\nneeds children is still lacking. While beneficial things like integrated\nclasses are becoming more and more popular, special needs children can still\nfeel alienated from the community, as can the parents of a special needs child.\n \n \n \n \n In the communities we live in, there are still a lot of aspects of\nspecial needs children that are not understood by the general public \u2013\nespecially within the average school system. For that reason, many special\nneeds children are not valued the way they should be. \n \n \n \n As a parent, teaching the value of your special needs child and\ncombating the ways special needs children are not valued in our communities\nshould be important to you.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Image\nCourtesy of Shutterstock \n \n \n \n Special Needs Children Can\u2019t Compete  \n \n \n \n One of the most common things you hear parents and community members say\nabout special needs children is that while they deserve attention, they can\u2019t\ncompete with other children, especially in the classroom. While this is often\nan argument against integrated classes, the truth is that many special needs\nchildren can rise to the level of any child in a classroom with proper education. \n \n \n \n Just because a special needs child doesn\u2019t currently have the same\nskillset as another child doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be developed, worked on and\nimproved.  \n \n \n \n They Aren\u2019t Capable  \n \n \n \n Special needs children are often viewed as not as capable as other\nchildren within the community. The truth is that while special needs children\nmay need additional help and education in some aspects of life, that doesn\u2019t\nmean that they aren\u2019t fully capable in others.  \n \n \n \n Not all special needs children are incapable of doing many of the tasks\nthat their peers do, and simply assuming that they can\u2019t is a very\nclosed-minded view.  \n \n \n \n Special Needs Children Teach Compassion \n \n \n \n In the classroom and even on the playground, special needs children can\nhelp to teach compassion to their fellow classmates. Compassion isn\u2019t the same\nas feeling sorry for a special needs child \u2013 it simply means lending a hand to\na fellow human that needs help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Image\nCourtesy of Shutterstock \n \n \n \n \n \n Not only in a school setting but even in everyday life, compassion can\nbe taught by special needs children. Whether they are playing on a sports team\nwith other kids, in girl or boy scouts, or just simply with you at the\nsupermarket, people of all ages can learn to be compassionate just from being\naround them. \n \n \n \n They\u2019re A Burden to Society  \n \n \n \n Another common argument against integrated classrooms and even funding\nfor special needs programs is that special needs kids are a burden to society\nand don\u2019t have anything to offer. It\u2019s simply not true, and special needs\nchildren who get the education and attention they need are very likely to be\nable to perform in society. \n \n \n \n Who\u2019s to say that a child with special needs can\u2019t be a productive\nmember of society before they\u2019ve even been given a chance? \n \n \n \n Teaching Tolerance and Empathy  \n \n \n \n In addition to compassion, special needs children in our communities and\nschools help to teach tolerance and empathy \u2013 both for other special needs\nindividuals and for any individual who is seemingly different. While these\nmessages should be taught outside of interaction with special needs students,\nintegrated classrooms and regular interaction can really help children\nunderstand these concepts in a real world way.  \n \n \n \n Special needs children might not make up a large portion of our\ncommunities, but they are an important part \u2013 one that shouldn\u2019t be ignored or\nmarginalized. The misconceptions many people have of special needs children\nneed to be erased \u2013 corrected with education and knowledge of how helpful they\nreally can be to society. \n \n \n \n Otherwise, we\u2019ll be doing special needs children and their peers a great\ninjustice.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Tara Heath  is a freelance writer who resides in\nCalifornia.

They often juggle a huge number of tasks, running both their\nhousehold as well as that of the care recipient, and holding down a job while\ndealing constantly dealing with life\u2019s little and big emergencies.  \n \n \n \nThat workload combined with emotional and psychological toll\nthat comes with watching a family member suffer has a powerful impact on the\nhealth of the caregiver. One of most cited reasons for placing loved ones into\ncare homes is the declining health of the primary caregiver. In order to\ncontinue to be there for your loved ones, then, it is very important to protect\nyour own health. \n \n \n \n Support Programs   \n \nThere are a vast number of people in a situation similar to\nyours. The 15 million non-professional caregivers in the US provide  17 billion\nhours of unpaid care  to their spouses, parents, grandparents, and siblings\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia.   Many\ncaregivers suffer from feelings of isolation and excessive stress, not only\nfrom the amount of work, but also from the emotional strain of trying to help\nsomeone who may not even want, or understand that they need, help. Joining a\ngroup of people who really understand your situation can be a huge help\npsychologically and practically. \n \n \n \n Counseling \n \nCaregivers are much more likely than non-caregivers to\nsuffer from depression and anxiety issues. The idea that you might need\ncounseling sounds off-putting to many of us because of the stigma that comes\nwith the idea, but don\u2019t let that stop you. Counseling can not only improve\nyour own emotional state and give you someone who will keep an eye out for you,\nbut it can make you a better caregiver by providing you with another\nperspective and professional feedback on your specific situation. \n \n Doctor Visits \n \nAs a caregiver you probably spend more time in a doctor\u2019s\noffice than you\u2019d like, but when was the last time that you sat on the\nexamination table? \u00a0  72%\nof caregivers  report that they don\u2019t go to the doctor as often as they\nshould and twice as many caregivers as non-caregivers fail to fill out\nprescriptions due to the cost. Get to your doctor and make sure that you\u2019re\nphysically healthy, and get the help you need for any issues you may have.\nSimply ignoring possible problems will not make them go away and can eventually\ninterfere with your ability to continue to provide care for your loved one. \n \n \n \n Exercise \n \nCaregivers have higher stress levels, a higher risk of  heart disease  and diabetes,\nand a higher mortality rate than non-caregivers. Beside the issues we mentioned\nearlier, this is also result of the lack of time that caregivers have to\nexercise and pursue their own hobbies. Make the time to go out and exercise,\nand if your care recipient is able then take them along and relieve some of\nthat stress. Both of you can benefit greatly. \n \n \n \n Respite \n \nMany of the health problems caregivers face are a direct\nresult of the sheer volume of work that they have to do, and at the end of the\nday the only way to make it possible to take care of yourself is to reduce that\nvolume. Get help! Share the load with friends, other family members, or hire\nsomeone to give you the time you need to take care of yourself. Many senior\ncommunities also offer respite care. While this feels like we\u2019re somehow\nletting out loved one down, it\u2019s what will ultimately enable you to provide the\nbest care possible to your loved one the longest. \n \n \n \nJeff Anderson writes for  assistedliving.com  about elder care,\ncaregiving, and dementia issues. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JQOCpDlB1ic/UrNmt0DzanI/AAAAAAAABLc/7zLc2BpLedU/s1600/careself.jpeg", "http://www.alzheimers.net/resources/alzheimers-statistics-2013/", "http://www.caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/content_node.jsp?nodeid=1822", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12568816", "http://www.assistedliving.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/12/taking-care-of-yourself-as-long-term.html", "title": ""},

Delicious and fun! \n \n Christmas Canapes: \nSlice a cucumber into rounds. \u00a0On each round, put a dollop of blue cheese dip or a soft blue cheese. \u00a0Put a pecan or walnut on top. \u00a0Looks Christmassy and it's yummy. \n \n Dinner: \nBuy those cooked chickens from the rotisserie at the grocery store. \u00a0If you have several guests, put several on a tray. \u00a0Decorate with fresh rosemary sprigs and cranberries.  \n \n Mashed Sweet Potatoes:  \u00a0Pierce sweet potatoes with a fork and microwave till soft at high power. \u00a0(each potato takes about 7 minutes). \u00a0After they are cool, they peel easily. \u00a0Mash with margarine and a bit of cumin if you like that. \n \n Stuffing:  \u00a0Make up a box of Stove-top stuffing and throw in a few chopped pecans and chopped dried apricots.  \n \n Frozen Peas:  \u00a0Cook peas, toss in butter and a bit of grated lemon peel.  \n \n Dessert:   \nBuy decorated Christmas cookies and serve with candy cane ice cream. \u00a0My grocery store sells this at Holiday time, but if you don't have it, just crush candy canes and sprinkle them on vanilla ice cream.  \n \nServe the dinner on pretty paper plates on a matching paper tablecloth. \u00a0I bought lovely things (surprise!) at the dollar store this year for my Mum's Christmas time birthday lunch. \u00a0With real flowers on the table, it looked beautiful and no washing up! \n \nTo all my fellow caregivers, I wish you a care-Less lead-up to Christmas. \u00a0I hope you can relax and enjoy the company of your loved ones.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L9o01hKjSeU/UrhFzQT2mlI/AAAAAAAABLs/eZj4W-uEwEs/s1600/Christmas-relaxation.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C-kJuk77IVA/UrhF7igxwSI/AAAAAAAABL0/A0h99-CL0Cg/s1600/Christmas-vacation.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/12/the-care-less-christmas-dinner.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nThis morning, I have no intention of getting dressed. \u00a0I have a cold and sore throat, but I'm not complaining, because I'm tucked up in a cosy robe, reading in a blissfully quiet house. \u00a0An hour ago, I settled on the sofa with my coffee and \"The Guardian\" newspaper open on my laptop. \u00a0I began to read an article by Sara Maitland called  \"Why Do We Have Such a Problem With Being Alone? \" \u00a0Maitland is a fascinating woman and someone I instinctively like. \u00a0In her former life, she was a great hostess of interesting dinner parties and friend to many, a self-confessed 'chatterbox'. \u00a0Now, she lives alone in a remote moor in southwest Scotland. \u00a0The closest grocery store is 20 miles away.  \n \n \n \n \n \nMaitland questions why, in our society, we mistrust, fear or condemn those who would choose solitude as a lifestyle. \u00a0Her article is riveting for anyone who has ever had isolation thrust upon them, or has wished for and chosen solitude as a preferred state of being.  \n \nCaregivers know a lot about solitude, isolation, being alone, call it what you will. \u00a0Silence and solitude can be intolerable, especially for anyone with mental illness. \u00a0Even healthy people who are not used to being alone may feel anxious and desperate for company when alone. \u00a0Some may argue that our society, with its constant chatter of sound-bites, mini narratives and inspirational quotes has made us immune to the benefits of solitude - we have lost the knack of enjoying our own company.  \n \nSuch a state is a double blow for caregivers who feel a burden of care for their loved one. \u00a0Mystics and religious scholars write about what it means to be human and how, sometimes, we can find that meaning in silence and solitude. \u00a0Hans Reinders is a Christian scholar whose academic specialty is cognitive disability. \u00a0He quotes a mother of a young man with severe disabilities: \n \n For many, many years, I was confined to the house, \u00a0alone and without the support of friends or relatives. \u00a0My husband was at work all day and I was alone with Oliver and the other five children. \u00a0This enforced seclusion was difficult for me, I had a restless, seeking spirit. \u00a0Through Oliver, I was held still. \u00a0I was forced to embrace a silence and solitude where I was \"forced to prepare the way of the Lord.\" \u00a0Sorrow opened my heart and I \"died.\" \u00a0I underwent this \"death\" unaware that it was a trial by fire from which I would rise renewed - more powerfully, more consciously alive.  (Hans Reinders, \"Receiving the Gift of Friendship: Profound Disability, Theological Anthropology and Ethics\", 2008) \n \nI know what that mother is talking about - making peace with solitude and with oneself is a trying, but ultimately rewarding process. \u00a0That mother's son Oliver and my son Nicholas were the catalysts in helping us to understand this life lesson. \u00a0What I am talking about here is banishing the sense that the caregiver will constantly strive to be somewhere other than at peace and at home, giving care to someone she loves. \u00a0I think I am trying to say that the capability to be happy in solitude is an important element of the capability to give good care. \n \nSara Maitland has written several books about her chosen lifestyle and its meanings. \u00a0Here is what \nKathleen Jamie wrote in her Review of Maitland's  \"A Book of Silence\" : \n \n But what is silence? Well, that's the rub. It's more difficult to define than you might at first imagine, and much of the book is an exploration of different kinds and uses of silences, and different silent places: deserts, islands. Silence, it might be said, is that which the modern world is seeking to banish. The world, and human lives, have never been so noise-filled. It's not just talk, of course, but machinery and communications and entertainment. It's hard sometimes to imagine that the planet, without the internal combustion engine, is actually pretty quiet. Is it an absence or a presence? A liberation or a captivity? Silencing is what the oppressed suffer, and silence - or solitude, the two seem synonymous - is what the desert fathers sought.\u00a0 \n \n It's funny that I usually write about the benefits of support networks, of the benefits of sociability for caregivers and their loved ones. \u00a0But as caregivers, what are the tools we need to  derive \u00a0benefit from sociability? We need to connect in ways that reflect and respond to our authentic experience with matters of love, life and death. \u00a0Silence and solitude help us do that.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/11/why-society-problem-being-alone", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cPpHBOYEg70/UtF-tVp1CsI/AAAAAAAABP4/mhX6_d0FaHo/s1600/Sara-Maitland-in-Carlin-s-009.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/A-Book-Silence-Sara-Maitland/dp/1582436134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389457389&sr=8-1&keywords=A+book+of+silence"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2014/01/the-caregiver-benefits-of-silence-and.html", "title": ""},

300 . \u00a0  Since she is in the early stages of\nAlzheimer\u2019s, she is still capable of dressing herself, doing her makeup, and\nbeing relatively independent. \u00a0  However\u2014she\nstruggles (mightily) with remembering her own address, phone number, and the\nnames of her grandchildren. \u00a0  To her, she\nis still mom\u2014still the boss. \u00a0  To me, she\nis fading faster than I can grasp, and she needs to let me help her\u2014to let me\nbe the boss (at least occasionally!). \n \n \nThis Christmas, while family  \n was preparing to visit for the\nholidays, I had an epiphany that nearly drove me straight to panic. \u00a0  For years (literally longer than I can\nremember) my mother has been the master and commander of the dinner table\nmeal. \u00a0  My mother has always cooked with\npride and passion\u2014whether it was a week night after school meal or a\nThanksgiving feast that would make the Pilgrims blush. \u00a0  Lately, though, mom has been struggling with\nmaking mac and cheese (out of the box) and is in fact not allowed to turn the\nstove on unless somebody else is home with her. \u00a0\n \n \n \nSo it\u2019s not too difficult to imagine the sheer terror I felt\nwhen faced with the realization that most (if not all!) of the holiday cooking\nwould fall into my lap. \u00a0  I\u2019ll spare you\nthe bulk of my culinary stress (because honestly it could be a book\u2014I\u2019m talking\nlike an  Odyssey  length book   here) and instead share the sweet\nvictory that was delivered to me in the form of homemade sugar cookies. \n \n \nYears of attempted (read: \u201cattempted\u201d and not \u201csuccessful\u201d) recipes\nhad left me with the bleak realization that, at best, I was an \u201cokay\u201d\ncook. \u00a0  Well aware of my culinary\nlimitations, (and mom\u2019s newfound ones) I foolishly thought I was picking an\n\u201ceasy\u201d task when I decided to tackle the task of baking our holiday-staple\u2014sugar\ncookies. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI should have switched gears and put my sister in charge of\nbaking after I took one look at the yellowed piece of paper I had (finally!)\nlocated nestled between the

until only hints of the\ndirections remained. \u00a0  I went to the store\nand grabbed too much of each ingredient just to make sure I had enough (4 bags\nof flour, anybody?)\u2014I mean hey, you can never be too cautious. \u00a0  \n \n \nWhen I got home, I turned on the oven and began trying to\ndecipher if the recipe was calling for 3  1 / 2  cups of\nflour or 3  1 / 2  bags (I was pretty sure this was an\nimportant distinction). \u00a0  I heard rustling\nbehind me, and turned around to see mom cracking into one of the flour bags and\ncarefully measuring out a cup full. \u00a0

wet ingredients.\u201d  \n \n \nMy mouth must have been open (and I\u2019m sure I was staring)\nbecause mom repeated her instructions slowly. \u00a0\n My mother, whom I didn\u2019t trust to make mac and cheese out of a box\nbecause, prior to not being allowed to use the stove, she had (twice) forgotten\nthat she\u2019d started cooking and left an empty pot on a hot burner\u2014could remember\nthe basics of this cookie recipe. \u00a0  She\ncouldn\u2019t remember the specifics but I could see it in her eyes\u2014this\nfamiliarity, the memory of making this recipe for the past 40+ years\u2014in this\nmoment she was my mom. \u00a0  She was in\ncharge. \u00a0  \n \n \n I know next year it won\u2019t even be close to the same for us\u2014so\nthis year I drove mom nuts (nothing new here, let\u2019s be honest) because I kept\nholding up production. \u00a0  I took tedious notes\non the whole baking process that would make Da Vinci proud. \u00a0  Next year I will again attempt to do

{"date": "", "body": "\nMy son Nicholas has been seen by a dentist many times, but he's never really had his teeth examined. \u00a0He's never had a dental x-ray and he's never had his back teeth scaled and polished. \n \nNick has severe cerebral palsy and for him, that means he has an uncontrollable bite reflex. \u00a0He'll chomp down hard on anything in his mouth, including the dentist's finger. \n \nNow that our young man is 25 years old and we can actually see a cavity in one of his molars, we began investigating dental treatment options. \u00a0A couple of months ago, we went to the dental clinic at our local hospital - the destination for anyone in our city whose health condition makes dentistry impossible at a typical walk-in clinic. \u00a0\"Oh, your son's teeth look great!\" exclaimed the petite blonde dentist. \u00a0\"But if he's never had an x-ray, we'll have to do that. \u00a0He'll have to be asleep for that here at the hospital. \u00a0We can do whatever work is required at the same time.\" \u00a0I nodded, thinking she meant light sedation with me in the room to monitor Nick's comfort and be his 'translator'. \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0I forgot how  not  normal we are. \n \n \n \n \nYesterday, we all went along to the hospital for the pre-operative assessment and five hours later, I came home with instructions to prepare Nicholas for a general anaesthetic with intubation. \u00a0A nurse from the care home where Nick now lives will have to come with us in order to closely monitor his respiration in the recovery room. \u00a0In the old days, this was my role in our children's hospital, but adult hospitals prohibit anyone but a qualified healthcare professional from entering the recovery room. \n \nMy husband and I weighed the risks of a general anaesthetic against the benefits of routine dental work. \u00a0 Before the signing the consent for surgery, we consulted again with the dentist. \u00a0She remarked, \"We do not know the condition of Nick's back teeth. \u00a0If he develops an abscess or other painful infection, he will need to wait until an operating room becomes available. \u00a0That could take days or even weeks, because a painful tooth will not be a priority.\" \u00a0 For us, that sealed the deal. \u00a0This Friday, we will be at the hospital to have a routine dental checkup in a very abnormal manner.  \n \nFor caregivers, lots of mundane tasks and routine responsibilities are anything but normal. \u00a0Perhaps for us, normal is our own personal way of getting through the day and getting the job done.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KzIViTZZzVI/UpaJQZ9LFnI/AAAAAAAABHM/_4a4gsTofpU/s1600/notnorma.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/11/when-normal-isnt-normal-trip-to-dentist.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n Last week, I visited my Mom for the day. \u00a0Her seniors' residence is a couple of hours away by car, so when I go, I stay for as long as I can. \u00a0There's a lot I can do to be helpful in her apartment, so I try to make the trip every couple of weeks.\u00a0 \n \n I know Mom enjoys my company, and I enjoy hers. \u00a0She doesn't get out of her apartment very often, largely because she's off the meal plan. \u00a0The daily ritual of getting dressed, going downstairs and sitting in the dining room with friends is not one that appeals to my mother. \u00a0There are many reasons for this, chief among them that the food being served is neither appetising nor digestible for my Mom's very sensitive stomach. \u00a0 \n \n So, my sister delivers groceries or food and I do too, when I can. \u00a0Last week I shopped and then made lamb chops, wax beans, sweet potato and apple crisp. \u00a0I asked Mom if she would eat it and she replied, \"Well, I'll eat the apple crisp!\" \u00a0She was only half joking. \u00a0I know she might take a bite of sweet potato, but the rest may well go in the garbage. \n \n But it's not only food that Mom is missing by not dining with friends. \u00a0It's company and conversation. \u00a0Preparing food and eating together is powerful social medicine. \u00a0No one knows this better than contemporary artists who seek to disrupt our daily habits and help us to see the ordinary as EXTRAordinary. \u00a0 \n \n Theaster Gates  is a Chicago based artist who inspires me to seek out an excuse to celebrate everyday living in offbeat ways. \u00a0A former urban planner, Gates \u00a0 re-purposes abandoned buildings in Chicago's South Side to help others \"understand the beauty that's embedded in [them].\" \u00a0But he doesn't stop there. \u00a0Gates invites the neighbors over - he hosts 'feasts' along with a facilitated conversation about the meaning inherent in found objects, in an obsolete library archive, in old rafters and of course in each other.\u00a0 \n \n Theaster Gates' jazzed up derelict building is called \"The Dorchester Projects.\" \u00a0Here he is talking about his idea for transforming something old, familiar, ugly and worthless into something beautiful, interesting, valuable and unique: \n \n \n \n \n Gates' work is important for caregivers because our surroundings can become embedded with drudgery, guilt, resentment, anger or hopelessness. \u00a0Gates gives us the spark to shift our vision of our surroundings by making a new recipe, having a 'different' kind of conversation and generally shaking things up at home till we glimpse a bit of sparkle and the potential of hope. \n \n CAREGIVER IDEA: \u00a0Lots of people have collections of one sort or another. \u00a0Take out a collection belonging to your loved one and look at each object. \u00a0Why is it important? \u00a0Is each collectible associated with a memory? \u00a0Invite a neighbor, friend or relative over to share in partaking of your 'home museum exhibit'. \u00a0 \n \n Other artists working with food and perception are Jon Rubin and Dawn Weleski who created \" Conflict Kitchen\" restaurant in Philadelphia . \u00a0Conflict Kitchen serves up food from countries that are in conflict with or at war with the United States. \u00a0The restaurant website explains the project's mission this way:\u00a0 \n \n Conflict Kitchen is a restaurant that only serves cuisine from countries with which the United States is in conflict.

{"date": "", "body": "\nChristmas is a stressful time for caregivers. \u00a0We buy gifts for our own families, help our loved ones to give, cook our best loved traditional recipes, enable and host holiday social events, all while carrying out our usual caregiving tasks. \u00a0We love to give, but we need others to remember our needs, too.  \n \nThe act of giving thoughtful gifts is potent medicine. \u00a0Last Christmas, I wrote a  post about the power of giving , especially at Christmas. \u00a0My Mom loves to give gifts to her children and grandchildren, but she can't get out to shop anymore. \u00a0This year, my sister and I are helping her to feel empowered by giving. \u00a0We are exploring online shopping with Mom using the Ipad that we gave her for her 90th birthday two years ago. \u00a0Giving is a potent enabler for everyone. \u00a0This is a story that I wrote last year: \n \nI was just 22 years old when my husband Jim and I were posted to Moscow in 1978. \u00a0It was the Brezhnev era and we were nervous about living in a faraway foreign land. But, Jim and I had slogged over Russian language lessons for a year before we left, so we felt somewhat prepared. \u00a0Of course, that was a long time ago and way before our children arrived on the scene. \n \nOur time in the USSR was a great adventure and we made good friends both in the diplomatic corps and within the 'refuznik' community of Muscovites (those who had applied to leave Russia, but had been refused an exit visa). \n \nJim and I assumed that Eastern Europe would be our future work focus, but when Nicholas was born with disabilities, those plans were de-railed. \u00a0In fact, our colleague and friend from our 1970's Moscow days, Rod Irwin, was later named Canadian Ambassador to the Russian Federation. \n \nIt was Rod's wife Penny who introduced me to the remarkable Moscow charity,\u00a0 Maria's Children. \u00a0\u00a0Maria Yeliseyeva is a Moscow artist who has taught painting and textile arts to, over the years, thousands of orphans, including those with disabilities. \u00a0A few years ago, when Penny and Rod returned to Canada from their time in the Ambassador's official residence in Moscow, Penny dropped over to give me a gift. \u00a0It was a quilt. \u00a0Not a large bedspread type of quilt, but an artwork depicting a Russian countryside winter scene. \u00a0It was beautiful. \u00a0It was clearly made with joy, imagination and love, not to mention great skill. \n \n \n \n \nPenny told me her story of visiting Maria's Children and noticing the children with cerebral palsy. \u00a0She told Maria about our family and about Nicholas. \u00a0Maria pressed the quilted picture into Penny's hand, saying \"Please take this and give it to your friend in Canada. \u00a0It will be a great thrill to the children who made it. \u00a0You see, they have grown up in an orphanage and they have never before given a gift to anyone. \u00a0This is a great opportunity for them.\" \n \nI've never forgotten those children and their gift to us. \n \nI wonder who gives a gift to Maria, though. \u00a0Who cares for the caregiver? \u00a0If she is like a lot of folks who spend all their time tending to the needs of others, she might not even know what a gift of self-comfort might look like. \u00a0Caregivers need to take ownership of their own needs, especially if they are caring for someone over the long term. \u00a0So, make a list of gift ideas for yourself today. \u00a0If you think, \"What could I ask for?\", start  HERE .  \n \nGiving comes in many forms....giving to others, helping others to give and enabling others to give to you. \u00a0All these types of giving are good for the mind, body and soul. \u00a0But remember the most important person on your list - you! \u00a0'Tis the season! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mariaschildren.ru/content/view/141/96/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R4A1fWHjfts/UM0NfHRsL_I/AAAAAAAAAiM/czihbletK4Y/s1600/ottepel.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/caregiverspace/gifts-for-caregivers/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/12/a-caregiver-christmas.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n There have been times around the holiday season of giving when I have\nthought, \u201cI give to others every day. \u00a0  Will anyone\ngive to me? \u00a0  If they do, what do I need\nor want?\u201d \u00a0  I wasn\u2019t thinking of a sweater\nor a new pair or socks \u2013 I was thinking of care. \u00a0  I was daydreaming about someone caring for\nme, the caregiver. \u00a0  \n \n Eva Feder Kittay is a philosopher and mother of an adult daughter,\nSesha, who has severe cognitive disabilities. \u00a0\n Eva also cared for her ailing and elderly mother until last year. \u00a0  \n \n Eva coined the word  doulia  to\ndescribe a new paradigm for reciprocity for caregivers in the community. She\ndescribes doulia as an ethical principle that recognizes giving care as an\nimportant contribution to the overall good of society. \u201cWe can ask whether\nparents or kin who assume the role of caregiver should have claims on the\nlarger society to support them in their efforts to provide care. If, for all\nthe effort and care in raising a child with disabilities into adulthood, there\nis no payback (conventionally understood) to the society at large, can we still\ninsist that there be a state interest in helping families with the additional\nburdens of caring for a developmentally disabled child? Is there a state\ninterest in assuring families that their vulnerable child will be well cared\nfor when the family is no longer able or willing to do so?\u201d [i]  Kittay\nanswers her own question with a resounding yes and that response is rooted\nfirmly in her own mothering experience. She describes a concept of\ninterdependency or \u201cnested dependencies\u201d that recognizes the inevitability of\ndependency as a fact of being human. It is via the idea of doulia that\nreciprocity can be realized through policy because the driving force is an\nequality that \u201cour full functioning presumes our need for and ability to participate\nin relationships of dependency without sacrificing the needs of dependents or\ndependency workers.\u201d [ii] \n \n \n Here Kittay is advocating an ethical framework and moral obligation for\nsociety to look after caregivers so that caregivers can carry out that care\nwithout sacrificing their own wellbeing. She is talking about \u2018payback\u2019 for the\ncaregiver. \u00a0  \n \n We know doulia as friends and family members who help a new mother by\nwatching the older children and performing household chores so that the mother\ncan give total care to her newborn. Implicit in this natural family tradition\nis the understanding that the mother is \u201cowed\u201d care because she is giving care\nto a much loved, highly vulnerable newborn. Her first priority is to give the\nbest care possible to her beloved charge.  \n \n Over the past few years, I have been thinking about how to ignite a\nwholesale shift in thinking about care across society. \u00a0  Kittay\u2019s ideas about doulia and inevitable,\nnested dependencies provide a great jumping off point for a new conception of\ncare for the caregiver. \u00a0  \n \n But where do these ideas lead, practically speaking? \u00a0  Well, I believe that employers should have a\ntwo-pronged corporate social responsibility program \u2013 family care and community\ncare. \u00a0  Assuming that some employees have\ncaregiving responsibilities that are sometimes onerous, causing them to claim\nsick days or leave to look after a critically ill spouse, elderly parent or\nchild with a disability, the company could and should support its own. \u00a0  The second prong of the corporate social\nresponsibility strategy would be a focus on the needs of the greater\ncommunity. \u00a0  Another idea would be to have\nlocal volunteer bureaus match families with volunteers. \u00a0  My local volunteer bureau matches only\nwilling helpers with agencies, never with needy private citizens. \u00a0  \n \n Kittay is right. \u00a0  We don\u2019t blink\nan eye when people rush to help with household chores of the new mother. \u00a0  We instinctively know that she needs to have\nher full attention on caregiving and the duty of others is support that\nrole. \u00a0  So why are older caregivers any\ndifferent? \u00a0  They aren\u2019t. \u00a0  And if long-term caregivers don\u2019t receive\nlong-term support, they and their charges will suffer. \u00a0  Doulia is a concept worth thinking about and\nacting upon this giving season and all year round.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n [i]  Eva Feder  Kittay,\n\u201cWhen Caring Is Just and Justice Is Caring: Justice and Mental Retardation,\u201d  Public Culture , 13.3 (2001): 565. \n \n \n\n \n [ii]   Kittay,  Love\u2019s Labor , p. 132. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aNVkv4Pf4eE/UqbqycGR99I/AAAAAAAABKM/PEx8Lrng5nQ/s1600/GivingBackjpgTxt1.jpg", "http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1489173439865061632#_edn1", "http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1489173439865061632#_edn2", "http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1489173439865061632#_ednref1", "http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1489173439865061632#_ednref2"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/12/a-concept-for-giving-back-to-caregivers.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nWhat does pain look like in a person who cannot speak? \u00a0Most often with Nicholas, it looks like this: \n \n \n \nWhen his smile suddenly turns to a 'stricken' look, we know that Nick is in pain. \u00a0There are other signs too - sweaty palms and feet, high heart rate, staring, not responding in his usual way, and whispering \"ow\". \u00a0We know the signs of Nicholas' pain and we know how to soothe him. \n \nBut what about pain in those we love who have severe communication and cognitive impairments - loved ones with Alzheimer's, severe dementia, and certainly severe cognitive disabilities? \u00a0They may feel pain, but sometimes cannot express it in ways that family members and medical professionals can understand.  \n \nYesterday, I listened in to a  webinar about pain  in children with severe developmental disabilities. \u00a0It was presented by the Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres, but there was plenty of information and practical advice about loved ones of any age who are unable express the pain they feel. \n \n73.5% more children with severe disabilities experience pain compared to their able-bodied peers, according to reporting by their parents. \u00a0Pain can arise as a result of simple activities of daily living, assistive devices (such as seating), acute pain from conditions such as dislocated hips or bony contractures as well as chronic pain resulting from immobility. \u00a0Gastric pain is another significant culprit in the discomfort experienced by children with severe disabilities. \n \nPain specialists and webinar presenters  Dr. Frank Symons and Dr. Frank Oberlander  described three types of pain: \u00a0physiological pain, inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. \u00a0Each type requires different management, and when the type of pain is difficult to discern, often the treatment is wrong. \n \nDr. Symons and Dr. Oberlander discussed their research interest in finding objective measures for pain that could be useful when simple observation does not give the family or treatment team good information about the source of patient distress. \u00a0Small changes in saliva, blood, cerebrospinal fluid or hormones are all under investigation as potential markers for the type and level of pain.  \n \nNicholas has had chronic pain for much of his life and at times, his pain has been uncontrolled. Screaming was an indicator that we all understood, but very often we had great difficulty in locating the source of his distress. \u00a0He has always been on oral opioids to alleviate pain from hip dislocations and nerve pain. \u00a0But I recall on one occasion, Nick was screaming in agony night after night. \u00a0I changed his feeding schedule, adjusted medications, cuddled him, fed him, massaged him... nothing worked. \u00a0Finally, in desperation, I arranged an admission to the hospital for observation. \u00a0I recall the treating physician suggesting that in the absence of any other ideas, we would treat constipation aggressively while we waited for other tests to be completed. \u00a0After three days, Nick's screaming suddenly stopped. \u00a0X-rays of his abdomen showed that Nick was impacted high in his intestine and the bowel regimen had worked. \u00a0Treating pain in non-speaking loved ones can be a crap shoot (forgive the pun!) and that time, we simply got lucky. \n \n \n \n \n The International Institute for the Study of Pain uses a scale of 1-10  with corresponding facial expressions. \u00a0But everyone is different and although the facial pain scale is a helpful tool for some, it didn't apply to Nicholas. \u00a0His facial expression for extreme pain is most often a look of extreme surprise or 'frozen fear'. \u00a0When we observe sweaty palms and feet together with a high heart rate, we look for a source of pain and if we can't find one, we treat it anyway. \u00a0The lesson here is to find a pain scale that is individual and fairly reliable for that person.  \n \nDoctors Symons and Oberlander candidly discussed the challenges facing the pain specialist when treating patients who cannot communicate their experience in ways that are easily understood. \u00a0This state of affairs can easily lead to the team doubting their diagnosis. \u00a0In that case, Dr. Oberlander asks, \"Do we even need a diagnosis? \u00a0When should we stop the unending search for a diagnosis? \u00a0Is the symptom itself a diagnosis?\" \u00a0Clearly, treating patients with severe disabilities poses difficult challenges for the team and also for the family caregivers who don't know how or what to report to doctors, other than symptoms that may or may not be significant. \u00a0 Dr. Oberlander suggests that it's better to resist seeking a single diagnosis. \u00a0For example, he says, not all irritability is derived from physical pain. \u00a0Some non-pain events such as seizures can cause distress. \u00a0Or, in the case of cerebral palsy, seizures can trigger increased spasticity which in turn can trigger increased pain due to dislocated joints or other orthopaedic problems.  \n \nThere are many reasons that pain management can fail a person who has severe disabilities and communication difficulties. \u00a0We are fortunate that Nicholas can say a clear 'Yes' and 'No'. \u00a0 So, Nick can tell us if he has 'no pain', 'some pain' or 'a lot of pain'. \u00a0But because he very afraid of going to the hospital if he reports a lot of pain, often he will simply fib and under-report his discomfort. \u00a0We need to watch carefully for subtle signs and we give extra pain meds based on what we observe. \n \nWhen we watch our loved ones who cannot speak, we realise that what they experience and what they express are not the same thing. \u00a0We must watch carefully, identify indicators and develop our own custom pain scales the best we can. \u00a0Caregivers have many roles and being the voice of pain for someone you love is one of the most vital. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--tSzw8BEY20/Uo6rKXEICFI/AAAAAAAABGo/29XsE-89_7o/s1600/golf.jpg", "http://ken.caphc.org/xwiki/bin/view/ChildrensPain/Pain+in+children+with+developmental+disabilities_What+to+do+when+everything+fails", "http://ken.caphc.org/xwiki/bin/view/ChildrensPain/Pain+in+children+with+developmental+disabilities_What+to+do+when+everything+fails", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wzzHUxdsOHo/UpFtAc9_5dI/AAAAAAAABG4/Bkx2eXUcGtA/s1600/Wong+Baker+FACES+Pain+Rating+Scale+Emergecy+Medicine+Practice_1.JPG", "http://www.iasp-pain.org/Content/NavigationMenu/GeneralResourceLinks/FacesPainScaleRevised/default.htm"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/11/caring-for-patient-in-pain-who-cant.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Nearly every day I see stories in the media of people with disabilities being abused. (For example, the case of\u00a0 Ethan Saylor, the young man with Down Syndrome who was killed by police when he went to the cinema) . \u00a0 But I normally don't blog about them because I am not a rights activist - I'm more of solution-based peacenik, albeit a very determined one.  \n \n But today is different. \u00a0This morning, I received a message from a respected colleague,  Eva Kittay . \u00a0Eva is a distinguished professor of moral philosophy at SUNY and she's also the mother of a young woman with cognitive disabilities. \u00a0Eva's work has strongly influenced my thinking about what makes us equal as humans... ALL of us, including those whose capacity to reason is seriously compromised.  \n \n Eva sent me a  story about a young man with Down Syndrome in Miami Florida who had been beaten by the police . \u00a0What made this story so heartbreaking is that young Gilberto Powell (aged 22) is very, very vulnerable. \u00a0He was walking the short distance home from a friend's house when he was stopped by police. \u00a0Gilberto became afraid and tried to run home, but he was caught and beaten because police said they felt threatened by a 'bulge under the suspect's shirt'. \u00a0Gilberto was punched in the face and knocked to the ground. \u00a0His 'bulge' was torn from his body. \u00a0The 'bulge' turned out to be a colostomy bag. \u00a0When Gilberto's distraught mother implored the officer to explain how he didn't know her son had Down Syndrome, the policeman replied, \"I'm not a medical doctor\".  \n \n I was in the kitchen today, telling my husband this story. \u00a0He looked up and declared, \"But everyone should rise up against the police - they should rise up just like they did for Trayvon Martin!\" \u00a0Then I remembered Barak Obama's words in the Martin case,  \" When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. \u00a0Another way of saying that is \u00a0 Trayvon Martin \u00a0 could have been me 35 years ago.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n How many fathers in America would look at the image of Gilberto's Powell's bloody, bruised face with the same father's love and recognition of his 'son'? Would the President ever recognise someone with Down Syndrome as 'his son'?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Eva Kittay's central thesis about the human worth of people with cognitive disabilities is the idea that \"we are all some mother's child. \u00a0 Relationships of caring form the conduits of\nworth. \u00a0We should also observe\nthat the capacity to give care and to acknowledge the bonds forged through care\nto one are not merely a precondition for a \u2018proper\u2019 morality \u2013 characterised as\npractical moral reasoning.\u00a0 Giving and\nacknowledging care invoke a moral reasoning.\u00a0\nGiving and acknowledging care invoke a moral power through which we\nrespond to the intrinsic value of each individual.\u00a0 It is the fountainhead of that worth.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Kittay explains to us why tears dampen our cheeks when we read how an innocent young man is beaten by police - it is not just for him that we we weep, it is for his mother. \u00a0We instantly recognise the familial bond of love in this family and when a terrible injustice is done, we feel what they feel. \u00a0 \u201cThis is the dignity grounded in our common connection to\nothers in our need for care, in our dependency and vulnerability\nand in the worth actualised when other beings with intrinsic worth devote\nthemselves to our wellbeing\u2026..each one of us, equally, is worthy of dignity,\nfor we are all some mother\u2019s child.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n So, these stories of painful injustice are not just about THEM. \u00a0They are about US. \u00a0Gilberto Saylor could have been my son. \u00a0And Mr. President, he could have been your son, too. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/Health/syndrome-man-movies-ends-morgue/story?id=20046376", "http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/General_University_News_2/Stony_Brook_University_Faculty_Member_To_Distinguished_Professor_Rank.shtml", "http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhNQJ90mp0RLjQ9nir", "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/07/19/203660128/obama-trayvon-martin-could-have-been-me-35-years-ago", "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/07/19/203660128/obama-trayvon-martin-could-have-been-me-35-years-ago", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3aCDtwRW6fA/UnCCD1KMNsI/AAAAAAAABDo/L0iGmU88rL8/s1600/obama192way-0105b5eb8abe81f11baac35cad024b6e117fa60a-s40-c85.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-un6AJwwCvcs/UnCCjDwcA_I/AAAAAAAABDw/nQeBoJ_U9lk/s1600/powell.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/10/could-ethan-saylor-have-been-your-son.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Yesterday, newspapers in Canada announced an important Supreme Court ruling for caregivers and their families. \u00a0At issue was whether or not physicians had the unilateral right to withdraw life support from a patient on the basis that to continue life support was a) futile and b) that the withdrawal of life support did not constitute 'treatment' and therefore did not require consent from the family. \u00a0The physicians in this case are neurologists at Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital. \u00a0The patient in question is Hassan Rasouli, represented by his wife and daughter. \u00a0You can read about this case HERE.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The outcome of this case has important implications for people with disabilities, the elderly and their caregivers. \u00a0In fact, interveners in the case consisted of the\u00a0 Consent and Capacity Board, the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition, the\u00a0 Canadian Critical Care Society, the Canadian Association of Critical Care Nurses,\u00a0 the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly, ARCH Disability Law Centre,\u00a0 the Mental Health Legal Committee, HIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario and the\u00a0 Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. \u00a0 \n \n Reading about this sad and difficult case reminded me of something I wrote for  Al Etmanski's blog two years ago - \"What Are You Skating Towards\"  in which I was asked to identify a societal trend affecting caregivers. \u00a0Here is what I wrote: \n \n \n \n Over the last year, I have observed a pernicious trend toward labelling some people as unworthy of continued care. In 2012, I will be skating defensively toward it. Thanks to information technology, I have many friends all over the world who are also parents of children with disabilities. One family, from Australia, I have known \u2018virtually\u2019 for many years - their son has developmental disabilities, is medically complex and has managed to survive over 77 hospitalizations in his 23 years of life. This year, the professional advisory committee at their hospital took a unilateral decision that there would be no more ICU hospitalizations or resuscitation measures because these would \u2018not be in the best interest of the patient\u2019 and furthermore, they would be \u2018futile\u2019. It was my guess that a meeting of hospital administrators had taken place that basically placed a cap on the public funds that one individual could or should consume in a lifetime - especially if that individual had developmental disabilities. \n \n \n \nOf course one can never know whether the financial burden of keeping Mr. Rasouli alive at taxpayers' expense played into this case, but there is no denying that had the Supreme Court decision gone the other way, money  could  motivate the shutting down of life-sustaining treatment without family consent because a diminished life was deemed \"futile\" by physicians.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHere is what the Supreme Court justices wrote in  their decision :\u00a0 \n \n \n [34] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The physicians argue that treatment under the\u00a0HCCA\u00a0is limited to what the attending physician or caregiver deems to be of\u00a0medical benefit\u00a0to the patient\u00a0(in other words, what is medically indicated).\u00a0 Mr. Rasouli\u2019s physicians have concluded that life support no longer offers a medical benefit, despite keeping him alive, given his unconscious state and the extreme unlikelihood of his recovery.\u00a0 It follows, they argue, that the provision of life support to Mr. Rasouli has ceased to be treatment under the\u00a0HCCA, obviating the need for consent to its withdrawal.\u00a0 \n \n [35] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The difficulty with the physicians\u2019 argument is that it substitutes a physician-made criterion for treatment (medical benefit) for the criterion specified in the\u00a0HCCA\u00a0for consent (health-related purpose).\u00a0 These concepts sound similar, but they are in reality different. \n \n \nNote: \u00a0HCCA Stands for the  Ontario Health Care Consent Act . \n \n \n \nThe Supreme Court decision related solely to the laws governing consent at end of life in Ontario. \u00a0The fact that the court did not go further in clarifying the national laws regarding family consent when 'turning off' life support disappointed some. \u00a0But, it's a start. \u00a0And because I live in Ontario, I will sleep a little more soundly tonight knowing that doctors will never be able to withdraw the life support of someone I love without my consent.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FFw990NuSKg/UmKr7YGeIkI/AAAAAAAABB8/Xjrd-_179qs/s1600/rasouli.jpg", "http://www.aletmanski.com/al-etmanski/2012/01/donna-thomson-what-are-you-skating-towards-defence.html", "http://scc.lexum.org/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13290/index.do", "http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_96h02_e.htm"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/10/the-rasouli-case-and-why-it-matters-one.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nWhen I am in any kind of pain, I want people around me to look me in the eye.  \n \n \n \n \n \nHere's what got me thinking about eye contact: \u00a0a couple of weeks ago, I was sitting in a dermatology clinic chatting with the resident and a young medical student. \u00a0It was all very jolly until the doctor walked in carrying what looked like a cocktail spritzer bottle with a trigger handle. \u00a0He said, \"I'm going to spray liquid from this bottle directly on to two sun spots on your face. \u00a0It's going to really hurt.\" \u00a0\"It is?\" I asked weakly, looking at my new friend the resident. \u00a0He looked away and so did the med student. \u00a0I was on my own to deal with this painful procedure. \u00a0As it turned out, the stinging was significant, but not terrible. \u00a0And it's all healed nicely now. \n \nEye contact is a powerful kind of hand holding. \u00a0Sick people need it, people in pain need it and so do caregivers. \u00a0Eye gaze \u00a0says, \"I am with you. \u00a0You don't need to experience this alone. \u00a0What happens to you happens to me, too.\" \n \nAs I reflected on my little episode in the dermatology clinic, I remembered something I wrote in  my book  about when I had been unable to look my own son Nicholas in the eye when he was in his greatest hour of need. \u00a0Nick was 2 years old and had been diagnosed with severe GERD, or gastro-esophageal reflux. \u00a0We were advised that an operation to stop the reflux was necessary, but what we didn't know was how invasive it would be. \u00a0Similar to an open-heart procedure, Nick's tiny body couldn't manage the assault. \u00a0When he woke up from the operation, his cerebral palsy caused him to be in terrible spasm and pain. \u00a0This is what I remember: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n While Nicholas was in surgery, Jim and I passed the\nhours in the surgical waiting room.\u00a0 Time\ndragged on and finally, we decided to wait near Nick\u2019s bed on the ward.\u00a0 Another hour passed and I asked the nurse in\ncharge if she could find out when Nicholas would be back with us.\u00a0 It was dusk now and she said that Nicholas\nwas in recovery, but was \u201cbreath holding\u201d so they were keeping him a little\nlonger to monitor the situation.\u00a0 Twenty\nminutes later, a nurse and an orderly appeared down the hall wheeling a cot\ntowards us.\u00a0 Inside was Nick, his mouth\nopen and rigid, eyes wide with panic.\u00a0 He\ngasped, writhing, and exhaled a hoarse cry.\u00a0\nHe was in the room now, and we hovered like birds flapping\nuselessly.\u00a0 That night was the first, but\nnot the last time that I saw in my son\u2019s eyes a terrible pleading.\u00a0 I turned away and put my hand down on the\ncorner chair to support myself from falling.\u00a0\nJim warned \u201cDonna, you can\u2019t do this.\u00a0\nCome here!\u201d\u00a0 I came back to\nNicholas, murmuring apologies through tears. \n\n\n\n \n \nThere would be other times in Nicholas' life when his eyes would be windows on his panic and pain, but I would never look away again.  \n \nCaregivers look at their charge all the time... scanning for signs of decline, bed sores, fevers, or for changes in breathing and function. \u00a0We are expert observers. \u00a0But we need friends and family to look at us, too. \u00a0Caring and giving are words that tell us why - all of our energy is going out, to a person in need- often someone we love. \u00a0I often say that we cannot do this caring and giving alone. \u00a0We need companions in our loving work. \u00a0And one powerful way to be a friend of a caregiver to look them in the eye. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a7_uRbIJ1Mg/UnO09HxrzqI/AAAAAAAABEI/KnkmKQlPfs8/s1600/women-friends-comforting-al.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7JSUefkFwfc/UnO3kukiU_I/AAAAAAAABEU/piTJgs2uuGc/s1600/article-new-ds-photo-getty-article-128-187-medfr03638_XS.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/11/please-look-at-me.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThis morning, I stumbled upon an  article in the Guardian (UK) newspaper  that started like this: \n \n The officials who broke down Joyce Carol Vincent's door were meant to be serving an eviction notice. \u00a0 Instead they found her corpse slumped on the sofa, with the light from the TV still flickering over her . By 2006, she had lain there for almost three years.\u00a0 \n \n Aditya Chakrabortty writes about the sad death of 38 year Vincent and links it to a recent speech about social isolation by Jeremy Hunt, the UK Secretary of State for Health. \u00a0Hunt's speech is titled  \"The Forgotten Million\"  - he was talking about seniors in care homes. \u00a0 \n \n There is no doubt that loneliness is bad for everyone's health. \u00a0How bad? \u00a0Chakrabortty reports: \u00a0 \n \n Studies show that chronic loneliness wrecks one's health: pushing up stress levels, increasing blood pressure, disrupting sleep, even bringing on dementia. And, yes, it kills. The Chicago neuroscientist John Cacioppo, who has researched social seclusion for decades, has tallied up the harm posed by common health hazards. Air pollution increases your chances of dying early by 5%; obesity by 20%. Excessive loneliness pushes up your odds of an early death by 45%. \n \n Caregivers are experts in loneliness. \u00a0I have been thinking for years now about making friends with solitude - when I was alone at home with Nicholas managing crisis after crisis, I sought solace in my garden. \u00a0I hovered close to the telephone and waited for disaster. \u00a0This worried and distracted state of being is not conducive to small talk. \u00a0It seemed easier, somehow, to talk to plants. \u00a0At least they were healthy and they grew if I tended them - something I couldn't seem to accomplish with my son. \u00a0(He's much, much better now, I am happy to report!) \n \n Caring for someone you love who is very ill, in pain, confused or desperately sad is lonely work. \u00a0But it doesn't have to be so lonely that if we die, we wouldn't be found for three years. \u00a0No, there are some people who will offer to be present with us in our caregiving work. \u00a0Perhaps there will be just one person who isn't afraid to look your loved one in the eye after a catastrophic stroke. \u00a0Maybe there is an acquaintance who offers to be a friend when your husband is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's. \u00a0These are the unafraid, the champions of tough and compassionate witnessing. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n I remember reading about a study in New York City examining what kinds of help were helpful to the families touched by tragedy on September 11. \u00a0The results showed that the most helpful kinds of help were friends who came to the door with food... friends who stayed, listened and weren't afraid to witness terrible grief. \u00a0This is worth knowing, because if our society loses these skills, we will lose the ability to give good care and we will all suffer the real consequences of loneliness. \n \n T here is much that we can do to reorganise our communities and right now, there are clever people working on social design ideas to combat isolation. \u00a0Parks, schools, churches, apartment party rooms... these are all potential sites of deep conversation among friends. \u00a0With a little nudging and clever design, we can address the scourge of social isolation. \u00a0As Chakrabortty said in his Guardian piece, \"the flipside of economic individualism is loneliness.\" \u00a0And if we know that loneliness makes people sick and can even kill, then let's give it serious attention at all levels of society. \u00a0The easy, transient connections of facebook or twitter aren't going to cure what ails us. \u00a0Authentic, real time spent with compassionate friends will. \u00a0 \n \n Caregivers know about loneliness, but we're also experts in its remedies, too. \u00a0When you have been most lonely in your caregiving role, what helped? \u00a0Let's get this conversation started.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2Zg75CCdSrA/Um0nB7wtWdI/AAAAAAAABC4/GNvoJwyOzmg/s1600/loneliness.jpeg", "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/21/loneliness-result-britain-economic-model?utm_content=buffer78c28&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer", "http://www.blogger.com/goog_476803992", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/09/joyce-vincent-death-mystery-documentary", "https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-forgotten-million", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L7wuNzzDQzE/Um0oio37jEI/AAAAAAAABDE/q3_Rdt4g3Qk/s1600/friend-hug.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rS9YI-8MYlE/Um05d4cAwjI/AAAAAAAABDU/aeEcyK_VOSU/s1600/Kleinman.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/10/loneliness-and-caregiving.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \nRecently, two articles caught my eye. \u00a0One was a  Johns Hopkins study  showing that surprisingly, \u00a0caregivers live longer than their non-caregiving counterparts. \u00a0 The other article reported on the happiest country in the world according to the World Happiness Report - Denmark . \u00a0Why are Danes so happy? \u00a0Apparently, their society is one of equals supporting each other. \u00a0Denmark is a country based on \"WE\", not \"ME\". \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nHere in North America, we might have something to learn from looking at Danish society and putting their elements of happiness together with caregiver longevity. \u00a0Rather than aspiring to independence and the accumulation of personal wealth, we should consider championing the idea of interdependence and altruism. \u00a0It's making Danes happy and it's helping caregivers live longer - that sounds good to me. \u00a0 \n \nIt was the Johns Hopkins Center for Aging and Health that conducted the longevity study in caregivers. \u00a0John Roth, Center Director, admits that caregivers faced with levels of extreme stress along with little social support will certainly not be happy or healthy. \u00a0But, Roth says,\u00a0 \u201cIn many cases, caregivers report receiving benefits of enhanced self-esteem, recognition and gratitude from their care recipients. Thus, when caregiving is done willingly, at manageable levels, and with individuals who are capable of expressing gratitude, it is reasonable to expect that health benefits might accrue in those situations... If highly stressful situations can be avoided or managed effectively, caregiving may actually offer some health benefits for both the care recipients and the caregivers, including reduced risk of death for those providing care.\u201d \u00a0 \n \n So, what might government policies look like that take into account reasonable levels of caregiving? \u00a0Denmark has some answers to that question. \u00a0Some of the happiness indicators under review in the World Happiness Index were a sense of social support, freedom to make life choices and a culture of generosity. \u00a0Of course, these were in addition to financial wellbeing, healthy life expectancy at birth and a lack of corruption in political leadership. \u00a0The Danish government has programs that support parents - maternity and paternity leave is generous. \u00a0Danes believe that access to health care is an absolute right and the continuity of care is built in to a system that is based on the central role of the family physician. \u00a0Gender equality is ingrained in social assistance programs, enabling more women to work and contribute financially to their households. \u00a0Finally, Danish culture is one that cultivates a sense of optimism. \u00a0They combat the effects of an inhospitable climate with the hospitality of the home. \u00a0They seek out and share something called hygge - cultivated cosiness. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs a caregiver, I want to share 'hygge' with my loved ones at home every day. \u00a0I'm betting that if policymakers asked caregivers, we would have some really good ideas about what makes a happy and long life for ourselves and our families. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newswise.com/articles/johns-hopkins-led-study-shows-increased-life-expectancy-among-family-caregivers?ret=/articles/list&category=medicine&page=1&search%5Bstatus%5D=3&search%5Bsort%5D=date+desc&search%5Bsection%5D=10&search%5Bhas_multimedia%5D=", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/22/denmark-happiest-country_n_4070761.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PuapMPDQWtU/Umg-6mDinNI/AAAAAAAABCY/xntyuVYf1J4/s1600/we-not-me.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/10/caregivers-have-secret-to-long-and.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nThis morning, I had the pleasure of chatting with Scott McNabb, \u00a0Executive Director of  Homewatch CareGivers Canada . \u00a0Like many other passionate professionals in the caregiving field, Scott is a former caregiver himself. \u00a0Together with his sister, the McNabb siblings looked after their parents until they died. \u00a0Scott explained that his father was physically strong, but suffered from Alzheimer's. \u00a0And although his mother's mind was clear, her body was frail. \u00a0After learning difficult lessons from the front lines of caregiving, Scott wanted to help others, so he quit his job as an insurance executive and 'traded the board room for the living room'.  \n \nI was particularly interested in talking to Scott McNabb about his interest in supporting male caregivers. \u00a0Homewatch CareGivers is unique in hosting ' The Male Caregiver Community ', an online support forum for men\u00a0who give care to their loved ones. \u00a0In Canada, 46% of all caregivers are male and this trend away from traditional gender roles in caregiving is growing throughout North America and beyond. \u00a0More young fathers are taking advantage of paternity leave, while older men are looking after their spouses with illness or their children with disabilities. \u00a0As more women are employed and our society ages, it stands to reason that men will give care in ever greater numbers with each passing year. \n \nBut Scott McNabb maintains that men seek and benefit from caregiving support in ways that are different from women. \u00a0\"When I walk into a cocktail party, I see women congregate to share opinions and expertise on anything from eldercare to the purchase of new curtains. \u00a0Men don't do that. \u00a0They might talk about the latest hockey scores, but they don't discuss emotional topics in a public, social setting.\" \u00a0Scott McNabb knew first hand how difficult it was for him to find support during the ten years that he cared for his parents, so he decided to create a men's support group. \u00a0McNabb told me, \"When the men came to the support group without their partners, they opened up. \u00a0If someone expressed a particular challenge, there would always be others who would jump in with suggestions or advice. \u00a0When I get a call for help at Homewatch from a woman, it's usually because she is burnt out from trying to work, look after her children and give care to her aging parents, all by herself. \u00a0When I get a call from a man, it's usually at the beginning of the caregiving journey, because men tend to have a more managerial approach. \u00a0They research from the get-go and they tend to delegate right away. \u00a0Both are loving people, but they approach their caregiving responsibilities very differently. \u00a0And the support they need in caregiving is very different too.\" \n \n \n \n \nSo, the Men's Support Network was born. \u00a0McNabb believes that male caregivers appreciate the anonymity of the online information exchange and they need a place to find resources that are tailored for their unique life experience.  \n \nSomething tells me that Scott McNabb is on to something and that he is ahead of his time. \u00a0I'm going to show my husband The Men's Support Network. \u00a0I bet he'll love it. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5FLyjrvbqZc/Uk7ejih1vxI/AAAAAAAABAc/tlM5ZjrAups/s1600/male-caregiver-community-logo_bak.png", "http://www.homewatchcaregivers.com/find-a-caregiver/ontario", "http://www.malecaregivercommunity.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qf5uXkh1cpQ/Uk7eUy7f8jI/AAAAAAAABAU/H7EX2yeCkMk/s1600/homewatch-030234.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/10/male-caregiver-community-because-men.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n A stranger asks, \"What do you do?\". \u00a0They really mean, 'do you WORK?'. \u00a0When you reply that you care for a loved one, they look past your shoulder, scanning the room for an escape route.  At the grocery store, someone you used to know walks by, averting their eyes. \u00a0Conversations with people apart from other caregivers can be difficult and sometimes hurtful. I am a caregiver who has never had a 'proper' job since Nicholas was born twenty-five years ago.  I have certain sensitivities and sometimes, I take a chilly greeting personally.  During the years when Nicholas was constantly in hospital and often in crisis, I would say this to the doctors:  \"I really need you to be nice to me.  I mean it.\"  I did not know any other way to express the fact that a small slight, a critical gaze,  or an unkind word could shatter what bit of resilience I had left to get through the day.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0   Eva Kittay recognises this chink in the armor of caregivers because she is one herself (when she is not teaching moral philosophy at SUNY Stony Brook).  Eva describes the phenomenon of the 'transparent self' of the caregiver - \u201ca self through whom the needs of another are discerned, a self that, when it looks to gauge its own needs, sees first the needs of another\u201d.  Kittay argues that the moral requirements of a dependency relationship make the transparent self indispensable.  This labor of love is simultaneously responsive to the needs of others, exhibiting care - it cultivates intimacies and trust between humans.  Both care and concern contribute to the sustainability and connectedness fundamental in dependency relationships, but it leaves the caregiver vulnerable.  Prolonged transparency of the self can lead to clinical depression at the worst and the absence of empowerment to act on one's own behalf at the least. \n \n \n My clumsy response to being too transparent for too long was to beg those around to 'be nice to me'.   Looking a caregiver straight in the eye with real interest (not sympathy) is tonic to the caregiver soul.  Asking her (or his) opinion about a shared experience, even if it's what she thinks about the color of the sky - \u00a0demonstrates a respect for that part of the person which is not a caregiver.\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \"What do you do?\" is a question that most caregivers despise. \u00a0Somehow caring for a person you love doesn't stack up alongside occupations like doctor, lawyer or even office manager.  New mothers on maternity leave from high powered jobs very often complain that work comrades avoid them or don't include them in professional banter.  For long-term caregivers, respectful, authentic and engaging conversation is hard to come by.  So, if you happen to overhear someone say \"I just need you to be nice to me\", make eye contact, elicit a few opinions and share a personal reflection.  And by all means, don't ask \"What do you do? \u00a0Do you work?\" \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4AqnhSpiMY0/UkNea2KWNpI/AAAAAAAAA_4/SLh5t_mS8Iw/s1600/eminem.jpeg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gU8wgjaomIs/UkNcVj93C-I/AAAAAAAAA_k/tUkc5b25W-Y/s1600/different.jpeg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-POZGe4j4t5E/UkNdPVQ_QQI/AAAAAAAAA_s/YbcRJlnE8yk/s1600/you-are-not-alone45.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/09/so-do-you-work.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Guest Post \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As only a part-time caregiver to my grandmother,\nI feel fortunate that her caregivers are both caring and attentive to her needs\nand respect her as an individual. However, I\u2019m all too aware that senior\nneglect and abuse are widespread in some nursing homes and retirement\ncommunities. However, these circumstances aren\u2019t always mean-spirited. Even\nwell-meaning individuals with sound moral reasoning can accidentally neglect\nthose that they care for. \n \n \n \n In dealing with those in need on a daily basis,\nmany of those in caregiving and medical professions experience what is called\nsecondary traumatic stress, or what is more simply known as  compassion\nfatigue . This results in increased stress and anxiety,\nand creates indifference or even an extremely negative attitude towards others.\nSome studies have found that up to 85% of health care workers experience at\nleast one symptom of compassion fatigue.  \n \n \n \n Being aware of the risks that this can have\ntowards one\u2019s professional performance \u2013 and more importantly, how this can\nmanifest itself as abuse and neglect towards those who need their help \u2013 is an\nessential duty of every caregiver. If you are in the care of a neglectful\ncaregiver, or are related to a family member whom you suspect to be a victim,\nyou should first attempt to contact your nursing home supervisor. If their\nresponse is defensive or dismissive, or if they do not respond at all, it might\nhelp to seek the counsel of a  nursing home abuse\nattorney . \n \n \n \n To help improve awareness of the various ways\nthat seniors can be neglected, here are three aspects of wellness that are\noften forgotten in cases where patient neglect occurs. By remembering these\ntips, caregivers can improve the overall well-being of senior citizens in their\ncare. \n \n 1 \n \n . \u00a0.. Routine physical activity \n \n Seniors often feel a desire to isolate themselves\nand refrain from physical activity, so leaving them to stay in bed can be\nall-too-easy when it seems to be their preference. Staying in bed can cause\nserious physical side effects, such as infection-prone bedsores and muscle\natrophy, but the mental impact of staying in bed all day is nearly as damaging.\nEven those with physical disabilities should get out of bed on a daily basis. \n \n 2 \n \n . \u00a0.. Emotional well-being \n \n When dealing with a lot of patients with serious\nconditions on a daily basis, it can be difficult to remain empathetic to their\nconcerns. Reaching out to patients to express authentic concern for their needs\nis an essential way to help seniors feel like they aren\u2019t simply mouths to\nfeed. No matter what their situation is, establishing and maintaining an\nemotional connection with patients is an essential part of the caring process. \n \n \n \n 3. \u00a0 Social connection \n \n One of the best reasons that senior care\nfacilities are favored for many retirees is that these places provide an area\nwhere elders can coexist with others who share common interests, face similar\nissues, and socially connect as equals in ways that a caregiver-patient\nrelationship cannot achieve. However, this independence also provides seniors\nan avenue to isolate themselves, which can be detrimental to them when allowed\nfor long. Caregivers should always help seniors maintain an active social life,\nwhich is necessary to maintain a positive outlook. \n \n It can be easy to overlook the individuality of\npatients when dealing with occupational stress. But the wellness of those in\ncare is too valuable to society to ever put on hold due to personal problems,\nand keeping these tips in mind while attending patients can help make sure that\nseniors are never neglected on your watch. Whether you\u2019re a family member or a\nprofessional on the field, it\u2019s always worthwhile to maintain compassionate and\nresponsive to the needs of our elders. \n \n \n \n About\nthe author:  Alan Brady is a writer who visits\nhis grandmother bi-weekly to lose at Scrabble and check up on her. He advocates\nfor greater awareness of caregiver neglect, which he sees as one of the leading\ncauses of senior depression. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K0fLLlXDVns/UmBisG46zpI/AAAAAAAABBs/VWGVtOturOw/s1600/walker.jpeg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_fatigue", "http://www.attorneys.com/personal-injury/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/10/for-caregivers-three-tips-on-protecting.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n I am a fan of massage therapy. \u00a0Massage has helped to alleviate my chronic neck and back pain - the result of years of lifting my son Nicholas, who is now 25 and is disabled with cerebral palsy. \u00a0But I have also used massage a tool to soothe my mother's muscles and even to comfort my mother in law as she lay dying in hospital. \u00a0If you care for a loved one with Alzheimer's or dementia, you may wish to learn more about the benefits of massage. \u00a0 \n \n \nAs a caregiver, you are constantly looking for treatments\nthat will benefit those you take care of. But you may have overlooked the one\ntreatment that has been around for a long time\u2014massage. Massage is more than a\nrelaxing rubdown. It also has a number of therapeutic effects that may very\nlikely help improve the lives of your loved ones.  \n \n \n \nGeriatric massage therapy is specifically designed with the\nneeds of seniors in mind. This type of massage incorporates gentle and light\ntechniques that can include passive stretching of the muscles. A light oil or\nlotion is typically applied to the skin so that the skin isn\u2019t irritated while\nthe muscles are being worked.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a caregiver, it would be a good idea to accompany your\nloved one to help them relax and have a comfortable experience. As you would\nwith any activity, make sure to communicate with your loved one\u2019s doctor their\nintent to have a massage. If your loved one is concerned about their modesty,\nassure them that they can decide on the amount of clothing they wear.  \u00a0 If they wish, only the area being worked on\nwill be exposed.  \n \n \n \nThe effects of massage on those with Alzheimer\u2019s have met\nwith mixed reviews. Many claim it has a calming effect on the sufferer. Those\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s are frustrated and anxious because they struggle to\ncommunicate with others. Massage acts as a non-verbal means of communication.\nIn one study a group receiving hand massages while being talked to in a calm\nvoice reported lower pulse rates and reduced inappropriate behavior. The\neffectiveness may be due to a combination of its relaxing effect in addition to\nproviding a form of social interaction.  \n \n \n \nThose suffering from infirmities may experience relief from\nconditions including arthritis, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The\nfollowing list includes a number of other benefits that massage offers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Muscle relaxation \n \nRegular massage helps keep muscles limber and reduces the\nnumber of phantom aches and pains that come with growing older. Gentle massage\nhelps stretch the muscles and over time can increase flexibility. \n \n \n \n Improved circulation \n \nMassage facilitates blood circulation by forcing blood\nthrough congested areas. The gentle squeezing and pulling also moves toxins out\nof muscles and increases the flow of lymph fluids, which contribute to a\nhealthy immune system. \n \n \n \n Less anxiety \n \nThose suffering from anxiety and depression benefit from\nmassage. Massage reduces tension and also provides the therapeutic effects of\nhuman touch to those deprived of regular human contact. Massage is also\nreported to increase feelings of overall well-being. \n \n \n \n Improved balance and\nposture \n \nMassage stimulates the body\u2019s awareness and circulation\nespecially in the feet and hands where blood flow may be constricted. It helps\nmuscles improve their range of motion and flexibility, both of which contribute\nto better co-ordination.  \n \n \n \nMassage is more than a skin-deep treatment. It provides more\nhealth benefits than just a relaxing rub down. The benefits are numerous enough\nthat a caregiver may want to consider them as another avenue to helping their\nloved ones lead more fulfilling lives. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ut5jFkW5tSs/UlXSjVCP9xI/AAAAAAAABAw/XfLEXjJFnhA/s1600/Dementia-therapy-Massage.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KKMN62c24XQ/UlXSvZxHrJI/AAAAAAAABA4/mNmgkYfZFts/s1600/massage1.jpeg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/10/the-benefits-of-massage-in-dementia-and.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nSome friends are for life. \u00a0\n Some friends stick with you through thick and thin. \u00a0  Friendship is a really, really big deal for\neveryone, but especially for our loved ones with disabilities or age-related vulnerability. \u00a0\u00a0  It may be that someone with a cognitive\nimpairment cannot carry on a conversation, let alone forge and maintain\nfriendly relationships. \u00a0  Yet, these\nrelationships are the key to a good life. \u00a0As the mother of a young man with disabilities, I always wanted (more than anything) for Nick to be invited to birthday parties and for our doorbell to ring and to hear the words, \"Can Nick come out to play?\" Friendship is vitally important to me and to our family. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHans Reinders is an author I keep coming back to when I\nthink about the deeper meanings of friendship. \u00a0\n His book,  \u201cReceiving the Gift of Friendship: Profound Disability,Theological Anthropology and Ethics\u201d  is a text I used often when researching my\nown book. \u00a0\u00a0  The Amazon liner notes for\nhis book read this way: \n \n \n \n \n \n Does what we are capable of doing define us as\nhuman beings? If this basic anthropological assumption is true, where can that\nleave those with intellectual disabilities, unable to accomplish the things\nthat we propose give us our very humanity? Hans Reinders here makes an unusual\nclaim about unusual people: those who are profoundly disabled are people just\nlike the rest of us. \n \n He\nacknowledges that, at first glance, this is not an unusual claim given the\nsteps taken within the last few decades to bring the rights of those with\ndisabilities into line with the rights of the mainstream. But, he argues, that\ncannot be the end of the matter, because the disabled are human beings before\nthey are citizens . \"To live a human\nlife properly,\" he says, \"they must not only be included in our\ninstitutions and have access to our public spaces; they must also be included\nin other people's lives, not just by natural necessity but by choice.\" \n \n \n \nMy Nicholas does not suffer from a cognitive disability, but\nhis physical disabilities put him at risk of social isolation. \u00a0  He cannot speak or read or walk. \u00a0  His has low vision and no hand function. \u00a0  Could he be \u2018chosen\u2019 as a friend? \u00a0  YES! \u00a0  \n \n \n \nNicholas has a small number of lifelong, close friends. \u00a0  One of them, Eleni Wener, met Nick when they\nwere classmates in the 6 th  grade. \u00a0\n Eleni is the young girl holding Nick\u2019s hand in this school photo: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEleni was so taken with Nicholas that when she performed her\nBat Mitzvah, she dedicated her financial gifts to Lifetime Networks Ottawa, an\norganization that I helped to start in our city. \u00a0  I wrote a newspaper about Eleni\u2019s gift that\nappeared in our local paper: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEleni\u2019s friendship has informed her academic career choices \u2013\nan undergraduate degree in disability studies is now being followed by graduate\nwork in public health. \u00a0  She came to visit\nour family in London and has never lost touch over the years. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nTo choose a friend is a deeply human act of civility and\nintimacy. \u00a0  To be chosen as a friend is an\nhonor that gives meaning and purpose to someone\u2019s life.  \u00a0 Nicholas and Eleni are good friends and always\nwill be. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.ca/Receiving-Gift-Friendship-Theological-Anthropology/dp/0802862322", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2knyZ0ttmO8/UhjWEe-rKeI/AAAAAAAAA8Y/7vFOz3gbMSQ/s1600/hans.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aRQ72iIqaVc/UhjZiUjAxUI/AAAAAAAAA84/IzjpaET4FcM/s1600/Eleniclass.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cDCudcNWnwg/UhjYN_D95BI/AAAAAAAAA8k/f6tP1ecYZak/s1600/Eleniscan.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kY1e4dERcNU/UhjYjuowu5I/AAAAAAAAA8s/1EdS-UpPKy4/s1600/EleniLondon.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/08/the-meaning-of-friendship.html", "title": ""},

Just walk beside me and be my friend. \n \n Albert Camus \n \nProfessional caregivers are trained to avoid personal\nrelationships with their clients. \u00a0  There\nare lots of good reasons why this policy is standard in health care agencies:\nemotional investment could skew clinical judgment, agency staff might make\nprivate arrangements for employment, thus leaving the agency out of the\npicture, or the caregiver might give \u2018unequal\u2019 quality of care to favored\nclients who are also friends. \n \n \n \n \nBut is it always in the client\u2019s, the caregiver\u2019s and even\nthe agency\u2019s best interest to avoid personal relationships between paid\ncaregiver and client? \u00a0  In our family, we\nhave enjoyed excellent service from paid care workers who kept a respectful\ndistance from personal conversations. \u00a0\n BUT, most of our paid caregivers over the years have remained close\nfriends \u2013 some, I would call lifelong best friends.  \u00a0 There are a number of reasons for this. \u00a0  My son\u2019s care began when he was a child and\npediatrics is naturally less formal than adult care. \u00a0  Nicholas lived at home, so clinical behaviors\nwere inappropriate in a home setting. \u00a0  I\nwas always home either looking after our daughter, tending to the pets or\ncooking in the kitchen. \u00a0  I am by nature\nan outgoing person, so we absorbed Nick\u2019s helpers into our family in order to\ncreate a sense of normalcy in our day-to-day life.  \n \n \n \nOf course, we have no interest in becoming best buddies with\nhospital nurses or specialist rehabilitation professionals. \u00a0  It\u2019s the homecare workers I am talking about\nhere \u2013 the staff who remain in our employ for years at a time. \u00a0  When Nicholas began secondary school, I\nneeded someone to help him with homework and play computer games with him,\nallowing me the time to walk the dog, make dinner and help Natalie with her\nschoolwork. \u00a0  (Nick has no hand function\nand has low vision, so helping with his after-school routine isn\u2019t something\nthat I could multi-task.) \u00a0  I wanted a\nhigh school student\u2026.someone just a little older than Nick \u2013 someone who would\nbe a role model and \u2018big brother\u2019. \u00a0  I\ntelephone the school guidance counselor and was given a short list of\nrecommended candidates. \u00a0  The first name I\ncalled was a young lad called John. \u00a0  Nick\ncan\u2019t pronounce \u2018John\u2019, but he is able to verbalise his father\u2019s name of Jim. \u00a0  So, John became \u2018Jim Jim\u2019. \u00a0  That was in 1999 and John is still Nick\u2019s best\nfriend and \u2018big bro\u2019. \u00a0\u00a0  \n \n JimJim taking Nick out for his first ride on a city bus. \n \n \n \n \n \nJimJim is big brother to Natalie too! \n \n \n \n \n \nThis year, one of Nick\u2019s full-time day caregivers got\nmarried and our family joyfully celebrated together with our caregiver/friend\nand his family. \u00a0  That particular young\nman moved to London with us in 2006 and lived with us there for a year before he moved back to Canada and assumed full-time employment\nat the residential facility where Nick now lives.  \u00a0\u00a0 What goes around, comes around, and in the\ncase of our caregiver/friends, we are very grateful.  \n \n \n \n \n \nNick is a young adult and so are his professional caregivers. \u00a0Staff are chosen for their medical expertise, but also on the basis of personality and shared interests with Nick. \u00a0These young people ARE Nick's friends - they are real friends. \u00a0When one young man took a holiday in Greece last summer, he telephoned from Crete to wish Nick a Happy Birthday. \u00a0Local time in Greece was 2:30am, but that didn't stop him from picking up the phone to call his best pal.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nEmployers, caregivers, clients and families will have to\ndecide if and when it is appropriate to establish and maintain friendly\nrelations that go beyond the usual clinical model of support. \u00a0  In our case, we absorbed our home-helpers\ninto our family. \u00a0  I was always home and\nworking with our helpers in a team mode (caring for Nick and his sister was always at least a two-person job), so there was never any possibility of\nexploitation on the part of anyone. \u00a0\u00a0  Our\nhome helpers knew that if Nick was well and pain-free, their responsibility was\nto be with him, or tag-team with me to do whatever was necessary. \u00a0  If Nicholas was ill or in distress, our\nhelpers assumed other household responsibilities so that I could be completely\npresent with Nick in his hour of need. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nToday, I would like to pay tribute to our caregiver/friends\nwho, over the last 25 years have given us their expertise, their kindness,\ntheir good humor, their tears mixed with my own, and their loyal and abiding\nfriendship. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/albert_camus.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-95Nhb08eTfk/Uh1XnnlDoNI/AAAAAAAAA9I/D44uuPYJZPM/s1600/jimjim.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tYUdn8_nCBU/Uh1hAB2_b-I/AAAAAAAAA9k/uY_ANVRVuaU/s1600/JimJimnat.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rt9UqOPu6nY/Uh1ZJPt2OLI/AAAAAAAAA9U/pb6OFvvTZ6M/s1600/nickjoshwedding.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/08/can-paid-caregivers-also-be-friends.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Guest Post by Sarah Gotheridge \n \n In Defense of Out-of-Home Care & How Family Can Stay Involved \n \n \n Many families are faced with the problem of caring for aging relatives that can no longer live alone at home. Out of home care can offer many benefits to both the elder and his or her family members. They can provide around the clock care for seniors with memory problems or disabilities that make it unsafe to live independently. \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 Who Needs Out of Home Senior Care In past times, it was common to have elderly parents live with their grown children. However, modern society has changed significantly, and this may no longer be a viable solution for an aging parent. Grown children may be divorced and live in much smaller living quarters. Both husbands and wives may work full time and not be available to provide care for the senior for long periods of time during the day. Families are smaller now as well so that other children may not be available to help out with care. Though many seniors are choosing to \u201cage in place\u201d in their own homes with some help from children or home health caregivers, this may not be the right solution for every senior. Aging people with severe memory problems or those with medical conditions that require constant monitoring may need the constant care that an out of home facility can provide.\u00a0 Assisted Living Assisted living has grown in popularity over the past decades. According to the Small Business Development Center, up to one million Americans live in senior care facilities, and many choose the assisted living option because of its many advantages. These facilities provide cleaning, laundry and meals in a residential environment that often includes a variety of enriching activities to keep bodies healthy and minds sharp. Assisted living facilities provide a good solution for seniors who do not have serious medical conditions, are able to get around on their own and enjoy interacting with other people of their own age.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Group Homes In some areas of the United States, group homes provide care for seniors in a home environment with caregivers that the elder has a consistent relationship. These can often be a good substitute for the family environment and can provide the senior with interaction with other people his age, as well as 24/7 supervision.\u00a0 Nursing Homes For elders with severe medical problems that need 24/7 nursing care, the nursing home can offer skilled, experienced clinical care.\u00a0 Ways To Stay Involved Frequent visits to the  care home  are the best way to stay in touch with an elder who is an out of home facility. If possible, you can take the elder for visits to local stores, museums, restaurants and movie theaters for an outing that will brighten their day and provide mental stimulation. Simple conversation is often the best way to connect them with events in the day and general family events. Of course, involving them in family parties, holiday occasions can help to keep the elder in the family circle. Bringing books, puzzles, photographs of other family members and mementos of happy times together can also provide positive interactions with them.

(He took a few sips, and then delighted, pretended to be\ntipsy.)\u00a0 As the golf game neared its\nfinish, I went upstairs to collect the hamburgers for the bar-b-q.\u00a0 They were nowhere in sight.\u00a0 The platter sat clean and empty on the\ncounter.\u00a0 I suddenly had a terrible\nthought and knew in my heart that I was right \u2013 Goldie, our golden retriever\nhad eaten them.\u00a0 Twenty generous\nhamburger patties couldn\u2019t fit into the stomach of a normal dog, but I knew the\ncapacities of our Goldie from previous experience.\u00a0 By now, the golfers had congregated on the\npatio, ready for their lunch.\u00a0 I\nannounced that hot dogs would be served instead of burgers due to one very greedy\ndog having just eaten our lunch, just as my brother in law Gerry with his video\ncamera captured Goldie on the beach below belching up mounds of raw hamburger\non the sand.\u00a0 Frank, my sister\u2019s husband,\nwas on screen suggesting that I should patty them up again since the meat was\nstill fresh.\u00a0 As I watched the scene\nunfold on the videotape, I laughed again as hard as I had the first time it\nplayed out.\u00a0  \n \n \n \nNicholas may not have his birthdays\nup north anymore.\u00a0 But we will follow him\nas he cleverly reinvents himself, his place, his future and his fun.\u00a0 We have stopped thinking of Nicholas as\nhaving a limited life or abbreviated lifespan.\u00a0\nWe know he can beat the odds \u2013 he\u2019s a winner and he\u2019s my pick.  \n \n \n \nHappy Birthday, Nicholas, and may\nyou have many more. \u00a0We love you! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2ylARF_HKQs/UiYbONG6nxI/AAAAAAAAA94/dqIYhWRLj6I/s1600/nickpartybest.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T0-Bp_es32s/UiYgZumbnJI/AAAAAAAAA-I/P3_Uf0fM0EY/s1600/Mumandnick.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/09/betting-on-birthdays.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n 4 Tips to Help You Reduce the\nImpact of Caregiving on your Relationships \n \n \n \n Becoming\na caregiver can be one of the most impactful changes that can occur in a\nperson\u2019s life.  \u00a0 Caregiving is not a change\nthat only affects the relationship between you and the person you are caring\nfor, it is one that may affect all of the relationships in your life that are\nimportant to you. \u00a0  This may include your\nrelationship with your significant other, with children, friends, relatives,\nsiblings and even with your employer.  \u00a0 One of the most influential factors in\nmaintaining and improving your relationships as a caregiver is\ncommunication. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n 1 - Communicate Through Family\nMeetings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Communication\nbetween family members is important for helping everyone to understand the\nchanging role of the primary caregiver and the impact it will have on life as\nthey know it. \u00a0  Family meetings are a\ngreat way to communicate what will happen, set expectations, enlist support, identify\nproblems, and explore solutions. \u00a0  This\nmay also be a good time to brainstorm on ideas of how to best help the person\nin need, how to collaborate and how to work as a team to provide caregiving\nduties. \u00a0  Use a family meeting to explain\nto children what will be happening and to discuss adjustments that will impact\ntheir lives so they may be more prepared for what may occur.  \n \n \n \n The\nrelationship between the caregiver and their child/children may be impacted by\ncaregiving responsibilities, as there may not be as much time for the kids as\nthere used to be. \u00a0  The decrease in\nquality time with the children can negatively impact the bonding and attachment\nbuilding that parents and children need with each other. \n \n \n \n \n \n Children may\nalso be affected as they may be asked to help and participate in caregiving\nactivities. \u00a0  They may have to change\ntheir behavior to accommodate the person needing care, especially if the aging\nor ill relative has moved into the family home. \u00a0\n For some, this can be disruptive to children as it may not be\nappropriate for them to have the burden of being responsible at a young\nage. \u00a0  Children need the opportunity to\nsimply be children.  \n \n \n \n It is\nimportant to communicate to children frequently about caregiving and reaffirm\ntheir place in the life of the caregiver. \u00a0\n Family meetings can be planned as often as is necessary to support one\nanother and ensure that feelings are being validated and that everyone\ncontinues to be on the same page.  \n \n \n \n 2 - Prioritize Communication with\nYour Spouse \n \n \n \n It is\nvery common for marriages to be negatively affected by caregiving roles. \u00a0  The existence of communication between\nspouses can often make or break a relationship.  \u00a0 Caregiving often results in less time for\nspouses to spend together, to talk with each other and enjoy one another\u2019s company. \u00a0  The attachment between spouses can be reduced\nand many times spouses become resentful that the caregiving spouse may be\nexpending more of their energy on caregiving, rather than on the marriage or\nthe family.  \u00a0 Married couples with\ncaregiving roles can benefit from planning time alone with their spouse to\nmaintain emotional and romantic attachments to one another. \u00a0  It is important to keep intimacy and fun in\nthe marriage, to facilitate a strong and supportive marriage during the\ncaregiving process. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Many\ntimes there is increased strain on the relationship between couples as their\nparental roles change as a result of caregiving. \u00a0  The primary caregiver may increasingly spend more\nresources on caring for someone outside of the immediate family, resulting in\nan imbalance of parental responsibilities for the other parent. \u00a0  The other parent must do more to care for the\nkids and take on more responsibility for them. \u00a0\n The imbalance can result in more stress for the other parent and\nincreasingly resentful feelings towards the caregiving spouse, if they do not\ncommunicate with each other about the situation and their needs. \n \n \n \n One of\nthe most common strains on a marriage is when a family member requiring\nassistance moves into the caregiver\u2019s home. \u00a0\n Spontaneity enjoyed by married couples is diminished. Schedules must be\nadhered to or plans made in advance that takes into consideration the person\nneeding care. \u00a0  A sense of privacy is lost\nfor couples, as well as respite from caregiving as the person is always\nthere. \u00a0  The entire family is affected and\nthe family can no longer enjoy the lifestyle that they had before. \n \n \n \n Spouses\nthat focus on communicating with each other can often maintain their marriage\nthrough these challenges that caregiving can create. \u00a0  Caregivers and partners of caregivers that\ndiscuss their feelings with each other, often experience less stress and\nfrustration with one another. Voicing needs and concerns as well as hearing the\nsame from the other spouse in return, can assist couples to maintain bonds and\nhelp each other to work through issues and fears together.  \n \n \n \n 3 - Inform your Employer \n \n \n \n A\ncaregiver that is working may find it difficult to maintain the same standard\nof performance in their job prior to taking on caregiving duties. \u00a0  Leaving work unexpectedly or for scheduled medical\nappointments to care for someone, and overall fatigue at work, can take its\ntoll on the relationship between the caregiver and their employer. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n For some\npeople, caregiving roles are not only physical and emotional, but they can be\nfinancial as well. \u00a0  Paying for medical\nbills of the person in need, contributing towards food and housing and other\nexpenses, is not uncommon. \u00a0  Therefore, it\nmay be important to maintain a good working relationship with your employer\nduring the time that you have caregiving responsibilities. \n \n Communicating\nwith your employer and explaining your situation may help your employer to\nunderstand and possibly accommodate your needs to be a caregiver, while\npreserving your job. \u00a0  Occasionally\nemployers will work with an employee to create a more flexible schedule that\nprovides you the time that you need for caregiving, and yet is still productive\nfor the employer as well. \u00a0  They may have\nthe ability to implement a remote work situation allowing you to work from home,\nor different working hours to fit your schedule. \u00a0  The important thing is to communicate with\nyour employer and allow them the opportunity to work with you, if possible, on\nyour situation. \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 - Seek Support \n \n \n \n It is equally\nimportant that caregivers take care of themselves and their personal needs just\nas much as the person for which they are caring. This can be in the form of\nengaging in hobbies and leisure activities, but can also be in the form of\nphysical and emotional support.  \u00a0 Consider\nlooking into physical support in the form of respite care. \u00a0  Research options for care, so that you and\nyour family can have a break from caregiving if necessary. \u00a0  There are organizations that provide care on\na temporary basis, allowing you to rest and rejuvenate, so that you can return\nto caregiving with confidence. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Also, seek\nsupport groups in your area, as it is sometimes helpful to communicate socially\nand hear the stories of others who have experienced similar situations to what\nyou may be undergoing as a caregiver. \u00a0\n Hearing ideas from fellow caregivers and realizing that you are not\nalone may be all you need to push onward. \u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n For\nrelationships to be successful or repaired, it is essential to communicate,\nespecially in the face of change and in managing the challenges that caregiving\nbrings. \u00a0  Promoting communication in all\nareas may ultimately help you and your family to obtain successful\nrelationships in your caregiving journey.  \n \n \n \n Lauren\nHill writes for  LiftCaregiving , a Richmond, VA company offering\nsupport for caregivers. \u00a0  You can follow\nLauren on  Google+  and her  blog .  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TDzWH6nV57A/UgkuOiQOeDI/AAAAAAAAA60/wX4WxxlGE1U/s1600/family-meeting.jpeg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9OJIlgUEgy8/Ugkuo4QzrxI/AAAAAAAAA68/qaDFpric3ns/s1600/childcaregiver.jpeg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JAm9976qLYw/UgkvYxzVtYI/AAAAAAAAA7E/A14RUj3Ii_E/s1600/angry-couple-fight.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_L0-LUaDoWs/UgkwA8W_3dI/AAAAAAAAA7M/m1Lk-9ZHTYU/s1600/emplyerchat.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PcF8ve-3grM/UgkwfnYIXyI/AAAAAAAAA7U/0B9sgUxIqR8/s1600/Icare.jpg", "https://www.liftcaregiving.com/advice/relationships", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/115600345977124144292", "http://www.laurenqhill.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/08/guest-post-4-tips-on-how-caregivers-can.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday was a day that I will always remember. \u00a0Nicholas came up north to our family cottage for the afternoon! \u00a0It has been seven years since he was last here and we were all unsure whether he could withstand the pain of such a long (two hour) journey each way.  \n \nLet me tell you a bit about our cottage in the Quebec Laurentians and why yesterday was so meaningful to everyone in our family.  \n \nThis old house was built by my grandparents in the 1920's. \u00a0Here's a photo of our beach in those days - my Dad is the young lad on the far right. \u00a0He passed away at the age of 54 in 1975. \u00a0Our cottage is full of memories - of spending summers learning from my Grandmother how to clean a fish, or light a fire in the wood stove. \u00a0My Dad taught me how to catch frogs and hook a bass. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI met my husband here at the lake. \u00a0Our respective grandparents were friends and my husband's family cottage is across the lake. \u00a0His parents met and married here too. \u00a0We joke sometimes when we meet 'new lake folks' - we introduce ourselves by saying, \"This is my brother Darryl and my OTHER brother Darryl!\" \u00a0It's a fact that there are so many Wrights and Thomsons of all ages here, it seems that everyone is related. \u00a0The lake, the memories, the rituals, the views.... it's all a deep part of who we are as a family. \u00a0My sister  Karen  is an artist and she paints the lake again and again. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo yesterday, our family was complete. \u00a0Nick arrived with Tom, his helper, after a long and bumpy drive through the country. \u00a0Nick was in pain. \u00a0The boys had brought the hoyer hoist along and we got Nick into bed right away for a lie down. \u00a0Tom gave him morphine and tylenol which took the edge off and pretty soon my guy was smiling again. \n \n \n \n \n \nOur lake family began to arrive to greet Nick... brothers in law, sisters in law, cousins and friends. \u00a0Jim lit the BarBQ and we got Nick down to our balcony, overlooking the lake. \u00a0Everyone was so happy to see our Nicholas! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNick left for home in the late afternoon after another lie-down. \u00a0We gave a second dose of pain killers just before we waved goodbye in the driveway. \u00a0Later, the boys skyped us to let us know that the drive home had been fine and Nick was full of bravado as well as relief that he had done it!!! \n \n \n \nThis morning, I called and asked whether Nick had paid for his visit to the cottage with seizures overnight. \u00a0This can happen - pain is a seizure trigger. \u00a0Only two seizures - we are so happy! \u00a0I asked Nick, \"Would you like to try a cottage again, maybe in a couple of weeks?\" \u00a0\"Yeeeahhh\" came Nick's reply. \u00a0So, we're planning a repeat lake visit, but better the next time. \u00a0We'll manage the pain more strategically and we'll get my Mom here too. \u00a0With Nicholas, every good experience is measured in the price he pays in pain. \u00a0Yesterday, the price was not too high and we're going to do it again. \u00a0Hallelujah. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aNOWDrcPbrk/UgENveka3FI/AAAAAAAAA5k/hhiWhKhN7ns/s1600/oldcottage.jpg", "http://www.karenthomson.ca/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CIzi1DCnUi0/UgEPzDzkpsI/AAAAAAAAA50/X6pCwrN8XL0/s1600/lakepainting.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZF4qRcyyRgA/UgEQz8Go5-I/AAAAAAAAA6A/62ct72xNJqQ/s1600/Nickbed.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NdlnFlrG-98/UgER2H_-Y7I/AAAAAAAAA6U/bk5W5qTJ1Ck/s1600/Nickbalcony2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Oy__IgJ_VaY/UgERvWaFOzI/AAAAAAAAA6M/O1fzciUX3Hk/s1600/Nickbalcony1.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1ETRyOzxwxI/UgET4VJFSVI/AAAAAAAAA6k/wO5CF1RJSVg/s1600/wholefamilycottage.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/08/a-day-to-remember-always.html", "title": ""},

In her free time, she enjoys\nSudoku, spending time with her family, and playing with her poodle, Max.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen my\ngrandfather turned ninety, my dad explained to me the meaning of the old\nproverb \u2018once a man, twice a child\u2019. I\u2019d heard the proverb before, but I\u2019d\nnever fully understood what it meant. It wasn\u2019t until my dad explained it in\nthe context of my grandfather\u2019s situation that I discerned the meaning behind\nthe words.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs impossible as it might seem to me, my grandfather had once been a baby. Like all babies, he had\nrelied on other people to bathe him, feed him and clothe him. Now, after being\nself-sufficient for many years, my grandfather once again required other people\nto take care of him. In other words, my grandfather was childlike in terms of\nhis renewed dependence on other people.  \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  When\nmy father explained the proverb to me, he reminded me that he, too, would one\nday need someone to take care of him. We grow up half-believing that our\nparents are invincible, so the idea of my father reaching an age where he was\nno longer self-sufficient seemed impossible at the time. Now, many years later,\nmy father has aged\u2014just as he once warned me that he would. It is my\nresponsibility to take care of him, the way he used to take care of me.  \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  My\nfather sacrificed everything for me. He did everything in his power to provide\nme with every possible advantage and opportunity. I felt that I owed it to him\nto provide the best level of care available, which is why I chose twenty-four\nhour at home care over a nursing home.  \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  You\nhave to understand\u2014this was before I had any experience with at-home care,  back when I was\nstill a sales consultant. I didn\u2019t have access to the information I have now.\nWhen my brothers and I were trying to decide at-home care and a nursing home,\nthere were two things that trumped all other concerns.  The first was our\nfather\u2019s comfort. The second was his safety. \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  When\nit came to the question of my father\u2019s comfort, it was imperative that we keep\nhim in his own house for as long as we could. My father has owned his house for\nforty years. He worked hard for years to pay off the mortgage and poured sweat,\nblood and time into various home improvement projects in an effort to make sure\nit was a suitable place to raise a family. That house is more than just a place\nmy father happens to live\u2014it\u2019s a living part of him, a tangible memory that\nconnects him to his past. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nMy brothers\nand I knew that forcing my dad out of his home and into a nursing home would\nbreak the old man\u2019s heart. We decided that couldn\u2019t do that to him\u2014not after\neverything he\u2019s done for us. That\u2019s why we decided to hire at-home care. With\ntwenty-four hour home care, my father doesn\u2019t have to leave the comfort of his\nown home.  \n \n \n \nSafety was the\nsecond thing my family had to take into account when we were considering\nwhether or not to hire at-home care. When I researched nursing homes online, I\nwas amazed by the amount of physical, emotional and sexual abuse that occurs in\nadult care facilities. According to an article by  ABC News , patients\nare abused by their caretakers in approximately 1 out of every 3 facilities.  \n \n \n \nThe article,\nwhich sites a study conducted by the Special Investigations Division of the\nHouse Government Reform Committee, listed malnutrition, dehydration, inadequate\nsanitation/hygiene, \u00a0  untreated bedsores\nand inadequate medical care as common problems that plague patients in nursing\nhome facilities. In light of this article (and many others like it), my\nbrothers and I decided that at-home care was the safest option for our father.  \n \n \n \nEverything\nwe\u2019ve seen since we hired an at-home caretaker has convinced my family and me\nthat we made the right decision. My father is happier than he\u2019s been since my\nmom passed. He gets to keep his house, maintain some semblance of autonomy and he\nhas company during the day. I don\u2019t know how things would have turned out if\nwe\u2019d put him in a nursing home, but my brothers and I are all glad we\ndidn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s much more satisfying to see him well taken care of and exactly\nwhere he belongs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://plus.google.com/109142171744384687458/posts", "http://www.mynursingdegree.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--eGd7kUhumg/UgqzSk5r-JI/AAAAAAAAA70/tf5N-P5OtqI/s1600/oldmanhands.jpeg", "http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92689&page=1#.UazuxUDU-Ck"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/08/guest-post-in-defense-of-at-home-care.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nTomorrow morning, I'll wake up early to go see my Mom. \u00a0I am at our lake house for two weeks of holiday with my husband and I feel badly leaving him here while I go see Mom. \u00a0It's going to rain tomorrow and he'll be at the cottage with no car. \u00a0I know he'll read and putter, finding things to do - goodness knows that there are many small repairs waiting to be done in this old house. \n \nI don't know what I'll find when I get to Mom's. \u00a0Preparing food and eating is a problem for Mom that we have struggled to wrestle to the ground for some time. \u00a0For my sister, delivering food began as a weekly treat. \u00a0But delivering food to Mom as an essential component of her being alive is not feasible, so we hired helpers who would shop and cook. \u00a0Mom couldn't eat the food in the dining room downstairs at her residence, she said, because it disagreed with her. \u00a0This is no attention-grabbing false notion - she's right. \u00a0The food doesn't agree with her. \u00a0My mother's digestive issues are legendary and I've written about them before. \u00a0She's had C-Difficil three times in the last year and she has severe irritable bowel syndrome as well as any number of food intolerances. \u00a0Still, one has to eat to survive. Now, Mom has let go all her hired helpers and is no longer on the food plan. \u00a0She says she will 'order out' or cook herself. \u00a0It's not a plan that's likely to work. \n \nThe thing is, my mother hates being old. \u00a0She rails against the barriers to doing whatever she wants to do - getting into the canoe at the lake, for instance. \u00a0As for no longer driving, she says 'it's like someone cut off my legs\". \u00a0My Mom is stubborn and petulant. \u00a0She wants what she wants. \u00a0But the situation is not simple. \u00a0It's always a mistake to dismiss what she says - there is always something there that is the difference between health and wellness, between peace and a major emergency.  \n \nTomorrow I'm bringing my Mom presents - one of them is an 'E-cigarette' from my visit to London recently (you get 500 puffs of nicotine laced, yet harmless to others, indoor enjoyment). \u00a0My mother is, and always has been, a smoker. \u00a0I know she'll get a great kick out of waltzing around the no smoking areas of her seniors' residence puffing away with a twinkle in her eye. \u00a0She will chuckle as 'the inmates' as she refers to her best pals, realise there is nothing more to her cigarette 'smoke' than wisps of odorless, colored mist. \n \n \n \n \nAs I think about what to pack for tomorrow, I keep being distracted by thoughts of another conversation I had this week. \u00a0Jim and I skyped Nicholas yesterday (well, truthfully we skype him every day if we do not see him) and we arranged for Nick to visit the cottage next week just for the day. \u00a0This seems so simple, so innocuous. \u00a0It's not. \u00a0Nicholas has not been up north to our country place for seven years. \u00a0He grew up having summer holidays here, went for early morning swims, had his birthday parties here with friends and family every year.... he learned all the summer rituals of our family until pain or living in England prevented him from coming to the lake. \u00a0Right now, Nick's pain control is pretty good, so we decided together to take the chance of deciding to bring him here for a day. \u00a0I have no idea if he will enjoy the experience or find the four hours of driving on country roads simply too much to endure. \u00a0But he wants to try.  \n \n \n \n \nSometimes, we help our loved ones do things that maybe they shouldn't do... things that are dangerous or perilous in some way. \u00a0But sometimes we just have to try, because that is what it means to be alive.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mXAyDq_pDws/UfnOt47aM6I/AAAAAAAAA4c/Cl9-afQKfs0/s1600/Ecigarette.jpeg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o18YZehwOF4/UfnPZkF10dI/AAAAAAAAA4k/oVnX5PMSjC8/s1600/oldpicjimnickinboat-1.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/07/aiding-and-abetting-guilty-pleasures.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThis morning, there is a medical clinic appointment in my diary. \u00a0It's not for Nicholas or my Mom - it's for me. \u00a0It's a follow-up to a scope of my esophagus I had a while back - my family and good friends know that sometimes I have trouble swallowing food. \u00a0Some dry piece of meat or bread will lodge itself in my 'throat' (actually closer to my breastbone) and no amount of drinking water or purposeful swallowing will get it to budge. \u00a0So, the doctor simply 'stretched' my esophagus and did a biopsy while he was at it. \u00a0This morning, I expect he'll ask me how it's going and inquire whether I would like the procedure done again for extra effect. \u00a0What I do not expect him to say is that I have esophageal cancer, but I must admit that my GP did mention that my symptoms could indicate that diagnosis, if my symptoms had appeared suddenly (they didn't). \n \nAll of this got me thinking about when illness strikes a parent or caregiver. \u00a0The joke amongst young mothers is that they 'never get sick'... even when they have a hacking cough and a high fever. \u00a0For anyone giving care, booking off for a day or two is not an option. \u00a0Of course, there are times when even the most intrepid and determined caregiver will be bedridden or incapacitated to such an extent that the troops must be called in. \u00a0 I recall once when my children were small, I somehow contracted viral meningitis. \u00a0Natalie was a toddler and Nick was four or five. \u00a0Before Natalie was in school full days, I used to say 'my kids are a two person job!\" \u00a0So at that time, we had a mother's helper living with us and we were both rushed off our feet with Nick's nursing needs and Natalie's penchant for mischief. When I had meningitis and realised that no amount of willpower would enable me to get out of bed and into action, I felt desperate. \u00a0I pulled on the arm of my young home helper and wailed, 'what are we going to do? \u00a0It's impossible for you alone to look after the kids!\" \u00a0Jim was working very long hours or travelling, and he would have been out of his depth with Nick's complex care anyway.  \n \nI had no emergency plan and I was living abroad, so no family nearby. \u00a0But our mother's helper had a family and it was her mother who came to stay. \u00a0Mrs. Rolley was this blessed angel's name and she came to cook, do laundry, play with Natalie and spread a sense of calm and control throughout our home. \u00a0I was lucky that within a week, I was out of bed and back to an approximation of my usual routine. \n \nOther mothers and caregivers are not so lucky. \u00a0A cancer diagnosis and the ensuing invasive treatments can be a doubly scary prospect for someone who is caring for young children or vulnerable adults. Social services are not designed to do 'emergency response' for childcare or respite. \u00a0But there is one charity that I read about recently that has taken up this cause. \u00a0It's Toronto based and called  \"The Nanny Angel Network\" . \u00a0 The story of how one Nanny agency CEO took it upon herself to help women with cancer look after their families is  HERE . \n \n \n \nCREATING THE EMERGENCY PLAN \n \nA caregiver 'angel' is not likely to swoop in, ready to help every caregiver, though. \u00a0That means it's essential to have an emergency plan in place for when the caregiver is too ill to carry out essential caring responsibilities. \u00a0For those tag-teaming with their spouse or another competent adult, an emergency plan could be as simple as promising to step in for the other in case of illness or emergency.  \nFor single caregivers, the best place to start in thinking about creating an emergency plan is by making a list of anyone who has been helpful (or offered to be helpful) in the past. \u00a0It's a good idea to have a 'Plan A' and a 'Plan B'. \u00a0Write a draft email to a couple of prospective surrogate caregivers who have the skills set (or could learn quickly) to step in to care for a loved one. \u00a0Explain that you are creating an emergency care plan for your home and you are asking for a commitment of help to replace you, the caregiver, if you become temporarily incapacitated. \u00a0Leave no stone unturned to explore other sources of emergency assistance as well. \u00a0If you have a social worker, ask what they suggest. \u00a0Local community centers and churches sometimes have committees that can handle such family crises in their neighorhood. \u00a0In the case of emergency care for school age children, schools are a natural partner in crisis scenario planning, whereas staff at a day program for Alzheimer's might step in for a vulnerable loved one with that condition. \n \nAn emergency respite plan is a good thing to have. \u00a0And beginning that conversation with friends, family and neighbors could lead to greater awareness of your role as a caregiver and your need for regular respite. \u00a0The emergency planning might be an opportunity to create a network of care for your loved one. \u00a0Either way, like making a will or planning a fire escape route from your home, emergency planning in the event of caregiver illness is a great insurance policy against true catastrophe.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nannyangelnetwork.com/", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2013/06/07/f-nanny-angel-network-mothers-cancer.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OMy1T5d9tTM/Ugob3oQmWvI/AAAAAAAAA7k/rXETQpI36HE/s1600/hi-nanny-angel-family-8col.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/08/moms-and-caregivers-are-never-sick-right.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If you provide ongoing care for a disabled individual, then\nyou may need to be the one who applies for benefits on his or her behalf. There\nare additionally some state and local programs that provide additional benefits\ndirectly to full-time caregivers of the disabled, which means that you may also\nbe able to receive some financial support yourself for filling the role of\ncaregiver to another individual.  \n \n \n \n Situations\nin which Caregivers May Need to Assist  \n \n Any condition that compromises the mental capacity of a\ndisabled individual may require a caregiver to step in to facilitate the\napplication process for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits.  \n \n Parents of minor children with special needs or disabilities\nmust also apply on behalf of their kids.  \n \n If you provide care for a developmentally disabled adult or\nadults with Alzheimer\u2019s/Dementia, you may need to initiate and provide support\nand guidance throughout the disability application process as well.  \n \n A caregiver may need to apply for disability on behalf of\nhis or her charge in many other instances too, including for coma patients and\nfor individuals that are in and out of consciousness, for example.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The\nApplication Process \n \n When applying for benefits online, you have options\navailable to describe whom it is that the application is for and who is\ncompleting the application. These options include: \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Filling\nout an application for yourself \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Filling\nout an application for someone else who is with you \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Filling\nout an application for someone else who is not with you \n \n \n \n You must indicate that you are completing the application on\nbehalf of someone else, and if that person is unable to comprehend the process\nand sign the application, then there will be additional steps required for\napplying for benefits on their behalf. Those details will be covered in the\narticle section, which follows, on the topic of seeking assistance from an\nadvocate or attorney. \n \n You can also apply in-person, at your local SSA office on\nbehalf of the disabled person in your care. However, he or she will still need\nto sign the application. Review the next section to know how to handle an\napplication for SSD benefits, if the person in your care is not mentally\ncompetent.  \n \n \n \n Seeking\nAssistance from an Advocate or Attorney \n \n As the SSA requires the signature of the applicant on the\nformal application for SSD benefits, you may need to seek additional legal\nassistance in order to act on behalf of an applicant with compromised or\notherwise limited mental capacity.  \n \n In other words, if the person for whom you are applying for\nbenefits is unable to understand the SSD application process and is unable to\nsign the application, then you will need to either: \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Have\nthe legally designated representative of the disabled individual sign on behalf\nof the applicant and submit the associated documentation to the SSA to prove he\nor she is legally allowed to do so, \n \n \n \n OR \n \n \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Seek\nlegal help to have a designated representative assigned to handle legal and\nmedical matters for the person that is in your care, including the formal\ndisability application process. \n \n \n \n Becoming\na Representative Payee \n \n If the individual is approved to receive SSD benefits, you\nmay also need to apply to be a representative payee with the SSA.  \n \n This simply means that benefit checks will be issued to you\nto use for providing the care and support your charge needs. This is a legally\nbinding relationship that requires you to communicate honestly and openly with\nthe SSA a minimum of four times per year regarding the manner in which benefit\nfunds are being spent.  \n \n The application is Form SSA-11, and can be found  here :  http://www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-11.pdf \n It is important to note however, that in most circumstance, the SSA\nrequires this application form be completed during an in-person interview\nappoint with an SSA representative, typically at your local SSA office.  \n \n \n \n Applying\nfor Caregiver Benefits  \n \n As previously mentioned, there are some local and state\nbenefit programs available that may provide direct financial and other support\nservices for you as the caregiver of a disabled person.  \n \n These programs are typically administered through the\ndepartment of family services in your home state, and may include the\nfollowing: \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Referral\nservices and other information \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Assistance\nin gaining access to other services \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Support\ngroups, training, and individual counseling services \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Caregiver\nrespite programs, to give you a break from your role as caregiver \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Supplemental\nsupportive care services \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Income,\nusually in the form of Medicaid waiver payments issued to you as the caregiver\nof a Medicaid recipient \n \n To know for certain what caregiver benefits may be available\nin your area, you must reach out to your local department of family services or\nanother similar social services agency to make inquiries. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Article by Ram Meyyappan \nSocial Security Disability Help \n www.disability-benefits-help.org/blog \n\n\n\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k4YLGRxWYwk/Uemt3JiUq9I/AAAAAAAAA3g/YtfXNaRecwc/s1600/7183670-social-security-benefits-form-showing-financial-concept-in-office.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gRGow0jbuvk/UemuXJ4S6vI/AAAAAAAAA3o/hgs0Jr4KtGw/s1600/social-security-disability.jpg", "http://www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-11.pdf", "http://www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-11.pdf", "http://www.disability-benefits-help.org/blog"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/07/guest-post-applying-for-social-security.html", "title": ""},

This vibrant and diverse urban neighborhood is distinguished by its lack of air conditioning units - something that has important implications for its citizenry. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo, what's the big deal about no AC? \u00a0It drives people outside to their sidewalks. \u00a0Sidewalks in the summer become common living spaces - it's not exactly a party and not exactly a wake, but something very social and in-between. \u00a0It's 'hanging out and having a laugh'. \u00a0Cooling off outside means there are no televisions and no computer games, but there might be music. \u00a0There are all ages and there's a lot of improvisation and horsing around. \u00a0When people come together with the shared objective of being outdoors because it's cooler, a social magic begins to occur. \u00a0All ages and abilities collide in friendly ways and laughter is the common language.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSome may call city folks with no air conditioning lower income and I do not mean to romanticise that urban reality. \u00a0I give thanks for the many blessings in my life, including feeling cool indoors on a sweltering day. \u00a0But as someone who has given over my adult life to the care of vulnerable loved ones, I often reflect on social isolation. \u00a0I look at the folks on the sidewalk where my daughter now lives with longing. \u00a0I want to join in the banter, to be part of a friendly, cohesive group. \u00a0I wonder, do these particular people look after one another in times of illness or infirmity? \u00a0Surely the happy times on the sidewalk form bonds that endure indoors and throughout the winter.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhere I live in Ottawa, Canada, winters are long and cold. \u00a0Summers are hot and humid. \u00a0Either way, most folks do not know their neighbors and most children spend too much time on the computer or watching television. \u00a0We were alone amongst our peers when we chose to allow our daughter to walk to school at the age of 8. \u00a0People mostly stay indoors on account of fear (in the case of children unsupervised) or because of inclement weather. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy son Nicholas is mostly bedridden and his friends are his caregivers (mostly young men his own age). \u00a0What Nick loves most is what I call 'boy banter' and what he calls 'trash talk'. \u00a0It's the kind of chatter that is teasing, friendly and open ended. \u00a0This sort of relaxed socialising is difficult to find for people like me and members of my family. \n \n \n \nSo, what am trying to say here?: \u00a0That I value sociability and I miss the opportunities for 'hanging out and having a laugh' with my neighbors and my friends. \u00a0I value hanging out with no particular agenda or activity in mind. \u00a0I value socialising in a group that includes all ages and all abilities. \u00a0In fact, it is my idea of  fun  - it refreshes my sense of who I am in the world because it reminds me of my place in the community. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nMaybe, when I get home, I'm going to put out two chairs on my front porch. \u00a0One for me and one for whomever walks by. \u00a0I'll let you know how it goes.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c_ZIhmpjO6U/UeRqLqJf_CI/AAAAAAAAA3Q/SGHfkp3KKrg/s1600/two_rocking_chairs_on_porch_u12751495.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/07/hanging-out-and-having-laugh.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n Cameron Von St. James is a husband, father and caregiver.  In this guest post, Cameron shares his family story of caring for his wife Heather through her cancer diagnosis and treatment.  Thank you, Cameron and here's to all the husbands, fathers and sons giving care today. \n \n \n \n \n \n How a battle with cancer made us stronger \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n My beautiful daughter, Lily, was born in of August in 2005. It was a time of complete joy and happiness with our little family. Over the next several months my wife and I learned how to be parents and how to care for a little child. Three months later, we were preparing for Christmas and our daughter's first holiday season. That was when disaster struck, on November 21st, 2005. My wife, Heather, was diagnosed with cancer. \n \n \n \n Our doctor told us that Heather had  malignant pleural mesothelioma . ( CLICK HERE  for more information on mesothelioma.)  He helped us to understand what the cancer was and how it would affect our lives. My wife sat there in shock, with a look on her face that I would never forget. The doctor gave us a few options on where we could go for treatment, and we quickly chose to go to a doctor in Boston who specialized in mesothelioma. His name was Dr. David Sugarbaker. This decision was the first of many that I would have to help make regarding my wife's care. \n \n \n \n The next two months passed amid chaos and uncertainty. Heather, who previously had a full time job, had to stop working. My full time job became part time in order to accommodate my new responsibilities as a caregiver. We juggled doctor visits with taking care of our daughter and still struggling to go to work and pay our bills. During these times I faced my greatest fears. What would happen if Heather died? How could I raise Lily alone? More than once these fears brought me to my knees, sobbing. It was only by reminding myself of the tasks that lay ahead that I could focus and keep going. \n \n \n \n Throughout this whole ordeal we had so many people who offered to help. Friends, family, and complete strangers would approach us with tokens of help. Some were small, and some were huge. No matter what they were, each and every bit of help took one more thing off of the list that we had to do that day. If I could give advice to anyone who is facing any sort of illness, it would be to accept every offer of help given to you. We could not have survived without it. Even though my fears of being alone crippled me at times, the truth was that we were always surrounded with love. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n During these years I learned how to be a caregiver. Being a caregiver isn't easy. It is constant, day and night. You can quit a job, stop going to school, and give up on any other thing you do in life, but as a caregiver to someone you love, there is no giving up. It was hard. There were good days and bad days, and I came to accept that. As long as you never give up hope, you stand a fighting chance. \n \n \n \n For years we went through the routine familiar to all those who have had a loved one fighting illness. We had radiation treatments, chemotherapy, even surgery. Finally we got the amazing news that  Heather was cancer free . \n \n \n \n Those years as my wife's caregiver taught me a lot. I learned to give up my pride and ask for help when I needed it. I learned that I can meet any challenge, no matter how great it was. I learned that hope is a weapon that fights off despair. If you ever find yourself in my situation, you will have to dig deep. Never stop fighting for them. Never stop hoping for them. In the end, you will find that both you and your loved ones have become strengthened to a degree that you never thought possible. \n \n \n \n \n \n For more information on mesothelioma,  CLICK\u00a0HERE. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oa_-xxm7Zk0/Uc67Jw4yBBI/AAAAAAAAA1s/hIfLvLR8cxs/s960/Family.jpeg", "http://www.mesothelioma.com/mesothelioma/types/pleural.htm", "http://mesothelioma.net/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JTQW5JpSlH4/Uc67XGp3q0I/AAAAAAAAA10/D7HafXt1sRE/s319/Screen+Shot+2012-07-26+at+8.01.02+AM.png", "http://www.mesothelioma.com/heather", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kMc8dNLxCkw/Uc67dqU2QaI/AAAAAAAAA18/pxZYwKfXVrk/s320/Screen+Shot+2012-07-26+at+8.01.25+AM.png", "http://mesothelioma.net/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/06/guest-post-how-battle-with-cancer-made.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Caregivers of very vulnerable loved ones who have extremely high needs are at high risk of being accused of abuse. \u00a0I know, because it happened to me. \u00a0And there are many other loving and responsible parents of children with severe disabilities who report similar scenarios. \u00a0In 2005, my son Nicholas had uncontrolled pain as a result of failed hip surgeries. \u00a0Nick was on muscle relaxants and major pain killers, including morphine. \u00a0But very often, the prescribed doses of these drugs did nothing to stop the terrible screaming in our house. \u00a0From the hospital payphone, I complained to a clinic nurse that pain doctors on call would hang up on me or simply tell me to come to the ER (something I could not do on a daily basis). \u00a0When Nick's pain got too bad, I reported that I gave a little extra morphine when I could not receive medical advice over the phone (often in the middle of the night). \u00a0I was exhausted.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n From my book, \" The Four Walls of My Freedom \":\u00a0 \n \n I remember standing at the pay telephone in the gloomy hallway, relating\nthe desperate events to our rehabilitation nurse in Ottawa. \u00a0  I described the visit to New Jersey, my\nworries about taking Nicholas home in such distress, and especially my worry\nabout failing him as a mother. \u00a0  I thought\nthat perhaps he should be placed in a long term care hospital. \u00a0  Surely they would know how to manage his pain\nbetter than me? \u00a0  Surely they would have\nshift workers who would be less exhausted and desperate than me? \u00a0  Perhaps, I imagined, people who knew me would\nrealize the unthinkable, stark gravity of this request for a hospital placement\nfor Nicholas and funds would be found to keep him at home. I was on my knees,\nbegging for help. \u00a0  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Finally, we boarded an ambulance taking us home to our local children\u2019s\nhospital in Ottawa. \u00a0  I carried the\nMontreal doctors\u2019 notes in my lap, recommending a sleep study to ensure\nbreathing safety in the event of necessary morphine increases. \u00a0  I was happy to be going home and I felt that\nthe pain team in Montreal had witnessed enough of pain at a level \u201c10/10\u201d to\nmake their recommendations irrefutable. \u00a0\n I had just got Nicholas settled into his room in the Ottawa hospital\nwhen my social worker together with the rehabilitation nurse knocked at the\ndoor. \u00a0  The look on their faces frightened\nme. \u00a0  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u00a0  My social worker looked distraught. \u00a0  The nurse said that a child protection charge\nhad been made against me. \u00a0  There would be\nan investigation into the allegation that I had overmedicated Nicholas in New\nJersey, and that because I had indicated extreme levels of stress and\nexhaustion, I was possibly trying to harm Nicholas. \u00a0  At the very least, I had given extra morphine\nwithout a prescription and potentially put his life in danger. \u00a0  I was incredulous, but at that point, I\ndidn\u2019t comprehend the full implications of this turn of events. \u00a0  Then I was told that I could not be alone in\nthe room with Nicholas. \u00a0  Easter weekend\nwas coming up and Nicholas could not come home for a weekend pass. \u00a0  I was being investigated as a mother with\nintent to harm, if not kill her child. \u00a0  A\nsense of dread, fear and helplessness oozed its way into my thoughts and\ndreams. \u00a0  I worried constantly that they\nmight take not only Nick, but also Natalie away from us. \u00a0  It was ironic, I thought, that my greatest\nfear had been Nick dying. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nA couple of months ago, I wrote a blog post titled  \"Saying I'm Fine When I'm Not\" . \u00a0I received this comment from another mother of a young man with disabilities: \u00a0 Thanks for writing this. \u00a0I think \"I'm Fine\" is a lot more than just the face we present to the world. \u00a0It's our guard against a system/society/family/community saying \"maybe they're not coping with their child with disabilities, maybe it's too much, maybe the system should step in and take that child\". \u00a0I only realized years later how close I came to losing Mike when a nurse said to me \"we're going to admit him for a few days to give you some rest.\" \u00a0Mike was actually very sick, but that wasn't what the nurse was talking about. \u00a0So \u00a0\"I'm fine\" is our way of protecting our family.... until we realize that, of course, we're not fine at all. \n \nOne mother I know was investigated by new staff at a respite facility because of bruises on her son, acquired from his falls resulting from his ataxic cerebral palsy. \u00a0Another Mum was charged with  Munchausen by Proxy  by the hospital when physicians were (at first) unable to diagnose a rare genetic disorder. \u00a0These stories are all too common. \u00a0 \n \nLess frequent are the stories of caregivers being mistakenly charged with neglect or abuse of their elderly loved ones. \u00a0At least, I have not heard stories of this kind. \n \nWhat might we deduce about underlying attitudes towards our vulnerable charges? \u00a0I believe that an unspoken assumption on the part of pediatric rehabilitation professionals is that in the case of severe disability, the human response is to harm or even murder their child. \u00a0Where elderly charges are concerned, professionals may believe this is the case, but the value of an old life is less than that of a young life, disabled or not.\u00a0 \n \nThe truth is that the vast majority of families giving care LOVE their charge. \u00a0But caregivers need help and support - to ask for that help and support does not represent ulterior motives to rid themselves of their caregiving responsibilities by harming their loved one! \u00a0Asking for help is simply that - asking for help. \u00a0It's the responsible, right thing to do and it is shameful that caregivers should feel afraid to express that need. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sJyM8CYPHdo/Udynov3s0QI/AAAAAAAAA2w/IhbfXQV3ea4/s1600/childprotection.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1373415147&sr=1-1&keywords=the+four+walls+of+my+freedom", "http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/sick/munchausen.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/07/caregivers-are-not-usually-abusers.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nFor some reason, last night our alarm clock rang at 4am. \u00a0My husband quietly cursed and fumbled to turn it off. \u00a0We both lay awake after that and quite soon, I could hear his deep and measured breathing. \u00a0He was asleep, but I was alert in the dark. \u00a0The words in my head were, \"what have I learned?\" \u00a0I began to reflect on what my children have taught me over the years.  \n \nThere is a language of shared humanity which is not verbal. \u00a0It is a watchful, intent, fascinated state of observation that never wains because it is fuelled by love. \u00a0Nicholas speaks only a few words, so when I chat with him, I sit forward, eyes scanning his body for clues to expression. \u00a0I watch his eyes, or perhaps the tilt of his head to see if he is pointing to something in his room by looking for it. \u00a0I observe a smile play around his lips and I begin to imagine what the joke might be. \u00a0When he was small and I spent far too many hours holding his arching body and stiff limbs, I learned to read every fine movement as he struggled to find comfort in my arms.  \n \n \n \n \nThe language of shared humanity is, at its most fundamental, a language of touch. \u00a0A loving thought communicated by a hand outstretched on another's arm and held there until the thought is shared silently is what I am talking about. \u00a0The idea of \"I will take care of you\" or \"I will take your pain\" passes through skin, into flesh and courses through the blood until it reaches the other's brain and resonates there - a sentiment understood without speaking.  \n \nI have learned that some people, but not all, want to help a family like ours. \u00a0I learned that it is much better to say \"yes, please!\" to those who do wish to help and enter our world. \u00a0Very recently, I went to a neighborhood drinks party. \u00a0There was a woman I recognised but couldn't place. \u00a0She approached me, asking \"Do you remember me? \u00a0I'm Jack's Mom. \u00a0Nicholas and Jack were in grade five together and Nicholas came to our house to play\". \u00a0\"Of course!\" I replied, my eyes widening. \u00a0Now I remembered this woman's warm, insistent voice. \u00a0Years ago, she offered to befriend me and for her son to befriend Nicholas. \u00a0I was amazed and touched by her goodness and her persistence. \u00a0I've also been surprised and sad that some I considered good friends turned away from us in our hour of greatest need. \u00a0Then, I learned to accept human frailty - to not be bitter, but grateful for those who do embrace us. \n \nI have learned that nature is a healing force. \u00a0When I had trouble feeding Nicholas, I watered my garden. \u00a0When I had no peace in my head from re-playing conversations about what the future might hold, I walked in the woods. \u00a0When I felt trapped by my child's overwhelming needs, I swam in our lake and felt free. \u00a0When I felt hopeless, I watched my dog chase a squirrel and return to me, her tail wagging. \n \nI have learned that there is no efficiency and no joy in trying to meet all the needs of my loved ones by myself. \u00a0I learned that a  group of caring family members and friends can work together  to support us if they are organised and have an effective way of communicating with each other.  \n \nI learned that the purpose of life is to keep going, keep breathing, keep putting one foot in front of the other and to help those I love to do the same. \u00a0I learned that happiness is sometimes a choice, and that despair is always an enemy.  \n \n \n \n \nI have learned that it is possible to have a rich life, even if one is very old or very disabled. \u00a0This is possible with curiosity, a sense of humor, a sociable personality and an optimistic nature. \n \nI have learned that kindness is the greatest virtue.  \n \nThese are some of the lessons that I have learned over the years from caring for my family. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MWKZX3L_eu0/UdTspFPCVEI/AAAAAAAAA2c/Uve_sJdcR9c/s425/touch.jpg", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wr7T404Dq9Y/UdTqVtDYIcI/AAAAAAAAA2M/KByonCk8zdc/s720/45-Lessons-in-life-1_2.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/07/the-lessons-i-have-learned-in-my-life.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nMy mother is, well, unique. \u00a0When I was in kindergarten, I walked to school - alone. \u00a0All the other children were dropped off by their parents, but my Mom just woke me up, left a bowl of cereal at the end of my bed (who doesn't love breakfast in bed?) and after we both got dressed, she left for work and we parted ways at the front door. \u00a0Mom was the only woman in our neighborhood to be employed outside the home. \u00a0She had no interest whatsoever in cooking (\"Here, eat this peanut butter sandwich so you won't be hungry anymore\") and she cleaned, but not for fun. \u00a0My Mom was the original independent, hard-nosed, who-cares-what-the-neighbors-think feminist.  \n \nMom's moral compass is embedded in her DNA - she didn't learn right from wrong at university - she never went. \u00a0After the depression, only the boys had that privilege. \u00a0But Mom always had a job; usually as a secretary at our school. \u00a0She always took jobs that allowed her to be home with us during school holidays.  \n \nGrowing up, I watched with a mixture of fascination, mortification and eventually pride as Mom would become exorcised over some perceived unfairness that my sister or I suffered at school. \u00a0On my first day of grade one, Mom let my teacher have it. \u00a0 After school, I told my parents how during class, I had put up my hand to ask for a drink from the hallway water fountain. \u00a0The day was scorching and in those days, there was no air conditioning. \u00a0The teacher refused to let any child out of class, even for water. \u00a0Mom worked in my school as the secretary and the principal was also our parish priest. \u00a0My first day at that school was also my last and I was transferred out of Catholic school into our local public one. \u00a0The priest came knocking on our door at home and pleaded with Mom to put me back into Catholic school, on religious grounds. \u00a0He might as well have been talking to a post. \n \n \n \n \nOnce, I remember that my Dad made the mistake of telling Mom (who was dressed in her pyjamas at the time) not to have her morning coffee and cigarette on our front porch. \u00a0\"I don't want the neighbours to be looking over here\", he said. \u00a0That was Mom's cue to dance around a birch seedling in our front lawn, may-pole style. \u00a0 My sister and I screeched with laughter and Dad just shook his head. \n \nWhen my sister Karen had premature twins, Mom was there for night duty. \u00a0When Nicholas was diagnosed with disabilities, Mom arrived with a pot of 'stew' (her signature dish), boxes of chocolate cookies (the marshmallow kind called \"Whippets\") and cuddles at the ready.  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen the children were small and I became exhausted from round the clock care for Nick, Mom invited me and Natalie on a holiday to her rental property in Florida. \u00a0 Even though Natalie was only three, Mom 'taught' her how to play tennis, letting me sleep for the first two days of our holiday. \n \n (Florida with Mum and StepDad Bill) \n \nOnce, when the children were a little older, Mom came to visit and help out around the house. \u00a0I arrived home from a therapy appointment with Nicholas to find my mother outside on ladder, cigarette dangling from her lips, washing the windows. \u00a0She was about 70 at the time. \u00a0\"Mom! \u00a0What are you doing?! \u00a0Get down from there!\", I shouted in alarm. \u00a0\"Well, the windows aren't going to wash themselves, they're dirty. \u00a0And where's your ironing? \u00a0I'll do that when I'm finished. \u00a0You go lie down. Now.\" \u00a0That was Mom - direct, unapologetic, funny and slightly outrageous. \n \nToday, Mom still smokes and enjoys her chocolate bars with a rum and coke. \u00a0She plays a mean hand of duplicate bridge and beats me every time at scrabble. \u00a0A couple of years ago, Mom got so annoyed at the cost of cigarettes, that she wrote a letter to the editor of her local paper voicing her opinion that seniors who contributed to the war effort should be exempt from paying taxes on smokes.  \n \nWhat did I learn from my mother? \u00a0I learned resilience, assertiveness, kindness, loyalty and a passion for justice. \u00a0These are all qualities that I endeavor to use daily in my work as a caregiver activist. \u00a0Thank you Mom, and Happy Mother's Day. \u00a0You are one of a kind and I love you. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k0rkCw3TMZk/UYri55csTWI/AAAAAAAAAyI/FUKzeF25LLw/s1600/Mom.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UuslTPCgx4Y/UYrjhi6jDgI/AAAAAAAAAyQ/0O_tioMtysA/s1600/Oldfamilypic.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dnox1vZs6f8/UYrjp715pMI/AAAAAAAAAyY/NEo2a7UCTHI/s1600/MumNickbaby.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DamfzJC83cM/UYrj2D34jII/AAAAAAAAAyg/U0BwbVCpwoM/s1600/MumandNickolder.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CydObQRLnb4/UYr5p64ElzI/AAAAAAAAAy8/6lYvL-WmE-s/s1600/mumandnat.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HubpSiZrPa0/UYrkzER6UpI/AAAAAAAAAys/7EQSZfGLzQk/s1600/Mumbday.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/05/meet-my-mother-natural-born-activist.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nIn an unexpected, swift life change, you're suddenly the caregiver for your loved one who's been diagnosed with dementia. Your life and priorities have changed forever. As your loved one begins to lose physical abilities and mental capabilities, your life will revolve around caring for them. Knowing what to expect can make the road ahead easier and more manageable to navigate. \n \n \nExpectations \n \n \nMedical science can help slow the progression of the disease, but it is a  terminal disease  (HelpGuide.org). While this can be difficult to accept, understanding the disease at its outset will help you learn about what is going to happen in the coming years. Expectations also help limit feelings of grief and anger as you endure difficult days and challenging moments. \n \nPatients with dementia often cannot control their behaviors. They may ask the same question over and over or get lost easily, according to caregiver.org. An individual with dementia may also experience mood disorders and extreme anger. They can forget people, places and events. As a caregiver, expect to face hardships and challenges that can be physically and emotionally draining. \n \n \nPreparation for Help \n \n \nThroughout your dementia journey, you will need help. Trying to do it alone will only make it difficult and frustrate both of you. In addition to emotional support, you'll likely need the ongoing help of a health care professional with the proper health care background and education, such as certifiable\u00a0 PSW courses in Ontario  or another city. A PSW is a personal support worker who has the trained skills and knowledge to care for clients suffering from dementia. They can help with mental activation and assist with personal hygiene.  \n \n \nEmotional Support \n \n \nWatching someone you love slip away little by little is painful. Grief and anger are normal. You may even question the diagnosis when things are going well, according to StrengthforCaring.com. Emotions and denial can impact your ability to care for the individual, so it's important to understand, accept and deal with them.\u00a0In the midst of negative emotions, consider these strategies, as recommended by CaregiverSupport.org: \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n Identify and surrender to feelings \n \n \n\u00a0\n Remove yourself from the situation when frustrated \n \n \n\u00a0\n Figure out the trigger \n \n \n\u00a0\n Talk to someone you trust or write in a journal \n \n \n\u00a0\n Remember to care for your own needs \n \n \n\u00a0\n Know your limits and stick to them \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYour bond with your loved one will grow as you care and provide companionship. You'll create greater compassion and acceptance. You'll also make new relationships as you seek support and education. \n \n \nPractical Tips for Dementia Caregivers \n \n \nWhen you are in the trenches of caring for someone with dementia, life can feel overwhelming. Keep the following tips in mind: \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n Distinguish between what you can and cannot change \n \n \n\u00a0\n Recognize signs of frustration and ask for help when you start to get frustrated \n \n \n\u00a0\n Focus on redirection, not reality\u00a0(For example, instead of reminding the individual that her mother is dead, ask her to tell you about her mother when she asks for her) \n \n \n\u00a0\n Avoid making agreements, as the individual may not remember anyway \n \n \n\u00a0\n Learn to tell, not ask (StrengthforCaring.com) \n \n \n \nCalling this journey difficult is an understatement. Asking for help doesn't mean you love the individual less or are less committed. Learn your limits and research what you can about the disease. Accept help and you'll get through this journey gracefully. \n \nBy\u00a0 Alexis Brown \n \nAlexis is a medical student from Philadelphia and writes for several blogs. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.helpguide.org/elder/alzheimers_disease_dementia_support_caregiver.htm", "http://www.everest.ca/campus/toronto_college_park/program/personal-support-worker", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xGeYXhkHoUU/UbpDIONQr9I/AAAAAAAAA1I/8f1zU8OTpb4/s1600/caregiver.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/06/guest-post-diagnosed-with-dementia-what.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday I tuned in to a podcast about a new model of care in Australia. \u00a0Initially I thought I might be able to double-task by writing some easy emails while listening. \u00a0But almost immediately, I abandoned that idea and grabbed paper and pen instead. \u00a0I needed to remember everything about this podcast and consider what it meant to me - both professionally and personally.  \n \n Social Innovation Generation (SiG)  in Toronto, Canada sponsored this presentation by  Sarah Schulman  titled \"Are We Doing Good?\" \u00a0SiG described it this way: \u00a0 For the past 5 years, Sarah Schulman has been \u2018radically redesigning\u2019 youth, family crisis, and aged care services. People in this line of work talk a lot about social problems (wicked versus tame). They talk a lot about methods (design thinking, systems thinking). And they even talk a lot about impact (effective, efficient). But, they don't talk nearly enough about what is good. Do you? \n \n Listen to the podcast  HERE .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sarah began by introducing Dudley and Daphne, a couple both in their 90's and still living in their home in Australia. \u00a0Dudley is a former race car driver and Daphne was his pit crew. \u00a0Now, with limited mobility and a range of health issues, Dudley and Daphne sit at home, either staring out the window or watching television. \u00a0Daphne reflects, \"This isn't a life. \u00a0I'd rather be dead than live like this.\" \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Mary is Daphne and Dudley's care worker. \u00a0She delivers social and communication care to the couple for 90 minutes per week in addition to popping in six days a week to give them both a bath. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Daphne and Dudley's adult children worry about their parents and were happy when they stopped driving. \u00a0They disapproved of their parents buying french fries on their outings, reasoning that high fat foods would contribute to heart disease. \n \n \n \n All the parties contributing to Daphne and Dudley's care had a different idea of what was 'good' for the elderly couple. \u00a0The agency that employed Mary believed that good care was delivered if it 'did not go overtime and it kept the clients happy.\" \u00a0The government ministry that paid the agency to deliver care maintained that 'good' was achieved if Dudley and Daphne remained alive. \u00a0The couple's adult children believed that 'good' was upheld in their parents' lives if the grandparents did not die and did not cause worry by indulging in risk-taking behaviours. \u00a0Dudley and Daphne themselves were deeply unhappy and lacked purpose in getting out of bed every day. \n \n \n \n Dr. Schulman's innovative program  \"InWithFor\" \u00a0seeks to develop a language to talk about what is good, for starters. \u00a0What does good look like for individual service users? \u00a0Questions like, \"When do you feel most independent and in control?\" lead to a deeper conversation about how help can become meaningful and helpful. \u00a0Dr. Schulman has set herself a daunting task - it is to seek the end of a flourishing life in those who need care. \u00a0In order to achieve her goal, new capacities must be developed in creative problem solving at all levels. \u00a0The values and ideals of service users must be actively sought and acted upon. \u00a0Schulman's model is certainly bottom up and not top down. \n \n \n \n Dudley and Daphne are not the only examples of care receivers described in Schulman's podcast - there is a disenfranchised and employed youth and a recovering addict with ten children. \u00a0Redesigning services with a good life as an end goal for different sorts of care recipients is no simple feat. \u00a0But anyone interested in knowing how should begin by listening to  this podcast  today.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sigeneration.ca/", "http://www.inwithfor.org/who/biographies/", "http://vimeo.com/67212403", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L43GeLKuN8c/UaaPxdKLgtI/AAAAAAAAA0U/DVfQ1tFobQ0/s1600/InWithFor_TACSI-600x417.jpg", "http://www.inwithfor.org/", "http://vimeo.com/67212403"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/05/just-breathing-vs-good-life.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nSometimes, my son makes bad choices. \u00a0So does my mother. \u00a0Nicholas almost always decides what he wants (and what he doesn't!) based on short term pleasure (and pain avoidance). \u00a0This means, he will NEVER choose to have an injectable medication, an enema, or go the ER, even if his life depends on it. \u00a0Luckily, Nick's caregivers and his family know his foibles and together, we make sure that if our young man needs treatment, he gets it, no matter what. \n \nWith Mom, it's different, but the problem is essentially the same. \u00a0She doesn't like the food at her seniors' residence, so she removed her name from the meal plan. \u00a0To be honest, a lot of it does not agree with her delicate digestive system, so she has a point. \u00a0But in her apartment, she can't be bothered to eat the chicken sandwich my sister has made or even her favorite rhubarb pie that I brought last week.  \n \nSometimes, bad choices that vulnerable people make can have terrible consequences. \u00a0My friend is a foster Mom to a LOT of children with disabilities. \u00a0One of her foster daughters had a developmental disability as well as a tracheotomy, a breathing tube that needed suctioning on a regular basis. \u00a0When the young teenager went into a nursing home for a few days to give my friend a break, the nurses did not suction the tube. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Because my friend's foster daughter waved them away. \u00a0She didn't like the suctioning, so she 'refused it'. \u00a0Mucus eventually blocked the tube and my friend's foster daughter died.  \n \nThe problem of championing individual choice at all costs is particularly dangerous in the case of cognitive impairments. \u00a0Another friend's Mom was hospitalised with the physical effects of advanced Alzheimer's. \u00a0When my friend arrived at her mother's bedside, she asked a nurse when her Mom had last had a bath. \u00a0\"Oh, she hasn't had a bath since she arrived here. \u00a0She said she didn't want one.\" \u00a0My friend was incredulous - \"What do you mean, she didn't want one?! \u00a0She doesn't know what she wants, she has Alzheimer's!\" \u00a0My friend wheeled her mother down the hall and bathed her herself.  \n \nMany home health care workers and other health professionals are trained to respect patient choice. \u00a0And that, of course, is a very good thing. \u00a0But sometimes, that can have harmful, even fatal consequences when common sense isn't part of the equation. \u00a0Have you had an experience where the rule of patient choice has been applied without the benefit of observation and common sense? \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SQLGO32m-nM/UZGCccA9XWI/AAAAAAAAAzg/SJ-RC7L7OeU/s1600/choice.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/05/when-patient-choices-are-harmful.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \nIn my last blog post, I wrote about the messy business of\noverriding bad decisions that vulnerable loved ones sometimes make. The\npotential for anything from hurt feelings to fisticuffs is clear and present\nwhen families disagree with a vulnerable relative on treatment plans, housing\nsolutions, care needs or any other matters of daily living.\u00a0 When an adult loved one is deemed to be\nlacking \u2018capacity\u2019 or the ability to make important life decisions in his or\nher own best interests, there are usually only a few legal alternatives and\nnone of them are ideal \u2013 at least as far as the vulnerable person is\nconcerned.\u00a0  \n \n \n \nTHE STATUS QUO \n \nIn most places there are two sets of tools: one set that is\navailable to people who are deemed to have legal capacity and one set that is\nused when people are found not to have legal capacity. Furthermore, there are\ntools available for financial decisions and tools available for health and\npersonal care decisions.  Powers of Attorney  enable people to designate another\nperson to handle their financial affairs. A person must have capacity to sign\nover Power of Attorney. \u00a0We have Powers of Attorney for my\nmother \u2013 one for finances and one for personal care decisions.\u00a0 We also have a separate \u2018bank\u2019 Power of\nAttorney that allows my sister and I to handle Mom\u2019s banking at her branch when\nshe is unable to go to the bank herself. \u00a0For Nicholas, we have a Power of Attorney that he signed over to us and we used it to open his bank account when we moved from the UK to Canada in 2011.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal Directives, sometimes called Advance Care\nDirectives are used to appoint another person to make health and personal care\ndecisions. Personal Directives might have different names in different\njurisdictions. Personal Directives can also only be written if a person is\ndeemed to have capacity. They are usually designed to be used when the person\ncan no longer give consent for treatment or care. \n \n \n \nAdult Guardianship is used in the case of adult disability\nto appoint a substitute decision-maker when a person is found not to have\ncapacity and needs someone to manage their financial or legal affairs or to\nmake decisions about their health or personal care. Adult Guardians are also sometimes\ncalled Committee, Trustee, Curator. Generally, Guardians have full authority to\nmake decisions on behalf of the person. In some places, such as Ontario\n(Canada), Guardians are granted powers only in areas in which there is a need\nfor substitute decision-making and there is an expectation that they consult\nthe person to determine their preferences and wishes. \u00a0 Under adult guardianship procedures, if an individual is declared incompetent/incapable, they are legally a non \u2010 person. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTHE REVOLUTIONARY IDEA \n \nAll the really revolutionary ideas in social care have come\nfrom families.\u00a0 Strategies to create\nlegal frameworks that support loving relationships and enshrine the moral\npersonhood of vulnerable people are tricky to design, but a group of families\nand professionals did it in British Columbia, Canada.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how: \n \n \n \nSupported decision making is different from substitute\ndecision making. Substitute decision making is when someone takes the place of\nan individual who is determined incapable of managing their affairs or making\ndecisions. The substitute decision maker acts on behalf of and in the best\ninterests of the individual. This is the approach reflected in Power of\nAttorney and health care proxy decision making. \u00a0The trick for policy-makers was how to create a legal framework for supported decision making. \u00a0In BC, they did it with the The Representation Agreement Act. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo one writes with more authority about this issue than my colleague, Al Etmanski. \u00a0Al is a Canadian change-maker with international impact. \u00a0He was a prime mover in this and many other pieces of legislation in BC supporting vulnerable citizens and their families. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAl describes the BC policy this way:\u00a0 \n \n The Representation Agreement Act of British Columbia   was\ncreated from a philosophy that views people as capable even if they cannot\nmanage their own affairs or give informed consent. A representative(s)is always\nlistening to the individual\u2019s communication (all forms of communication are\nrecognized) to enable them to participate in decision making. A representative not\nonly preserves an individual\u2019s self \u2010 determination, they\nstrive to enhance it. A representative does not take the place of the\nindividual, they act as a bridge to help third parties know and interact with\nthe individual. \n \n \n \n \n \n Supported decision making is not just support with decision\nmaking.

{"date": "", "body": "\nFamilies of adult children with disabilities in Ontario, Canada, are  in the news today . \u00a0An Ottawa mother, Amanda Telford, 'abandoned' her son Phillip (aged 19) in the offices of Ontario Social Services and the lines in her tearful, exhausted face tell a story of frustration, isolation and lack of support for her family. Telford's son Philippe has severe autism, developmental disabilities and challenging behaviors.  \n \n \nA few days ago, Philippe escaped from the family home and wandered to a restaurant three miles away before he was found. \u00a0The next day, he managed to open a locked medicine cabinet and swallowed a bottle of blood pressure pills, necessitating a seven hour stay in the ER before he was declared healthy and fit to return home. \u00a0When he reached home, he escaped again. \n \nPhilippe Telford requires twenty-four hour one to one supervision to keep him safe. \u00a0He is non-verbal and very physically strong as well as agile. \u00a0When Philippe turned 19, his access to school ended and his name went on a long waiting list for day programs and supportive housing. \u00a0Philippe must wait for someone currently receiving service to pass away before he will be offered assistance. \u00a0And there's a good chance that Philippe is not even at the top of the waiting list - clients whose parents are dead have top spot. \u00a0Amanda Telford abandoned her son in order to get him the services he needs to be safe. \n \n Currently in Ontario, an inquiry is being carried out by the provincial Ombudsman  into the crises of families who are struggling to support their adult with developmental disabilities. \u00a0So far, the Ombudsman has taken statements from 700 families in crisis and that number is growing quickly. \u00a0Families are desperate and push has come to shove. \n \nInstitutions to support adults with disabilities in this province and elsewhere have closed, and that is a good thing. \u00a0But the funds realised from the closure of those facilities have not been reinvested into families who support the next generation of children with disabilities growing up. \u00a0Community care policies were developed 'back in the day' when a developmental disability was a life-limiting condition. \u00a0As recently as twenty-five years ago, medical textbooks listed the longevity of someone living with Down's Syndrome as 21 years. \u00a0Today, those without complicating medical conditions live normal life spans. \u00a0Today's young adults are the first generation of people with disabilities who live outlive their parents - ever. \u00a0And no government anywhere is ready for this social phenomenon.  \n \nTwo things we know for sure: \u00a01) we have growing numbers of people aging into disability AND increasing numbers of people with disability aging and 2) community care budgets are being impossibly stretched due to these demographic changes, pitting an aging population against people with disabilities. \u00a0  \n \nToday, a CBC radio show \" Ontario Today \" took calls from families in crisis trying to find day programs and housing solutions for their adult children with developmental disabilities, including autism. \u00a0I hope that both provincial and federal authorities involved in social care policy heard the program. \u00a0Every parent caller knew what kind of help they needed. \u00a0They had developed solutions that were \u00a0creative, responsive, collaborative and fair. \u00a0Many parents expressed a wish to co-pay with government such solutions and to remain significantly involved in their child's life. \u00a0Every parent who called in was exhausted, desperately worried, and very angry. \u00a0But, they also expressed the deep and abiding love for their vulnerable children, the same as any parent would express for their able-bodied child.  \n \nOur society used to have institutions for vulnerable citizens. \u00a0Then the institutions closed and families were expected to 'look after their own'. \u00a0But families cannot look after a vulnerable child forever. \u00a0Parents get old and infirm, or they die. \u00a0Direct care and housing solutions need to be co-created by families together with policy-makers. \u00a0The will is there, the time is right. \u00a0Let's do it now.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2013/05/01/ottawa-autism-son-left-government-services.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XGFp0bxhCZs/UYK5r9dATFI/AAAAAAAAAxY/mhDfn7e-_hc/s1600/telford.jpeg", "http://www.ombudsman.on.ca/Newsroom/Press-Release/2012/Ontario-Ombudsman-to-investigate-provinces-servic.aspx?lang=en-CA", "http://www.ombudsman.on.ca/Newsroom/Press-Release/2012/Ontario-Ombudsman-to-investigate-provinces-servic.aspx?lang=en-CA", "http://www.cbc.ca/ontariotoday/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/05/amanda-telford-is-good-mother.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nThere are some people who, in the prime of their lives, cannot conceive of getting old. \u00a0They imagine that only other people have babies with disabling conditions. \u00a0They champion independence and despise infirmity. \u00a0Those people might believe that if anything catastrophic ever DID happen to them, then surely the government or some agency or other would step in to help. \n \nWrong. \n \nFamilies living in the trenches of caregiving know only too well that there is not enough help (if any at all). \u00a0Day programmes, respite care, supported housing options, home nursing are all just pie in the sky dreams for many who cannot afford to pay privately for all the services they need. \n \nMy last post told the story of an Ottawa (Canada) mother,  Amanda Telford , who was forced to abandon her 19 year old son Philippe in the offices of the local social services center. \u00a0Philippe Telford-Chiasson has a \u00a0severe form of autism, challenging behaviors, tourettes syndrome and diabetes. \u00a0Last week, he ran away, managed to unlock a medicine cabinet at home where he found and swallowed 14 blood pressure tablets and then ran away again. \u00a0Amanda Telford and her husband lost most of their support services once Philippe turned 19. (Adult services in Ontario are poorly funded and waiting lists for services are years long.) \u00a0The events of last week were the last straw and all of Canada watched on the evening news as a devastated mother said a tearful goodbye to her son on the steps of a government building. \n \n \n \n \nFamilies like the Telfords have something in common with the legions of caregivers struggling to manage the complex needs of relatives with cancer, Alzheimer's, stroke or any number of disabling conditions. \u00a0Sometimes, the medical and social/emotional needs of a loved one are just too much for one person or even one family to manage. \n \nWe can share the social/emotional care (although it's trickier in the case of mental illness) and specialised web-based platforms such as  Tyze Personal Networks  are terrific for that. \u00a0But we can't share nursing or personal care. \u00a0We can't ask friends or family to stay awake all night to prevent someone wandering or monitor respiration. \u00a0We can't ask them to change dressings or assess medication side-effects. \n \nThe demographics of aging are unprecedented - huge numbers of baby boomers are aging into disability and people with disabilities are living into old age. \u00a0So, what can we do? \u00a0What will be required of citizens, governments and businesses to ensure that we don't find ourselves in Amanda's Telford's nightmare, or something like it? \n \nPart of the answer to that question is in the  latest newspaper report on the Telford case titled \"Autistic teen left by mother gets a home \". \u00a0The key sentence in the article is this: (Amanda Telford) \"What I really like is that developmental service agencies came together and worked with Champlain District CCAC, which is Ministry of Health funded.\" \u00a0Philippe Telford needs developmental services because he is autistic and has developmental disabilities. \u00a0But he also has complex health challenges due to his diabetes. \u00a0Two government ministries worked together to create a solution that resulted in safe housing with appropriate support, and that is novel. \u00a0Inter-ministerial funding, to say nothing of public/private partnerships are difficult to monitor. \u00a0For bureaucrats, the need for accountability and transparency can sometimes override service provision in their list of priorities - we live in a very risk averse society and politicians know that vulnerable people and their families can represent a political minefield as well as a financial sinkhole. \n \nBut sharing the burden of care across government ministries IS the way forward. \u00a0Someone will just have to figure out the accountability issues. \u00a0Helping all the older people in our society to stay at home longer, helping their families to stay healthy and happy, enabling young adults with disabilities and their families to plan their futures without fear and dread - all these things can be done. \u00a0To do so, we need to share the financial burden across sectors AND seek innovative business opportunities that have shared social objectives as well as sustainable financial models.  \n \nIn my own family, we DID find ourselves in something like the Telford's nightmare. \u00a0It was 2004 and my son Nicholas had uncontrolled hip pain. \u00a0Oral morphine, muscle relaxants and nerve blocks did nothing to stop the screaming. \u00a0A complex condition of untreatable sleep apnea put Nick on the palliative care list - doctors said he might have two months to live. \u00a0Maximum allowable levels of home nursing support hardly touched Nick's complex needs and our case was brought forward to our local 'committee of last resort'. \u00a0A full fledged appeal to override policy on maximum support began in earnest. \u00a0When I complained to a nurse that the prescribed amounts of pain medications did not alleviate Nicholas' excruciating pain, I was charged with child endangerment because I had reported to a nurse that I gave a small amount of extra morphine at 3am when I could not reach the hospital pain team by phone to advise me. \u00a0The Children's Aid Society inquiry found that Nick was at risk due to lack of services - they declared the care we gave to our son was exemplary. \u00a0The case reached the provincial appeal board where senior representatives of multiple government ministries discussed how to help us and how to pay for that help. \u00a0Finally, we got a deal - a deal that paid for nursing care Nick needed. \u00a0But that deal ended the day our son turned 19. \u00a0I tell this story in my book,  \"The Four Walls of My Freedom\". \n \nIn both Canada and the UK, representatives of Health as well as Social Services would talk about our son and point to each other, saying \"this case is for you!\" \u00a0For many years, as with the Telford family, nothing happened due to political wrangling and our family paid dearly for that inaction. \u00a0In our experience, the system failed when they tried to assign Nicholas to just one homecare budget. \u00a0We received the support we needed when multiple partners came to the table to collaborate and innovate.  \n \nAs a country that is part of North American society, can we assist the needs of vulnerable people and their families in ways that are individual, imaginative and flexible? \u00a0Can we bring social entrepreneurs into the equation to link communities and families with medical education opportunities such as perhaps health care certification for trained new immigrants? \u00a0Can we begin to value the giving and receiving of care? \u00a0I believe that we can do all these things. \u00a0The first step is realising that no one family, no one government funding entity, and no one sector of society can do it alone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5fS8GNrOqHc/UYbI9Yf51lI/AAAAAAAAAx0/n_lJv7qczvo/s1600/me.jpeg", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2013/05/01/ottawa-autism-son-left-government-services.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FGYbUTQa39o/UYbHHFdTi3I/AAAAAAAAAxo/m6LCEAEYqlw/s1600/telford.jpeg", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2013/05/01/ottawa-autism-son-left-government-services.html", "http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1367787004&sr=8-1&keywords=the+four+walls+of+my+freedom"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/05/when-familys-love-is-not-enough.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThe world is reeling from the news of a  terrible explosion at the Boston marathon .  \n \n \n \n \nIn my morning newspaper today, I read  this by Craig and Marc Kielburger,  brothers who founded the charity  Free The Children  and the  Me To We  Social Enterprise:  \n \n \n \n\"A Halifax girl is allegedly raped by four of her classmates, and her peers use social media to spread a photo of the incident throughout her high school. Haunted by the pain and humiliation, she ends her life. \n \nLast September, a British Columbia teen posts a heartrending video detailing the constant cyber-bullying she endured for more than a year. One month later she commits suicide. \n \nIn Ottawa, three teenage girls stand trial for human trafficking and running a prostitution ring. South of the border, in Steubenville, Ohio, two high school football players are headed to prison for rape, and two girls face charges for threatening the victim. In Fort Colville, Wash., a pair of boys just 10 and 11 years old are charged with plotting to rape and murder seven classmates.\" \n \n \n \nThe Kielburgers wrote about the need for teaching compassion in schools. \u00a0Perhaps a curriculum in kindness would not have stopped the Boston bomber, but with so much hatred and violence in our midst, it is at least a positive direction to contemplate. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Kielburger brothers continue, \"In 2006, in anticipation of a visit from the Dalai Lama, teachers across the Vancouver School Board developed lesson plans for exploring compassion. Under the board's five-year plan for social responsibility, compassion is being integrated into the elementary and secondary curriculum - English, drama, even science. Other organizations like Roots of Empathy, the Kindness Foundation and the Hawn Foundation are also developing resources and lesson plans to teach compassion in a school setting.\" \n \n \n \nSo, what does any of this have to do with caregivers? \u00a0Well, caregivers are the epitome of compassion in action. \u00a0We have something to teach the world about kindness and so do our charges. \u00a0I became a better listener when my father lost his speech after his third stroke at the age of 52. \u00a0My son Nicholas was frequently paired with the kids in class who posed behavior problems at school. \u00a0Nick's best friend lived in a group home for children with 'oppositional defiance disorder'. \u00a0That lovely boy came with us to the movies, to museums... he stayed here for sleepovers and never, EVER did he cause any problems. \u00a0On the contrary, he was Nick's special helper and protector from would-be bullies on the playground. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI know that my mother makes my sister and I better citizens by helping her with health or practical challenges of aging. \u00a0Sometimes, Mom could teach the class in 'oppositional defiance', but her determination to choose (even when those choices are not in her best interest) forces us to see life from her perspective. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nLooking after others and seeing life through their eyes makes us more fully human. \u00a0Today, we caregivers can show others the meaning of compassion. \u00a0Today, many will be looking for answers and paying close attention.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/04/live-updates-boston-marathon-explosion/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-52yER5ztBjM/UWyTtPMS2CI/AAAAAAAAAwY/URrhMM8hAGA/s1600/boston.jpeg", "http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Teaching+compassion+classroom/8242793/story.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_the_Children", "http://www.metowe.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B7WG5B0KOvw/UWyTcvNs_2I/AAAAAAAAAwQ/xxt9pfy-vcw/s1600/marc.jpeg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/04/searching-for-roots-of-compassion-in.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nWhen I was a teenager, my Dad had a series of strokes. \u00a0When Mum went into the hospital for minor surgery, a woman in a white uniform arrived in our house to take care of Dad. \u00a0I couldn't stand her and she didn't think much of me. \u00a0In those days, I was studying theatre at university and rehearsals often lasted till well into the night. \u00a0This nurse disapproved of my hours, of the state of my bedroom, and I suppose she disapproved of the way that I spoke to my Dad (normally). \u00a0I was glad to see the back of her. \n \nOver the years, I've learned a lot about the power politics that sometimes play out in homecare. \u00a0I have learned that caregivers who are team players by nature often become like members of our extended family. \u00a0I have learned that in home nursing for children, the rules of agencies are often at odds with what families need (eg. we don't want uniforms that remind my child of hospital stays and painful procedures). \u00a0All families are different and families have the right not to be judged in their own home.  \n \nFor the most part, we have had wonderful paid caregivers in our home - people who honestly loved my family members with care needs and respected our way of life in our most private domain. \u00a0Once in a while though, a nurse would arrive who insisted on the uniform. \u00a0We had a male nurse who insisted on changing everything around in Nicholas' room to be more 'like we do it in the hospital'. \u00a0He constantly referred to me as 'Mum'. \u00a0Calling mothers 'Mum' is standard fare in hospitals where doctors see so many sick children that they cannot possibly remember parents' names. \u00a0But at home, I wasn't having it. \u00a0\"I'm sure your mother would rather have exclusive rights to being called \"Mum\" - please do call me Donna. \u00a0I insist, as this is my home\", I said, smiling. \u00a0My little ploy had no effect and this nurse continued to wear his uniform and call me \"Mum\". \u00a0We replaced him. \n \nPalliative care is a discipline that has mastered the art of working with families. \u00a0Homecare workers of all levels are team members with caregivers, but it's the patient and family who are the acknowledged leaders. Our palliative care doctor (and all his staff) were the best example of team players I have ever seen. \u00a0Basically the message was \"what would you like to do about this and how can we help?\" \u00a0Naturally, that is a very different message from one in the hospital where you need the professionals to take charge and direct treatment. \u00a0But even then, in the case of chronic care and lengthy hospitalisations, the relations between family, patient and professionals rightly take a shift to be more relaxed, open and collaborative.  \n \nOne thing I know is that I cannot give care alone. \u00a0For my complex relatives, it takes a team of family together with professionals from across disciplines and levels of qualification. \u00a0Besides great professional skills, I look for friendliness and flexibility in our prospective team members. \u00a0Oh, yes, and a sense of humour. \u00a0With those qualities, we're bound to be friends for life. \n \n Sometimes caregivers are silly. We like that. \n \n \n And we like it when they are kind. \n \n \n \nI could tell so many stories of the kindness of our own team members.... doctors who hugged me, nurses who cried with me, and our forever friends who have lived with us and helped me with whatever we needed in the way of, well, everything. \u00a0But for the last week, the family care online forums have been awash in tears for a little boy with disabilities who passed away. \u00a0His name was Gavin and his mother Kate Leong, wrote about his life and passing in her blog \" Chasing Rainbows \". \u00a0Kate and her husband wanted Gavin to help other children, even in death, so they donated his organs. \u00a0Kate posted this message on facebook a couple of days ago. \u00a0To me, this message speaks to the bonds between professionals and family caregivers that can be forged by facing struggles together, as one. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Whenever Gavin was hospitalized - or even there for an appointment - it always felt like we were home with family. He was so loved by his doctors - and we loved them, too. I was so grateful to get this email (which I'm sharing with permis sion) from Gavin's Orthopedic doctor who was always amazed with his progress and determination. Thank you, Dr. Peter Gabos, for taking such good care of my son... and for comforting me with this message: *** Dear Ms. Leong\u2014 I was in the OR yesterday operating in the room right next to Gavin\u2019s. You can imagine my shock and profound sadness when I learned he was in fact the child undergoing organ harvest. We stopped our case in a moment of absolute silence for him. I am so profoundly saddened by your loss. The world has truly lost one of its most courageous beings. The example of care and unconditional love that infused through you to him will stay with me forever. I am so blessed to have been touched by the both of you.

{"date": "", "body": "\nBefore computers, I relied on a monthly magazine for my connection to other caregivers. \u00a0I was a new mother of a baby with severe disabilities and that magazine was called  \"Exceptional Parent\"(now re-named EParent Magazine) . \u00a0I would rifle through the magazine in search of the page titled 'Letters' and there, I would read messages such as \"Hi, my name is Sarah and my son David was born with cerebral palsy. \u00a0But it's not his CP that worries me. \u00a0It's his mysterious and very high nighttime fevers.....\" \u00a0These letters about symptoms, behaviors, strange rashes, rumors of new treatments and possible cures.... these letters were my lifeline to other parents who were something like me.  \n \n \n \n \nA few years later when the internet came along, I joined the first big disability online community called  Braintalk Communities . \u00a0I found my natural home in a forum called \"Child Neurology\" and there, I made friends. \u00a0Rose, Lisa, Robin, Tracy, Micky, Deborah, Mary Grace, Paul, Tamie... these are just a few of the Braintalk people I call I real friends, even though I have never met them. \u00a0But I write often privately to Rose and I telephone Tracy and Micky if their children are ill and I want to offer closer support. \u00a0These online friends and I share a unique bond of our 'exceptional parenting' experience. \u00a0Country of citizenship, economic status and political leanings are all irrelevant in our club. \u00a0We have more important matters to discuss: our complicated children and our own experience as their loving nurturers. \n \nI still talk to my friends on Braintalk, but there aren't many of us left there. \u00a0Most folks have gravitated to blogs or Facebook to talk about their challenges. \u00a0But, for me, Braintalk is still that 'safe' room where I can rattle on about tube feeds, enemas and I can even spice up the conversation with the kind of black humor that my friends there will understand. \u00a0I don't mind the quiet of my old chat room. \n \nEvery so often in other online support communities, I see glimpses of deep and authentic online friendships between parents who have never met. \u00a0I saw one yesterday.  \n \nEllen Seidman writes a blog about her son called \" Love That Max \" - it's a blog I visit often. \u00a0Two days ago, Ellen wrote about her online friend Kate, another parent blogger whose son Gavin had become gravely and suddenly ill. \u00a0Last night, this beloved boy passed away.  \n \nThis is what Ellen wrote when Gavin was in ICU: \u00a0 I have never met Kate in\u00a0person. And yet, I\u00a0 know \u00a0her. Mom to Gavin and Brian, she blogs at\u00a0 Chasing Rainbows ;\u00a0we've exchanged comments and emails for years. She is the one who let me know \u00a0Duke University was doing stem cell infusions, where Max got his. Gavin's diagnosed with cerebral palsy, but Kate's never been totally convinced that's what he has. She's done everything within her powers to help him, from making special nutrition-packed purees to setting up a hyperbaric oxygen tent in her basement. Gavin, who's 5, recently started walking independently. \n \n I know Kate. You do, too. Because she is any one of us, loving up her child, continuously finding new ways to help him and spreading the word about his greatness. And she does it with particular spirit and humor. \n \nThis morning, I decided to check on Kate and Gavin and I was devastated to read this: \n \n Five and a half years ago, a tiny precious boy was born to two broken people. \u00a0He came with no instructions and a body that often failed him, leaving us feeling determined, yet helpless at the same time. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n We embarked on the journey of a lifetime with this boy. \u00a0He healed our brokenness with his spirit, he inspired us with his courage and he brought hope to families and children and educators and doctors and therapists and more without ever uttering one word. \n \n \n \n I never in a MILLION years thought I'd be writing this. \n \n \n \n Today, Ed and I are holding Gavin's hand as he takes a new journey that doesn't include us. \n \n \n \n \n \n I am heartbroken for Kate, for Brian, her husband and for sweet Gavin. \u00a0There, by the grace of God go I .... go  we . \u00a0Rest In Peace, Gavin - you are loved by many like me, who never met you.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.eparent.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-utkf5qEqKXw/UWlg6BwJfzI/AAAAAAAAAwA/dJZfaW4uFow/s1600/EP.jpg", "http://braintalkcommunities.org/", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/", "http://www.kateleong.com/", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/2010/06/great-big-thank-you-tokate-at-gavin.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LQqvAlxuiU8/UWghRwj_bQI/AAAAAAAAKRY/z9YZJ3fOHeI/s1600/100_3211.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-phNIyvCKHC4/UWgftRnx_-I/AAAAAAAAKQ4/LuTpTo1pn6A/s1600/IMG_0042.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/04/cyber-friendship-love-and-grief.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nI peer at an x-ray of my spine. \u00a0I'm looking at my neck bones, trying to figure out why my right arm is constantly numb or tingling... why my hand itches and sometimes I feel electric shocks in my shoulder. I know my lower back is shot. \u00a0Disintegrating discs mean that I have to be very careful lifting anything heavier than about 20 pounds. \n \nIt wasn't always like this. \u00a0For years, I lifted Nicholas.... right up until he was 18 and nearly six feet tall. \"Hey Nick\", I'd say, \"You are my personal trainer! \u00a0No osteoporosis for me - I'm as strong as a WWE wrestler. \u00a0I kick butt!\" \u00a0And we would both giggle at my ridiculous effort to imitate his wrestling superstars. \n \nRegrets? \u00a0I have a few. \u00a0One of them is lifting Nicholas so long without bothering to use a lifting device. \u00a0We eventually had a ceiling track installed, but it was always so much quicker just to lift Nick myself instead of bothering with the sling. \u00a0Now, I am paying the price for thinking that I was immune from the wear and tear of repetitive strain.  \n \nSo, this week, on doctor's orders, I had a massage. \u00a0Karina, the massage therapist has the build of a long -distance swimmer and the manner of a zen healer. \u00a0She runs a clinic near my home called \" Metta Message \". \u00a0I asked Karina about the meaning of Metta and she explained that it is a Buddhist practice of meditation. \u00a0\"Umm humm,\" I was relaxed, listening at this point. \u00a0\"Anyone can practice Metta. \u00a0It involves the contemplation of loving kindness - the sort that you feel for your new baby.\" \u00a0My eyes opened and I began to listen very intently. \u00a0\"You begin by directing all that loving kindness to yourself, as if you are the baby. \u00a0You meditate to fill yourself up with loving kindness. \u00a0That way, you are ready to begin giving it to others.\" \u00a0\"Ohhh\", I thought.  \n \n \n \n \nHere is how the  Wikipedia explains the Metta  practice: \n \nThe cultivation of loving-kindness ( mett\u0101 bh\u0101van\u0101 ) is a popular form of\u00a0 meditation in Buddhism . In the Theravadin Buddhist tradition, this practice begins with the meditator cultivating loving-kindness towards themselves, [7] \u00a0then one's loved ones, friends, teachers, strangers, enemies, and finally towards all\u00a0 sentient beings . In the\u00a0 Tibetan Buddhist \u00a0tradition, this practice is associated with\u00a0 tonglen \u00a0(cf.), whereby one breathes out (\"sends\") happiness and breathes in (\"receives\") suffering. [8] \u00a0Tibetan Buddhists also practice contemplation of the Brahmavih\u0101ras, also called the\u00a0 four immeasurables , which is sometimes called 'compassion meditation' [9] \n \nSo, last night, I didn't sleep well. \u00a0I woke at 3:45am and worried.... about Nicholas, about my mother who took a fall yesterday, about my daughter whose last exam at university is today. \u00a0And I thought of Metta. \u00a0I began to breath deeply and slowly. \u00a0I thought of myself as my own precious baby. \u00a0My thoughts kept straying to tasks, events, past transgressions. \u00a0But I will try again. \u00a0This Metta is a very good thing for caregivers. \u00a0Perhaps Buddha himself was a caregiver.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mettamassage.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7qx_ekPEbKY/UXqhncwXlaI/AAAAAAAAAxA/B9WJg4rFD8g/s1600/kindness.jpeg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mett%C4%81", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_meditation", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mett%C4%81#cite_note-7", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient_beings_(Buddhism)", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonglen", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mett%C4%81#cite_note-8", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmavihara", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mett%C4%81#cite_note-9", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k2rRqrILA1k/UXqh73EFtDI/AAAAAAAAAxI/6S151TbFa8U/s1600/timthumb.png"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/04/metta-loving-kindness-how-to-feel-it.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThe idea of personal choice is not something that we think of every day, but it's a little like fresh air - try \u00a0living without it. \u00a0As the needs of a loved one escalate, opportunities for caregivers to exercise personal choice diminish. \u00a0Of course, the effects of disability or aging negatively affect peoples' ability to choose. \u00a0My mother and my son both get hopping mad when can't do what they want for one reason or another. \u00a0And when that happens, I feel badly. \u00a0I find myself trying to make it happen for them... whether it's a hair appointment on the spur of the moment for my Mom or tickets to the hockey finals for Nicholas. \u00a0\"Of course, it's no trouble, of course I'll do it!\"  \n \n Eva Kittay  is a moral philosopher, writer and special needs mother. \u00a0 She writes about the caregiver's 'transparent self' . \u00a0Eva says that to be a really good caregiver, you have to make yourself invisible. \u00a0The caregiver's intent listening, observing and caring all enable a loved one to be the best they can be. \u00a0And yet, she says, we must be alert to our own disappearing self. \u00a0Choosing is a big part of expressing the self. \u00a0If we lose ourselves completely in giving care to those we love, we will become depressed, angry and even ill.  \n \nSometimes, we simply cannot choose our tasks. \u00a0We can't even choose  when  we perform those tasks. \u00a0It was like that with washing Nick's tube feeding supplies. \u00a0Medication syringes and stomach tubes would no sooner be used than they would be needed again. \u00a0My day was a constant revisiting of soapy water and vinegar for rinsing. \u00a0Most days, the thought clanging around in my head was \"I would rather chip rocks on a chain gang than wash another *&^% tube!\" \u00a0I never shied away from work in general - I simply wanted to choose my task, any task.  \n \nLater, when I was writing  my book , I began to think about how people living with infirmity and their families could have a life that they valued. \u00a0I began to look at human happiness and the ingredients for it. \u00a0 Sabina Alkire  co-wrote the  National Happiness Index for Bhutan , the only country in the world with a National Happiness Index. \u00a0She is an extraordinary person who has made a huge contribution to the understanding of poverty alleviation. \u00a0I was fortunate to meet Sabina and I brazenly asked her to create a happiness index for our family. \u00a0She did and it became a chapter in the book. \u00a0The one regret that I have about our happiness index is that I somehow neglected to include a category titled \"Ability to act in a spontaneous manner\". \u00a0Spontaneity is the mother of all choices. \u00a0\"Let's go shopping\" or \"Surprise! \u00a0I just scored tickets for tonight's game\" are phrases that never occur in the household of a caregiver. \u00a0Every outing and action requires complicated planning and often, costly modes of transportation. \u00a0No wonder families suffer from 'social exclusion'! \u00a0It's just easier to stay home. \n \nSometimes, we need to find our choices in unlikely places. \u00a0\"I choose to look out the window and not at the television\" or \"I choose to wear something from my jewellery box every day, no matter what\" are examples of small choices that lift the spirits. \u00a0Breaking daily routines that  can  be broken is powerful medicine for the transparent caregiver.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uJr35SpERvs/UVySnOgeh5I/AAAAAAAAAvg/k2D64wjekfE/s1600/got_choice.jpg", "http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/philosophy/people/faculty_pages/kittay.html", "http://books.google.ca/books?id=yD8vXYqsULcC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=eva+kittay+the+caring,+transparent+self&source=bl&ots=BUaew4LTA2&sig=KACbvUfbN_v6zhffcmheHrZh5_Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=h45cUeunMu3V0gHT44HoBg&sqi=2&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg", "http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365020967&sr=8-1&keywords=the+four+walls+of+my+freedom", "http://www.ophi.org.uk/about/people/current-people/sabina-alkire/", "http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/04/the-idea-of-personal-choice-tough-one.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nAdvocating for care is a complicated task. \u00a0The job of caregiving does not discriminate on the basis of family income, race, education or employment status. \u00a0Anyone, anytime can find themselves suddenly thrust into the position of giving care to a loved one. \u00a0And if the care needs are high, the caregiver will quickly become exhausted and discouraged. \u00a0That's when help is needed. \u00a0When I needed help, I didn't always know how to get it. \u00a0Over the years, I have reflected on which strategies work and those that don't. \u00a0I've also looked carefully at best practice political lobbying techniques to see how those might help families get support quickly and efficiently.  \n \nThrough a social enterprise called, \" The Advocacy School \", I give a care advocacy workshop for families titled  \"How to Know What you Want and Get What You Need\" . \u00a0The workshop starts off by asking families to look at what sorts of help and support they already have in place and whether that help is actually helpful. \u00a0It's important to start with an analysis of 'the givens' and sometimes, families realize that supports they have been fighting for are not actually what they need or want. \u00a0An Alzheimer's day program that only runs in the mornings may not suit an elderly person who sleeps till ten everyday, meaning that mornings are the only respite for the caregiver spouse. \u00a0Sometimes the meagre offers of support from local or state governments are either unsuitable, or just not worth the paperwork that's required for eligibility. \u00a0 A casserole delivered by a neighbor every Friday afternoon might be the most helpful assistance that a family receives.  \n \nIn the workshop, the first step is analysing families' current help and support. \u00a0That's followed by an analysis of neighorhood supports (including  possible  supports). \u00a0Next, there's a needs analysis and a matching up of needs to supports in order to identify one or two 'asks' or requests for support. \u00a0Finally, families learn the ABC's of strategic enquiry and how to write a briefing note in order to 'get what they need'. \u00a0In the live workshop, participants can try out their strategies through role play. \n \nHere is the handout that I use in my workshop. \u00a0This handout was used for families of adult children with disabilities, so if there are categories that don't apply, try to think of a relevant replacement support or service that can be slotted in. \u00a0'Direct Funding' refers to any cash payment that families receive through agencies or governments. \u00a0' ODSP ' refers to the disability pension benefits in my home province of Ontario in Canada. \u00a0' RDSP ' refers to the Registered Canadian Disability Savings Plan. \u00a0If you do not live in Canada, perhaps you have another form of savings plan or insurance. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \nOn holiday in Cat Island, Bahamas recently, something\nhappened.\u00a0 Regular readers of my blog\nmight recall that  I\u2019ve blogged about Cat Island before  \u2013 it\u2019s a remarkable\nplace in its beauty, its simplicity and its authentic (but few)\ninhabitants.\u00a0  \n \n \n \nLast year, I visited an 87 year old firecracker called Miss\nElla Sweeting.\u00a0 Back then, Miss Ella sang\u00a0 us a couple of rap songs and explained\nraucously that she had been banned from calling in to the Eleuthera radio station\nfor over-using that privilege.\u00a0 She was,\nwhat you might call \u2018a going concern\u2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis year, I dropped in again to visit Miss Ella.\u00a0 Her straw work roadside stall was empty of\nwares, but the door was open, so I knocked and stepped inside.\u00a0 There was a tiny frail woman sitting by the\ntelevision.\u00a0 She wore an ill-fitting\nblack wig.\u00a0 I asked if Miss Ella was\nin.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m Miss Ella \u2013 that\u2019s me\u201d.\u00a0 But, it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 This woman was shrunken \u2013 her face sad.\u00a0 There was no light in her eyes and she had\nlost so much weight that I was forced to stare, searching for the Ella I knew. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe drove back to our little beach cottage and collected\ngroceries and cash, delivering them to our elderly friend.\u00a0 Then I stopped in to \u201cYardies\u201d, a local conch\nshack and gas station down the road.\u00a0 I\nstopped the owner, Odette, and expressed my concern about Miss Ella\u2019s\ndecline.\u00a0 \u201cYes\u201d, nodded Odette, \u201cher\npension cheque ran out and she\u2019s getting old.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s just old, that\u2019s all.\u201d \n \n \n \nI have been thinking about that statement every day since we\nreturned home from the island.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI wondered about why I thought Odette's acceptance of the  inevitability  of aging was so culturally different from my own ideas of infirmity. \u00a0Recently, my mother has been ill with complications of her own advanced age - she is 92. \u00a0I get frustrated with her when she refuses to call the doctor about her pain or dizzy spells. \u00a0I want my mother to seek medical attention and to be 'cured' of her ailments. \u00a0I am so used to pestering professionals about my son Nicholas' litany of conditions. \u00a0Most recently, I have been on the road and on the phone trying to sort out a recent jump in the number of seizures he suffers each day. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nOdette's voice has been in my head with her knowing, sad explanation to me of a simple fact of life - that life ends, and it's not easy, but.... there we are. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am a natural-born crusader and acceptance is a state that does not come to easily to me. \u00a0But I think I need to be more humble in the face of the forces of nature. \u00a0Nicholas has a disability that cannot be cured. \u00a0The clock cannot turn back the years that my mother has lived on this earth. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nNext year, when we return to Cat Island, will Miss Ella greet me with a song or even a sigh? \u00a0I don't know. \u00a0But either way, I will return to Odette and seek her guidance on how to better accept the inevitability of struggle and pain in those we love. \n \n Listen to what Dr. Gerda Lerner says about aging  - her reflections are profound. \u00a0Dr. Lerner was a historian, author and teacher. \u00a0She was one of the founders of the field of women's history and taught history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Duke University.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GLZgJsc9t-8/UU7y05UUC9I/AAAAAAAAAuA/E75dgEjFbIA/s1600/P1060261.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aQUYkPKVoXw/UVjttF9dVaI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/5zB19_NPSd4/s1600/missella.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE8ljoS9rH4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE8ljoS9rH4"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/03/making-peace-with-aging-and-infirmity.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nCaregiving a job that is made up of hundreds of small tasks. \u00a0Each task in itself seems perfectly doable. But taken together and over time, caregiving can be isolating and soul destroying.  \n \n \n \n \n \nIt doesn't have to be that way. \u00a0The beginning of putting a broken caregiver's life back together is the realisation that no one person alone can take care of all the needs of another. \u00a0A wise person said, \"It takes a village\", and they were right.  \n \nThat's why building a 'team' to help advocate for care support is so important. \u00a0It is difficult to ask for help and there are many reasons why that is so. \u00a0Not least among them is our guilt over a deeply embedded belief that we should be able to care for our loved one alone. \u00a0That's where the advocacy team of friends, family and support professionals comes in very handy. \u00a0They can find out where help might be available and ask  for  you. \n \n \n \n \n \n In my last post , I described the process of strategic inquiry into agencies, community centers, churches, or anywhere else you might find care assistance that would be helpful in easing the burden of care. \u00a0Seeking out those Executive Directors and asking their advice on how their organisation might be helpful to your family is the first step in community relationship-building. \u00a0Once you understand the business priorities of the organisation that you are advocating, you can begin to think about how to match those with your needs. \u00a0You will be looking to ask for help that helpful to you, but also represents a 'win' for everyone.  \n \nIn many secondary schools, students are not allowed to graduate until they have completed a designated number of volunteer service hours. \u00a0Dog walking, snow shovelling and even grocery delivery are a few of the tasks that young people could perform to assist a neighborhood family in need of a helping hand. \u00a0A call or visit to the guidance counselor can be the first step in making a new friend who can help out around the house. \n \nAn online care coordination tool such as  Tyze  can be a lifesaver when friends and family have come together to form a little 'Swat team' to help advocate for home support. \u00a0I've written extensively about how we use Tyze to coordinate Nick's complex care, but here, I'm talking about using a tool such as Tyze to coordinate the advocacy effort. \u00a0If a sibling offers to meet with the CEO of the local community center, but cannot attend the follow-up meeting, someone else can jump in. \u00a0Everyone has access to the same records, critical background information and appointments agenda because it's all stored in the same secure website. \u00a0An email group, google calendar, or private facebook page are other options to coordinate the team. \n \nWhen a stressful caregiving situation tips over into crisis, it's difficult to pick apart specific actions that will be helpful. \u00a0Everyone involved feels overwhelmed and immobilised by exhaustion and worry. \u00a0But, there is hope. \u00a0The tools that I developed in the workshop  \"How to Know What You Want and Get What You Need\"  come directly from my own experience of feeling overwhelmed, finally getting help and then reflecting on what worked and what didn't.  \n \nToday, I had the pleasure of having a live radio chat with  Joni Aldrich on her radio show \"Caregiver SOS\".  \u00a0At the end of our interview, Joni asked me this: If there was one thing that you would tell caregivers, what would it be? \u00a0My answer: \u00a0You can't do it alone. \u00a0It takes a village to give care, and that's a good thing for all concerned, because caregivers want to look after their loved one. \u00a0And extended family, friends and neighbors want to help. \u00a0Everyone just needs to be shown how they can all work together.  \n \nJoni Aldrich's interview with me will be re-broadcast this Saturday, March 30, 4-5pm EST. \u00a0Tune in  HERE ! \n \n \n \n*This group (not individual) workshop, \"How to Know What You Want and Get What You Need\" is available through the Advocacy School. \u00a0 The workshop may be purchased by a charity or support group for caregivers. \u00a0The workshop is also available in the form of a three-part webinar. \u00a0If you would like further information, use the\u00a0 contact link on the Advocacy School \u00a0website. \u00a0 We are also developing a workshop for best practice in effective patient advocacy.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dOmcn0pw8m4/UVRVTI_gZ_I/AAAAAAAAAu4/Oau2oaK8EmE/s1600/world_on_shoulders.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--_58BF58Xs8/UVRVkCdhs3I/AAAAAAAAAvA/ZjVnDd3no80/s1600/manyhands:world.jpg", "http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.advocacyschool.org/how-know-what-you-want-and-get-what-you-need", "http://w4wn.com/radio-shows/joni-aldrich-s-o-s-supporter-of-survival/", "http://w4wn.com/radio-shows/joni-aldrich-s-o-s-supporter-of-survival/", "http://www.advocacyschool.org/contact"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/03/caregiver-advocacy-part-3-roundup.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n Caring.com  is a great resource for family caregivers of seniors in the US. \u00a0I am so pleased to share a very wise blog post from Paula Spencer Scott, their senior editor. \u00a0Here, Paula gives sage advice on avoiding conflict with aging parents, but I know these tips will be useful in any caregiving situation where conflict with a loved one might arise from dependency issues. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 Tips on Avoiding Conflict With an Aging\nParent \n \n \n Whether it's\ngetting sick, giving up the keys, or moving out of one's home, the aging\nprocess has a high potential for conflict. Unfortunately, parents' anger often\nfalls on their adult children, their caregivers. Here are 4 tips for avoiding\nconflict in these sensitive aging situations. \n \n \n \n \n 4 Tips on Avoiding\nConflict With an Aging Parent \n \n by  Paula\nSpencer Scott, senior editor at \u00a0 Caring.com . \n \n \n \nKids and their parents are often at odds. But the squabbles\nare often less expected, and more stressful, when both sides are grown-ups.\nAdult children frequently find themselves in clashes with aging parents over\nissues ranging from giving up the car keys to whether it's safe to continue\nliving in a longtime home.  \n \n \n \nTalking about tough issues is never easy. The following\nstrategies can help prevent your conversations from descending into anger,\nfrustration, and a strained relationship.  \n \n \n \n Ask, don't tell. \n \n \n \nIf you rush in with criticisms or solutions about worrisome\nsituations, you're setting yourself up for confrontation or stonewalling.\nNobody wants to be told what to do (unless they're explicitly asking you for\nguidance). Better to start touchy conversations on topics you're concerned\nabout in a more general, nonthreatening way: \"How's it going?\" \"How's\nthe car?\" \"Do you like your doctor?\" \"How are you feeling?\"\nThese openings give your parent a chance to start a conversation on more\nneutral ground. Letting your parent initiate talk of concerns or problems means\nhe or she is less likely to start from a defensive position -- and might be\nmore open to collaborating with you on a solution. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Play back what you\nhear.  \n \n \n \nOne helpful way to avoid an escalating argument is to use a\ntactic called reflexive listening. Play back your parent's statements: \"I\nhear you saying that you're worried about how you'll get to the hairdresser's\nand the grocery if you can't drive, right?\" Only after you say this --\nwhich reassures that you hear and get her side of things -- do you add your own\nten cents: \"But if I take you with me on my weekly grocery run and Linda\nagrees to come to the house to do your hair, you'll at least have those basics\ncovered. Let me think about some other transportation options for you.\" \n \n \n \nOther empathetic bridges to try: \"I know you're worried\nabout . . . \" \"I agree with you that it's tough when . . . \"\n\"You're right that . . . \" \n \n \n \n Stay upbeat and\nsupportive. \n \n \n \nWhether you agree or not with how your parent is handling a\nsituation, keeping your own cool will help you remain an advocate, rather than\nan adversary. If you cut in with arguments, you risk losing your parent's\nwillingness to explore options in a collaborative way. Realize that for some\ndiscussions, and with some parents, the adult child is simply not the best\nperson to engineer a change. Such a parent might be much more receptive to a\nthird party, such as another relative, a clergyperson, or a family friend.  \n \n \n \n Remember that it's\nhis (or her) life. \n \n \n \nYou're concerned for your parent's well-being and happiness.\nBut unless his or her mental status is impaired, you can't impose your own will\nany more than your parent could force you to do what they wished when you were\na 20-something. You might not like his or her choices. You might feel\nfrustrated by the pace of progress. But your parent is an adult entitled to\nautonomy about the decisions concerning his or her life.  \n \n \n \nThe difference is  when your loved one's mental capacity is failing \u00a0and he or she is unable to make a decision about safety or well-being. Then it's\ntime to look into other alternatives, such as guardianship.  \n \n \n Paula Spencer Scott is senior editor at \u00a0 Caring.com , the leading online destination for caregivers\nseeking information and support as they care for aging parents, spouses, and\nother loved ones.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt first, advocating for care seems like a daunting, almost impossible task. \u00a0But like any unwieldy job, the trick is to break it down into manageable building blocks. \u00a0I've tried to simplify the how-to's of advocating for care in a workshop that I give for caregivers called  \"How to Know What You Want and Get What You Need\". \u00a0 \n \nTo begin advocating for care, it's important to understand the 'givens', or what you already have in the way of support. \u00a0 A tool for that analysis was part of my last post on this subject .  \n \nThe next area to look at is household and family caregiving needs. \u00a0These are highly personal and will vary from family to family. \u00a0If you feel that in-home respite is an important need, but have never used this service before, then beginning slowly will be important. \u00a0A short-term, medium-term and long-term plan will all have to be thought out. \u00a0The key here is creativity and 'thinking outside the box'.  \n \nFirst you will want to list all the care chores that you currently carry out or manage. \u00a0These could include: \n \n \nPhysical Assistance/Mobility \nPhysical Assistance/Toiletting \nPhysical Assistance/Bathing \nPhysical Assistance/Dressing \nPhysical Assistance/Eating \nTransportation \nCommunication Assistance \nBehaviour Support \nEmotional Support/Stimulation \nSocial Support in the Community \nMedication Administration \nCaring for Other Family Members \nEnjoying Time Together With Your Relative with disability \nDoctor Appointments \nRecord Keeping \nPaid Staff Procurement \nPaid Staff Training \nPaid Staff Bookkeeping \nFunding Applications \nKeeping Team Up to Date \nSpecialized Supply/Equipment Ordering \nFood shopping \nCooking \nTidying/Light Cleaning \nHeavy Cleaning \nLaundry \nDriving/Errands \nCar Maintenance \nYard Maintenance \nBanking \nHome Maintenance/Including Insurance taxes etc. \nPet Care \n \nAssign a number beside each category that represents the number of hours per day that you spend on that area. \u00a0Next, tick that category if you would like to download that chore or responsibility to someone else.  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nOnce needs are identified, a decision is taken to begin the advocacy effort starting with one or two of the most pressing needs (or helpful forms of help). \u00a0 \n \n \n \nNow, the planning begins to build an 'advocacy team'. \u00a0The team might consist of a family member, a best friend and a neighbor who happens to have experience in building a small business, for example. \u00a0If the need is to locate and find funding for supportive housing, for example, a more elaborate researching of the community and possible additions to the team who have specialised skills will be required. \u00a0If the need is to identify a volunteer driver for shopping and medical appointments, less research into the community will likely be necessary. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNext, the team will make themselves familiar with the priority needs and they will begin to undertake a process of  strategic inquiry . \u00a0They might need to create a briefing note if the advocacy effort is directed at government or agency funding for housing or respite. \u00a0A briefing note is simply a one page document beginning with an introduction to members of the caregiving family, followed by a statement of needs and supports as well as a brief story to illustrate why the support being requested would meet the stated need. \u00a0The briefing note should also include a short list of questions for the initial information meetings, such as, \"Who should I speak to? \u00a0Who has responsibility for decision-making about funding?\" Finally, everyone advocating for your family care will need to prepare and polish an 'elevator speech' - a talk that encapsulates quickly and convincingly why the target person or agency should give you what you need. \n \nThe strategic enquiry is really an intelligence gathering exercise into the agency you are lobbying for help. \u00a0Even if it's an informal community group such as a church club that offers some help to parishioners with long-term care needs, those who know a lot about the organisation and the people in it will have a much better chance of success when they ask for help. \u00a0The best way to start a strategic inquiry is to identify someone on the advocacy team who will meet with a senior staff of your target organisation for the purpose of  gathering information and asking advice  in how best to approach matching your family needs with the objectives of the organisation as a whole. \u00a0Anyone going in cold asking for money and help may simply be turned away. \u00a0But, someone asking for information and advice will likely be welcomed to begin a conversation that might lead to a helpful relationship. \n \nNext up: \u00a0how that friendly conversation in the strategic inquiry can help you craft your request and get the help you need. \n \n \n \n*This group (not individual) workshop is available through the Advocacy School. \u00a0 The workshop may be purchased by a charity or support group for caregivers. \u00a0The workshop is also available in the form of a three-part webinar. \u00a0If you would like further information, use the\u00a0 contact link on the Advocacy School \u00a0website. \u00a0 We are also developing a workshop for best practice in effective patient advocacy.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QQER_bj5GkM/UVC6F5ge-CI/AAAAAAAAAuo/aSainKVVenA/s1600/simplify2.jpg", "http://www.advocacyschool.org/how-know-what-you-want-and-get-what-you-need", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pq_JeHbI8Jg/UVC4FNS9HDI/AAAAAAAAAuY/fQmC8zklWqs/s1600/huddle.jpg", "http://www.advocacyschool.org/contact"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/03/building-winning-advocacy-team-for.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nIn the days, months and years since my father's first stroke, since the birth of my two children, since the diagnosis of our son's disabilities and more recently, since my mother's increasing infirmity, I have scoured books and my own memories to find meaning in my caregiving experiences. \n \nWith my Dad and with Nicholas, there was, for a time, a chorus of 'whys' in my head.... why them? \u00a0why us? \u00a0why me? \u00a0My Mum's challenges are more organic, they come at the end of her long life, so I don't rail against them in quite the same way.  \n \nArthur Kleinman's \" The Illness Narratives: A Method for the Care of the Chronically Ill\"  was written in 1988, but it is still utterly relevant, especially to the range of family caregiving experiences in my life. \u00a0As I was reading, I felt that Kleinman was speaking to me. \n \nKleinman asserts:  \"We must begin with the premise that chronic disease by definition cannot be cured, that indeed the quest for cure is a dangerous myth that serves patient and practitioner poorly. \u00a0It distracts their attention from step-by-step behaviors that lessen suffering, even if they do not magically heal the disease. \u00a0Patient and practitoner both need to accept that the primary goal of treatment is the reduction of disablement in the ongoing experience of an illness.\" \u00a0 \n \nAnd make no mistake, our society construes old age as disease - aging is no longer a natural process, it's a chronic illness. \u00a0So, it's not only Nicholas we're talking about here.  \n \nWhen I have been most frustrated, most desperate, most misunderstood and mistrusted by the very physicians who were meant to be helping us, I believe it was because we, the family, so completely misunderstood the professionals' ideas of intended outcomes. \u00a0The family and the treatment team were operating on different planets.  \n \nKleinman writes,  \"Today there is in North America, a wholly unrealistic popular expectation that all diseases should be treatable and that no medical encounter should lead to a negative outcome.\"  \u00a0I am guilty. \u00a0I held that belief and when major interventions produced unintended, horrible outcomes, I was angry. \u00a0 I was confused and I was still desperately hopeful that another intervention could and must be found to 'cure' what ailed my father, my son and my mother. \n \nWhat Kleinman so gently but insistently presents is a vision of professionals working with families to collaboratively negotiate treatment based on real, shared knowledge of each other's perceptions of the illness and effects on personal and family life. \u00a0Kleinman presents the case for an intelligent, informed acceptance of natural processes, of suffering, of trying and sometimes winning.... and sometimes losing the battle against disease. \u00a0And he's talking about disease that has morphed into a life of illness.  \n \nKleinman proposes an investigative process to put everyone (patient, family and professionals) on the same page. \u00a0He would ask all concerned, \"What do you think is wrong? \u00a0What do you think caused it? \u00a0What do you want me to do? \u00a0What is the chief way this illness (or treatment) has affected your life? \u00a0What do you fear most about this illness or treatment?\" \u00a0These are just a few of Kleinman's excellent and probing questions. \u00a0All are designed to lay assumptions on the table and compare them - an exercise that would have saved my family enormous pain, had we known to do it.  \n \nNot all medical professionals are ready, willing or able to engage with patients and their families in this manner. \u00a0It may be considered 'unscientific' at the worst and 'too time consuming' at the least. \u00a0But Kleinman lays out (with compelling case histories) very, very good reasons why we should all try.  \n \nI haven't finished yet thinking about this book - I know that it's one I'll keep coming back to. \u00a0There is so much I still need to understand in order to find the delicate balance between accepting that which I cannot change or cure, 'fighting back' and working together effectively with professionals for the good of the people I love. \n \nIn my next post, I'll reflect on how Kleinman's perspective can inform our thinking about changing systems to support families giving care. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Illness-Narratives-Suffering-Healing-Condition/dp/0465032044"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/02/lessons-in-meaning-of-illness-aging-and.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n Arthur Kleinman  understands families like mine.\u00a0 I know he does, because he wrote this:  \n \n \n \n The chronically ill\noften are like those trapped at a frontier, wandering confused in a poorly\nknown border area, waiting desperately to return to their native land.\u00a0 Chronicity for many is the dangerous crossing\nof the borders, the interminable waiting to exit and reenter normal everyday\nlife, the perpetual uncertainty of whether one can return at all.\u00a0 To pass through this world of limbo is to\nmove through a \u201cnervous\u201d system, a realm of menacing uncertainty.\u00a0 For some the passage not so difficult; for\nothers it becomes routine like so much else in life; yet for others it involves\ndespair at being stuck in a place one has come to hate and fear.\u00a0 This image should also alert us to the social\nnature of chronicity: the entrance and exit formalities, the visas, the\ndifferent languages and etiquettes, the guards and functionaries and hucksters\nat the border crossing points, and especially the relatives and friends who press\ntheir faces against windows to wave a sad goodbye, who carry sometimes the\nheaviest baggage, who sit in the same waiting rooms, and who even travel\nthrough the same land of limbo, experiencing similar worry, hurt, uncertainty\nand loss.\u00a0 Social movement for the\nchronically ill is back and forth through rituals of separation, transition and\nreincorporation, as exacerbation leads to remission and then circles back to\nworsening and so on. \u00a0( The Illness Narratives, 1988 ) \n \n \n \nLuckily, Kleinman has offered some thoughts on restructuring\nthe way in which professionals care for the vulnerable and their families.\u00a0 He begins by suggesting a major transformation\nof training for health professionals and proposes a new methodology that is\nrooted in \u2018empathetic listening, translation and interpretation\u2019.\u00a0 The practical steps in building this new\nprofessional training would be first the execution of a \u2018mini-ethnography\u2019 or\nlife history of the patient and his or her family.\u00a0 The neurologist treating my son\u2019s first\nseizure would have discovered in my life history that I had been traumatized as\na teenager by witnessing my father having a post- stroke seizure while the two\nof us were alone at home.\u00a0 I was almost\nimmobilized by fear when I realized years later that Nicholas might have\nepilepsy.\u00a0  \n \n \n \nNext, Kleinman proposes \u2018the explanatory model followed by\nnegotiation\u2019.\u00a0 Once a professional\nunderstands the lived experience of a person requiring care, he or she can\nconverse with the patient and family to compare understandings of the illness,\nthe treatment options and how to agree on a course of action.\u00a0 Everyone in the room might answer questions\nsuch as \u201cWhat do you think is wrong?\u00a0\nWhat caused it?\u00a0 What do you want\nme to do?\u00a0 What do you think will happen\nif you have this or that treatment?\u201d\u00a0 Of\ncourse, no one is going to take time to build consensus in this manner if there\nis an emergency situation, but in chronic care, consensus is critical to\nminimizing regret, frustration or anger over the long term. \n \n \n \nFinally, Kleinman proposes a process of \u2018remoralization or a\nprocess of medical psychotherapy\u2019 for doctors seeking to be truly helpful to\ntheir patients with chronic illness.\u00a0 He\ndescribes a series of appointments wherein patients can discuss their sense of\nloss; a talking therapy moving the patient from grief to restitution.\u00a0  \n \n \n \nThis may be helpful, but it is my personal opinion that a\nbetter solution for professionals caring for people with disabilities or those\nwho are infirm due to their age would be an imperative for all student doctors\nto complete a rotation in community medicine.\u00a0\nFor  all  doctors to have the\nexperience of visiting homes and observing the real lives of patients living\nwith chronic care conditions would go a long way to achieving Kleinman\u2019s ideal\nof empathetic listening.\u00a0  \n \n \n \nArthur Kleinman wrote \u201cThe Illness Narratives\u201d in 1988.\u00a0 There has been a lot of water under the\nbridge since then \u2013 that was the same year that my son Nicholas was born with\nsevere disabilities.\u00a0 Since 1988, much\nhas stayed the same and much has changed, some for the good.\u00a0 Consider this pearl of Kleinman\u2019s wisdom:  \n \n \n \n The study of illness\nmeanings is not only about one particular individual\u2019s experience; it is also\nvery much about social networks, social situations, and different forms of\nsocial reality.\u00a0 Illness meanings are shared\nand negotiated.\u00a0 They are an integral\ndimension of lives lived together.\u00a0 Had\nwe examined work settings, schools or other of the major institutions of\nsociety, we would have arrived at the same point.\u00a0 Illness is deeply embedded in the social\nworld, and consequently it is inseparable from the structures and processes\nthat constitute that world.\u00a0 For the\npractitioner, as for the anthropologist, an enquiry into the meanings of\nillness is a journey into relationships. \n \n \n \nI knew these ideas to be true long before I ever heard about\nKleinman and his work.\u00a0 I allied myself\nwith the work of the  PLAN Institute  and with the innovative social network\ncoordination tool,  Tyze .\u00a0 These entities\nwere created in order to create social support networks around vulnerable individuals,\nbut also to allow professionals, patients and their families to share\ninformation, listen empathetically and to negotiate treatment plans by engaging\nin one, ongoing \u2018real life\u2019 conversation about ongoing care and treatment\nchoices. \n \n \n \nCan it ever be possible to have a de-medicalized model of\nsocial, community and family based medicine for long-term care patients\nincluding the elderly?\u00a0 I think it is and\nArthur Kleinman has given us a very good place to start.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~anthro/social_faculty_pages/social_pages_kleinman.html", "http://books.google.bs/books/about/The_Illness_Narratives.html?id=dPN5N2qKGCwC&redir_esc=y", "http://planinstitute.ca/", "http://www.tyze.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/03/envisioning-better-future-for-caregivers.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n I am reminded so often that receiving care is a skill that requires training in good manners, empathy for the caregiver and a healthy dose of polite assertiveness. \u00a0I found this old blog post from October, 2010 and I think it contains a message that's worth repeating. \n \n \n \n It IS good to receive! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLike any other young adult, sometimes Nicholas misbehaves. He swears and if he\u2019s really angry, he will fly into a rage. A flailing arm can give a mother or caregiver a nasty bruise. This anger doesn\u2019t flare very often; most of the time, Nicholas is calm, happy and polite. But when his mood gets out control, especially if someone is actually trying to help him or offer treatment, that\u2019s when I launch into \u201cstrict mother mode\u201d. \u201cNicholas\u201d, I say very firmly, \u201cYou have an important job in life and right now you are not performing it very well. Your job is to ask for help politely and always say thank you. You have just as much responsibility here as your carers, Mister, so you had better apologize for your angry outburst.\u201d Now, some people might think that my reaction is unfair. They might believe that because Nicholas is mostly bed-bound and sometimes has difficulty making himself understood because of his very limited speech, that he has a right to show unbridled anger. I disagree. I believe that precisely BECAUSE Nicholas\u2019 physical handicaps require him to receive care, he has an\u00a0 added \u00a0responsibility to curb his anger and behave in a civil manner. \n Care is a two way street and part of building a new paradigm for active citizenship will have to include some training in \u201c receiving \u201d care. What are the ingredients of playing that role well? How can one get the best out of one\u2019s helpers? Is it ever possible to ask\u00a0 too much \u00a0of one\u2019s helpers? How and when is it appropriate to show anger or frustration? Age does not preclude anyone from enjoying the benefit of understanding the rules of engagement when it comes to receiving care. Children are taught to respect their parents\u2019 efforts to provide for and nurture everyone in the family. Why should this expectation diminish in the case of disability or ageing?\u00a0 \n \n Perhaps we need to start with ourselves. The next time I am having difficult day and a friend says \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d I plan to answer \u201cYes\u201d, even if I can\u2019t articulate what kind of help I need. The first step is accepting an offer of help. The second step is saying \u201cThank you!\u201d \n \nEducators have managed to incorporate lessons in ethics and self-esteem in the curriculum. I propose we add some learning objectives to our teaching that relate to giving and receiving care. At lunch one day, children could experiment with feeding each other. In a care home, residents could set aside one hour per week to wash the face and hands of the care home staff, or simply listen to their problems.\u00a0 \n \n \nIf we believe that relationships are the key to a good life\u00a0 throughout \u00a0life, it ensues that everyone will at some point give and at other points need to receive care. But the language, good manners and ease of transition from one role to another is key to getting good care into the social water supply. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HC2aNARHL5Q/UUXKa87VtrI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/8SGRSYulFH0/s1600/ThankYou_Header.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/03/the-good-of-good-manners-in-caregiving.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nAll this talk of torture in my last post got me wondering about the most awful times of pain and suffering in our own Nicholas' life. \n \nWhen Nick was small, he had a surgical procedure to correct gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. \u00a0The procedure was called an 'open full-wrap fundoplication'. \u00a0Sometimes words like water-boarding or enhanced interrogation techniques do not sound so bad if you haven't witnessed them first-hand. \u00a0The same goes for an open fundoplication.  \n \nFrom my book \" The Four Walls of My Freedom \", here is a reminiscence of Nicholas returning from the operating room after this day-long surgery that involved breaking his breast bone and opening his rib cage in order to wrap part of the stomach around the esophagus and staple it to prevent reflux. \u00a0They also inserted a feeding tube in his stomach. \u00a0He was two and half years old. \n \n \"Another hour passed and I asked if she could find out when Nicholas would be back with us. \u00a0It was dusk now and she said that Nicholas was in recovery, but was \"breath holding\" so they were keeping him a little longer to monitor the situation. \u00a0Twenty minutes later a nurse and an orderly appeared down the hall wheeling a cot towards us. \u00a0Inside was Nick, his mouth open and rigid, eyes wide with panic. \u00a0He gasped, writhing, and exhaled a hoarse cry. \u00a0 He was in the room now, and we hovered like birds, flapping uselessly. \n \n That night was the first, but not the last, time that I saw in my son's eyes a terrible pleading. \u00a0I turned away and put my hand down on the corner chair to support myself from falling. \u00a0Jim warned, \"Donna, you can't do this. \u00a0Come here!\" \u00a0I came back to Nicholas, murmuring apologies through tears.\" \n \nI felt utterly responsible for my baby's terrible state. \u00a0My feelings of self loathing only increased in the many follow-up hospital appointments when doctors would order me to restrain my flailing boy when they performed some painful, but necessary procedure on him.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Nick after an orthopaedic surgery in 1991) \n \nWhen I recall those dark days, I still think of books and movies about awful abuse performed on children by mentally ill parents. \u00a0What on earth could Nick have believed about me, his trusted mother, when one minute I was holding him down to endure a painful procedure that he didn't understand and the next minute, I was cuddling him and soothing his hurt?  \n \nI don't know if it's better to be with your child during those procedures or not. \u00a0I chose to be there, and I thank God that Nicholas forgave me.  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat I learned from my experience though, is a great respect for the way that nature made Nicholas and the dangers of trying to change him. \u00a0Witnessing pain in anyone is a terrible thing, but participating in painful medical procedures of someone you love is almost unbearable. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358884943&sr=8-1&keywords=the+four+walls+of+my+freedom", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EPBfafK9bq4/UP7u-v6yMRI/AAAAAAAAApM/tXpcjBIk1AQ/s1600/nicksurgery.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QpE8u0loUJU/UP7wCAGJTvI/AAAAAAAAApY/VEo0xM0J1E0/s1600/meandnick.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/01/am-i-abuser.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThere's an interesting trend in caregiving. \u00a0Women who have had their lives and careers de-railed suddenly by 'extreme caregiving' are taking their lessons learned and crafting them into new careers of helping others on a similar journey.  \n \nI became interested in this phenomenon and wrote about it in my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom:\u00a0 \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n Rosalyn Benjamin Darling points out in her research on\nparents of children with disabilities that \u201cWhen parents continue to encounter\nneeds that cannot be met by existing societal resources, they may embark on a\nprolonged career of seekership. \u00a0  The goal\nof seekership is normalization, or the establishment of a lifestyle that\napproximates that of families with only nondisabled children. \u00a0  Seekership results in advocacy and activism\nwhen certain situational contingencies or turning points occur. \u00a0Such\nactivism Darling calls \u2018entrepreneurship\u2019. \u00a0\n One has to be socialized into the role of entrepreneur, and socialized I\nwas. \u00a0  The confluence of the changing role\nof women, opportunities for our higher education and the booming economy all\nprovided fertile ground for the flourishing of my skills as an entrepreneurial\nactivist. \u00a0  Darling continues \u201cFor most\nparents, active entrepreneurship ends after they reach what they consider to be\nnormalization,\u201d while for some it continues to \u201ccrusadership.\u201d \u00a0  These are the parents who continue to work\nfor disabled children and adults even when the needs of their own children are\nmet.\u00a0 \n\n \n \n \n \n It is not just parents of children with disabilities who become seekers, entrepreneurs and crusaders. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nEarlier this week, I had the pleasure of speaking with a caregiver crusader,  Cindy Laverty . \u00a0Cindy is a California based caregiving coach with an impressive range of multi-media tools to help people survive and thrive throughout their caregiving journey. \u00a0Cindy has a kind heart, a keen intellect and a will of steel. \u00a0She founded  The Care Company  to help others and this is her story. \n \n \n \n Me : \u00a0Cindy, tell me about yourself. \n \n \n \n Cindy : \u00a0My ex-husband and I had been divorced for fifteen years, but his parents, Bob and Puff were wonderful grandparents to our daughter and we remained close. \u00a0Puff, sadly, suffered badly from early onset dementia and Bob cared for her. \u00a0Every Sunday night, Bob, my daughter and I would have dinner at the same restaurant, at the same time and have the same food from the menu. \u00a0Bob called my daughter 'The Butterfly'. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nOne Sunday night, Bob took my hand and said, \"I have a favor to ask. \u00a0Will you pay my bills and check on Puff when I have open heart surgery next month? \u00a0I'm having this surgery because I want to see The Butterfly graduate from college.\" \u00a0I was shocked and tearful, but I replied immediately, \"Of course!\", never realising in that instant that my life would change completely. \u00a0I was utterly unprepared for what happened next. \n \n \n \nI was working at that time as an events coordinator for a fitness company, so it was relatively easy to put the legal documents such as powers of attorney and Bob's will in place before his surgery. \u00a0Bob entered the operating room for a 'routine valve replacement'. \u00a0It was not routine. \u00a0Bob spent two weeks in the ICU, then suffered a debilitating stroke. \u00a0Rehab followed. \u00a0In the meantime, Puff and my in-laws' home was falling apart. \u00a0I discovered that Puff had not had a bath in five months. \u00a0There were leaky pipes in the house and crumbling ceilings. \u00a0I fired the caregivers and quit my job to take care of both Bob and Puff. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI felt like I was doing everything wrong. \u00a0I felt so guilty about not being with my own family enough and I felt like I wasn't doing enough for Bob and Puff.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOne night, lying in bed, a voice in my head spoke to me: \u00a0\"You know this about you\", the voice repeated. \u00a0I realised suddenly that I was on a journey. \u00a0It wasn't going to work to try to be in charge, but I didn't yet know another way. \u00a0In that moment, I understood that caregiving knocks you down until you listen. \u00a0It does not discriminate. \u00a0I realised that I needed to get help for my in-laws,  yes , but I needed to get help for  me , too. \u00a0I knew that I was falling apart, but I knew I didn't need a psychologist or medication. \u00a0I needed a  coach. \u00a0 I remembered being on sports teams in high school - I needed a coach to teach me the fundamentals, to cheer me on and to push me up the mountain when I faltered. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo, I founded  The Care Company . \u00a0I founded The Care Company so that people would not get lost on the journey, as I did. \u00a0Puff died two years after I started the company, and then their daughter, my ex-sister in law, passed away from breast cancer. \u00a0Four years after Puff died, my dear Bob passed away... but not before he was able to see his \"Butterfly\" graduate from high school.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Me : \u00a0You work with many clients who are overwhelmed by their caregiving responsibilities. \u00a0You come to know your clients intimately. \u00a0What have you learned from them? \n \n \n \n Cindy : \u00a0I have learned that some people are selfish and some people are  good  selfish. \u00a0The 'good selfish' caregivers are able to take time and space for themselves. \u00a0They have boundaries in place. \u00a0I have learned that people are resilient. \u00a0But, I have also learned from my clients that those who listen to their hearts instead of their heads do best. \u00a0I call caregiving 'angelwork'. \u00a0When we give credit to ourselves for doing angelwork, we do better. \u00a0My clients have taught\u00a0me about courage. \n \n \n \nCoaching and the range of caregiving tools available from Cindy are not free. \u00a0Cindy now makes her living by helping others survive a journey that she nearly did not survive herself. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI'll continue to occasionally profile caregivers of all ages and descriptions who have become entrepreneurs and crusaders. \u00a0It's a trend worth watching.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360250159&sr=8-1&keywords=the+four+walls+of+my+freedom", "http://thecarecompany.biz/cindy/", "http://thecarecompany.biz/", "http://thecarecompany.biz/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EbGX_5AArVA/URPE99t-qqI/AAAAAAAAAqs/Ni7p-Wfdqmk/s1600/butterfly.png"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/02/the-care-company-cindy-laverty.html", "title": ""},

But could this trend of isolating ourselves from our elders be slowly changing? \u00a0I'm hearing more and more of my contemporaries worry aloud about the unpleasantness of a future being warehoused with legions of other baby boomers. \u00a0People my age are beginning to actively plan co-habiting with groups of friends, living in hotels (if they can afford it) or living in households with multiple generations. \u00a0The picture of families caring for each other is changing. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n So, I jumped at the chance when an online colleague approached me for the opportunity to write a guest post about wanting her own mother to come and live with her family at some point in the future when care requirements became more than just delivering the occasional casserole. \u00a0I wondered what reasons younger families have today for inviting their parents to share their home. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n My guest blogger is\u00a0 Noami Esterly. \u00a0Naomi divides her time between managing a house of three boys (her husband and two kids) and a newborn baby girl, volunteering in her community center and writing freelance for\u00a0 1800Wheelchair.Com .\u00a0 In her guest post below she shares an open letter to her mom. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Thank you, Naomi, for sharing the love you feel for (and learned from) your Mom.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n An Open Letter To\nMy Mom \n \n \n \n Dear Mom, \n \n \n \nYou are the one who has always been there for me. You nurtured me when I was a\nbaby, guided me when I was a child, and, now that I am a grown woman, you are\nmy friend. You taught me how to love, and I can think of no better role model\nfrom whom to pattern my own motherhood. Even though I realize that I do not say\nit enough, I love you, and I appreciate all that you have done for me more than\nyou will ever know. \n \nI know that in my busy schedule we have grown farther apart than I would like.\nI miss you very much, and I promise to set aside more time for mother-daughter\nbonding as well as quality time with your grandchildren. You have fashioned me\ninto the woman I am today, and I would love for you to watch my three beautiful\nchildren grow with the guidance you have instilled in me.  \n \nFor all of your patience, friendship, and love throughout my entire life, I am\nforever in your debt. Now that I have a family of my own, I want you to be a\npart of it, and I want to be there for you always as you have always cared for\nme. Therefore, I would like you to consider coming to live with my family\nshould you ever need assistance. It would be a wonderful way for you to bond\nwith your grandchildren, and they, in turn, would grow up with the fortune of\nhaving known their beloved grandmother so well. When they are off to school for\nthe day, you and I could go for walks, shop, go to museums, cook and bake\ntogether, or anything else we can imagine. Should you ever need mobility\nassistance, I would be there for you to take you anywhere you want to go. I\ncould push you in a wheelchair so that you do not miss out on anything that you\nwould like to see or to do. \n \nI would take wonderful care of you, mom, because you showed me how to do so\nwhen you raised me. Once my children are grown and out of the house, we would\nstill have so much fun together. You would also be able to watch your\ngrandchildren closely as they graduate from college, marry, have babies of\ntheir own, and succeed at various accomplishments that would make us both\nproud. I believe that we should spend more time together as a family, and\nliving with us would provide for the best opportunity to do so. I never want\nyou to feel as though you are helpless or unable to live the life you desire. I\nwant to be there for you whether you need me or not, because I love you. \n \nPlease do not fear that I feel obligated to spend more time with you or take\ncare of you should the need arise. Because of you, I have never known life\nwithout love. You are my mother, and nothing would bring me greater joy than to\nreciprocate that love and care.

{"date": "", "body": "\nA couple of nights ago, my husband Jim and I went to the movies. \u00a0We saw Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" - a film already infamous for its portrayal of torture as a measure to ensure post 9/11 homeland security and as a tool to locate and eliminate Osama Bin Laden. \n \n \n \n \n \nIt's a good film, but what's it got to do with issues of caregiving in the western world? \n \nWell, yesterday, I drove through a snowstorm to visit my Mom who has not been well and who needed a couple of loving visitors (me and my sister) who would roll up their sleeves and help with laundry, cooking and myriad of other household tasks. \u00a0It was a long and tiring day, so this morning I decided to stay in my dressing gown till noon, reading newspapers and perusing Facebook. \u00a0But two stories caught my eye. \n \nOne story was an  Op-Ed in the Montreal Gazette  penned by a pediatrician at the Montreal Children's Hospital. \u00a0He argues that a proposed amendment in the laws of Quebec allowing physician assisted suicide is wrong and dangerous. \u00a0He asserts that the health care system in his province is badly broken and that rather than admit to a serious lack of political will needed to address the under-funding of palliative care, provincial leaders have chosen instead to masquerade assisted suicide as compassionate end of life care. \n \nThe next story that caught my eye was an  editorial in the Ottawa Citizen newspaper  about the torture portrayed in Zero Dark Thirty. \u00a0The whole editorial is worth reading, but this passage made me think: \n \n \n \n In the immediate, panicky aftermath of 9/11, one of the more quietly important contributions was a short essay published by the University of Toronto philosopher David Dyzenhaus. His essay, The Permanence of the Temporary, reminded us of the work of Carl Schmitt, a German Weimar-era political theorist who was convinced that Liberal democracy is a fraud. We pretend we value things like habeas corpus, individual rights, and constitutional checks on the executive powers, but when faced with a perceived existential challenge, we\u2019re more than willing to jettison them. Ultimately, Schmitt held that liberal democracies could not effectively defend themselves while remaining true to their core principles. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo, I ask, is our society under an existential threat due to an ageing society and too many people with disabilities and chronic illnesses living beyond their projected longevity? \u00a0Have we begun to jettison our moral principles with respect to health care and palliative care?  \n \nI'm not sure, but I might feel a little better if the Quebec government had announced funding increases to home care and palliative medicine alongside their proposal to legalize assisted suicide. \u00a0But, they didn't. \u00a0Those areas are being cut.  \n \nMy mother lives in Quebec. \u00a0I have seen the failures of the healthcare system there to address her needs. Intensive care treatment is still excellent, but doesn't help my Mom. \u00a0Her health needs involved frequent short stays in Emergency Wards as well as home help. \u00a0 Hospitals, especially Emergency Rooms, are frantic and overcrowded places. \u00a0They are badly understaffed. \u00a0We live in Ontario and here, there is currently a provincial enquiry into the serious lack of funding for adults with developmental disabilities and their families. \u00a0Our son Nicholas is a big consumer of healthcare dollars and he will never be employable. \u00a0Do families like mine represent an existential threat to the rest of society?  \n \nPerhaps, but I think we also represent redemption. \u00a0It is within our community where others find lessons in resilience, compassion, forbearance, and creativity. \u00a0The roots of the disability movement here in Canada forged the architecture for social enterprise, for innovation in social finance, and for  building networks of personal support  that work for anyone from pregnant mothers to at-risk youth.  \n \nWho feels that our community of caregivers and care receivers pose an existential threat to the rest of society? \u00a0Probably folks who believe that individualism and consumerism are the keys to a good life. \u00a0Now is the time for those of us who know better to raise our voices, tell our stories and proclaim that there are no existential threats where compassion lives. And everyone is going to need compassion when they get old or ill. \u00a0Everyone.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kxU3Hz2Ui-U/UPwtBmyEh3I/AAAAAAAAAoE/JPZkAl1orcU/s1600/zerodark.jpeg", "http://www.montrealgazette.com/opinion/Opinion+Legalizing+assisted+suicide+wrong+dangerous/7834520/story.html", "http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Midnight+Children+moral+corruption+Zero+Dark+Thirty/7840265/story.html#ixzz2IXCaYutu", "http://www.tyze.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2013/01/torture-movies-and-politics-of.html", "title": ""},

Don\u2019t automatically rely on past solutions and instead place increased value on new, temporary solutions, in response to such an unpredictable climate. \u00a0 \n Think big picture. Make decisions based as much on intuition as analysis. \u00a0 \n Capitalise on complexity. If your talent management strategy is working, then you should be confident that you have the right people in the right place. This will enable you to rapidly break down any challenge into bite size pieces and trust in the specialist expertise and judgement of those around you. \u00a0 \n Be curious. Uncertain times bring opportunities for bold moves. Seize the chance to innovate. \u00a0 \n Encourage networks rather than hierarchies \u2013 as we reach new levels of interconnection and interdependency collaboration yields more than competition. \u00a0 \n Leverage diversity \u2013 as our networks of stakeholders increase in complexity and size, be sure to draw on the multiple points of view and experience they offer. Doing so will help you expect the unexpected. \u00a0 \n Never lose focus on employee engagement. Provide strategic direction, whilst allowing people the freedom they need to innovate new processes, products and services. \u00a0 \n Get used to being uncomfortable. Resist the temptation to cling on to outdated, inadequate processes and behaviours.

The talk is about Mr. Wright\u2019s son and the meaning of life, love and family. \n \nIt has become an annual event at Louisville Male Traditional High School (now coed, despite its name), and it has been captured in a short documentary, \u201c Wright\u2019s Law ,\u201d which recently won a gold medal in multimedia in the national\u00a0 College Photographer of the Year \u00a0competition, run by the University of Missouri. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe filmmaker, Zack Conkle, 22, a photojournalism graduate of Western Kentucky University and a former student of Mr. Wright\u2019s, said he made the film because he would get frustrated trying to describe Mr. Wright\u2019s teaching style. \u201cI wanted to show people this guy is crazy and really amazing,\u201d Mr. Conkle said in an interview. \n \nThe beginning of the film shows Mr. Wright, now 45, at his wackiest. A veteran of 23 years teaching, he does odd experiments involving air pressure and fiery chemicals \u2014 and one in which he lies on a bed of nails with a cinder block on his chest. A student takes a sledgehammer and swings, shattering the block and teaching a physics lesson about force and energy. \n \nBut each year, Mr. Wright gives a lecture on his experiences as a parent of a child with special needs. His son, Adam, now 12, has a rare disorder called Joubert syndrome , in which the part of the brain related to balance and movement fails to develop properly. Visually impaired and unable to control his movements, Adam breathes rapidly and doesn\u2019t speak. \n \nMr. Wright said he decided to share his son\u2019s story when his physics lessons led students to start asking him \u201cthe big questions.\u201d \n \n\u201cWhen you start talking about physics, you start to wonder, \u2018What is the purpose of it all?\u2019 \u201d he said in an interview. \u201cKids started coming to me and asking me those ultimate questions. I wanted them to look at their life in a little different way \u2014 as opposed to just through the laws of physics \u2014 and give themselves more purpose in life.\u201d \n \nMr. Wright starts his lecture by talking about the hopes and dreams he had for Adam and his daughter, Abbie, now 15. He recalls the day Adam was born, and the sadness he felt when he learned of his condition. \n \n\u201cAll those dreams about ever watching my son knock a home run over the fence went away,\u201d he tells the class. \u201cThe whole thing about where the universe came from? I didn\u2019t care. \u2026 I started asking myself, what was the point of it?\u201d \n \nAll that changed one day when Mr. Wright saw Abbie, about 4 at the time, playing with dolls on the floor next to Adam. At that moment he realized that his son could see and play \u2014 that the little boy had an inner life. He and his wife, Nancy, began teaching Adam simple sign language. One day, his son signed \u201cI love you.\u201d \n \nIn the lecture, Mr. Wright signs it for the class: \u201cDaddy, I love you.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing more incredible than the day you see this,\u201d he says, and continues: \u201cThere is something a lot greater than energy. There\u2019s something a lot greater than entropy. What\u2019s the greatest thing?\u201d \n \n\u201cLove,\u201d his students whisper. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes the why of what we exist,\u201d Mr. Wright tells the spellbound students. \u201cIn this great big universe, we have all those stars. Who cares? Well, somebody cares. Somebody cares about you a lot. As long as we care about each other, that\u2019s where we go from here.\u201d \n \nAs the students file out of class, some wipe away tears and hug their teacher. \n \nMr. Wright says it can be emotionally draining to share his story with his class. But that is part of his role as a physics teacher. \n \n\u201cWhen you look at physics, it\u2019s all about laws and how the world works,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t tie those laws into a much bigger purpose, the purpose in your heart, then they are going to sit there and ask the question \u2018Who cares?\u2019 \n \n\u201cKids are very spiritual \u2014 they want a bigger purpose. I think that\u2019s where this story gives them something to think about.\u201d \n \nMr. Wright says the lecture has one other purpose: to inspire students to pursue careers in science and genetic research. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s where I find hope in my students,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe if I can instill a little inspiration to my students to go into these fields, who knows? We might be able to come up with something we can use to help Adam out one day.\u201d \n \nA version of this article appeared in print on 12/25/2012, on page D5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Laws of Physics Can\u2019t Trump the Bonds of Love. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/author/tara-parker-pope/", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/laws-of-physics-cant-trump-the-bonds-of-love/?pagewanted=print", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/category/well/", "http://www.cpoy.org/index.php?s=WinningImages&c=260", "http://www.cpoy.org/?s=Home", "http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/joubert/joubert.htm"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/12/a-christmas-story-reprinted-just-because.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nSometimes I see a post in the newspaper or in another writer's blog that is simply too good and too relevant not to share with my readers here. \u00a0This is one of those posts:  \n \n \n \n It's by Harriet Cabelly and it's titled \"A Mind Like Schwarzenegger's Body - Interview with Susan Fernbach on behalf of Mark O'Brien (from the film The Sessions) \n \n \n \n \n \n\"Who is Susan Fernbach? After seeing the movie\u00a0 The Sessions \u00a0and being completely enthralled with the man whose heart, mind and soul were not in the least bit concealed by the iron lung machine in which he lived most of his life, I looked for someone to enlighten me further on how Mark O'Brien was able to engage in life with such charm and spunk. \n \nOut of the confines and restrictions of his body came beautiful words -- words to describe and connect with the nakedness of humankind. His prose came true to life as he connected with a partner, Susan Fernbach, for the last five years of his life. \n \nMs. Fernbach sheds some light on Mark O'Brien's ability to transcend his circumstances and live in the best way possible. She also shares some important points on being in relationship with a disabled person. \n \n Harriet Cabelly: What personal qualities helped him carry on and move in a positive direction? \n \nHis sense of humor, his intelligence (I used to say he had a mind like Arnold Schwarzenegger's body), a kind of patient tenacity. He once said that what most people think of as courage is really an extreme form of patience. \n \n How did he handle pity, self or otherwise? \n \nHe turned it on its ear in his poetry and other writing, making fun of people's pity for him and his own self-pity. In\u00a0 Breathing Lessons \u00a0and in\u00a0 The Sessions , he and the character based on him somewhat facetiously blame God for his situation, making self-pity into a joke. However, his humor did not negate his feelings -- it helped him cope. \n \n What were his day-to-day coping skills that kept him going? \n \nHe learned to manage his attendants, hiring and firing as needed, giving instructions to them on how he wanted to be assisted. He learned a lot of these management skills from other disabled people in Berkeley. He learned gratitude, which helped him focus on the things that were going right, and he had a spiritual life connecting him to the Divine. \n \n What thoughts propelled him forward? \n \nHe set projects for himself that he could accomplish -- starting an essay, writing a poem or a journal entry -- and the sense of accomplishment helped give him impetus to keep going. When he felt afraid or discouraged, he wrote down those feelings in journals or poetry to get them out of himself. \n \n In general, how did he manage to build a productive and meaningful life? \n \nHe did things even though they scared him -- \" feel the fear and do it anyway \" as the saying goes. He set goals and accomplished them. He built important connections within the disability community based on the \"social model\" of disability as a rights movement rather than the \"medical model\" which defines a person only as a set of deficits or conditions. His disabled friends were very important to his self-image and in reducing his sense of isolation. \n \n What advice would you give someone with disabilities so they can transcend their challenges and live in their best way possible? \n \nTake what society says about you with a grain of salt, especially the media's stereotypes. Don't allow them to pigeonhole you. Set your own goals and celebrate your accomplishments. Don't be denied a purpose for your life. \n \nRead up on the disability rights movement and find out about the courage of people in wheelchairs who chained themselves inside San Francisco's federal building to demand enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. They are inspiring. \n \nJoin groups or online forums where you can communicate with other disabled people. You are far from alone. Mark used to say that everyone will be disabled if they live long enough. \n \nNotes to those who love a disabled person: \n \nBe honest and gentle with yourself about your grief. Their loss of ability is a loss for you too. Being a poet myself, I wrote down my grief about Mark's limitations into several poems. \n \nYou may feel like all that matters is your loved one's state of mind and rehab/goals/accomplishments. For a while, at the beginning of a disability, that may be true, when everyone is in crisis mode. After a while, however, even though it's hard to do, it's important to reclaim some of your own focus, goals and projects. These can help recharge your batteries and help you feel good about something, especially amidst the grief that comes with loss of ability. \n \nAlthough you may want your loved one to overcome his/her condition, don't allow yourself to be made responsible for their state of mind. \n \nFind other people with disabled loved ones. They understand the fatigue and grief that comes with the territory. There are many resources for this on the web for specific conditions and diagnoses. \n \nIf you find yourself in the role of caregiver, try to find support. Many senior centers or center for independent living have resources like this. \n \nExcerpt from\u00a0 The Man in the Iron Lung : \n \nThree Reasons to Live \n \nThe Practical \no God, it was boring \nbut there was nothing else \nso I did it \ngot it out of the way \n \nThe Spiritual \nwe had this deal going \nlike God gave me life \nfor a while \nI gave him gratitude \nfor a while and \nit worked out ok \n \nThe Intellectual \nthings just kept happening \nyou know how every day is different? \nand I just wanted to see \nwhat would happen next. \n \nMay, 1995\" \n \n \nNicholas went to see The Sessions - he didn't want to go with me, so he went with his dearest and oldest friend instead (a guy, of course)! \u00a0They loved the film and Nick had lots of questions afterwards about sex, love and relationships. \u00a0Reading this interview with Susan Fernbach, I realize now more than ever how similar Nick is to Mark O'Brien. \u00a0 Their approach to life is almost identical (although Nick might be slightly more of a jock and slightly less of an intellectual than O'Brien). \n \nIn 2005, Nicholas won an award in high school for 'academic perseverance', he wrote an acceptance speech that read: \n \n \n I thought that I would share with you my secrets of perseverance.\u00a0 Talking about pain or ongoing challenge is very boring to me.\u00a0 I would choose having fun and learning at school over sitting home and complaining any day.\u00a0 I will never give up in school because frankly, I am just too curious and excited to find out what is going to happen next in each of my classes.\u00a0 Some people call this approach having a positive attitude; I call it wanting to express my opinions.\u00a0 I have opinions in my personal life, my school, my community, and my country.\u00a0 And if I want people to hear my opinions, I know I have to be involved.\u00a0 I know how to find information about my interests, and how to use that information.\u00a0 I AM NEVER BORED!!!

{"date": "", "body": "\nThe last few days, I have been thinking about the privilege of giving. \u00a0This is a story that came to mind: \nI was just 22 years old when my husband Jim and I were posted to Moscow in 1978. \u00a0It was the Brezhnev era and we were nervous about living in a faraway foreign land. But, Jim and I had slogged over Russian language lessons for a year before we left, so we felt somewhat prepared. \u00a0Of course, that was a long time ago and way before our children arrived on the scene. \n \nOur time in the USSR was a great adventure and we made good friends both in the diplomatic corps and within the 'refuznik' community of Muscovites (those who had applied to leave Russia, but had been refused an exit visa).  \n \nJim and I assumed that Eastern Europe would be our future work focus, but when Nicholas was born with disabilities, those plans were de-railed. \u00a0In fact, our colleague and friend from our 1970's Moscow days, Rod Irwin, was later named Canadian Ambassador to the Russian Federation.  \n \nIt was Rod's wife Penny who introduced me to the remarkable Moscow charity,  Maria's Children.  \u00a0Maria Yeliseyeva is a Moscow artist who has taught painting and textile arts to, over the years, thousands of orphans, including those with disabilities. \u00a0A few years ago, when Penny and Rod returned to Canada from their time in the Ambassador's official residence in Moscow, Penny dropped over to give me a gift. \u00a0It was a quilt. \u00a0Not a large bedspread type of quilt, but an artwork depicting a Russian countryside winter scene. \u00a0It was beautiful. \u00a0It was clearly made with joy, imagination and love, not to mention great skill.  \n \n \n \n \nPenny told me her story of visiting Maria's Children and noticing the children with cerebral palsy. \u00a0She told Maria about our family and about Nicholas. \u00a0Maria pressed the quilted picture into Penny's hand, saying \"Please take this and give it to your friend in Canada. \u00a0It will be a great thrill to the children who made it. \u00a0You see, they have grown up in an orphanage and they have never before given a gift to anyone. \u00a0This is a great opportunity for them.\" \n \nI've never forgotten those children and their gift to us.  \n \nAt this time of year, that story reminds me of the importance of helping our loved ones continue their traditions of giving, even if they are infirm, ill or disabled. \u00a0This year, my Mum has not been well, so I made cheese balls which I wrapped with cards for her special friends and helpers. \u00a0She is so happy to know that her friends will receive a Christmas gift from her that says not only, \"You are one of my favourite people\", but also, \"I may need a lot of help these days, but I can still give too!\" \n \nOne of my favourite things to make and give with Nicholas is white chocolate bark candy. \u00a0It's become a real tradition in our house and we all love it. \u00a0It's so easy, but it looks gorgeous and when it's presented in clear plastic bags and tied with ribbon, it's a great gift that everyone is thrilled to receive. \n \n \n \n \n \nSo, here's our recipe for White Chocolate Bark: \n \n \n \nIngredients \n \n 1 \u00a0 lb \u00a0 (454 g)\u00a0 white chocolate , chopped (We use Baker's brand) \n 1 \u00a0 cup \u00a0 (250 mL)\u00a0 dried cranberries \n 1 \u00a0 cup \u00a0 (250 mL)\u00a0 pistachio nuts , shelled \n \n \n \nPreparation \n \n \n \n \nIn bowl (plastic or glass), melt chocolate in microwave according to package directions. Stir in cranberries and pistachios. Pour onto foil-lined baking sheet; using palette knife or rubber spatula spread into 12- x 9- inch (30 x 23 cm) rectangle. \n \nRefrigerate for at least 1 hour or until hardened. Break into pieces. \n \n \n \nThe hardest part of making this recipe is shelling the pistachios. \u00a0My daughter Natalie loves this job though, and so do I. \u00a0(We eat quite a few as we're 'working'!) \u00a0It's just lovely to sit around the table and chat as we're shelling. \u00a0Nicholas helps to stir in the cranberries and nuts. \u00a0Of course, he's the official taster as well! \n \nI hope the loved ones in your family have the opportunity to give at this time of year. \u00a0I would love to hear your stories of enabled giving and please do share your recipes if your gifts are edible! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mariaschildren.ru/content/view/141/96/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R4A1fWHjfts/UM0NfHRsL_I/AAAAAAAAAiM/czihbletK4Y/s1600/ottepel.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XVAnKh57-64/UM0Mrz8OSpI/AAAAAAAAAiA/WSZ0M5gdJqs/s1600/pistachio-cranberry-bark-1-525.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/12/enabled-giving-at-christmas-or-hannukah.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nA few weeks ago, Nicholas came home to help decorate our Christmas tree. \u00a0Nick is never that interested in the 'girlie' stuff of decorating, but he was only slightly grinch-like after I gave him a hot chocolate with mini-marshmallows to sip and put on Phil Spector's \"Rockin Around the Christmas Tree\". \u00a0As we were hanging baubles, I asked my young man if he'd like to take some decorations back to his home to do up his room for the season. \u00a0\"No!!!!\" was his reply. \u00a0I rolled my eyes and made a feeble attempt to convince him otherwise, but it was no use. \u00a0For some reason, Nicholas believes that to participate in holiday festivities by anything other than coercion does not reflect the total he-man that he is. \u00a0So, we wrapped our guy up against the cold and off he went with his helper/friend back to his man-cave bachelor pad. \n \nThen one day last week, I dropped in on my boy and couldn't help but notice standing in the corner of his room, THIS: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJen, Nick's night nurse had slowly worked on my family Grinch, saying, \"Nick, maybe we could make you a man-tree. \u00a0If I get a tree that isn't all sparkly or anything, would you try it?\" \u00a0\"Well, OK\" was Nick's reply. \u00a0So, Jen's Dad made a stand in his workshop and Jen got a large tree branch to go in the stand. \u00a0It was a tree that befitted a Grinch. \u00a0Then Josh, one of Nick's two best friend/day-time helpers got Nick to help make decorations. \u00a0These decorations reflect Nick's interests - the World Wrestling Entertainment and beer. \u00a0Note the crushed beer can for a 'star' on the treetop. \u00a0I'm not sure what convinced Nicholas to say 'oh alright' to the gold stars, but I suspect that he was so pleased with his unique Christmas tree that by the end, he was more willing to go along with girlie stuff. \n \nSo, when it came time to bring in gifts for all Nick's helper/friends, of course we put them under his tree! \u00a0We had a gift exchange with some of his helper/friends a couple of days ago and a good time was had by all.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nToday is Christmas Eve. \u00a0Nicholas will go with Jim to my brother in law's for a family party. \u00a0Natalie and I will drive to Montreal to see my Mum who turns 91 today! \u00a0She's still feeling pretty rotten from her recent bout with C-Difficile, but I hope our visit will cheer her. \u00a0Our plan is to give her a very gentle and long hug.  \n \nTo all my friends in the caregiving world, far and wide, may the spirit of Christmas fill your hearts.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mx-SYQy7K6I/UNhN17Ic4YI/AAAAAAAAAkE/WdDabYVSwpU/s1600/xmastree.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DPFobn74VcQ/UNhPGRg1tyI/AAAAAAAAAkg/bCkvLWHCRv4/s1600/crystal.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hwtGv2D0bYc/UNhPQVrz0lI/AAAAAAAAAko/LZFoAA4Srks/s1600/rotaryxmasgang.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/12/how-grinch-got-christmas.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nThere are always one or two gifts at Christmas that become family heirlooms. \u00a0They are the hand-made gifts - those crafted carefully and thoughtfully for someone who is particularly loved. \u00a0They are the gifts that make one ponder, 'who am I and what is the meaning of my life?' \u00a0This year in our family, one of those special presents was a Coat of Arms that my sister Karen made for Nicholas. \u00a0 Karen is a Montreal-based painter . \u00a0She worked with Nicholas and his helpers for months, sending them heraldry images together with their meanings. \u00a0Nicholas added his own touches and finally, a mock-up emerged. \u00a0Little did we know that a professional printer would then produce a 3-D textured poster board of Nick's crest! \u00a0This wonderful artwork will hang on Nicholas' bedroom door in his residence, like a royal coat of arms on a palace drawbridge!  \n \nTo understand the images in this coat of arms is to understand how Nicholas sees himself. \u00a0The colour red signifies the military strength and magnanimity of a brave warrior. \u00a0The jagged edged 'raguly' line surrounding the crest tells of difficulties encountered and fire means zealousness. \u00a0Nicholas chose the English white rose because of his time living in England, but also because it signifies love and faith. \u00a0Antlers denote strength and fortitude (they also give a Canadian flare). \u00a0The maple leaf that contains the English cross tells Nick's story of growing up in Canada and England, while his sports teams are evident throughout. The Ottawa Senators vintage \"O\" logo appears front and centre directly below a banner with the words \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" - the song of the Liverpool Football Club.  \n \nBut it was the snail that made me laugh and tear up all at once. \u00a0The snail is the heraldic symbol of deliberation and perseverance - the qualities that define Nick and make him so admirably unique in today's world.  \n \nThe other present that made family history this year was a scrapbook of favourite family recipes for Natalie. \u00a0It seemed to me this year that our little girl was growing up and that perhaps she needed a bit of home as she prepares applications for graduate school and a more adult life after her first four years of college.  \n \nThe book is divided into family holidays (cottage, Christmas and birthdays) as well as by people - each member of our family contributed their favourite recipe along with a memory. \u00a0It all sounds a little bit precious and probably sentimental, but we had a marvellous time making this gift. \u00a0And given that Natalie is studying material culture and contemporary anthropology, we knew it would appeal to her sense of imbuing objects with meanings to do with identity, history and emotion. \n \n \n \n \nI guess we were all feeling that transitions are coming in Natalie's life and that perhaps future Christmases would never quite be the same as when the children were little. \u00a0Natalie felt this most keenly and on Christmas morning as we hugged, she said, \"I could feel this transition coming, but the book made it OK.\"  \n \nTonight, we will all join with Joshua, an old family friend and now one of Nicholas' full-time carers. \u00a0Josh is getting married this evening and as we wish him well for his future life, we will give thanks for the love in our family and for all of our blessings in 2012. \n \nHappy New Year, everyone! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ggOKvrIE0mk/UOH4SxJQr8I/AAAAAAAAAlE/mIvHb9an8ag/s1600/coatofarms.jpg", "http://www.karenthomson.ca/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HxZUQ1FbBj4/UOIDAuri_8I/AAAAAAAAAlg/R5mImCOpOms/s1600/recipes1.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z6HKeEEC_go/UOIDI31ni7I/AAAAAAAAAlo/44mLXBt52I8/s1600/recipes2.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/12/very-special-gifts.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n When my son Nicholas was about fourteen, he had a major hip surgery. \u00a0Because of his severe cerebral palsy, the doctors decided it would be best to send Nicholas straight to the ICU rather than the recovery room after the surgery. \u00a0Of course my husband Jim and I were waiting anxiously for our boy to be wheeled, still asleep, into his bay in the bright and beeping environment of intensive care. \u00a0Nick began to spike a temperature soon after his arrival - a urinary tract infection was diagnosed. \u00a0Then the diarrhea started. \u00a0 Wikipedia describes the 'hospital superbug' C-Difficile this way:\u00a0 Clostridium difficile \u00a0 ( pronunciation below ) (from the \u00a0 Greek \u00a0 kloster \u00a0 (\u03ba\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1), spindle, and \u00a0 Latin difficile , [1] \u00a0 difficult), also known as \"CDF/cdf\", or \" C. diff \", is a \u00a0 species \u00a0 of \u00a0 Gram-positive \u00a0 bacteria of the genus \u00a0 Clostridium \u00a0 that causes severe \u00a0 diarrhea \u00a0 and other intestinal disease when competing bacteria in the \u00a0 gut flora \u00a0 have been wiped out by antibiotics. \n \n \n \n Patients undergoing major surgery very often have an in-dwelling catheter and these are notorious for causing urinary tract infections, as it did in Nick's case. \u00a0But the anti-biotics automatically prescribed to prevent blood and bone infections in orthopaedic surgery candidates were the culprit in Nick's C-Difficile. \u00a0So, another antibiotic was prescribed to knock out both the UTI and the C-Diff and this time, the strongest one on the market -  Vancomycin . \u00a0It eventually worked, but not before interacting with Nick's anti-seizure medication.... but that's a story for another day. \u00a0Nicholas did, eventually, recover from his surgery and from his urinary tract infection and C-Difficile. \u00a0At the time, I thought, \"Boy, I hope I never see  that  condition in anyone I love again\". \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Fast forward to last March. \u00a0My Mum, who is a decade short of being a centenarian, contracted the dreaded C-Diff infection - not once, but twice. \u00a0The second time was in the hospital while she was waiting for a nursing home bed, arranged on a short term basis just to get her strength back. One of the hospital staff was guilty of infecting her again. \u00a0After an arduous course of vancomycin, my Mum got better - until three days ago. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mum has gastro problems at the best of times and when a gastro bug hit her residence and spreading like wildfire, of course she got it. \u00a0She's back in hospital and we just found out that she's positive for C-Diff again ..... or is she,  really ? \u00a0 A little further reading into C-Diff yielded this surprising nugget:\u00a0 Latent symptoms of\u00a0 C. difficile \u00a0infection often mimic some\u00a0 flu-like symptoms \u00a0and can mimic disease flare in patients with\u00a0 inflammatory bowel disease -associated colitis. \u00a0  So. \u00a0My mother's symptoms may be C-Diff and we'll know that if she's worse. \u00a0If she continues to recover without medication or intravenous fluids, then we'll\u00a0 \n \n know that she had a nasty case of the flu, but that the bacteria C-Difficil happens to still reside in her gut 'harmlessly'. \u00a0Another key fact I learned about about this superbug:\u00a0 In a very small percentage of the adult population,\u00a0 C. difficile \u00a0bacteria naturally reside in the gut. Other people accidentally ingest spores of the bacteria while they are patients in a hospital, nursing home, or similar facility. \n \n So, how can the frail, elderly and vulnerable avoid getting C-Difficile? Good hand washing, including the use of anti-bacterial gels and the avoidance of anti-biotic treatments for routine infections (unless absolutely necessary). \u00a0That's what my mother's doctor said and it's what we practice the best we can in our family. \u00a0Sometimes, though, superbugs live up to their name.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile#Pronunciation", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_(language)", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile#cite_note-1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-positive", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LZmnkKwP0DI/UMaK0_VOL7I/AAAAAAAAAhg/KiQmEymT77I/s1600/li-hand-wash-hospital-620-c.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu-like_symptoms", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/12/c-difficile-evil-bacteria-that-makes.html", "title": ""},

But over time, these tasks together can be exhausting.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n1) \u00a0You can\u2019t do it alone. \u00a0Make a decision to say \u2018yes\u2019 every time someone asks to help. If you are shy or embarrassed to do so, just explain that you\u2019ve taken a decision to say yes to each offer of help, even if you don\u2019t know precisely how that person can help. If you don\u2019t have a task list, just ask your friend to come over and hang out with you and your charge. The helpful tasks will reveal themselves (and the helping capacity of your friend will too). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n2)\u00a0 Remember, not all friends are good at being helpful. \u00a0If you find that some friends or family don\u2019t offer, just accept that part of their personality and try to move on asap. Begin to develop an \u2018A\u2019 team of really helpful friends and family who turn up and roll up their sleeves.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n3)\u00a0 Coordinate the team \u00a0using facebook, email or one of the terrific new software platforms for caregiving such as\u00a0 Tyze . \n \n \n \n4)\u00a0 Ensure that the whole team understands that caring for and about you, the caregiver, is a top priority. \u00a0When a baby is born, everyone instinctively understands that the mother must be cared for so that she can look after her baby. The same principle is true when giving care. Someone else should look after walking your dog and collecting your children from school so that you can be with your relative in times of crisis. \n \n \n \n5)\u00a0 Between crises, let the team share the care and visiting responsibilities \u00a0 so that the principal caregiver can have a break. \u00a0These breaks will enable the caregiver to hang in for the long term without burning out. Maybe some friends can step up by issuing an invitation to dinner or a concert. When people talk about \u2018caregivers needing support\u2019, this is one important kind they are talking about - a real break. \n \n \n \nBuy Donna's book on\u00a0 amazon \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n SHARE ON FACEBOOK \n SHARE ON TWITTER \n COMMENT ON ARTICLE \n PRINT ARTICLE \n SEND ARTICLE \n SUBSCRIBE TO THE ETHICAL HUSTLE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tyze.com/", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/ethicalhustle", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/contributors/christabel-shaler", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK&t=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada", "http://twitter.com/home/?status=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada+--+http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK&title=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada", "http://buzz.yahoo.com/buzz?targetUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK&headline=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada&summary=When+someone+you+love+is+suffering%2C+it+is+easy+to+feel+worn+down%2C+angry+and+defeated.+As+you+confront+the+daunting+walls+of+medical+bureaucracy%2C+it+may+seem+impossible+to+go+on.%26nbsp%3BRemember+that+caregiving+is+ultimately+a+privilege%2C+because+it+is+an+opportunity+to+love+deeply%2C+without+ego%2C+and+to+spell+out+that+love+in+your+actions.Donna+and+her+familyThe+first+time+I+met+Donna+Thomson+was+in+the+pages+of+her+book%2CThe+Four+Walls+of+My+Freedom.%26nbsp%3BDonna%27s+book+brings+a+strong+and+articulate+voice+to+the+millions+of+invisible+caregivers+across+Canada.+I+also+enjoy+her+blog%2C+which+includes+a+fantastic+recent+piece+titled%2C%26nbsp%3BHow+To+Live+Without+Irony%3A+Just+Ask+a+Caregiver.", "http://www.google.com/bookmarks/mark?op=add&bkmk=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK&title=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK&title=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK&title=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK&title=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada", "http://www.tumblr.com/share", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/forward?path=node/13649", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/print/node/13649", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/ethicalhustle", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/commentary", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/tags/british-columbia-health-care", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/tags/canadian-health-care", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/tags/caregiving", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/tags/end-life", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/tags/home-care", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/tags/palliative-care", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/tags/four-walls-my-freedom", "http://goofyfoot.ca/", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/ethicalhustle/2011/09/11/social-media-tool-helps-mother-fight-cancer", "http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552788903", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK&t=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada", "http://twitter.com/home/?status=Five+tips+for+surviving+caregiving+in+Canada+--+http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FUvAUzK", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/comment/reply/13649", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/ethicalhustle/five-tips-surviving-caregiving-canada#print", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/forward?path=node/13649", "http://www.vancouverobserver.com/feeds/blogs/54"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/11/five-tips-for-surviving-caregiving.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nVS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A day or two ago, I was driving along the highway enroute to visit Nicholas, my young man who lives in a truly cozy and pleasant care home.\u00a0 Nick is 24 and has severe cerebral palsy as well as a myriad of other complicated medical conditions.\u00a0 He is blessed with fantastic nursing care to keep him safe as well as family and friends who love him. \u00a0 Nick moved out of our home last year and we are all still finding our way to being comfortable with this new way of living. \n \n \n \n So as I was saying, I was driving along, listening to the radio - an interview with a certain Christy Wampole who had written an opinion piece for the New York Times that seemed to be getting a lot of attention in cyberspace.\u00a0 The title of Dr. Wampole\u2019s article was \u201c How to Live Without Irony \u201d.\u00a0 I began to listen intently and almost missed my turn.\u00a0 I sat in the parking lot when I arrived at Nick\u2019s just to catch the last bit and for the last couple of days, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about irony. \n \n \n \n Dr. Wampole is a professor, so she\u2019s in the company of young people a great deal of the time.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2018hipsters\u2019 she is after in her article - young people who prize cynicism and disguise it as wit.\u00a0 Here is Wampole\u2019s description of a hipster: \n \n \n \n The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies relentlessly, foraging for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things. \n \n \n \n I found out during the interview that Wampole had received some 200 emails in the first 24 hours after the blog publication and in a mere three days, garnered almost 800 online comments.\u00a0 Clearly, the armor of irony is important to lots of people.\u00a0 Here\u2019s another nugget from the article:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u00a0Ironic living is a first-world problem. For the relatively well educated and financially secure, irony functions as a kind of credit card you never have to pay back. In other words, the hipster can frivolously invest in sham social capital without ever paying back one sincere dime. He doesn\u2019t own anything he possesses. \n \n \n \n Wampole paints an accurate picture of young people who scour vintage shops to find clothes that look geeky.\u00a0 They adorn themselves with styles that are a comment on a comment. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n As I listened, I remembered something I had heard the neurologist/author Oliver Sachs say years ago:\u00a0 \u201cPeople with disabilities are condemned to always being themselves\u201d.\u00a0 Yes, I thought, it\u2019s impossible for Nicholas to be a hipster, or for me to be one for that matter.\u00a0 It\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t love irony as a form of humour, especially British wit.\u00a0 But I am rubbish at pretending it\u2019s a pillar of my personality, and I\u2019m betting that\u2019s true of every other caregiver too. \n \n \n \n This is what Wampole says about the likes of us: \n \n \n \n Nonironic models include very young children, elderly people, deeply religious people, people with severe mental or physical disabilities, people who have suffered, and those from economically or politically challenged places where seriousness is the governing state of mind. My friend Robert Pogue Harrison put it this way in a recent conversation: \u201cWherever the real imposes itself, it tends to dissipate the fogs of irony.\u201d \n \n \n \nSometimes caregiving feels like love and sometimes it feels like war. \u00a0But it's always, always real. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P8DbrKHnCbM/UK61sehscaI/AAAAAAAAAgU/D-igeRjUt54/s1600/hipster+3.jpeg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Er0qzG_0c58/UK62-FU7QJI/AAAAAAAAAgc/kKZExbiUSj8/s1600/P1050772.JPG", "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/11/how-to-live-without-irony-just-ask.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I am proud to call Canadian Supreme Court Justice Rosie Abella a friend. \u00a0A few days ago, I was watching the television news when a story about a disability rights case in British Columbia caught my attention. \u00a0The case dated back to the 1990's and involved a young lad called Jeffrey Moore who, by the time he finished grade three, still could not read. \u00a0Jeffrey didn't even know the alphabet on account of his severe dyslexia. \u00a0Jeffrey's parents sued the province of British Columbia for the cost of private tuition that they were forced to purchase when the public system denied special education assistance for young Jeffrey. \u00a0It has taken all these years for the case to reach the Supreme Court, but when it did, Rosie wrote the judgement. \u00a0 \"Adequate special education, therefore, is not a dispensable luxury. \u00a0For those with severe learning disabilities, it is the ramp that provides access to the statutory commitment to education made to all children in British Columbia.\" ( CTV News Story HERE ) \n \n \n \n When I saw that story on the news, I wrote to this note to Rosie: \n \n \n \n \n Dear Rosie, \n \n \n \n I just wanted to write to tell you how thrilled I am about the ruling that was announced today. \u00a0As you can imagine, I was chatting about this ruling with all my friends in the parent movement - we are all thrilled for all the children of the future who will benefit from equal access to a good education. \n \n I wanted to share with you that Nicholas had a great experience in High School. \u00a0He attended Notre Dame High School and everyone there from the principal to Nick's aide were absolutely fantastic. \u00a0In June, 2005, Senator Jim Munson handed Nicholas a cheque for $1,000 and a \"Spirit of the Capital Youth Award for Academic Perseverance\". \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNick wrote this acceptance speech which his aide read to the audience at the Congress Centre awards ceremony: \n \n I would like to thank all the members of The Spirit of the Capital Youth Awards committee for this award. \u00a0This award makes me both happy and proud. \u00a0I am proud of my school, my teachers and my friends for working together to help me achieve academic success at Notre Dame High School. \u00a0I am proud of my family: Mom, Dad, Natalie, for their unfailing love and support. \u00a0I am also proud of myself for always trying my best. \u00a0I thought that I would share with you my secrets of perseverance. \u00a0Talking about pain or ongoing challenges is very boring to me. \u00a0I would choose having fun and learning at school over sitting home and complaining any day. \u00a0I will never give up in school because, frankly, I am just too curious and excited to find out what is going to happen next in each of my classes. \u00a0Some people call this approach having a positive attitude; I call it wanting to express my opinions. \u00a0I have opinions in my personal life, my school, my community and my country. \u00a0And if I want people to hear my opinions, I know I have to be involved. \u00a0I know how to find information about my interests and how to use that information. \u00a0I AM NEVER BORED! \u00a0My advice to other students is to keep trying, even if it takes a long time to achieve academically. \u00a0The world is far more interesting if you know something about it. \u00a0At times we all face some difficulties, but it is important to remember to never give up and never give in. \u00a0Thank you all, and good luck.\u00a0 \nThen Nick's aide read the words to the song of Nick's favourite English soccer team, Liverpool - You'll Never Walk Alone. \n \n When you walk through a storm Hold your head up high And don't be afraid of the dark At the end of the storm Is a golden sky And the sweet silver song of the lark Walk on through the wind Walk on through the rain Though your dreams be tossed and blown Walk on walk on with hope in your heart And you'll never walk alone You'll never walk alone When you walk through a storm Hold your head up high And don't be afraid of the dark At the end of the storm Is a golden sky And the sweet silver song of the lark Walk on through the wind Walk on through the rain Though your dreams be tossed and blown Walk on walk on with hope in your heart And you'll never walk alone You'll never walk You'll never walk You'll never walk alone. \n \n \n \nToday at the Remembrance Day ceremony, we were standing beside Jim Munson and reminiscing about this great day in Nicholas' life. \u00a0Nick's access to an adapted curriculum gave him the skills to go on to study pre-college courses online at the Open University in the UK and then to start an Ebay selling business. \u00a0He loves his life. \n \n \n \nLove,\u00a0 \n \nDonna \n \n \n \nIt was a coincidence that we ran into Senator Jim Munson at the Remembrance Day Ceremony. \u00a0He recalled Nicholas very well and together, we talked about the Supreme Court ruling that gives all children the right to equal access to the curriculum, regardless of learning disability. \u00a0I am proud to call Rosie Abella a friend and I'm proud to live in a democratic country with equality and rule of law. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DHDzEWNfQV4/UKVOtCxZlsI/AAAAAAAAAek/AvNrbUweL3E/s1600/2011HarlanLectureRosalieSilbermanAbella.jpeg", "http://bc.ctvnews.ca/school-discriminated-against-dyslexic-boy-supreme-court-1.1031962#ixzz2CK6n4TnR", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NJmLuvAYniM/UKVJIKYfreI/AAAAAAAAAeI/Ev6QZdyjUUs/s1600/spiritright.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/11/youll-never-walk-alone.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nVery recently, I came across a UK award-winning initiative for people with Alzheimer's that I thought was, well, 'barmy'. \u00a0The social enterprise is called \" Dementia Adventure \" and aims to connect people living with dementia to nature and a sense of adventure. \u00a0I was dubious until I watched the video embedded in their website. \u00a0Looking at the name alone, I thought at first \"Dementia Adventures\" was an organization that extolled the 'adventure of living with dementia'. \u00a0Not so - it's a wonderful and inspiring concept. \u00a0I spread the word on my  facebook page for caregivers  and then kind of forgot about it - until today. \n \nThis morning sealed the deal for my new way of thinking about how those with Alzheimer's or dementia can live a good life. \u00a0My husband and I were sipping our morning coffee over the Sunday papers and listening to CBC radio. \u00a0\" The Sunday Edition \" is a documentary show that we like and this morning, I stopped reading to hear  Karen Wells' in-depth investigation  of how the citizenry of Denmark have experienced a tectonic shift in thinking about how people with dementia can live a rich and valued life. \u00a0The common thread in the documentary is laughter. \u00a0There are the sounds of activity and laughter punctuating the entire piece.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Danish government set the stage for all this activity when they enacted a law stating that elderly people, including those with dementia should have the right to social contact and self-determination. \u00a0Ideas about how to accommodate those with memory deficits, while never sacrificing quality of life began to take shape. \u00a0The director of one day programme stated, \"We don't have scheduled activities. \u00a0We just try to shape our day as we would for ourselves, on a good day, if we had the day off work.\" \u00a0Groups are no larger than eight (the size of a good dinner party). \u00a0There are no dishwashers because hand washing dishes and cutlery is good for small muscle memory.  \n \nPeople with dementia and early Alzheimer's go on holiday, with support of their paid coordinators as well as family members. \u00a0Karen Wells of the CBC, asked one woman where she had gone on holiday with her day programme friends. \u00a0She replied, \"I can't remember, but I'm sure that I had a very nice time!\" \u00a0More laughter.  \n \nOf course, the effects of progressive memory loss lead eventually to nursing homes and to death. \u00a0But in Denmark, the journey is much happier. \u00a0If it were me, it's a journey I would choose. \u00a0Now I see that that the folks behind Dementia Adventure and social care policy in Denmark are really on to something. \u00a0Treating people as 'people', adjusting for their abilities, is a good way to live a life - any life. \n \nListen to Karen Well's radio documentary \"Redefining Dementia in Denmark\"  HERE \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HLpEcZwv3qI/UKj-MpCso8I/AAAAAAAAAfA/toSppuXonHE/s1600/dementiaA620.jpeg", "http://www.dementiaadventure.co.uk/", "https://www.facebook.com/donnathomsonauthor?ref=hl", "http://www.cbc.ca/thesundayedition/", "http://www.cbc.ca/thesundayedition/shows/2012/11/14/redefining-dementia-in-denmark/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KOwxXaM73sE/UKj-hB4-JjI/AAAAAAAAAfI/6Ktm_Mm77Tw/s1600/woodlandwalk.jpeg", "http://www.cbc.ca/thesundayedition/shows/2012/11/14/redefining-dementia-in-denmark/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/11/redefining-dementia-lets-all-go-to.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nI had to dry my tears and compose myself before beginning this post. \u00a0 It was a book that had made me cry - \" The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\" by Anne Fadiman .  \n \n \n \nThis is a story about a Laotian family of refugees in California whose daughter, Lia, had severe epilepsy and developmental delays as a result of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. \u00a0What happened to Lia and her family is a tragic litany of cultural misunderstandings together with the struggle for power over the care of this very complex child. \u00a0Lia's family belong to the  Hmong  group of Laotian people. \u00a0 This is how they referred to their daughter's devastating epilepsy, \"1982 was \"the year the spirit first caught Lia and she fell down\": 1985 was the \"the year Lia became government property.\" \n \nLia's family do not speak English, nor could they understand the doctors' complex and ever-changing regime of anti-convulsant drugs. \u00a0When Lia's parents believed that the drugs made their daughter worse (which they often did), they simply stopped giving the medication and brought her to a traditional Hmong shaman healer instead. \u00a0No one ever contested that Lia's parents loved her or that they doted on her care in every way. \u00a0In fact, medical professionals considered Lia spoiled, but that did not stop her doctors charging the parents with non-compliance in her drugs regime and placing Lia in foster care. \n \nDee Korda was the foster mother who cared for Lia during this sad time. \u00a0Dee came to love Lia and her family, even leaving her own new baby in Lia's parents' care while she brought Lia to medical appointments. \u00a0Dee Korda and her family never doubted that Lia was placed in foster care as a result of flawed judgement and cross-cultural misunderstanding. \u00a0She once said, \"Lia knew how to love and how to let people love her.\" \u00a0When Lia suffered toxic shock that rendered her effectively brain dead, the author remarked, \"Whatever else she had lost, Lia still knew how to be loved.\" \n \nMany parents I know and name as friends have been charged with non-compliance in cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the same illness that befell Lia. \u00a0Medication regimes are difficult to follow and the erratic comings and goings of seizures confounds the best doctors and scientists. \u00a0In fact, when Lia was removed from her family home and given over to the care of Dee Korda who administered multiple medications according to physician's orders, Lia's seizures became worse. \u00a0The sad story of Lia Lee is one of dedicated and talented physicians who had no training or skills in breaking down language or cultural differences in order to work in a collegial fashion with Lia's family.  \n \nIn 2004, Nicholas was in a great deal of pain. \u00a0Two hip surgeries to rebuild a dislocated hip had not prevented his hip to become dislocated again and we were advised to remove the ball of the femur altogether. \u00a0This surgical procedure seemed dreadful, but we accepted that it was our only choice, so we agreed to it. \u00a0Afterwards, when Nick's femur migrated upwards into the pelvic bone, we tried multiple, permanent nerve blocks, but they caused secondary nerve damage and pain in Nick's right foot. \u00a0Trying to find a safe dose of morphine or other strong painkiller was nearly impossible, especially when Nick was screaming at 3am. \u00a0Often, the hospital anaesthetist on call would simply say \"I don't do pain\", or \"I'm in the middle of a surgery, this is too complicated\" and they would hang up before I could reply.  \n \n\u00a0Then this happened: \u00a0(from my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom ) \n \n \"What is it?\" \u00a0My social worker looked distraught. \u00a0The nurse said that a child protection change had been laid against me. \u00a0There would be an investigation into the allegation that I had overmedicated Nicholas, and that because I had indicated extreme levels of of stress and exhaustion, I was possibly trying to harm Nicholas. \u00a0At the very least, I had given extra morphine without a prescription and potentially put his life in danger. \u00a0I was incredulous, but at that point, I didn't comprehend the full implications of this turn of events. \u00a0Then I was told that I could not be in the room with Nicholas. \u00a0Easter weekend was coming up and Nicholas could not come home for a hospital weekend pass. \u00a0I was being investigated as a mother who wanted to harm, if not kill, her child. \u00a0A sense of dread, fear and helplessness oozed its way into my thoughts and dreams. \u00a0I worried constantly that they might take not only Nick, but Natalie away from us. \u00a0It was ironic, I thought, that my greatest fear had been Nick dying.\"\u00a0 \n \nIn the community of parents giving complex care to their child, there is a high percentage labeled abusive at worse or non-compliant at best. \u00a0I am not a Laotian refugee and english is my first language. \u00a0Still, when my usually excellent relations with Nicholas' medical professionals took a bad turn, I believe it was on account of cultural misunderstanding. \u00a0The language that I did not understand was medical, administrative and prescriptive. \u00a0My language was cultural, intuitive and very responsive to a situation that was painful and chaotic. \u00a0In my next post, I will write about the inspirational lessons I learned for my own family and others who are working toward consensus with medical professionals in their child's life. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.ca/Spirit-Catches-You-Fall-Down/dp/0374267812/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1352416257&sr=8-3",

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Dr. Arthur Kleinman  is a psychiatrist and anthropologist who heads the Department of Social Medicine at Harvard University. \u00a0In my last blog post, I talked about the heartbreaking story of Lia Lee in \" The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\" by Anne Fadiman . \u00a0Lia's intractable seizure disorder combined with the cultural barriers between Lia's family and the medical community that treated her yielded tragic results. \u00a0Dr. Kleinman's opinions on Lia's case appear near the end of the book. \u00a0Besides being an expert on the Hmong people (Lia's culture), he is a major contributor to cross-cultural understanding in cases where western medicine clashes head-on with new arrivals in North America who present themselves at the Emergency Room.  \n \nKleinman devised eight simple questions for non-English speaking patients and their families. \u00a0This is how Lia's family answered them: \n \n1) \u00a0What do you call the problem?  \n Qaug dab peg. \u00a0That means the spirit catches you and fall down. \n \n2) \u00a0What do you think has caused the problem? \n Soul loss. \n \n3) \u00a0Why do you think it started when it did? \n Lia's sister Yer slammed the door and Lia's soul was frightened out of her body. \n \n4) \u00a0What do you think the sickness does? \u00a0How does it work? \n It makes Lia shake and fall down. \u00a0It works because a spirit called a dab is catching her. \n \n5) \u00a0How severe is the sickness? \u00a0Will it have a long or short course? \n Why are you asking us these questions? \u00a0If you are a good doctor, you should know the answers yourself. \n \n6) \u00a0What kind of treatment do you think the patient should receive? \u00a0What are the most important results you hope she receives from this treatment? \n You should give Lia the medicine to take for a week but no longer. \u00a0After she is well, she should stop taking the medicine. \u00a0You should not treat her by taking her blood or the fluid from her backbone. \u00a0Lia should also be treated at home with our Hmong medicines and by sacrificing pigs and chickens. \u00a0We hope Lia will be healthy, but we are not sure we want her to stop shaking forever because it makes her noble in our culture, and when she grows up she might become a shaman. \u00a0 \n \n7) \u00a0What are the chief problems the sickness has caused? \n It has made us sad to see Lia hurt, and it has made us angry at Yer. \n \n8) \u00a0What do you fear most about the sickness? \n That Lia's soul will never return. (Pages 260-1) \n \nThe author Anne Fadiman presented Dr. Kleinman with the Lee family's responses to his eight questions and this what she wrote: \n \n From his vantage point, a physician could encounter no more captivating a patient than Lia, no finer a set of parents than the Lees. \u00a0Then I told him what had happened later - the Lees' noncompliance with Lia's anti-convulsant regimen, the foster home, the neurological catastrophe - and asked him if he had any retroactive suggestions for her pediatricians. \n \n \"I have three,\" he said briskly. \u00a0\"First, get rid of the term 'compliance.' \u00a0It's a lousy term. \u00a0It implies moral hegemony. \u00a0You don't want a command from a general, you want a colloquy. \u00a0Second, instead of looking at a model of coercion, look at a model of mediation. \u00a0Go find a member of the Hmong community, or go find a medical anthropologist, who can help you negotiate. \u00a0Remember that a stance of mediation, like a divorce proceeding, requires compromise on both sides. \u00a0Decide what's critical and be willing to compromise on everything else. \u00a0Third, you need to understand that as powerful an influence as the culture of the Hmong patient and her family is on this case, the culture of biomedicine is equally powerful. \u00a0If you can't see that your own culture has its own set of interests, emotions and biases, how can you expect to deal successfully with someone else's culture?\"  (Pg. 261) \n \nIt would not be an understatement to say that I was thrilled when I read these eight questions. \u00a0I believe that most people who are faced with serious illness, together with their families, struggle to comprehend the culture and language of biomedicine. \u00a0 These simple eight questions have the potential of creating an even playing field of mutual understanding and respect in situations where patients are faced with choosing complicated treatments or invasive procedures.  \n \nIn 2004, my son Nicholas was suffering nearly constant pain from a series of failed hip surgeries and nerve blocks that resulted in increased pain due to nerve damage. \u00a0Nick's doctors were all highly skilled, totally dedicated professionals who struggled to help us recover hope for a pain-free future. \u00a0Now, looking at Kleinman's eight questions, I know that if I had answered them then and showed them to our doctors, they would have answered the same way that Lia's pediatricians did when they saw the Lee's answers: \u00a0\"They thought WHAT????\" \u00a0When our doctor told us that nerve blocks 'killed the nerves', I understood that Nick would have no sensation and certainly no pain. \u00a0After the nerve blocks, when my boy still flinched upon movement, I believed the nerve blocks had failed and needed to be re-done. \u00a0I know now that nerve blocks only partially numb sensation. \u00a0When another doctor said that Nicholas (aged 16) needed to 'adjust his lifestyle' and lie down most of the day in order to be comfortable, I could not accept that his active lifestyle could be over. \u00a0I believed it was my job to defend his chances of an active future. \u00a0There were many misunderstandings and all of them caused our family great distress. \n \nI'm going to write to Dr. Kleinman to ask him whether any scholar has investigated using his eight questions with non-immigrant patients. \u00a0Think of it! \u00a0These eight questions could be used to share perceptions between an elderly parent, family and professional care-home staff. \u00a0They could be used in cases where a young adult has just been diagnosed with schizophrenia and misconceptions about the causes of mental illness are revealed.  \n \nI am inspired by these eight questions and I am determined to find out more about how they can assist families like mine navigate the culture and language of biomedicine. \u00a0I'll keep you posted! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aij1myjEXsg/UKGPOuStpaI/AAAAAAAAAds/r3R5UfJIhE0/s1600/kleinman_arthur.jpeg", "http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~anthro/social_faculty_pages/social_pages_kleinman.html", "http://www.amazon.ca/Spirit-Catches-You-Fall-Down/dp/0374525641"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/11/eight-questions-that-can-heal.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThis morning I was driving through the rain as I listened to CBC radio. \u00a0I was relaxed after a hard workout at the gym - always a great state for listening, in my experience. \u00a0 Nora Young hosts SPARK , a weekly interview radio show about technology and human connectedness. \u00a0Nora is a quiet person with an unquenchable curiosity for understanding how we communicate across space, cultures, age, ability and language. \u00a0SPARK is always fascinating and this morning was no exception. \u00a0 Today, I learned about a new 'font' or computer typeface that has been invented especially for people with dyslexia . \u00a0It's registered on ' Creative Commons ' which means that it's free to download for anyone who wants to try it out. \n \n \nTo download the free font, click  HERE . \n \nListening to Nora and her guests talk about different ways that people can use technology to communicate reminded me of our own experience with teaching Nicholas to read. \u00a0My son Nick has low vision and severe cerebral palsy. \u00a0He's got fantastic hearing and understanding, but reading was always a huge struggle. \u00a0We tried various early computer programmes in the 1990's, light and shadow boards in the 2000's and continued trying until we finally gave up on reading altogether about eight years ago. \u00a0Now, Nick gets all the information he needs from the spoken word. \n \nFrom 2006-2011, our family lived in London where my husband served as Canada's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom (that's the same as Ambassador except that Canada is a member of the Commonwealth, so the title is different). \u00a0We had many official events with esteemed guests. \u00a0One evening, we were celebrating authors and I had the pleasure of speaking with  Margaret Atwood . \u00a0We were talking about the future of writing and the growing impact of technology on the written word. I was surprised to hear Ms. Atwood reflect, \"technology doesn't bother me at all. \u00a0I love it. \u00a0After all, the real point is to communicate ideas from my head into yours. \u00a0Why wouldn't we want to make that as easy and efficient as possible?\" \n \nIf the written word became obsolete, would that be a terrible thing? \u00a0I think the answer would be in what the replacement looked like. \u00a0If we were able to communicate without words, without books or typeface, well, perhaps we could communicate BETTER. \u00a0I find it clumsy and sometimes frustrating trying to understand Nick. \u00a0I remember my father being discouraged and sad after losing his speech to a catastrophic stroke. \u00a0What if we could communicate with our loved ones who find speech or writing difficult because of autism or alzheimer's?  \n \nI am interested in technology as a caregiving tool, but I'm also interested in the possibilities of computers as highly evolved communication devices. \u00a0I hope that one day, we will be able to understand each other's messages in a way that makes not reading well or speaking disabilities of the past.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/spark/", "http://www.cbc.ca/spark/episodes/2012/10/26/194-dyslexia-documentia-domains/", "http://creativecommons.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lceS-yeiTqI/UI2vLZwOnaI/AAAAAAAAAc0/85yMtFiryso/s1600/OpenDyslexic+font.jpg", "http://www.dafont.com/open-dyslexic.font", "http://www.margaretatwood.ca/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/10/future-fantasy-technology-and.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n When it comes to our aging population in Canada, we have a lot of reasons to be worried.\u00a0 Many people still assume that the government will provide care and if state funded services fail, charities will pick up the pieces.\u00a0 Tim Draimin, Executive Director of Toronto\u2019s Social Innovation Generation or SiG coordinates the efforts to create a sustainable business plan for our country\u2019s charitable sector.\u00a0 SiG has been looking carefully at the UK model of enabling the development of social enterprise, loosely defined as a business with a social purpose.\u00a0 This is important for Canadians, because solutions to meet the housing and lifestyle needs of vulnerable citizens will be found somewhere between charity and for-profit business models.\u00a0 Enabling innovation in this area by creating legal frameworks to allow private venture capital investment into charitable enterprises is the idea.\u00a0 The danger inherent in doing nothing to innovate is that numbers of people with care needs will grow as government budgets shrink.\u00a0 Families, especially women, will be caught in the middle.\u00a0 Economies will suffer, but so will people, especially the elderly. \u00a0 \n \n   One clear and present obstacle to assisting families in seeing to their loved ones\u2019 care needs is the fact that government budgets that are strictly attached to services, not to people.\u00a0 For example, when I appealed for help at home, I was told that Nicholas was entitled to a long term care placement, but I could not use that funding if I chose to look after him at home.\u00a0 We experienced constant battles between government departments, each of whom pointed to the other saying \u201cit\u2019s not our within our mandate to fund your family.\u00a0 Try another government department.\u201d\u00a0 In our case, that discussion most often heated up between the departments of health and social services, but it could equally have occurred between different budget representatives within a single department.\u00a0 A freeing up of budgets so that they follow a person, rather than the services they use could go a long way to making life much easier for society\u2019s most vulnerable citizens.\u00a0 A look at almost every tragic case of exhausted parents abandoning their children with severe disabilities, or even doing them harm shows that the tipping point of despair arrives about the time of the child\u2019s fourteenth birthday.\u00a0 Some parents manage to last longer, but this early adolescent period is a wakeup call for Mums and Dads who believed that perhaps things would get better with age.\u00a0 The spectre of the endlessness of care demands for someone who is suddenly growing a beard or breasts can hit hard.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n The case of six year old Ashley X was one that caught the world\u2019s attention and triggered an ethical firestorm in Seattle, Washington.\u00a0 In 2004, doctors at the Seattle Children's Hospital performed a hysterectomy, removed Ashley's breast buds and gave her high-dose estrogen to retard growth and sexual maturation -- a procedure that her parents say has kept Ashley a child.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n They maintain that it is easier to care for their daughter at home, to carry her and to keep her free from mentrual cramps.\u00a0 They call Ashley their \u201cpillow child\u201d because she is most comfortable lying on a pillow in the family home.\u00a0 The problem was that in May, 2007, the Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital admitted that it broke the law by performing the procedure to prevent Ashley\u2019s maturation because there was no court order or medical review by a board of ethics at the hospital. \u00a0 The problem with this treatment is that it is irrevocable.\u00a0 It denies the potential for growth and change in the human body \u2013 an extreme act that may ease the burden of care to families and state, but at a terrible human cost.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n There is no question that lifting, changing and bathing an adult is much more difficult than performing those tasks for a child.\u00a0 But a solution that is congruous with our most fundamental beliefs about dignity would not be the Ashley treatment.\u00a0 Rather, I believe that we should offer parents of severely disabled children a placement at the age of fifteen.\u00a0 If the parents choose to keep their child at home, they should be entitled to the equivalent care costs to be used in the family home.\u00a0 Currently, placements are virtually nonexistant for those with severe disabilities who are not wards of the state.\u00a0 Most families struggle on quietly until their son or daughter turns eighteen at which point the relatively \u201crich\u201d children\u2019s services become a thing of the past.\u00a0 Society hasn\u2019t woken up to the fact that this generation of children with severe disabilities raised in family homes are surviving into adulthood.\u00a0 Those with conditions such as Down Syndrome were expected to expire in early adulthood only twenty years ago.\u00a0 Today, their life expectancy is within a normal range if there are no medical complications.\u00a0 In parent groups, the eighteenth birthday of your child is called \u201cfalling off the cliff\u201d.\u00a0 Some schools will keep teens with disabilities until the age of twenty-one, but after that, there are often long wait lists for day programmes and a young adult is relegated to sitting at home watching television.\u00a0 Most parents have to give up work at this point to assume full time caring responsibilities when their contemporaries are at their professional peak or planning an early retirement. \u00a0 \n \n   For parents in this position, housing solutions are often the most pressing need.\u00a0 Most want some kind of a home with the proper supports for their son or daughter, perhaps shared with a couple of other individuals who have similar care needs.\u00a0 Access to tax sheltered savings such as the Disability Savings Plan combined with long term care funds released to the individual could go a long way to achieving this dream of \u201cindependent living\u201d.\u00a0 Innovative and flexible legal frameworks could give incentive to parents who wish to create social enterprise in housing provision for their loved one.\u00a0 A house is purchased, refurbished with specialized features, rented out to residents with care costs rolled in and a small board of directors manages the household staff and payroll.\u00a0 Profits from rental fees go repay investors and pay for building improvements.\u00a0 Members of personal support networks represent residents on the board (if residents cannot represent themselves) and ensure quality control of all services.\u00a0 Residents use a combination of state long term care funds and personal savings (via tax sheltered savings mechanisms) to pay for care and housing.\u00a0 All social aspects of daily living are arranged by residents or members of their personal support networks. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n   Seniors could use some aspects of this model.\u00a0 Most people at retirement age have some savings in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP).\u00a0 I would propose that any funds redeemed from that plan and used to pay for care should not be taxed whatsoever.\u00a0 This would entail providing receipts for care received and submitting them with an income tax return.\u00a0 Any monies spent on care would be eligible for a 100% tax refund. \u00a0 Governments cannot have their cake and eat it too.\u00a0 Societies cannot euthanize all its citizens who are too old, ill or disabled to be productive and parents should never be allowed to surgically ensure their children never grow up.\u00a0 A new deal that incentivizes saving and allows private investment into businesses that demonstrate a social purpose a way forward that offers some hope for a good life.\u00a0 Amartya Sen recognizes disability as a central challenge to justice.\u00a0 In the Idea of Justice, he writes \u201cGiven what can be achieved through intelligent and humane intervention, it is amazing how inactive and smug most societies are about the prevalence of the unshared burden of disability.\u00a0 In feeding this inaction, conceptual conservatism plays a significant role.\u00a0 In particular, the concentration on income distribution as the principal guide to distributional fairness prevents an understanding of the predicament of disability and its moral and political implications for social analysis.\u201d (The Idea of Justice, pg. 260) I want a good life for my son and my elderly mother.\u00a0 But I also want a good life for myself.\u00a0 Some of the challenges that I have described in my family could be addressed by an injection of cash.\u00a0 But a life that we value and have reason is one that has at its heart caring and belonging.\u00a0 If life is a pie chart, money is only one slice.\u00a0 The care of vulnerable citizens is a corporate act on the part of society; it\u2019s not just the job of social workers.\u00a0 It takes a village to raise a child, but it takes every citizen in every village to help sustain each other.\u00a0 \n \n I have never met another parent of a son or daughter with disabilities who did not know what they needed to thrive.\u00a0 We know that paid care together with the love and support of friends, family and neighbours is for us, the key to a good life.\u00a0 This is a future we must build for everyone, including those with differing abilities.\u00a0 For the sake of love and decency, we must be allowed to build it. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n This is Part 3 of my mini-series on fairness in policymaking for our families. \u00a0It's taken from my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom . \u00a0I am a Canadian who has lived in my own country, in the UK and in the United States. \u00a0With the US Presidential debate this evening, I encourage in a completely non-partisan way (especially because I am Canadian!), a thoughtful discourse on our caregiving and family issues. \u00a0Here's my take on the ethics behind fair policy. \n \n \n \n Ethics and moral philosophy guides us in shaping the financial deal between families and the state.\u00a0 If we agree that it is morally wrong to coerce someone into giving care, as in my own experience or that of the Kelso or McKeague families, then we must accept that families have a state supported exit clause.\u00a0 When families put their hand to their health or social service department and say \u201cI need help\u201d or \u201cI have had enough \u2013 I can\u2019t do this anymore\u201d, those civil servants should respond with practical solutions and no defensive, bureaucratic nonsense.\u00a0 Enabling families to contribute their own resources without fear of losing state resources would go some distance to achieving this ideal.\u00a0 Tax initiatives such as income splitting for families where one parent cares full time for someone in need would be helpful.\u00a0 If I had been able to claim half of Jim\u2019s income over the last twenty years, our tax rate would have been much lower.\u00a0 We would have had the extra cash to pay for more care and special equipment.\u00a0 As it was, on paper I could have been sitting home eating bonbons \u2013 my contributing role was not reflected in our taxation, so my contributions were not reciprocated in any way, shape or form by the state.\u00a0 Where citizens give care to others, policies must reflect an understanding that those two people \u2013 the carer and her charge \u2013 are linked in almost every way.\u00a0 The wellbeing of each is completely dependent on the other.\u00a0 Policies that support caregivers are essential to the health of their vulnerable charges, just as policies that support mothers result in healthy children.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Local community centres can play a vital role in supporting carers.\u00a0 Between postings at home in Ottawa, I was an active member of my local community centre, Dovercourt.\u00a0 For a time, I was a board trustee representing the interests of those served by inclusive programmes.\u00a0 Dovercourt is a terrific real life example of how a sports and recreation centre can galvanize a community to embrace all of its citizens.\u00a0 The City of Ottawa partially funds operations of that centre, but participants also pay fees for programmes.\u00a0 The centre\u2019s charitable status pays for free swims for people with disabilities, rehabilitation programming such as the rehab walking club and post-stroke aqua fitness classes.\u00a0 There are classes for all abilities, many for those with long term conditions as well as for those who are recovering from surgery or illness.\u00a0 Charitable funds also pay for specially trained one to one helpers, otherwise volunteers help out.\u00a0 Secondary school students are encouraged to fulfill their voluntary service hours requirement at Dovercourt.\u00a0 John Rapp, Executive Director at Dovercourt once told me that the lounge with its internet caf\u00e9 and playstructure is \u201cthe living room of the neighbourhood\u201d.\u00a0 Everyone is welcome and after aerobics or aqua class is time for cross generational coffee and conversation.\u00a0 The friendly banter is natural \u2013 differing abilities blend in seamlessly.\u00a0 Everyone is friendly with the residents of a local psychiatric group home who often come in for some company.\u00a0 When Nicholas and Natalie were small, I would leave them in the wonderful Kindercare facility, knowing they were safe and happy while I did aerobics in the adjoining gym.\u00a0 Family swims were a regular activity for us, but we took advantage of the disabled swim times if we wanted a quieter experience.\u00a0 These sociable and healthy pursuits made me feel connected to my neighbours.\u00a0 When I didn\u2019t come to class, people noticed and often, prepared meals would be dropped off at my door.\u00a0 All of these special kindnesses gave me a sense of connectedness to my community.\u00a0 It helped to make us all feel \u201cnormal\u201d.\u00a0 Dovercourt is a designated emergency shelter, so when the ice storm hit in 1998, many in our neighbourhood slept on cots in the gym.\u00a0 Although we had a hotel room, we used the warm facilities during the day to socialize and allow the children to play with their friends.\u00a0 This neighbourhood \u201cliving room\u201d is just one example of interdependence realized and celebrated through public-private co-funding arrangements. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But it\u2019s not only seniors or people with disabilities and their families who benefit from such arrangements.\u00a0 Cristina Odone of the Centre for Policy Studies in London was interested in the aspirations and life goals of women in England.\u00a0 What she found surprised her and offended some.\u00a0 Odone\u2019s research showed that most women derive their greatest satisfaction by nurturing their loved ones.\u00a0 Their careers are seen as an intrusive and rather unpleasant necessity.\u00a0 In \u201cWhat Women Want\u2026and How They Can Get It\u201d (March, 2009), she wrote \u201cOur work-centred culture is based on a fundamental conundrum: the economy depends on workers, while society depends on carers.\u00a0 Women, in particular, are torn.\u00a0 Only by resolving it will we create the conditions for a society in which adults fulfil their potential as professionals, partners and parents\u2026.Can \u2013 should \u2013 government intervene in such an intimate sphere?\u00a0 The answer is a resounding yes.\u201d\u00a0 Odone\u2019s policy recommendations reflect her findings that women feel torn apart by a desire to care for their families, to have some paid work for life balance and financial security while experiencing the push by governments for them to be in full time paid employment with children in daycare or face paying the penalty costs.\u00a0 If policy makers were to accept my argument for the capability of enabling good mothers as a matter of justice, they might take up some of Odone\u2019s recommendations such as:\u00a0 \n \n The government should change its childcare strategy.\u00a0 Pumping billions of taxpayers\u2019 money into a child care system that is both unpopular with mothers and has been shown to harm children\u2019s emotional development makes no sense \n Instead, through the tax credit system and childcare vouchers, the Government should enable families to choose their childcare, including parental or close family care. \n The 2007 Pensions Act, which introduces weekly national insurance credits for carers of children and the disabled as of April 2010, is a step in the right direction.\u00a0 The credits will count towards the State Basic and State Second Pensions.\u00a0 But the new proposals will only apply to those people who have 20 qualifying years of National Insurance (UEI) contributions\u2026who reach State Pension age between April 2008 and April 2015.\u00a0 More should be done in this direction. \n The government should reform the tax and benefit system so that they no longer penalise stay-at-home women.\u00a0 Income splitting could redress this.\u00a0 Income splitting regards the household rather than the individual as the basic economic unit.\u00a0 It allows married and cohabiting couples with children to be taxed jointly rather than as individuals. \u00a0 \n It should be easier, not more difficult, for businesses to employ part-time workers.\u00a0 At present only a little over half (66%) of businesses have part-time workers; the volume and complexity of employment regulations are not likely to attract more businesses to take on more employees of any kind.\u00a0 The government should act quickly to cut these regulations and their accompanying paperwork. \n Finally, we need to break the stranglehold that a small coterie of women who work fulltime and buy into the macho way of life, enjoy on our public life.\u00a0 They have, for years, misrepresented real women who reject the masculine value system for one that rates caring above a career, and interdependence above independence. \n \n \n Odone is talking here about the United Kingdom, but the policy ideas are relevant in any developed nation.\u00a0 She certainly seems unduly harsh to those women who have fought so long and hard for an equal place at the boardroom table, but I agree with her that the celebration of paid employment alongside derision for the work of caring is wrong and actually unhelpful to everyone.\u00a0 We all require care at some time in our lives.\u00a0 Indeed, a new trend to emerge (and this just from my own observations) is that of women beginning a new career path at age fifty-something.\u00a0 Once child rearing is done, healthy and fit mothers jump in to pursuing their dreams of becoming someone other than a mother.\u00a0 Many women find themselves at the top of their career game just as their husbands are on the point of retiring. I agree with Cristina Odone on most of her policy recommendations but I would warn her not to throw the baby out with the bath water.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Women do have more opportunities to succeed in business than ever before and we do not want to squander those advancements.\u00a0 But all of society needs to recognize that caring for dependents is not some dirty little secret to be denied or swept under the carpet.\u00a0 My daughter Natalie is at university and she has big plans for success in business AND a happy family \u2013 with lots of luxury holidays to boot.\u00a0 She wants it all, and I believe she should have it.\u00a0 Policies that allow women to nurture well with reasonable support followed by a retirement from caring should be available.\u00a0 Of course there will be some men and women who choose all or nothing on both sides of the work/care coin and why not?\u00a0 But where job satisfaction is concerned, Odone has echoed that essential PLAN value \u2013 that relationships are the key to a good life. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Coming next: Part 4 - the summing up.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1350402361&sr=1-1&keywords=the+four+walls+of+my+freedom", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rFjOIg8achI/UH2DqootT6I/AAAAAAAAAbg/BS3bVC300Bg/s1600/Scan+18.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/10/fairness-in-policymaking-for-family_16.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nRecently, I spoke on the telephone with another writer who six months ago, lost her beloved mother to cancer. \u00a0  Christabel Shaler writes a blog called The Ethical Hustler for the Vancouver Observer  and here is how she described her mother in one of her posts there: \n \n \n We grew up in a basement suite beneath beautiful houses and massive chestnut trees. Our clothes came from thrift stores and our car was a rusted Datsun. \n \n My mother worked long hours and saved up for trips to museums, opera tickets, piano lessons and art classes. She told me that I could do anything. \n \n Our luxuries were our creativity, comedy and imagination. My brother was a comedian and I built forts out of couch cushions while dressed as Cindy Lauper. Sometimes my mother's laughter overflowed and tears of joy would smudge her mascara.\u00a0 \n \n There were many times when we struggled, but my mother kept telling me that I could do anything.\u00a0Despite thin finances, I got through university. \n \n One month before my university graduation in October 2008, a doctor explained to us that my mother had cancer spreading throughout her bones.The room turned inside out. I had always thought that my mother's bones were made of steel. These bones had held our family together.\u00a0 \n \nChristabel is an old soul in a young person's body. \u00a0Her Mum passed away six months ago after a long, often difficult and sometimes profoundly joyful palliative period. \u00a0Christabel has many wise words, but something that she said in particular, stopped me in my tracks. \n \n\"I believe that I had the right to care for my dying mother.\" \u00a0 \n \nI was taken aback by that statement because so often we think of the rights of patients. \u00a0It's not often that policymakers or health care workers, much less family members think of the 'right to give care'. \u00a0In my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom , I talked about the right to give care this way: \n \n \n \n Eva Feder Kittay coined the word \u2018doulia\u2019 to describe a new paradigm for reciprocity for caregivers in the community.\u00a0 She describes \u2018doulia\u2019 as an ethical principle that recognizes giving care as an important contribution to the overall good of society.\u00a0 \u201cWe can ask whether parents or kin who assume the role of caregiver should have claims on the larger society to support them in their efforts to provide care.\u00a0 If, for all the effort and care in raising a child with disabilities into adulthood, there is no payback (conventionally understood) to the society at large, can we still insist that there be a state interest in helping families with the additional burdens of caring for a developmentally disabled child?\u00a0 Is there a state interest in assuring families that their vulnerable child will be well cared for when the family is no longer able or willing to do so?\u201d \n \n \u00a0 Kittay answers her own question with a resounding yes and that response is rooted firmly in her own mothering experience.\u00a0 She describes a concept of interdependency or \u201cnested dependencies\u201d that recognizes the inevitability of dependency as a fact of being human.\u00a0 It is via the idea of doulia that reciprocity can be realized through policy because the driving force is an equality that \u201cour full functioning presumes our need for and ability to participate in relationships of dependency without sacrificing the needs of dependents or dependency workers.\u201d \n \n \n \n This afternoon, I am in Vancouver to speak about an online tool for coordinating the care of a vulnerable person who receives care at home -  Tyze Support Networks . \u00a0Christabel Shaler will be here as well, talking about how she used Tyze to help care for her Mum. \u00a0I can't wait to meet Christabel.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n\"Push a Poo, push a poo, push a poo poo poo!\" \u00a0That's what I used to sing to Nick when he was little. \u00a0Recently, I sang the little ditty again into Nick's ear and we both had a good belly laugh. \u00a0But the laugh wasn't enough to elicit any action 'down there' and neither were buckets of medication or even a one litre soap suds enema (we'd given a fleet the day before). \u00a0This state of affairs is naturally causing him to feel nauseated and exhausted. \n \nNicholas has always suffered from severe constipation. \u00a0When he was small, we received a diagnosis of gastro-intestinal pseudo obstruction. \u00a0Here is a simple  description from the New York Times Health Guide: \n \n \n \n \n \nIn primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction, the small or large intestines lose their ability to contract and push food, stool, and air through the gastrointestinal tract. \n \nThe condition can occur suddenly (acute) or over time (chronic). It may occur at any age, but is most common in children and the elderly. Because the cause is unknown, it is also called idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (idiopathic means occurring without reason). \n \nRisk factors include: \n \n Having\u00a0 cerebral palsy \u00a0or other nervous system (neurologic) disorders \n Staying in bed for long periods of time (bedridden) \n Taking narcotic (pain) medications \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nicholas did recover from his childhood bouts of being unable to eat anything at all due to his miserable gut function (at one point he needed to be fed through his vein, bypassing the stomach altogether). \u00a0But recently, this chronic, adult form, or something like it, has reared its ugly head. \u00a0It's rather typical of Nicholas and people like him who are the first of their generation of children living with severe disabilities - they are pioneering the territory of aging with severe health challenges. \u00a0None of the medical literature can give any hint as to what to expect next from Nicholas - he is one of the first to survive his challenges to adulthood. \u00a0Now, Nicholas has all the risk factors for pseudo obstruction in spades. \u00a0I guess his intestines are finally fed up with trying to digest his feeds (not to mention the odd bit of fried chicken and french fries), especially when he's lying down most of the time and popping oral morphine. \u00a0What does the future hold? \u00a0I don't know - only Nick's gut will tell. \n \n \n \nYesterday, I made the short (on Canadian standards) drive to visit my Mum in Montreal. \u00a0It was a few months ago, but it seems like yesterday that she got out of hospital after battling two back-to-back cases of that dreaded hospital superbug, C-Difficil. \u00a0My Mum's problems are quite the opposite of Nick's. \u00a0Perhaps we could put my Mum in the next room to Nicholas and they could kind of create some intestinal karmic meeting in the middle. \u00a0Now, wouldn't that be grand? \u00a0Then, I could change my song to \"Don't Worry, Be Happy!\" \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4kE8QakQEA/UGbtYf_bqzI/AAAAAAAAAZk/Cp7z6KHP7Xs/s1600/toon973+Easter+Island+constipation.jpg", "http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/primary-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/overview.html", "http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cerebral-palsy/overview.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/09/constipation-blues.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nParenting healthy children is challenging, so imagine parenting a step-child with disabilities. \u00a0Blended families are nearly the norm nowadays and it follows that a contemporary phenomenon will be shell shocked step-mothers or step-fathers and their children who are learning about disability for the first time in their new blended family setting. \n \nLouise Kinross is the communications guru at  Toronto's Holland Bloorview Kids' Rehabilitation Hospital . \u00a0Louise is Ben's mother and Ben has complicated disabilities. \u00a0Louise uses her own experience together with her extraordinary capacity for empathetic listening to create  BLOOM, an online magazine for special needs families.  \u00a0It's a terrific resource and I highly recommend it. \n \nA couple of months ago, Louise interviewed a famous  Canadian Olympic rower, Silken Laumann . \u00a0Silken was speaking about her own blended family which includes her husband's teenaged daughter Kilee, who sometimes has challenging behaviours. \u00a0Kilee is diagnosed with autism. \n \n \n \nIf you are parenting a step-child with disabilities, you will find  this interview with Silken from BLOOM \u00a0interesting reading. \u00a0 \n \n BLOOM: What was it like to become a parent to a teen with autism? Silken Laumann: \u00a0 It's been quite a journey, as you can imagine. The first time Kilee grabbed me by the hair, I did everything wrong. I screamed. I fought back. I cried. I'm an Olympic athlete trained to jump out of the starting gate with a heart rate of 175, and I reacted like a woman being attacked in a dark alley. It wasn't rational and I was ashamed and embarrassed afterwards. She was crying and I was crying. \u00a0 It's been an upward positive swing from there as far as me managing my emotions around Kilee's physical outbursts \u2013 which happen less and less. I'm better at respecting her boundaries and I can see the signs of her escalating. I'm much more in tune with her energy when it starts to switch, so I'm much less likely to be in a situation where she grabs my hair and starts to pull. \n \n I went into the marriage believing it was the right thing to do for all our kids and that it was the right thing for our relationship and that there would be more to gain than to lose by coming together as a family. But all along there\u2019s been this discussion of what if she hurts one of the children? What if we can\u2019t handle it? There were some \u2018what ifs\u2019 we had to get through, and I kept saying I believe it will work out. There are things we can do if things get really bad, such as living separately for a while. My number one job as a parent is to keep my kids safe so if I ever felt that wasn\u2019t possible we\u2019d have to change our living arrangements. But we\u2019ve been able to get the help with Kilee that she needs and she\u2019s more settled in her outbursts.\u00a0\u00a0 \n BLOOM: What were the first few months living together like? Silken Laumann: \u00a0 I don't think anything could have prepared me for it. At the time I thought I was doing okay and I thought it was going well, but in retrospect it was really hard. Kilee moved from London, Ont. to British Columbia, which, as you can imagine with autism, was very traumatic for her. Her behaviour escalated within three weeks of moving out and we had outburst after outburst. Unlike my other kids, Kilee couldn't yell and say 'I hate you.' She'd come running at me or biting her hand or jumping up and down like a two-year-old. In the beginning I was far too judgmental. I didn't always separate the behaviour from the person. I couldn't see how much she was struggling. I'd get really angry at my husband too, thinking he didn't have enough discipline around setting boundaries for Kilee. It took me a while to get it \u2013 to start to understand the complexities of the situation and the complexities of Kilee. \u00a0 This is what happens with so many special-needs children. People just see the top layer and sometimes the top layer is not the best layer. With Kilee, as time went on, I saw layer after layer after layer. And as I have learned to be more still with her and much less judgmental, I can see just how vulnerable she is, just how hard she\u2019s trying, and just how frustrated she sometimes feels. And we're learning a language together on how to express that in a more helpful way than hurting or jumping or screaming. I\u2019ve come to understand that cause-and-effect consequences don\u2019t work with Kilee. That was hard for me because I\u2019ve parented my children on natural consequences. But that doesn\u2019t work for Kilee. If she throws her lunch out the window \u2013 which she did the other day on the drive to school \u2013 you can\u2019t just not give her lunch. \u00a0 When my other kids\u2019 behaviour stunk, I always tried to look at the antecedent, knowing it wasn\u2019t just about what was happening in the moment. But with Kilee it\u2019s so much harder to figure that out, because she\u2019s so limited with language about emotions. You have to pay so much attention. In the beginning it felt like Patch and I were always problem-solving around Kilee and I was so afraid my kids would feel this was 'all about Kilee.' It was important for me to say there will be certain accommodations made for Kilee, but the whole family will not be centred around one person. When Patch suggested putting locks on doors I said no, there's a point for me where we're not turning this into a group home. This is a family and everyone is important. Something that really helped was hiring a caregiver in the evening hours so we could give more equal energy to the kids. BLOOM: What have you learned since Kilee came into your life? Silken Laumann: \u00a0 I'm a very impatient and demanding person \u2013 demanding of myself \u2013 and that trickles over to people around me. One of my lifelong journeys is to not be so impatient and to not be so definite and confident that I know what needs to be done. Because with Kilee, none of that works. In fact, what's needed is the exact opposite. With Kilee, 90 per cent is feelings, not verbal communication. When she's vibrating high I can physically feel this big energy. And when she's going off into a dark energy, you feel it and see it in her eyes. \u00a0 Having Kilee in my life has made me slow down, and shown me how fundamental it is to focus on the positive, because positive reinforcement for Kilee is so important. I need to look at what I can do to encourage her and compliment her, even when she's acting out, because sometimes the best way to help her switch gears when she's sobbing or biting her hand is to start talking to her. I'll say: 'Oh Kilee, you're such a good girl and you have such a big heart. And we love you so much.' And I keep going at it and feeling it with her. Because I know that in that moment she's beating herself up. \n \n What have YOU learned by parenting step-children? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hollandbloorview.ca/", "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silken_Laumann", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XiEZQOhcHQY/UG7iRCA8qMI/AAAAAAAAAac/5VTuwxkrlbI/s1600/DSC_1913_1841.jpg", "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/07/life-is-not-just-about-achieving.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/10/caregiving-for-step-children.html", "title": ""},

If governments and families were to partner in order to realize this vision of a good life for vulnerable citizens, how might the policy read? \n \n   \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The last half century has seen the closure of residential care institutions for people with disabilities and growth in numbers of nursing homes for the aged.\u00a0 Who cares for and who pays for all these dependent individuals is a problem governments have struggled with ethically, financially and politically over the years.\u00a0 Governments\u2019 first response has been to devolve responsibility for vulnerable citizens to families, usually women.\u00a0 Liberal values of \u201cfree and equal\u201d citizenship combined with a drive for independence originating in the disability movement have further marginalized those with cognitive disabilities or mental illness.\u00a0 For them, and for their families, independence is a cruel fiction.\u00a0 Compounding the problem for families is that the first response of governments has been to minimize damage to their budgets by limiting access to community care, usually by increasing thresholds of eligibility.\u00a0 Thirty years ago, tube feeding would have been a nursing need requiring hospitalization.\u00a0 Today, families are expected to roll this task into their day alongside walking the dog and fixing school lunches.\u00a0 What to do with people who are completely dependent and whose families cannot or will not support them is a huge problem for contemporary societies.\u00a0 Equality based policies have failed people with disabilities and their families \u2013 we are not a society of equals. \u00a0 \n \n   \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the UK, a grand social experiment is underway.\u00a0 The Labour government under Gordon Brown has taken devolution of social care one giant step further by creating personal budgets for those receiving government funded care at home.\u00a0 Supporters of this regime decry the old system of take it or leave it day programmes, likening it to \u201csomeone taking all your money and spending it on things you don\u2019t want or need.\u201d\u00a0 The UK government at all levels is hoping that people will creatively make their disability pension cheque go further by being imaginative and flexible.\u00a0 But there is a worry among some that this policy represents state-sanctioned abandonment of its neediest citizens and a downloading of responsibility for their welfare to those who are least able to shoulder it. \u00a0 \n \n   One thing is clear.\u00a0 Governments cannot single-handedly provide the elements of a good life for vulnerable people who require care in the community.\u00a0 But families cannot shoulder the burden of care unassisted either. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Stay tuned for Part 2 of this mini-series.\u00a0 \n \n   \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1350059970&sr=1-1&keywords=the+four+walls+of+my+freedom"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/10/the-ethics-of-fairness-for-family.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nOne thing I know about caregiving is that it cannot be done well by one person alone. \u00a0We need friends, family... we need support. \u00a0And that support is really only very effective if it is coordinated. \u00a0So, to that end, I have given a lot of my time and energy to promoting a Vancouver based organization that has achieved global reach, the PLAN Institute for Caring Citizenship (www.planinstitute.ca). \u00a0The founding director of the PLAN Institute is Vickie Cammack. \u00a0Vickie is also the founder and CEO of a fantastically innovative and HELPFUL online tool designed to coordinate networks of support for those who require care and their families. \u00a0This tool is called Tyze (www.tyze.com).  \n \n \n \n \nVickie and I believe that our caregiving families have something valuable to share with the rest of society. \u00a0So recently, we co-wrote an article that was published in yesterday's Vancouver Sun newspaper Op-Ed section. \u00a0Our piece is a response to the recent Vancouver Foundation study 'Alone Together' that examined the extent to which folks in Vancouver felt a sense of satisfaction with their social connectedness. \u00a0This is our piece: \n \n \n \nThe recent Vancouver Foundation survey of social connectedness Alone Together found three-quarters of those polled reported satisfaction with their friendships. Yet a reading of the media and public reaction to the study would lead anyone to be alarmed that most city residents were friendless and disconnected from their neighbourhoods. \nSimon Fraser University\u2019s Public Square Community Summit (Sept. 18-23) offers a wide-ranging and compelling program that will investigate strategies to help build urban community connections, and that is a good thing. But it\u2019s striking that nowhere in the program is talk of what is working for the majority polled who reported satisfaction with their social supports. \nThree-quarters of people in Vancouver are happy with their social connectedness. Understanding the dynamics of trust and good neighbourliness that abound in our city is a powerful way to engender more of each. For anyone feeling doubtful, take a moment to reflect on our Olympic experience. Our collective task is to unleash more of it, not only by raising concerns about the 25 per cent who want more connectedness, but by shining a light on the abundance of trust and caring all around us. \nOur species is hardwired for compassion, belonging and meaning. Our very survival depends on it. Our society would simply not function without high levels of trust and freely given care. And the good news is there are several global and local initiatives that are accelerating trust and engagement. \nConsider Freecycle. In Vancouver, there are well over 7,000 registered users of Freecycle, an online site that connects those who wish to discard used household items with those who want them. No money is exchanged, but friendly conversations are part of the deal. Everyone on Freecycle shares a commitment to keeping city landfills free of their stuff, and when people share a commitment, they like to chat about it. \nOr, perhaps some of those happy people surveyed were saving money and making new friends by couch surfing. Anyone who offers their sofa to a complete stranger must have trust, curiosity and confidence in their heart. Couch surfing is not for those who harbour feelings of fear or complacency. A recent check of CouchSurfing.Org revealed nearly 3,000 ads offering a free sofa-bed in Greater Vancouver. \nAnd then there is Vancouver\u2019s vibrant urban gardening scene. Downtown gardening allotments are hot properties and hotbeds of opportunity for fun and conversation. There are no locked fences surrounding the beds of ripening vegetables and gardeners report few losses from produce thieves. \nDifferent ethnic backgrounds or abilities are not a barrier either to social engagements, especially for those under 30. Young people in this city are likely to respond to ethnic diversity or differences in abilities with a collective shrug. Their educational experience of classrooms full of peers different from themselves will have prepared them not to fear difference, a view of society that might be unthinkable for their grandparents. That open attitude helps when a new used clothing exchange starts up in a workplace, or a rooftop beekeeping operation needs volunteers. \nBut not everyone wants to root their social lives in helping others or participating in a community cause. The Vancouver Foundation research survey revealed a high percentage of inner city apartment dwellers who had no interest in knowing or befriending their neighbours. \nRather than assuming those people are sitting alone at home with no friends, some social scientists are devising new ways of discerning how downtown neighbourhoods are changing in contemporary cities. \u201cLivehoods\u201d is a research project that maps locations where people check in on social media most frequently. It\u2019s a new way of revealing where people go and the results are surprising. A careful reading of Livehoods shows folks may not know their neighbours, but they know the servers at their local coffee shop. \nHomegrown, free, collective initiatives that result in friendly conversation are part of the picture of what puts satisfaction into social life. Ad hoc, friendly encounters \u2014 those smiles and nods to strangers \u2014 have their place in helping us feel good about our place in the world, too. Sweeping cities of the world (and now in Victoria) is an urban project called Street Pianos. The idea is that a piano is placed outside, in a park or even a busy street. Anyone can sit and play. Anyone else can stop to listen, sit to play a duet, or simply walk by and recount the story of free pianos later at dinner. An urban space, previously thought of as perhaps dangerous and full of strangers with bad intentions is transformed. Citizens of a city need to feel ownership of and comfort in their own public spaces and projects like Street Pianos helps that happen. \nInitiating and spreading different kinds of public spaces for us to do what comes naturally \u2014 connect and engage \u2014 is one of the ways our city council can nourish and amplify trust. \nThe work of the Vancouver Foundation and SFU Public Square is to be commended but let\u2019s be sure to recognize, celebrate and accelerate the enormous trust, caring and belonging that are at the heart of our city. \n Vickie Cammack is the president and CEO of Tyze Personal Networks, a social media tool designed to deliver support networks to those facing life challenges, particularly those with a disability or issues related to health and aging. She is also is the founding director of the PLAN Institute and the co-founder of Planned Lifetime Advocacy Networks.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n When our son Nicholas was diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy over 23 years ago, he was four months old and I was very frightened.\u00a0 I was frightened, but also determined to learn as much as I could about how to care for my baby.\u00a0 I was full of the kind of youthful optimism that bordered on naivete - in those days, I believed that I could CURE Nick through the power of my will and my knowledge.\u00a0 Members of our extended family arrived at our door with casseroles, hugs and tears.\u00a0 But my husband\u2019s Auntie Nellie had knowledge about how to help Nicholas - Anelia, or Nellie as we call her, is a highly skilled physiotherapist and when she arrived, she stayed for days.\u00a0 I remember Nellie and I, still in our pyjamas at four in the afternoon, half lying on our spare bed with tiny Nick.\u00a0 Nellie explained the patterns of spasticity and how to gentle my baby\u2019s limbs into relaxed symmetry. \n \n \n \n Now, years later, I see Auntie Nellie at the cottage - her cottage is next door to ours.\u00a0 Last night, she came over for dinner and I asked her this, \u201cNell, you know so much about caregiving and helping seniors.\u00a0 You have spent your life healing sore muscles and bones.\u00a0 What can you tell caregivers that no one else will?\u00a0 What are your secrets?\u201d \n \n \n \n As generous as she was all those years ago, Nellie shared her wisdom for caregivers.\u00a0 Here are her secrets: \n \n People who give physical care over time will often put pressure on their joints and muscles while in an unnatural position.\u00a0 (I did this by lifting Nicholas into car seats and into his wheelchair for years - now I am paying the price with back pain.)\u00a0 Caregivers are taught correct lifting techniques, but are often not made aware that they need to STRETCH in order to counteract the repetitive strain on the joints and spine.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n This full body stretch can be done in bed when you wake up, following your morning shower or after you deliver care (whenever you can!) \n \n People who give physical care over time will often lose flexibility and range of motion in their upper back and shoulders.\u00a0 They will begin to look bent over with a rounded upper back and shoulders that refuse to rotate backward.\u00a0 Often, caregivers are unable to reach straight up to the ceiling or even clasp their hands behind their back, and for good reason.\u00a0 We are often stiff and sore.\u00a0 Here are Nellie\u2019s stretches to make sure you stay flexible, pain-free and healthy. \u00a0 The first stretch is done in a doorway with your feet hip-width apart. \u00a0Stand straight, with your hands on the door frame at shoulder height (level). \u00a0Now look at the next picture to see Nellie leaning forward for her stretch. \n \n \n \n \n \n Now, lean forward, allowing your shoulders to rotate back. \u00a0Your shoulder blades will come together and your chest will be open. If you experience pain, your loved one is probably ready for an OT assessment for assistive devices.\u00a0 Don\u2019t put off getting hardware to ease the strain on your body. Nellie says if you can, make sure you are stronger than the person you look after.\u00a0 (I made this mistake and didn\u2019t get a ceiling track hoist for Nicholas until he was 18.\u00a0 The discs in my lower back have now mostly disintegrated after years of heavy lifting.) \n \n \n \n REST your back, but do it properly.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how:\u00a0 Lie on the floor with your lower legs and feet resting on a sofa.\u00a0 Make sure that your bottom is close to the sofa and your entire spine is aligned.\u00a0 This might require a small towel being placed behind your head to make sure your neck is perfectly straight.\u00a0 You should have no pain in this position. \n \n \n \n While you're down there, reach your arms straight up to release the tension in your shoulders. \u00a0Push up with flexed wrists and hold, then release. \n \n \n \n \n \n I'm sure you have heard this adage before, but in an airplane, they always tell you to put the oxygen mask on yourself before your child, in the event of decompression in the cabin. \u00a0So, remember to always look after yourself first and often, so that you can hang in there for the long term giving care. \u00a0Stretch and strength - that's the wisdom of Auntie Nellie. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VOUpA4neEI8/UGDPFUpGWKI/AAAAAAAAAYU/WP4pQPq22ig/s1600/standstretch.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DGbnu1L7JyE/UGDQDUuH55I/AAAAAAAAAYc/GeKWKI8wZsw/s1600/startingpos.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jL6yrd9EqXA/UGDQ_U_wkwI/AAAAAAAAAYk/th15icJIETA/s1600/forward.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8Q-QSRbAUT8/UGK1lFRC64I/AAAAAAAAAZA/ofLytqjTx2Q/s1600/lyingstretch.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_IlAjzIiOAE/UGK2NT3-4XI/AAAAAAAAAZI/1Hd6mz4s5gI/s1600/handstretch.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/09/the-wisdom-of-auntie-nellie-stretch-for.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n Continued.... this is Part 2 of a reflection on fairness in policymaking for family caregivers. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n So, what are the roles of families and governments in supporting society\u2019s most vulnerable citizens?\u00a0 What kinds of policies can facilitate true partnership between governments and families who seek to care for someone needing help?\u00a0 One such policy is the groundbreaking Canadian Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP).\u00a0 In the late 1990s, Al Etmanski of PLAN called me and told me of his idea to create a fund for people with disabilities.\u00a0 I remember saying \u201cI have a savings plan for my daughter\u2019s university\u2026.why can\u2019t I have a savings plan for Nicholas\u2019 future?\u201d\u00a0 Hundreds, if not thousands of parents chimed in to a national conversation about financial tools that could transform the lives of people with disabilities from victims and consumers of tax dollars to contributing participants in our market economy and masters of their own destinies. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  The RDSP was announced in the Canadian federal budget of 2007 and our family has one now for Nicholas.\u00a0 Previous to this plan, families had no tax sheltered savings vehicle that could be used specifically for the future of a loved one with disabilities.\u00a0 Furthermore, if someone received government disability pension benefits every month, they were not allowed to have more than $5,000 in assets.\u00a0 A friend whose daughter had recently turned 18 was forced to sell back her daughter\u2019s prepaid funeral plan in order for her to qualify for disability pension benefits \u2013 the funeral plan was worth more than $5,000.\u00a0 This \u201call government\u201d or \u201call private\u201d finance thinking ensured that people with disabilities were effectively poor and had limited choices in terms of their discretionary spending.\u00a0 The thinking was that anyone who had private finances, yet was in receipt of government benefits, was guilty of welfare fraud. \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To be disabled and accept financial assistance from the state meant you had to be poor, or at least be SEEN to be poor.\u00a0 The RDSP, on the other hand, is a new savings plan that will assist families in planning for the long-term financial security of their relative with a disability.\u00a0 Over time, it is estimated that the RDSP will provide billions of dollars to supplement income, enable home ownership, and enhance quality of life for as many as 500,000 Canadians with disabilities.\u00a0 The plan is similar to an education savings plan, in that contributions remain tax-free until withdrawal.\u00a0 There are no annual limits on contributions, but there is a lifetime limit of $200,000, and these funds can be contributed by any family member or friend.\u00a0 There are no restrictions whatsoever on how the funds are used by the beneficiary, and when funds are withdrawn, they are taxed in the hands of the beneficiary at a much lower rate.\u00a0 For lower and middle-income families, the federal government will contribute to the plan as well through the Canada Disability Savings Grant.\u00a0 For families with an income less than $77,664, the grant will contribute $3 for every $1 contributed on the first $500 and subsequently $2 for every dollar on the next $1,000.\u00a0 If the family income is over $77,664, the government will match dollar for dollar up to $1,000. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 But those families with little or no capability to contribute to the plan are not excluded.\u00a0 When annual income is less than $21,816, the Canada Disability Savings Bond will provide $1,000 per year without any contribution from the family at all.\u00a0 Currently, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Yukon, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Ontario have all exempted the RDSP as an asset and income when determining eligibility for disability pension benefits.\u00a0 Quebec, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have exempted the RDSP as an asset and partially tax exempted payments from the plan.\u00a0 Nunavut has not yet made a decision on the plan. \u00a0 \n \n   \n \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Of course, just having savings does not make someone happy or keep them safe.\u00a0 In fact, someone who has the combination of learning difficulties and ready cash is even more vulnerable to exploitation.\u00a0 Furthermore, someone who is in need of social care is likely to have very limited means of converting his funds into good living.\u00a0 This is where personal networks come in to the picture of support.\u00a0 The PLAN values state clearly that people who have disabilities or are otherwise suffering from the effects of social exclusion need money AND caring friends to create a good life.\u00a0 Personal support networks consisting of family and friends who are coordinated in their caring tasks can fulfill a trustee role, ensuring accountability and transparency.\u00a0 The idea of distributive justice is difficult to apply when families who care for an aging parent or child with disabilities are so isolated.\u00a0 When my mother in law knew that we were struggling desperately with Nick\u2019s ill health, she used to say \u201cNow if there\u2019s anything I can do\u2026but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d.\u00a0 She was a kind person who was completely flummoxed by the scale of what might be required to be helpful.\u00a0 But when I asked for a banana loaf or company in Nicholas\u2019 hospital room, she was only too happy to oblige.\u00a0 The carving up of a gigantic need into small, do-able parts is the trick here.\u00a0 Ensuring that no one person is burdened by the lion\u2019s share of dependency work is key, alongside a shared and celebratory love for the person at the heart of the network. \u00a0 \n \n   \u00a0 Fiscal policies such as the RDSP that allow people to save without penalty, spend as they wish and participate in community life with the assistance of state funded services constitute the elements that allow people with disabilities to convert financial assets to good living. \u00a0 \n \n   So, in Canada families like mine finally have a financial tool to plan a decent future for their loved with a disability.\u00a0 Friends and extended family can help too.\u00a0 That\u2019s the good news.\u00a0 The bad news is that governments are scratching their heads wondering how to fund exploding social and health care budgets.\u00a0 The demographics of aging populations in developed nations around the world are the culprits.\u00a0 A US Census Bureau report of July 20, 2009 is full of terrifying numbers.\u00a0 Italians are advised to look away now: their country\u2019s population will in the space of thirty years shrivel dramatically, while numbers of elderly women will outstrip every other country on the planet.\u00a0 Emigration is sapping that nation of its employable youth and huge numbers of pensioners have all but bled the state coffers dry.\u00a0 (The Guardian, July 21, 2009 pg.17)\u00a0 In Great Britain, politicians and academics alike are busy inventing new ways of injecting private funds into pension funds to pay for the looming long term care crisis.\u00a0 Young Britons are not saving, given the current recession which comes on the heels of a borrowing and spending frenzy over the previous decade.\u00a0 At a roundtable of economists and accountants hosted by the Lord Mayor of London Ian Luder in September of 2009, Professor Ian Mayhew of the Cass Business School reviewed the gloomy UK demographics and proposed a radical solution to funding seniors\u2019 care.\u00a0 He noted that although life expectancy is increasing (especially among females), it is estimated that about ten years at end of life are spent with some form of disability.\u00a0 (Mayhew and Smith, 2009) In other words, people are living longer, but not without suffering all the effects of very old age.\u00a0 \u201cIntuitively as the health care system becomes more successful at lengthening life the possibility of greater social care needs is increased, insofar as any extra years are spent in poor health have limiting effects on activities of daily living, or lead to the greater occurrence of other diseases such as dementia.\u00a0 Such trends have the capacity to significantly affect the UK economy.\u201d (Mayhew 2009)\u00a0 No western democracy is immune from the problem.\u00a0 Governments in all developed nations are considering raising the age of pension eligibility, if they haven\u2019t already done so.\u00a0 Australia has introduced a compulsory pension scheme and other countries are watching closely how that initiative plays out. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n In Canada, health, social care and education are matters under provincial jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n My family experience has been in the province of Ontario, but federal guidelines are such that in principle at least, there shouldn\u2019t be too much difference in standards of decent support across the country.\u00a0 In light of a proposed reinvented public/private partnership between government and families, what exactly should be the bottom line expectation of provincial governments?\u00a0 I believe \u201cadequacy\u201d is the correct response here.\u00a0 Charles Taylor\u2019s notion of lower functioning and higher functioning is helpful yet again.\u00a0 Governments should ascertain what is required to support individuals\u2019 lower functioning.\u00a0 This should include mobility equipment, nursing services as currently identified for medically complex care such as patients on ventilators, and of course residential care facilities for acute and long term care patients.\u00a0 The state has a duty to partner with families to provide and pay for these matters of basic living. Higher functioning activities such as personal relationships, social outings, pursuing interests and offering civic contributions should be enabled by friends and family on a private basis.\u00a0 But these activities do not come free, and often in cases like my own family, require armies of people to carry out.\u00a0 Similarly with the aged, we must find ways of including the less able into our community life that will not bankrupt families and drive their primary caregivers to an early grave.\u00a0 Governments have a responsibility to enable active citizenship and the benefits of altruism \u2013 secondary schools in Ontario are doing this by requiring community service of their students.\u00a0 Some corporations reward their employees who volunteer.\u00a0 The Institute for Canadian Citizenship embraces the value that \u201cwe believe that citizenship requires that one take responsibility for others\u201d ( www.icc-icc.ca/en/about/index.html ).\u00a0 Co-founders of that Institute Adrienne Clarkson and John Ralston Saul told me that members of local citizenship committees befriend new Canadians and provide examples of civic contributions that are part and parcel of being a good Canadian.\u00a0 But contributions reap rewards and new citizens are given a Cultural Access Pass for one year\u2019s family admission to publicly funded cultural institutions.\u00a0 Currently, the scheme operates only in Toronto, but is set to expand to other regions across the country.\u00a0 This ethic of community giving and receiving is an example of a programme that forges a connectedness between people that if extended, will benefit vulnerable and isolated citizens as well.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NyOjDoUVTQY/UHrOrVWsP2I/AAAAAAAAAa4/M88Lf6S33kM/s1600/rdsp.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hkedv_-84v0/UHrPgVp-evI/AAAAAAAAAbA/brZ9eICOtLs/s1600/rdsp2.jpg", "http://www.icc-icc.ca/en/about/index.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/10/fairness-in-policymaking-for-family.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \nRecently, I received an email requesting a guest blogger spot on the subject of caregiving for people suffering from Mesothelioma, a type of cancer often caused by exposure to asbestos. \u00a0This got me thinking that perhaps we should do a mini-series based on caring for various cancers. \u00a0Perhaps a series devoted to caring that is specific to different conditions generally. \u00a0What do you think? \n \nHere is the first instalment of a series of posts that will appear from time to time devoted to the type of care specific to various conditions.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n What is Mesothelioma? \n \n Mesothelioma is rare type of cancer that affects the meothelium-the thin, protective membrane that covers the lungs, heart, and other internal body organs. The disease is mostly caused by asbestos exposure. \n \n The Difference Between Caring for Seniors and Mesothelioma Patients \n \n Whether they are parents or grandparents or even spouses or aging friends, many people care for seniors at some point in their lives. It\u2019s quite common for people to help their older loved ones with basic medical needs or simple tasks around the house. \n \n But few people ever have the experiencing of caring for a mesothelioma patient. \n \n Mesothelioma  patients are almost always seniors, and they typically have many more care requirements than the average older adult. Their health condition can become heavily symptomatic in a short amount of time, and caregivers may need to add on new responsibilities on a regular basis. Caregivers also have the task of helping mesothelioma patients cope with pain, fatigue and breathlessness. \n \n Unlike seniors who are dealing with the natural aging process, mesothelioma patients often have to cope with physiological difficulties associated with a terminal cancer diagnosis. They may struggle with feelings of isolation, loneliness and fear. As a result, caregivers may need to provide a higher level of emotional support.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n Types of Care that Mesothelioma Patients Need from their Caregiver \n \n As their cancer progresses and taking care of themselves gets increasingly difficult, many mesothelioma patients rely on their caregivers for hygienic assistance. Here, caregivers often provide the same types of care as they would provide to any other senior.\u00a0 \n \n They can help patients get dressed, shower, brush their teeth or comb their hair. Caregivers may also provide bathroom assistance. \n \n Caregivers often help mesothelioma patients with personal tasks as well. Typically, as the cancer progresses, it becomes more difficult for patients to handle responsibilities such as driving, making appointments, running errands and keeping the house tidy. When caregivers assume their new role, they often spend a good portion of their day helping the patient keep up with these tasks. \n \n Generally, caregivers are not responsible for providing medical care to mesothelioma patients. The health care services that help mesothelioma patients should typically be performed by a licensed medical professional. Caregivers can, however, help patients remember to take their medications or change the tanks on an oxygen system.\u00a0 \n \n Caregivers will have to work with the patient to help them stay comfortable when symptoms become stronger. In some cases, caregivers can provide supplemental oxygen to patients who are struggling to breathe. In other cases, caregivers offer more general palliative care, such as positioning the patient in a way that helps open up their airways.\u00a0 \n \n To help mesothelioma patients relax, caregivers may want to guide patients through visualization exercises or other calming techniques. They can also encourage patients to stay active in support groups, yoga classes or other stress-relieving activities. \n \n Caregivers may also benefit from attending these activities with their patient. Mesothelioma caregiving\u00a0can be a challenge \u2013 but with the proper outlets for diffusing the stress, it can be a smooth, rewarding experience! \n \n Author bio: Faith Franz researches and writes about health-related issues for The Mesothelioma Center.

{"date": "", "body": "\nThis is the first in a mini-series about how the senses are used in caregiving. \u00a0Today's subject: TOUCH \n \n \n \n \n \nOne of the benefits of caregiving, I believe, is that we touch the people we love more than the average, busy working person.  \n \nYoung parents know the primal satisfaction of touching their new baby. \u00a0But when children grow up, sometimes opportunities for touch fall victim to long hours at the office and busy after-school agendas. \u00a0Caregivers never lose the opportunity for intimacy through caring touch. \n \nMy son Nicholas turned 24 last week, but throughout his life, I have performed his care, helped him play with toys by holding his hand in mine. \u00a0I have held his head as he struggled to sip a drink or eat a sandwich without choking. \u00a0I held him when he was a baby, and when he grew, I kept on holding him.  \n \nWhen Nick developed a dislocated hip, he had surgery to rebuild the broken joint. \u00a0Because he was medically complex, he was sent immediately to the intensive care ward after the operation. \u00a0Jim, my husband, and I waited for him there and when he was wheeled on a gurney to his ICU bay, still sleeping, I gently placed my hands on his arm and silently willed healing, relaxation, and pain relief into him with all my might.  \n \nWhen my mother in law was lying in hospital and we knew that the end was coming, I had the privilege of massaging her arms and legs with moisturizing creams as we chatted.  \n \nThe touch inherent in my own caregiving has given me a deeper appreciation of how touching and being touched can excite, bond, relax, reassure and inspire. \n \nTouching someone we love is deeply wonderful and we caregivers are reminded of that every day. \u00a0It's just one of the benefits of the job.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z0Szab7malM/UEa55P_lskI/AAAAAAAAAUw/N2NcWhZy7lA/s1600/hug.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/09/the-caregivers-six-senses-today-is-touch.html", "title": ""},

Last week, I received such a message - this time from a father of a young boy with disabilities. \u00a0I was so touched by his sparse, heartfelt and heartbroken prose. \u00a0Ironically, I recently wrote a blog post questioning whether caregiving was 'women's work'. \u00a0One friend, a longtime carer of her two adult sons with multiple disabilities wrote to me privately after that post, \"I think women are nurturers and men are gatherers\". \u00a0Certainly, there are differences between the way individuals give and receive care. \u00a0Perhaps the caring capacities of the sexes are not so easy to categorize.  Julie Drury is an online friend with a new blog and a compelling story to tell. \u00a0I strongly identify with her modus operandi. \u00a0 This from  Julie's blog :\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I have been told that I am 'strong' and that I am 'brave' and that others could not do what I do. I am not sure that is true. I say I am not sure - because maybe I am different. I don't often cry when KK is in crisis, or when we receive bad news. I have always had a way of adding that information to my knowledge of KK's disease and moving forward. It doesn't immediately go to my heart and to my soul where I can be so seriously wounded that I might not have the ability to focus on what is important. KK. I worry that if I let the emotion overtake me\u00a0I will miss something important. \n \n And now this from Ed, my online friend who is a Dad. \u00a0Is there an in-between space that we can live - allowing ourselves to feel the natural woundedness without losing our steely, action imperative? \n \n \n \n \n \n In His Shadow \n \n \n \n Fathers and sons, the relationships can be complex. As a boy grows into man, a son will seek to find out what his place is in the world.\u00a0 He will try to define himself separately from his father.\u00a0 He seeks independence and a means to forge his own path. \u00a0 Few sons choose to live in the shadow of their father. \n \n \n \n In my case, I find myself in the shadow of my own son \u2013 Rodrigo.\u00a0 Rodrigo is 4 years old.\u00a0 He is a sweet natured boy who has a developmental disability.\u00a0 He can walk. He likes to climb. He falls down a lot.\u00a0 He is full of smiles and energy.\u00a0 I talk to him but he does not talk to me.\u00a0 He does not understand what I am saying. I hope one day that he does but I don't know if he ever will. Rodrigo has been diagnosed with a developmental disability, epilepsy and cerebral palsy.\u00a0 Rodrigo's days are spent exploring a world that he does not completely understand.\u00a0 In his world, he perceives no danger.\u00a0 His curiosity guides him. \u00a0 I spend my days chasing after him making sure he does not get hurt. I am not only in his shadow.\u00a0 I have become his shadow. \n \n \n \n Rodrigo loves to explore.\u00a0 When he enters a room, he will move around and seemingly reach, mouth, and touch everything.\u00a0 His curiosity seems unquenchable.\u00a0 He is cute. When he meets people, they invariably smile.\u00a0 They will say to hi to him.\u00a0 They will ask him for a hi-5.\u00a0 He will take no notice and want to climb up on to them. He loves everyone. I am there always to make sure he does not disturb them. It is at these times the shadow looms large. \n \n \n \n Our home is Rodrigo proof. We have gates on all the stairs - both up and down.\u00a0 We have all the cupboards locked.\u00a0 When at home, the shadow Rodrigo casts is not so dark. At home, I watch him vigilantly and ensure he does not get into any trouble.\u00a0 However, when we go visiting to other people's homes, the shadow re-emerges.\u00a0 At parties, I find myself with my boy playing with children and making sure he is entertained and not hurting others. I spend very little time talking to other adults. His shadow is always there to grab, guide and lurch to ensure he causes no harm to himself or others. \n \n \n \n I spend days chasing after my boy. My time is not my own. I have become the shadow of a 4 year old boy who in his own way is trying to understand his world. His world becomes my world. Because my time is not my own, I sometimes lose sight of who I am. I am getting lost in his shadow. \n \n \n \n Rodrigo gives me lessons about time.\u00a0 He teaches me about the past.\u00a0 A past where I had the abundance of time but which I now realize may have been misspent.\u00a0 He teaches me about the future.\u00a0 A future where I will not exist and the needs of my boy will need to be looked after by someone else. He teaches me about the present and the importance of the now.\u00a0 He teaches me to take advantage of the moment and to doing things immediately when the opportunity is offered.\u00a0 He also teaches me to cherish my time with him.\u00a0 He is my boy and he offers my wife and I so much love and happiness. Our only hope is to keep him happy and for him to reach his full potential whatever that may be.\u00a0 We do what we can to keep him stimulated and engaged in his world. \n \n \n \n I have read that to have a child with a disability also disables a family.\u00a0 The life that one thought they would lead disappears and it is changed forever.\u00a0 The unplanned life is much harder.\u00a0 Most things that were taken for granted such as going for a bike ride, going shopping, or even having a quiet dinner becomes bigger and more challenging.\u00a0 Most families with a disabled child will in one way or another struggle. Inevitability, you will make comparisons between your situation and another family's plight. You find yourself saying how lucky that family with a child with Down syndrome is because their child can communicate.\u00a0 At other times, you count your blessings because your child is not wheelchair bound and is generally happy and smiles unlike that family with the child with autism.\u00a0 Everything is relative. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n However, having a child with a disability does put you in special place.\u00a0 Unlike many of life's tragedies or challenges, a disability in a child is on-going. A child with a disability will not only last a lifetime it will last beyond your own.\u00a0 Planning for a future where you are not around becomes very important early on. \n \n \n \n I know to help my son I must ensure I help myself.\u00a0 To survive and endure and to make sure Rodrigo is always looked after. I need to regain control of my time.\u00a0 A friend of mine recently wrote to me that my wife and I do a terrific job in caring for our children but not to forget to take care of the adults who care for him.\u00a0 This is true.\u00a0 To do this, you need to look beyond yourself and your own immediate family. You need to ensure that time is dedicated to other members within the family.\u00a0 The burden of caring for a child with a significant disability must be shared with anyone that is willing to lend a hand.\u00a0 Pride has no place here.\u00a0 So we look to friends, to extended family, and the community at large to obtain help. We seek out this assistance to endure in the long run and to ultimately ensure that our son, Rodrigo, flourishes.\u00a0 Breaking down is not an option. \n \n \n \n We find ways to cope and to survive.\u00a0 I am my son's shadow.\u00a0 However, I know for the benefit of my son and myself that in time I will have to step outside of his shadow and learn to cast my own again. \n \n \n \n ---------------------------- \n \n Rodrigo lives with his shadow in Toronto. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Walls-My-Freedom/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347546850&sr=8-1&keywords=the+four+walls+of+my+freedom", "http://searchingforsolidfooting.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kQablYKFOx8/UFHw36dmGwI/AAAAAAAAAWY/aTmCDzBN0KM/s1600/shadow.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/09/fathers-sons-and-in-between-spaces-of.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \nIn April of 1975, I had a summer job at a tiny jewellery shop in Montreal. \u00a0One Friday, I reluctantly left our house to open the shop - my Dad was dying in the hospital and that day, I found it hard to gather the energy to speak to strangers about rings and necklaces. \u00a0Dad had been disabled by several strokes for a couple of years, but now he lay in a coma - felled by a recent and final catastrophic brain aneurism.  \n \nAnyway, that day, just after lunch, I was suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling of dread and anxiety. \u00a0I had to close the shop and go to my father. \u00a0I was a young girl who was responsible, obedient and utterly unused to the sort of decision-making that would lead me to close someone else's business on a whim. \u00a0I was hurriedly closing the cash register when a young man entered the shop, the sunlight streaming in the door behind him. \u00a0\"I'm sorry, I have to close the shop now\", I said, \"The shop is closed.\" \u00a0He began to make enquiries and when I quickly explained, he offered gently, \"My father recently passed away at the same the hospital. \u00a0I will drive you there now, I'm happy to help.\" \n \nI sat with my Dad that afternoon, watching my Dad's chest rising and falling in time with the black accordion inside the respirator machine by his bedside. \u00a0From time to time, the breathing would pause and a light labelled 'sigh' would blink. \u00a0I sighed too. \u00a0I talked to my Dad that day, telling him about the young man who drove me to the hospital that day and about my hopes and dreams as well as the minutiae of my everyday life.  \n \nLater that day at home, the phone rang. \u00a0It was my mother calling from the hospital. She was crying, asking \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \u00a0\"Why didn't I tell you what?\" I asked her. \u00a0\"Dad has twenty minutes to live and you were just here, why didn't you tell me?\" \u00a0But I hadn't known that my father would die that day. \n \nI have often thought of these events in the many years that have passed since they occurred. \u00a0Was the young man who drove me to the hospital some kind of an angel? \u00a0Did my sense of foreboding that impelled me to close the shop mean that I felt a kind of extra-sensory connection to my Dad that day? \u00a0Did Dad 'tell' me to come so that I could say goodbye?  \n \nSometimes people we love talk to us in silent ways, if we are lucky, and if we are listening. \u00a0When my son Nicholas was little, he frequently woke crying. \u00a0Sometimes he would need repositioning or other attention as often as every twenty minutes. \u00a0I remember that sometimes, I would wake on my own, in a quiet house. \u00a0I would tense because I knew that Nick would sense my wakefulness and call out to me. \u00a0How I longed to be left alone in the quiet to go back to sleep! \u00a0But I felt that some string with paper cups for listening connected our rooms and he would KNOW that I was awake. \u00a0He always knew.  \n \n \n \n \n \nNow that Nicholas is living away from home for the first time, I find myself worrying that I might not know if he needs help. \u00a0Is the listening line somehow broken? \u00a0Maybe it is, a little. \u00a0The last few times that he had a crisis, I confess that I didn't sense anything wrong. \u00a0The urgent calls took me be surprise.  \n \nThe state of acute listening that caregivers employ can be called telepathy. \u00a0It can be called listening by the total self or deep connectedness to another. \u00a0Whatever you want to name it, that cord of unspoken communication is the very core of intimacy. \u00a0Not very many people ever experience it - but caregivers often do. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZsuxz51shk/UE6Ljd-O4bI/AAAAAAAAAWA/bQ_RxaE5fVc/s1600/M8730063-Extra-sensory_perception_test-SPL.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O6_JbAsL328/UE58p6aICpI/AAAAAAAAAVo/fFZ8-GhI2NU/s1600/paper+cup+telephone.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/09/listening-loving-and-esp.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nI used to be an actor... and a director. \u00a0In fact, when Nicholas was born, I was working for a horse-drawn theatre called  The Caravan Stage Company  (the Caravan has since traded their clydesdales for a tall ship). \u00a0Now, after 23 years of looking after my children, I remain fascinated by storytelling on the stage, or even what might be called theatre in unusual spaces. \u00a0I adore contemporary storytelling, especially when it speaks to me about things that I know deeply but rarely talk about. \u00a0There are two such theatrical works that I would like tell you about today - I haven't seen them, but I find their premises compelling for our community of caregivers. \n \nThe first is a play that was 'performed' at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival last summer (2011). \u00a0It's called \" The Pleasure of Being: Washing, Feeding, Holding... \" \u00a0The play consists of one actor and one audience member - and yes, it is played out in silence and involves the actor bathing the audience member (bring your bathing suit!), followed by a long session of holding and being held.  \n \nHere is the  review from the Edinburgh Fringe : \n \n \n This one-on-one hotel room experience is Adrian Howells\u2019 attempt at total care for a single audience member. It starts with a warm bath filled with rose petals. I undress and step in. \u2018It\u2019s my honour to bathe you,\u2019 Howells says, with no hint of insincerity. He lathers up a sponge and starts to wash my face, torso, arms and legs. Afterwards I\u2019m wrapped in a dressing gown and taken to a pre-prepared duvet nest for a snuggling session. \n \n \n \n \n \n It makes you realise that in adult life most individuals don\u2019t get the opportunity to be truly pampered. I could book into a spa, but after I\u2019d received an all-over body scrub it\u2019s unlikely it would be followed by 15 minutes of tender cuddling. Also, Howells seems to be saying, some people don\u2019t receive any cuddling at all in their lives: not from a professional, not from a partner, not from a parent. His offer is a rare half-hour of someone\u2019s undivided attention and affection. An experience of almost unconditional love that feels like it could be a form of modern therapy for the isolated individual. \n \n But, I think to myself, as I\u2019m lying in the bath covered in petals, there has to be a catch. Everyone brings to this show his or her own set of connotations. I bring a healthy amount of reviewer\u2019s cynicism. I wanted to give myself up to the pleasure and warmth of human contact. But I didn\u2019t feel loved, or even decadent. I thought, instead, of a time when I might not be able to wash myself any more. I thought of my elderly grandparents, and how my parents used to bathe them. That love was truly unconditional. This is just a simulation \u2013 a performance. \n \n Or is it? I don\u2019t for a second feel as if Howells is playing a part. When he hugs me goodbye it\u2019s a real hug. I think about him repeating these intimate moments over and over. Giving away something so much more significant than a therapist \u2013 giving away what feels like a two-way emotional connection for the price of a Fringe ticket. Is he doing it purely for the thrill of participatory theatre, or for deeper reasons? \n \n There\u2019s a moment when I\u2019m lying against his chest when I remember what it was like to be a kid. But this memory jars against the reality of what\u2019s happening. As a child I felt safe because my parents looked after me, and their reasons for doing so were the simplest on earth. In this setting I\u2019m not quite sure what Howells\u2019 reasons are. \n \n Perhaps I should have asked him. But the time seems to run out very quickly. Howells makes it clear that there\u2019s no wrong way of experiencing The Pleasure of Being \u2026 It\u2019s true that your enjoyment of it will depend on what you bring to it. What\u2019s certain is that the show (if you can call it that) creates an incredibly knotted and intriguing performer/audience relationship. I don\u2019t leave feeling relaxed, but I do leave questioning my own definition of the performance, which is testament to how bold and unique this is as a piece of creative work. \n \nI have no idea how to rate this show, as I haven't experienced it personally. \u00a0But I do give the artist kudos for exploring themes of giving care with people who do not walk along our path. \u00a0 \n \nAnother just plain terrific show that I haven't yet seen (sigh) is \" Private Dancer\" by the Scottish artist Janice Parker.  \u00a0I met Janice when we lived in England and she showed me a video of show on her laptop. \u00a0It was dance theatre of the first order, but with a difference. \u00a0Janice Parker explains on her website: \n \n Private Dancer\u00a0 takes place in and around a specially designed and purpose built \u2018house\u2019, a realistically scaled luminous installation, containing 5 different rooms. Each room is filled with personal memorabilia and objects belonging to a solo disabled dancer, who inhabits and performs there to an audience of one. \n \n \n \n \n \n A dance that is never seen, alone at home we give it our all our best moves, our best performance ever. In this rare glimpse of a personal world, you\u2019ll be entertained to a host of good music, see some very fine dancing and be offered the treat of watching alone. We might let you in\u2026\u2026 \n \n \n \nWatch the  video on the website  to get a feel for the intimacy of someone with a disability dancing for an audience of one - it is remarkable. \u00a0 \n \nI am thrilled that artists are exploring our world, the world of giving care to people we love. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.caravanstage.org/", "http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/37152-the-pleasure-of-being-washing-feeding-holding/", "http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/37152-the-pleasure-of-being-washing-feeding-holding/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TiVaTgRYLkU/UFZkShsUqJI/AAAAAAAAAWw/1FJizZMSaxI/s1600/adrianhowellsthepleasureofbeingbyniallwalker-067-lst088212-1.jpg", "http://janiceparker.co.uk/about/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PNElMrx5QRQ/UFZlhJaOV-I/AAAAAAAAAW4/wG01X6tRUWw/s1600/FireShot+capture+%23209+-+'Private+dancers,+snails+and+ketchup+as+Olympic+Games+take+artistic+turn+-+Scotsman_com+Sport'+-+sport_scotsman_com_entertainment_Private-dancers-snails-and-ketchup_6165270_jp.png", "http://janiceparker.co.uk/privatedancer/about/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/09/how-artists-talk-about-caregiving.html", "title": ""},

In our normal lives, we see ourselves as members of a variety of groups \u2013 we belong to all of them. The same person can be, without any contradiction, a Norwegian citizen, of Asian origin, with Bangladeshi ancestry, a Muslim, a socialist, a woman, a vegetarian, a jazz musician, a doctor, a poet, a feminist, a heterosexual, a believer in gay and lesbian rights, and one who believes that many of the most important problems that Norway faces today could be resolved if Norwegians could be made to take an interest in the game of cricket. Each of these identities can be of significance to the person, depending on the problem at hand and the context of choice, and the priorities between them could be influenced by her own values as well as by social pressures. There is no reason to think that whatever civilizational identity a person has \u2013 religious, communal, regional, national or global \u2013 must invariably dominate over every other relation or affiliation he or she may have. \n \n From:  Violence, Identity and Poverty \n \n Amartya Sen  Journal of Peace Research  2008; 45; 5 ( http://jpr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/1/5 ) \n \n \n \n So, what does this mean for our community?\u00a0 For me, it means that I am not just a caregiver - I am a mother, a daughter, an actor, an author, a social justice activist, a blogger, a sister, a Canadian and a theatre lover.\u00a0 My son Nicholas is a blogger, an ice hockey fanatic, a friend, a son, a brother, a Liverpool football club supporter, a Canadian, an internationalist and is a recipient of complex nursing care.\u00a0 My mother is an Anglophone Quebecer, a lover of Kennebunkport in Maine, a keeper of memories in our family, a party-girl, a mother, a feminist and a reluctant senior citizen.\u00a0 Let\u2019s push this envelope a little further now.\u00a0 My friend\u2019s father who suffers from dementia (despite his memory loss) is STILL a father, a husband, a joker - he is a former football player and a former school principal.\u00a0 His loving family keeps all the \u2018former\u2019 roles alive and celebrates the roles that dominate today.\u00a0 Another friend who is a wheelchair user could benefit from Sen\u2019s multiple identity idea because with the benefit of this concept, she is not simply \u2018disabled\u2019, she is an engineer with a strong interest in women and leadership. \n \n \n \n Now, there\u2019s a concept.

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis morning I was doodling around looking at online news when I noticed  this article on the business page . \u00a0\"Hmmm\", I thought, '7 Habits of Highly Effective People' could be something that applied as well to caregivers and people with disabilities. \u00a0I have never heard of  Stephen Covey , the author of a book with the same name as the article, but I'm going out to buy it. \u00a0Sadly, Covey died yesterday from injuries resulting from an earlier bicycle accident.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThese seven tips are as relevant to any good caregiver who is advocating for their ageing parent in a nursing home or for their child with disabilities at school. \u00a0But my children would benefit from Covey's wisdom as well. I am trying to nudge Nicholas toward directing his own care, understanding how to advocate for himself (which is challenging given that he is non-speaking). \u00a0But Nick is a clever guy and a great communicator. I'm going to make sure that he reads this post. \n \n \n \n In honor of renowned author\u00a0 Stephen Covey, who died this morning at age 79 , we've decided to succinctly break down the\u00a0\" 7 Habits of Highly Effective People \"\u00a0from his all-time best-selling book, which sold 20 million copies.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Here's the short version, but we\u00a0 recommend you buy his book: \n \n 1) Be Proactive \n \n As human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. We have the independent will to make our own choices and decisions, and the responsibility (\"the ability to respond\") to make the right choices. You have the freedom to choose your own fate and path, so having the independent will, imagination and self-awareness to make the right move makes you a proactive, and not a reactive, person. \n \n 2) Begin With The End In Mind \n \n Mental visualization is extremely important. Covey says that all things are created twice: first, the mental conceptualization and visualization and a second physical, actual creation. Becoming your own creator means to plan and visualize what you're going to do and what you're setting out to accomplish and then go out and creating it. Identifying your personal statement and your principles will help. \n \n 3) Put First Things First \n \n With your power of independent will, you can create the ending you want to have. Part of that comes with effective time management, which is divided into what is urgent and what is not urgent. If you deal with crises, pressing problems and deadline-driven projects first, your life will be a lot easier. \n \n 4) Think Win/Win \n \n If you believe in a better way to accomplish goals that's mutually beneficial to all sides, that's a win/win situation. \"All parties feel good about the decision and feel committed to the action plan,\" Covey wrote. \"One person's success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others.\" If you have integrity and maturity, there's no reason win/win situations can't happen all the time. \n \n 5) Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood \n \n If you're a good listener and you take the time to understand a concept, it will help you convey your opinions, plans and goals to others. It starts with communication and strong listening skills, followed by diagnosing the situation and then communicating your solution to others. \n \n 6) Synergize \n \n Synergistic communication, according to Covey, is \"opening your mind and heart to new possibilities, new alternatives, new options.\" This applies to the classroom, the business world and wherever you could apply openness and communication. It's all about building cooperation and trust. \n \n 7) Sharpen The Saw \n \n Sometimes you're working so hard on the other six habits that you forget about re-energizing and renewing yourself to sharpen yourself for the tasks in front of you. Some sharpening techniques include exercise and nutrition, reading, planning and writing, service and empathy and commitment, study and meditation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mICN7GftfCU/UAV2ckSLXAI/AAAAAAAAAQE/-aLr_qUijbs/s1600/quotes-on-success.jpg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-coveys-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-2012-7", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey", "http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/16/us/obit-stephen-covey/", "http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Restoring/dp/1417656646", "http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Restoring/dp/1417656646", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K63z0ADgrD8/UAV2yh4RzpI/AAAAAAAAAQM/prFSiDb3GSE/s1600/communication_handshake.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/07/7-habits-of-highly-effective-people.html", "title": ""},

Author Thomson does share stories from her son's life throughout to illustrate the challenges they've faced and the questions raised. But she's more interested in examining some theories of humanness, and some government policies, and making some challenges of her own in the name of justice and human rights. \n \nIs This Book for You? \n \n It's definitely for you if: \u00a0your personal story is similar to Thomson's and you're wrestling with these issues too. \n It may be for you if: \u00a0you're interested in reading about disability rights and how people with disabilities can be accommodated and valued. \n It may not be for you if: \u00a0you're uncomfortable with philosophy on disability being framed and debated solely by people without disabilities. \n It's definitely not for you if: \u00a0you're up to your ears in issues different than these and are more interested in practical advice than big thinking. \n \n \nTable of Contents \n \n The Beginning \n Amartya Sen and the Capability Approach \n Beginning to Think Differently \n A Plan for the Future \n Eldercare \n I Am Loved, Therefore I Am \n Worthy of Dignity \n Some Mother's Child \n Welcome to Holland \n Nicholas and Capability \n The Prison of Pain \n The Injustice of Pain \n Learning and Belonging \n Capable Me \n Dependency Matters \n Being Well \n Good Ideas and Practical Solutions \n \n \n Quick Quote: \u00a0\"Many parents will identify with me when I talk about Nicholas' contribution to the quality of my life, especially to my spiritual wellbeing.

{"date": "", "body": "\nOccasionally, I will read something that another person has said or written and I think, \"I just wrote about the same ideas last week! \u00a0Are some of us wired to the same computer?!\" \n \nThe new summer edition of  Abilities Magazine  features an article I wrote about a trend that I began to observe over the past year - the title of the article is \"The New Face of Eugenics: The Shocking New Trend Toward Devaluing People With Disabilities\". \u00a0Here's a snippet: \n \n \n \n In 2004, I recall telling a neighbour that my son Nicholas was very ill because of his severe disabilities and we had moved him to our hospital palliative care service.\u00a0 \u201cOh\u201d, she nodded sympathetically, \u201cI remember when we had to put our dog down, it was so hard\u201d.\u00a0 I stopped sipping my coffee and blinked. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I am reminded of that conversation because recently, I have observed a pernicious trend toward labeling some people not worthy of being considered human.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just insensitive neighbours - it\u2019s Princeton University bioethicists and animal rights activists Peter Singer and Geoff MacMahon.\u00a0 They use IQ as a yardstick for human worth and argue that people with severe cognitive disabilities have roughly the same intrinsic value as a dog or a pig.\u00a0 Now ethicists Francesca Minerva and Alberto Guilini have weighed in on the question of what kind of life constitutes personhood in a recent issue of The Journal of Medical Ethics.\u00a0 A right to life, they say, is based on a person\u2019s ability to perceive meaning in their own existence.\u00a0 \u201cMerely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life.\u201d\u00a0 They use this argument to justify \u201cafter-birth abortion\u201d (infanticide) in cases where, due to disability or even changed family economic circumstances, the killing of newborns is justified because infants have no appreciation of life or the loss of it.\u00a0 Duke University philosopher Walter Sinnott-Armstrong makes an equally frightening case in another recent issue of the same journal.\u00a0 He seeks to prove that killing in itself is not wrong. Rather, he maintains, the wrong is in the removal of abilities from another.\u00a0 This line of reasoning allows him to justify using people with severe cognitive disabilities who require life-support technologies, but who are not brain dead, as organ donors.\u00a0 Each of these arguments is frightening, but taken together, they pose a real threat to everyone, especially people with disabilities and those who love them.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n We should pay attention to these journal articles because ideas developed by philosophers and ethicists have a way of trickling down, over time, into the hearts and minds of everyday people. \n \n \n \n Today, I happened on the  blog of the esteemed disability activist and academic, Catherine Frazee.  \u00a0Here is bit of what she wrote: \n \n \n \n \n \n I\u2019ve had many occasions to voice my outrage at Robert Latimer\u2019s crime, and my horror at the wave of support that rose as his arrest and multiple trials turned through the cycles of front page news. Tracy is 19 years dead. Robert is again a free man, after 7 years in prison, and 2 \u00bd years on day parole. \n \n I have no desire to rekindle the flame of this man\u2019s still unrepentant posture that ending Tracy\u2019s life was a blameless act. My quarrel here is not with a Saskatchewan farmer, or an Ontario mother, or any other horribly misguided parent seeking to end the life of a disabled child. My quarrel is with the clich\u00e9s and platitudes that both foster and condone a very particular homicidal impulse. It is a preposterous notion that Tracy\u2019s life did not conform to the law of nature that Robert somehow epitomizes.\u00a0 The simplistic morality of pitting the \u201claw of nature\u201d against the \u201claw of a nation\u201d \u2013 the core assertion of Global\u2019s\u00a0 Taking Mercy \u00a0 \u2013 must be exposed for what it is: a fundamentally eugenic rhetoric. \n \n The Global Television special \"Taking Mercy \" to which Frazee refers aired in March of this year. \u00a0The show profiled Robert Latimer and others who defend the right of parents to murder on the basis of \"compassionate euthanasia for the severely disabled.\" \u00a0 \n \n In a letter to Global TV,  Laurie Larson, president of the Canadian Association of Community Living , wrote: \n \n There are deeply concerning shifts taking place in society whereby a 'perfect storm' of threats are increasingly making it a dangerous time to be a person with a disability.....Global's programming uncritically provided a platform for perpetuating profoundly devaluing and damaging views without regard for (the) bigger picture or providing opportunity for people with disabilities and their families to provide a different perspective. \n \n There is something happening in society when people who are watching the same puzzling picture begin to simultaneously and in isolation, figure it out. \u00a0The consensus amongst us, I believe, is that anyone who has a disability or loves someone with a disability better be on the lookout for these dangerous attitudes. \u00a0Because we can't afford not to - it's a question of life and death. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.abilities.ca/", "http://fragileandwild.com/2012/07/10/this-land-is-my-land-robert-latimer-and-the-plundered-landscape/", "http://www.globalnews.ca/taking+mercy/6442597182/story.html", "http://www.cacl.ca/news-stories/blog/cacl-president-laurie-larson-talks-about-urgent-need-families-reclaim-voice-change", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NIL0d8ufxbw/T_3BVDLvj_I/AAAAAAAAAPk/4nmo0wM4dqc/s1600/free_radicals_protest+pic_512.png"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/07/malicious-whispers-and-dangerous-trends.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday, I was listening to the radio on my drive home from Montreal. \u00a0I had driven from our cottage in the Quebec Laurentians in the early morning to join my sister because, finally, our Mum was being discharged from the hospital after a long stay. \n \nThere is a lot to do when someone's care needs change. \u00a0Although she's 90 years young, my Mum is usually very independent. \u00a0But a long stay in a hospital bed changed all that for the time being. \u00a0She will need time and TLC to get her mojo back. \u00a0In my family, we understand the ebbs and flows of independence and dependency.... and of health and frailty. \u00a0We are OK with it and we know how to put support in place and how to take it away when it becomes redundant. \u00a0We know how to have a good time in reduced circumstances and we believe in the value of that experience. \n \nSo, back to the car ride and the radio. \u00a0I was listening to a  CBC news story  that dominated yesterday's press coverage in Canada. \u00a0The Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that Canadian law banning doctor assisted suicide is unconstitutional. \u00a0In her lengthy and complicated judgement, Judge Lynn Smith wrote, \" the law must allow physician-assisted suicide in cases involving patients who are diagnosed with a serious illness or disability and who are experiencing \u201cintolerable\u201d physical or psychological suffering with no chance of improvement.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGloria Taylor is a BC woman who suffers from ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) - she spoke to reporters, representing the small group of plaintiffs who challenged the law. \u00a0Taylor argued that she wanted the choice to end her own life with dignity, rather than suffer the ravages of ALS in its last stages. \n \n \nI have written before about euthanasia - it's a complicated issue and one that is different from doctor assisted suicide. \u00a0But there was something deeply disturbing about the way that Gloria Taylor talked about her life with ALS and her reasons for challenging the law. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI will paraphrase Taylor from my memory of the radio interview: she said that she had lost the use of her legs, so now, with a power wheelchair, she could not visit her family (except for her mother who happens to have an accessible home). \u00a0The ALS was causing Taylor to lose her voice. \u00a0She expressed despondency about not being able to communicating with her children or grandchildren after the complete loss of her speech. \u00a0She said that the greatest indignity of her life was needing assistance to use public toilets (the assistive devices in her home allowed her to be independent in her own bathroom). \u00a0And Taylor's worst fear she expressed this way,\u00a0 \u201cTo die screaming at the top of my lungs because the pain is so great that I can\u2019t stand it is something I try not to think about\u201d. \n \n \n \n So, as the parent of son with complex disabilities, what do I think about all of this? \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I believe that pain should be considered separately from dependency matters. \u00a0That's one thing. \u00a0Pain management should have its own rules and the law should support patients and doctors working together in the best practice of palliative care. \u00a0No one should have uncontrolled pain, ever. \n \n \n \n To me, Gloria Taylor's remarks reveal a dangerous trend in today's society - an aversion to dependency in all its forms. \u00a0I believe that we should not support this view and certainly not entrench it into law. \u00a0Of course, any debilitating and progressive disease is a tragedy for the individual and their family, that is a given. \u00a0But life with diminished physical capabilities can be very rich, especially with the help of technology. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Let me use Nicholas as an example of how this works. \u00a0Nick's friends do not have wheelchair accessible homes, so they meet at the pub, or at sports venues. \u00a0Often, Nicholas hosts his friends and family to take maximum advantage of shared interests. \u00a0Nicholas is non-speaking, so he uses an Ipad with a software programme called  ProloQuo2Go  in order to communicate. \u00a0The adult rehabilitation in our city does a terrific job of equipping ALS sufferers with the equipment they need to communicate non-verbally. \u00a0Life with fewer physical abilities need not be tragic. \u00a0Loving relationships combined with assistive technology will see to that.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n There will always be people who believe that life is not worth living with reduced capabilities. \u00a0Even my own father felt that way after his debilitating strokes. \u00a0But our law should not enable doctors to assist suicide on the basis of increased dependency. \u00a0Rather, our laws should support society in giving value to meeting dependency needs. \u00a0Children are dependent, mothers giving birth are dependent, people aging and dying are dependent. \u00a0It's part of life and we need to support our vulnerable citizens throughout everyone's life cycle. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/06/18/bc-gloria-taylor-assisted-suicide.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8DENXjD0VJI/T-C5UTERR6I/AAAAAAAAAMc/AvxidQYrvWc/s1600/gloria+Taylor.jpg", "http://www.assistiveware.com/product/proloquo2go"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/06/kill-me-now-im-disabled-assisted.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nI guess we are all haunted sometimes by things we have done in the past. \u00a0When I was a graduating high school student, I was lucky to have a summer job. \u00a0I was hired on as a life skills teacher at a sheltered workshop for people with developmental disabilities. \u00a0The place was called \" Arc Industries \" and the 'employees' there did two types of work: some hand-stitched baseballs while others packed and sealed boxes of sanitary napkins. \u00a0My job was to teach the employees how to read a menu and order food at a restaurant and how to set an alarm clock.  \n \nI remember feeling at first quite nervous about meeting people at Arc. \u00a0Most of the people had unusual features or behaviours and I was unused to diversity back then. \u00a0Many had lived from a young age at the  Southwestern Regional Centre for people with disabilities in Blenheim , Ontario. \u00a0That centre closed in 2009, but when I worked at Arc, the year was 1972.  \n \n \n \"Blenheim\", as it was called for short. \n \n \nI remember one angry young man who arrived every day with an aura of deep resentment. \u00a0One day I asked him about his past. \u00a0\"My parents didn't want me so they paid a government official to have me placed in Blenheim. \u00a0Something you would never understand.\" \u00a0I was silenced and deeply shocked. \u00a0This young 20-something man was able-bodied... he didn't have any disability. \u00a0He had just been an unwanted baby who had the misfortune of growing up in an institution far away from anyone who could have loved him. \u00a0His acquired disability was uncontrolled anger. \n \nAnother Arc Industries employee I remember from Blenheim was a very pretty young woman who was not much older than me. \u00a0We chatted as girlfriends and it was only in my one-to-one teaching that I realized what learning disabilities actually meant. \u00a0As I tried to impart the skills necessary to setting an alarm clock, it dawned on me that the meaning of a tiny clock face representing the alarm hour had no meaning to my friend. \u00a0The more I tried to explain, the more confused I became. \u00a0We gave up and went on to discussing ordering food at a restaurant. \u00a0I asked my friend to look over a menu and decide what to order. \u00a0She glanced at the menu, looked up and said \"I'll have a hamburger and a coke\". \u00a0I realized then that this young woman had all the clever tricks of a non-reader. \u00a0I was impressed. \n \nThere was Clarence, a young man who could sew more baseballs than anyone else. \u00a0He was never paid for his skill or expertise - none of the 'trainees' were paid anything close to minimum wage.  \n \nI recall there was a girl from my high school. \u00a0The day she arrived at Arc Industries, she rushed up to me and asked, \"Do you remember me? \u00a0I went to North Park too, I graduated! \u00a0They sent me here, it's a terrible mistake. \u00a0Can you help me? \u00a0You have to help me!\" \u00a0I was 17 years old and I said, \"Maybe this is an opportunity.\" I was thinking, adults don't make mistakes. \u00a0But of course, they do. \u00a0The adults in this woman's life made the mistake of never telling her that she was not actually keeping up with her fellow students. \u00a0No one had ever told her that she had a learning disability and what that meant to her future aspirations of a working and family life.  \n \nI remember these young people with their talents, their canny abilities to work around various disabilities, their anger, their deeply envious and resentful gazes. \u00a0I also remember the gentle Clarence and the sweetness of the staff, especially the cafeteria ladies. \u00a0There was kindness and great affection for each person who filled their tray at lunchtime. \n \nThroughout my university career, I worked summers in the field of disability. \u00a0I have memories that are so poignant now. \u00a0I was a young girl full of good intentions. \u00a0Now, I am a seasoned Mom of 57 - I know how to ease spasm, gentle dystonic limbs into relaxation, read meaning into hand gestures and eye gaze. \u00a0I remember all my friends at Arc Industries and I wish them well. \u00a0I hope they found love and meaning in their lives.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.clbrant.com/history.php", "http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/issues/policy-issues/deinstitutionalization", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SBJVdn195t8/T9nia8g9zaI/AAAAAAAAAMA/Feg5WgU9zt4/s1600/SouthwesternRegionalCentre_Blenheim.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/06/haunting-memories.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nRecently, I was asked to contribute a piece on the subject of technology and parenting a son with disabilities for the blog http://vancouvermom.ca. \u00a0Here is what I wrote: \n \n \n \n \n Article by Donna Thomson, disability activist, author and consultant, and user of the\u00a0 Tyze \u00a0social network. \n \n\nTechnology Became an Essential Tool \n \nIn January of 1998, Eastern Canada was hit with the worst ice storm in living memory. For the better part of a week, our house in Ottawa had no electricity. At first, we thought of our quiet and chilly living room campsite as a bit of a lark. We lit candles, sitting by the wood fire and reassured ourselves with storytelling. But slowly, over several hours, I began to steal sideways looks at Nicholas. I felt I might be seeing him clearly for the first time and I was frightened. \n \n \n \n \n \nIt dawned on me that without power, I could not give my boy his tube feeds. He could not tell me his \u2018good feelings\u2019 or \u2018bad feelings\u2019 using his computer speech device. His frail body was much colder than my own. Without electricity and a myriad of assistive devices, my boy was dangerously frail and completely disabled. After waiting out the ice storm in a warm hotel, I vowed never to take technology for granted again. \n \nNow that Nicholas is 23 and the Great Ice Storm is a distant memory, I marvel at how technology has become an essential tool for well-being in our family. \n \n\nSports Media Research Analyst \n \nNicholas was two years old when he got his first switch operated toys. At four, he graduated to simple \u2018PacMan\u2019 style computer games and at aged six, he began using head switches mounted on his wheelchair to control a basic word processor. Today, Nick has a blog and an E-Bay selling business. He is proud of completing three online college courses, including one called \u201cThe Study of Sports Online\u201d. His computer is connected to his large screen television and an iPad functions as a speaking device. Nicholas is non-verbal, tube fed and largely bedridden, but his signature block on emails reads \u201cNicholas Wright, Sports Media Research Analyst\u201d. \n \nNicholas is totally dependent and requires a small army of professional caregivers, friends and family to keep him healthy and happy. For all that coordination of care and support, I rely on\u2026yes, technology! \n \n\nThe Tyze Social Network \n \n We use a brilliant online social network called Tyze, a kind of highly specialized version of Facebook. Designed to ensure personalized and wrap-around support of a vulnerable person, Tyze is completely private \u2013 it even has a vault to securely store sensitive medical documents. It bridges formal supports (doctors, therapists) with informal supports (family, close friends). I can post Nick\u2019s Christmas wish list, while the GP corresponds with Nick\u2019s nurses or me about side effects of a new anti-seizure medication. This is one tool that\u2019s been a Godsend for us. \n \nSocial network sites can be used in different ways by different people. I use social media strategically to reduce isolation and to coordinate the help of friends, family and professionals. Because I have an interest in shifting political thinking about giving and receiving care, I have a blog. I use Twitter and Facebook as well. My online tools help me understand that I am not alone in parenting a child with severe disabilities. More than that, each social network allows me a voice to influence and educate society about families like mine. I pay attention to my online friends and work at my relationships with them. Very rarely do I lazily click \u2018like\u2019 on their post when I can make a thoughtful comment. My internet friends\u00a0 are \u00a0my real friends. \n \nFor me, I look forward to more, not less, innovation in allowing me to communicate with people I care about. I have managed to create a safe, caring neighbourhood in my social network communities because I work at it. I guess I am just one of those people who is not lonely online or off \u2013 I\u2019m happy and I\u2019m grateful for my laptop. \n \n\nTyze \n \n www.tyze.com \u00a0|\u00a0 Twitter \u00a0|\u00a0 Facebook \n \n Donna Thomson began her career as an actor, director and teacher.

She is also an acclaimed author and an active blogger on her blog\u00a0 donnathomson.com .

{"date": "", "body": "\n \n \n One of the people I admire most in the care field is Alex Fox, CEO of  Shared Lives Plus  in the UK. \u00a0I met Alex about four years ago when we both attended an event - I have forgotten the speaker, but I will always appreciate meeting Alex that day. \u00a0Read his latest blog post and you will understand why I value his friendship and collaboration.\u00a0 \n \n From Alex's Blog at:\u00a0 http://alexfoxblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/a-networked-care-and-support-system/ \n \nI was asked by NESTA to put together two minutes on fixing the care system for older people. Two minutes looks about blog length to me, so here it is: \n \n Our current care system is based upon families providing care for as long as possible and then handing over to services when they can no longer cope. \n \n But families are increasingly scattered and working long hours. Care services are ever more expensive and scarce. Isolation and loneliness are increasing and are problems which services cannot fix. \n \n So what \u00a0are \u00a0the innovations needed to fix our broken care system? \n \n We hear much about the need to integrate different kinds of service. But we must go further, integrating all service responses with the informal, unpaid caring provided by families, friends and communities. \n \n We must do that not only because it is the only affordable way of meeting people\u2019s care and support needs with dignity, but also because helping older people to maintain their relationships and form new ones is just as vital to health and well being. \n \n Real relationships, unlike service transactions, are reciprocal. So to tackle isolation and loneliness effectively, we must reject the assumption that older people who need support have nothing to contribute. Instead, we must build into every service and intervention the assumption that, not only can older people contribute to and in many cases manage their own well-being, but also that they have something of value to contribute to those around them. This applies not only to early, preventative services but also to interventions for people with high levels of need. Examples include: \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 support and training for family carers who should be treated as expert partners in care \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shared Lives, in which registered Shared Lives carers share their family and community life with an older person, who may visit the Shared Lives carer rather than visiting a day centre \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Support to develop micro-enterprises, for instance, Harry and George who used to work as joiners now teach woodworking skills to other older men, in an enterprise which provides companionship to its members and makes and sells rocking horses \n \u00a0\u00a0 Homeshare, in which isolated older people with a spare room are matched with younger people who lack affordable accommodation \n \u00a0\u00a0 Tyze.org, which uses social networking technology to oil the wheels of small, real-world networks of support, which can include paid staff alongside family and friends \n \n \n Some of these innovations are very new. Some mix new technology with age old thinking. They are all part of moving services out of expensive and isolating buildings and into more inclusive communities. And all seek to meet people\u2019s needs partly by recognising that we all need to feel needed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sharedlivesplus.org.uk/", "http://alexfoxblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/a-networked-care-and-support-system/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/06/great-ideas-on-housing-support-and.html", "title": ""},

At the same time, those who oversee the system have to recognize that physician and hospital care is not sufficient in the 21st century. \n \n We need to expand the areas medicare covers \u2013 into drugs, homecare, long-term care \u2013 while at the same time limiting coverage across the board to the essentials. \n \n Universal coverage is not a synonym for unlimited, open-ended coverage. There are choices to be made. They include: \n \n \u2022As stated already, defining clearly what is covered by medicare and what is not; \n \n \u2022Paying only for what works: There are a lot of interventions that are of dubious value or that are not cost-effective. They shouldn\u2019t be covered by public insurance; \n \n \u2022Paying a lot more attention to patients with complex needs because they drive costs. One per cent of patients account for 25 per cent of costs, and 5 per cent account for half of all spending; \n \n \u2022Instituting a means test: An equitable system does not mean you have to provide equal services to all at equal cost; user fees and co-payments are not necessarily unfair, but these approaches have to be used smartly; \n \n \u2022Regulating rather than outlawing private insurance and care. One of the most important lessons we have to take from Europeans is that we need a combination of a well-regulated private system and a well-managed public system. \n \nIn my book, \" The Four Walls of My Freedom \", I wrote: \"In Canada, health, social care and education are matters under provincial jurisdiction. \u00a0My family experience has been in the province of Ontario, but federal guidelines are such that, in principle at least, there shouldn't be too much difference in standards of decent support across the country. \u00a0In light of a proposed reinvented public/private partnership between government and families, what exactly should be the bottom-line expectation of provincial governments? \u00a0I believe \"adequacy\" is the correct response here. \u00a0Governments should ascertain what is required to support individuals' lower functioning (ie the essentials of basic health and survival). \u00a0This should include mobility equipment, nursing services as currently identified for medically complex care, such as patients on ventilators, and of course community-based residential care facilities for acute and long-term care patients.\" \n \nI was thrilled to hear Picard opine that more attention should be paid to patients with complex needs because \u00a0\"if we can get them right, mostly everything else will fall into place\". \u00a0That sentiment captures perfectly the raison d'etre of my book - I wrote down our experience caring for Nicholas because I believe that we can offer lessons in how to care for vulnerable citizens more ethically and more economically. \u00a0 \n \nThe lecture hall at Canada's National Gallery of Art was packed for Picard's lecture. \u00a0We were listening to a voice of change - now, are we willing to act? \u00a0I hope so. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://andrepicard.com/", "http://www.conferenceboard.ca/conf/12-0112/default.aspx", "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/new-health/andre-picard/dragging-medicare-into-the-21st-century/article2441600/", "http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1338504875&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/05/medicare-in-21st-century-change-is.html", "title": ""},

There is no formula to being effective, Moore said, but there are tips to advocate successfully, which is one of the main objectives of his new school, AdvocacySchool.org, launched in March 2011. \n \n\"Five years ago, I suggested an established, organized, focused effort at developing the internal capacity of advocacy of nonprofit organizations, to make them more effective when dealing with government,\" Moore, 63, who has more than three decades' of experience in public policy, government relations and advocacy, said in an interview at his home in Ottawa. \n \n\"I'm kind of semi-retired now, so I decided to start it and show that it is worth continuing for a foundation, an NGO, or a university,\u201d he said. \n \nAdvocacySchool.org is a low-cost, \"virtual\" organization without classrooms or full-time staff. It offers courses online and in-person at meeting rooms and organizations' offices. The school has 23 instructors and offers more than 25 seminars for individuals, nonprofits and companies whose staff need to learn or reinforce their advocacy techniques.\u00a0 \n \nThe school's most requested seminar is \"How the system works and how to work the system,\" which focuses on \"organizing one\u2019s time, resources and issue management to legitimately influence decisions of government,\" the school's website says. \n \nMoore, according to his personal website, is also working on a soon-to-be-launched book, \u201cHow the System Works and How to Work the System.\u201d \n \nMost of the school's workshops are interactive, with instructors trying to frame a discussion and help participants fill in the blanks, Moore said. They help lobbyists think about questions like, \u201cWhat is it that I am asking for? What are my strategies?\u201d he said. \n \nTraining sessions, which can be taught via online webinars, vary in length. The shortest is an hour long and the longest a full weekend. Some organizations have taken sessions over a four-month period, Moore said. \n \n \n \n.......One of the newest workshops is, \"How to know what you want and get what you need: An advocacy workshop for families giving care.\" It is a half-day workshop that matches families \"to potential sources of assistance in their community,\" the website says. \n \nThe workshop is directly linked to one of the original objectives of the school: to focus on community, nonprofit services. \n \n \n \n.......\u00a0Moore aims to have former politicians and bureaucrats speak from 30 or more years' of experience about how to communicate with decision makers more effectively.\u00a0 \n \nOrganizations that have hired the advocacy school include the Canadian Nurses Association, the Canadian Home Care Association, and private companies seeking to train their staff, Moore said. \n \n \n \nMoore also wants to develop more materials and readings about advocacy due to \u201ca total absence\u201d of instruction and teaching materials related to organized public policy. \n \nBeyond that, a top objective for the school is to expand its advocacy training for families with disabilities so they can better access government, and the system where decisions are made, he said. \n \n\"Last December, the advocacy school went to a conference in Vancouver.

Turner painting titled \" The Fighting Temeraire \". \n \n \n \n \nThe image depicts a huge and beautiful shipped being tugged to her last Berth, to be broken up. \u00a0The tug is steam powered - the ship is not. \u00a0Mulgan uses this image as a metaphor for innovation.... sometimes we have to break apart what we know and love in order to replace it with something that is perhaps smaller and uglier. \u00a0But we must do this to truly innovate - we must have the courage to smash old systems in order to experiment with something that might have great potential for transformational change.  \n \nOften, it's austerity that pushes us to explore new ideas for getting what we need. \u00a0When budget-conscius travellers found hotels too expensive, people began ' couch surfing '. \u00a0It's now the world's largest travel community. \u00a0Another stunning example of austerity innovation is the  Aakash  tablet computer, an extremely low cost device currently being massed produced for the poorest of the world's poor and distributed free to university students in India. \n \nAccording to Mulgan, 14% of corporate budgets is spent on innovation, research and development. \u00a0But no public agency spends this kind of money to invest in change. \u00a0The question posed to the audience was \"How can 20% in health, education or social services budgets be absorbed without compromising service?\" \u00a0The traditional answer to that question is to freeze budgets and sell assets. \u00a0A creative response is to innovate at the organizational level.  \n \nFor practical examples of possible transformational change, Mulgan asked us to think about circuit economies - those sectors of public services where people in need of publicly funded assistance keep coming back for more - the recidivism of convicted criminals or people re-hospitalized after medical procedures. \u00a0In those cases, one of the great ideas spearheaded by Sir Ronnie Cohen and gaining momentum in Canada is the  social impact bond . \u00a0This investment tool pays service deliverers based on the success rate of their social impact.... the more effective the social impact (eg. lowering recidivism rates), the greater the investment in the company or agency and the greater the return to the fund investors (private individuals or governments). \u00a0It's an exciting idea and one that I believe holds great promise. \n \nMulgan talked about community asset sharing as an idea that is beginning to take hold in austerity-bound Britain. \u00a0In the economy of commitment, Mulgan says that putting responsibility into the hands of people who care most about outcomes is a good place to start. \u00a0The upkeep of parks as the responsibility of a neighbourhood was one example he gave. \u00a0Another was a fascinating response to the widespread closure of public libraries in the UK. \u00a0A national website called  Bookhopper  has sprouted up that prompts people to list the books on their own shelves at home, then share and exchange with neighbours or lend through Amazon. \u00a0Book lovers meet their neighbours and forge community ties - it's a whole lot better than closed libraries with no alternatives for free book exchanges. \n \nSo, what would be the requirements for government at all levels to change so dramatically during my lifetime?  \n \nGeoff Mulgan identifies a few prerequisites for deep, systemic change: \n \n \n \n revolutionize the way in which government makes public their costs and outcomes- eg when all heart surgeons in the UK published their post-surgical mortality rates, the worst surgeons were outed and survival rates improved. \n aggregate capital across different services based on economies of 'flow' - eg. in my last post, I blogged about the couple with disabilities in Toronto and their newborn baby. \u00a0The homecare workers assigned to the couple were not allowed to assist the parents in caring for the baby, so the Children's Aid Society threatened to remove the child. \u00a0An aggregation of funding and service to focus on the family unit would save money and deliver a service that is truly helpful. \n government must create and fund arms length think tanks to experiment with models of change and innovation. \u00a0This is what happens in the field of science, and in Social Science, models must be tested before they are rolled out to vulnerable populations. \n \n \nAudience members and those listening via podcast were invited to ask questions after the presentation. \u00a0My question was \"in the UK today, there is a greater degree of perceived and real austerity than in Canada. \u00a0What level of austerity do you believe we need in order to kick-start breaking apart our old systems and inventing new ones?\" \u00a0Mulgan replied that he doesn't believe there is a direct connection between austerity and innovation, but austerity can certainly be a driver for change. \u00a0That said, he challenged leaders to create a 'feeling of austerity' to drive innovation. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nDo our leaders, federal, provincial or local have the courage to create a 'feeling of austerity' in the cause of innovation? \u00a0I would love to hear opinions on that matter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.marsdd.com/events/details/austerity-innovation/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Mulgan", "http://www.nesta.org.uk/", "http://newsite.plan.ca/about-plan/test/al-etmanski/", "http://sigeneration.ca/people-tim-draimin.html", "http://sig.uwaterloo.ca/profile/frances-westley", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Cohen", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fighting_Temeraire", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q1qFTpRG9s/T6Z-pCSOniI/AAAAAAAAAJw/sz1BXTpwXI8/s1600/300px-Turner,_J._M._W._-_The_Fighting_Te%CC%81me%CC%81raire_tugged_to_her_last_Berth_to_be_broken.jpg", "http://www.couchsurfing.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aakash_(tablet)", "http://socialfinance.ca/social-impact-bonds", "http://www.bookhopper.com/default.aspx"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/05/austerity-and-innovation-reinventing.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nThis morning, I was sitting in my dressing gown, coffee in hand, while I perused the  Globe and Mail  on my Ipad. \u00a0A story caught my eye: \" Using Competition to Fuel Social Innovations \".  \n \nSocial innovation is a concept that Wikipedia describes as \u00a0 new\u00a0 strategies ,\u00a0 concepts ,\u00a0 ideas \u00a0and\u00a0 organizations \u00a0that meet\u00a0 social \u00a0needs of all kinds - from\u00a0 working conditions \u00a0 and\u00a0 education \u00a0to\u00a0 community development \u00a0and\u00a0 health \u00a0- and that extend and strengthen\u00a0 civil society . \u00a0 \n \n Excellence in social innovation worldwide is championed by an organization called  Ashoka  - and anyone excited about positive change in the world should google it. \u00a0The heroes of that organization are called 'Ashoka Fellows' and there are plenty from  Canada . \u00a0One is my colleague in the disability movement,  Al Etmanski . \u00a0The Ashoka Canada website describes Al's 'New Idea' as follows: \n \n Increasing numbers of disabled people are living longer and the longevity means that many will outlive their parents. Al Etmanski addresses a concern that a steadily mounting number of parents live with: \"What will happen to my son or daughter when I die\u00a0 ?\" He redirects that question to \"What does it take to make a life\u2013however long\u2013a good life?\" He offers a new way of thinking about disabilities and citizenship and new insight about how to remove the barriers to a good life. His idea helps replace parents' anxious isolation with planning that realistically contributes to their children's safety, both while the parents are still alive and after they die.Relationships are the key. In Planned Lifetime Advocacy Network (PLAN), Al and his colleagues have created an infrastructure that systematically builds community, while dismantling the obstacles inherent in the social systems that control publicly funded services for the disabled. Al sees those systems as necessary and does not seek to replace them; rather, his work parallels the public bureaucracy and holds its feet to the fire by demonstrating what else needs to be done. For example, the Burnaby Association of Mentally Handicapped in Vancouver now pays for lifetime membership in PLAN for some people to whom it provides services. Al sees this relationship as \"a good place for us.\" PLAN's ability to facilitate relationships for people who are isolated will continue to infiltrate bureaucracies and citizens' movements and a growing international constituency of families with disabled members. \n \n Al continues to innovate for Canadians with disabilities and their families - the  Canadian Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP)  is a tax sheltered savings tool that enables wealth for those like my son Nicholas, who will never be employable. \u00a0The money in Nick's RDSP is substantial and all provinces in Canada have agreed not to claw it back at tax time. \u00a0Also, the RDSP does not negatively impact provincial disability pension benefits. \u00a0The RDSP was the brainchild of Al Etmanski and it's an idea that I championed from the get-go. \u00a0 \n \n Other Ashoka fellows from Canada include Mary Gordon, founder of the Roots of Empathy and Johann Olav Koss, founder of Right to Play. \u00a0The list is inspirational.\u00a0 \n \n Everyday, the news is filled with sad or disturbing stories of violence and injustice. \u00a0But sometimes, there is a good news story that inspires and the Globe story about Ashoka and the positive power of social innovation is one.\u00a0 \n Tomorrow, I will write about how the movement for social innovation is changing Canada. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theglobeandmail.com/", "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/giving/giving-profiles/using-competition-to-fuel-social-innovations/article2417948/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategies", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizations", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_condition", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_development", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "http://www.ashoka.org/international", "http://canada.ashoka.org/fellows-map", "http://canada.ashoka.org/fellow/al-etmanski", "http://rdsp.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/05/al-etmanski-and-positive-power-of.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nToday marks the mid-point of National Nursing Week. \u00a0This year's theme identified by the  Canadian Nurses Association is \"The Health of Our Nation\" . \u00a0The  international theme  this year is \"Closing the Gap: From Evidence to Action\". \n \nThese themes speak to the heart of our family life and what nursing means to Nicholas' wellbeing. \u00a0Nick could not survive without nurses. \u00a0Each evening at 8pm, a nurse arrives in his room. \u00a0Nick's greatest medical needs are at night - once asleep, he often stops breathing because of central and obstructive apnea. \u00a0When this happens, an alarm sounds on his oxygen monitor and the nurse will reposition Nick or stimulate his face to restart his respiration. \u00a0The nurses give medications via Nick's stomach tube, they take care of his incontinence needs, and they keep him comfortable by frequently repositioning him in bed. \u00a0Nicholas' nurses make careful and copious notes about his hour by hour pain levels as well as his respiration and they monitor his vital signs especially if he is unwell. \n \nBut this is not all the nurses do. \u00a0At 8pm, Nicholas is awake and usually watching television. \u00a0He might be \u00a0cheering for his team in the Stanley Cup ice hockey finals, or watching re-runs of his Liverpool Football Club in action back in the UK. \u00a0Ask Jen, Tiffany, Karen, Crystal, Patricia or any of his nurses - they all know team scores, best players and how to trouble-shoot when the technology connecting Nick's computer to his big-screen TV goes on the fritz.  \n \nChristine is the head nurse at the facility where Nick lives. \u00a0She is in charge of all things medical for Nick and others who live with Nicholas as well as adults with disabilities residing out in the community with their families. \u00a0Christine has helped me problem solve complicated medication problems, accessing difficult-to-reach doctors and finding solutions to funding problems for equipment and medical services. \u00a0Together, Christine and I can get around pretty much any medical problem that life throws Nick's way. \n \nNicholas has had over 65 hospitalizations in his life. \u00a0We have known many nurses both for home and hospital care in Canada and the UK.  \n \nNick is a Canadian and he is healthy - he is a living example of why nurses in our country celebrate \"The Health of Our Nation\". \u00a0And he is medically complex - a testament to years of nursing notes (ie. the real story in the day of a patient) being transformed into best practice.  \n \nToday, I would like to say THANK YOU! to all Nick's nurses, those incredible individuals working now, in the past, in Canada and in the UK. \u00a0Happy National and International Nursing Week! \n \nThis photo was taken on Nick's birthday (a ball hockey tournament in Hyde Park, London, in 2010). \u00a0Melinda, Nick's nurse, is on the far right and Angela, another wonderful nurse has her hand on the cup. \u00a0Thank you Melinda and Angela, we love you! \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd this photo was snapped at the airport when we arrived in Canada last summer. \u00a0Christine, our incredible head nurse is on the left. \u00a0Thank you for everything you do, Christine! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cna-aiic.ca/en/events/national-nursing-week-2012/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nurses_Day", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r0z4Q4zpc2s/T6k-u9wb_4I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/M-SoggsvDbc/s1600/b-daylondon.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1jLWUm1PKe8/T6k_HW7IzXI/AAAAAAAAAKE/M8X8jNaMlro/s1600/photo.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/05/thank-you-to-our-nurses-national-nurses.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nToday's  Huffington Post reported on a youtube video  which has gone viral over the last 12 hours: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When Stuart Chaifetz sent his 10-year-old son to New Jersey's Horace Mann Elementary School wearing a hidden audio recorder, he couldn't have predicted what he would uncover. \n \n The move came in reaction to accusations from the school that his son Akian\u00a0 was having \"violent outbursts,\" \u00a0including hitting his teacher and teacher's aide -- claims that Chaifetz claims are against his son's \"sweet and non-violent\" nature. \n \n Akian, who has Autism, returned with a tape containing hours of apparent verbal and emotional abuse from his classroom aide and teacher -- whom Chaifetz identifies as \"Jodi\" and \"Kelly\" -- a recording which his father later\u00a0 published on YouTube . \n \n The Feb. 17 recording started with Akian's aide and the teacher, whom\u00a0 Collingswood Patch provides evidence may be Jodi Sgouros and Kelly Altenburg , respectively, based on a previously published online staff directory. \n \n The two engage in inappropriate conversations, like joking about their alcohol abuse and sex lives in front of their students -- all of whom have behavioral conditions and, according to Chaifetz, communication difficulties that prevent them from relaying the conversations to their parents. \n \nAt the time of writing this, the facebook link to the story has 109 'likes' and 49 comments. \u00a0 Every single comment was in favour of the father's actions. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nParents' gut feelings about something wrong in their child's life are very often borne out after all the evidence is in. \u00a0Clearly, it is much more difficult to gather information from a child who is non-speaking or an elderly person with dementia. \u00a0But for people who know and love someone with these handicaps, \u00a0listening and watching closely offer up clues to what may be awry in caregiving relationships. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe biggest flag in this story and others I have heard anecdotally in the parent community is a school or other institution that does not welcome unplanned visits from parents. \u00a0Open lines of communication and complete transparency should be absolute givens where the care of vulnerable people is concerned.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIn 1995, we lived in London and after two years of intensive conductive education, we were looking for another school for Nicholas. \u00a0Carole Greenaway was our educational psychologist and I remember one day visiting a special school with Carole. \u00a0We were given a tour of Grove Park and I recall asking about visiting Nick's classroom and about opportunities to volunteer at the school. \u00a0On both counts, I was told that parents were unwelcome, but could be accommodated with plenty of prior notice. \n \n \n \nWalking back to the car in the parking lot, Carole and I looked at each other and we both made a gesture of thumbs down. \u00a0Shaking our heads, we chatted about what bad things could happen to vulnerable children behind closed doors. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nToday, I asked myself whether I would want CCTV surveillance in Nicholas' room. \u00a0It didn't take me long to decide that no, we don't need it and we wouldn't want it. \u00a0I drop in to visit Nick almost every day. \u00a0If I don't visit, I call and Nicholas tells me everything, even though his speech is extremely limited. \u00a0My gut tells me that Nick's care is fantastic and every day, I feel grateful. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nBut I do not judge people who do want surveillance cameras for their vulnerable loved ones who live in institutional settings. \u00a0My next post will be about one woman who tried and failed to get the right to have cameras installed in Ontario nursing homes.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/23/stuart-chaifetz-father-wire-son-records-teacher-abuse_n_1447330.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ow891NVgikc/T5iD2UBnN1I/AAAAAAAAAIc/djY22a8-Ax4/s1600/s-AKIAN-large.jpg", "http://www.hnva.net/teacherbully/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfkscHt96R0&feature=colike", "http://collingswood.patch.com/articles/cherry-hill-dad-tells-youtube-teachers-bullied-my-autistic-son"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/surveillance-for-safety-of-people-with.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nI always listen the radio when I'm driving and today was no exception. \u00a0I was on my home from visiting Nicholas when I tuned in to a  CBC show about life in Quebec called \"C'est la vie\". \u00a0The guests were two provincial parliamentary representatives (MNAs) who had worked for two years on a non-partisan committee on palliative care. \u00a0The results of their work was a newly released report called \"Dying with Dignity\". \u00a0 \n \nIt was interesting listening to these women talk about death and dying. \u00a0They had borne witness to so many stories of intractable pain, anger, desperation, joy, release - they admitted crying and sometimes laughing with their constituents. \u00a0I had no doubt that these representatives did their best to represent the lessons learned from the hearings and recommend measures that would assist more people have a good death.  \n \nIn 2005, Nicholas was diagnosed with severe central and obstructive sleep apnea. \u00a0His condition was so severe that the medical team suggested Nick might have two months to live, perhaps a little more. \u00a0We refused surgery to remove part of the back of his tongue and the placement of a tracheotomy. \u00a0We were placed on palliative care. \n \nDuring our posting in London, our palliative care physician came from a local hospice called St. John's and St. Elizabeth's. \u00a0Dr. Chris Farnham was a tall, gangly man who was somehow all smiley and sad-in-his-eyes all at once. \u00a0His voice was gentle and his humour sweet. \u00a0This was a kind man, but one of strength - Chris was a man of  character . \u00a0As the years passed and Chris made home visits, prescribing different versions of oral morphine and muscle relaxants, I began to understand the differences between palliative and curative medicine. \u00a0The palliative physician medicates, the mind, body and soul. \u00a0They do this in the comfort of home or hospice. \u00a0Everything is done with comfort in mind. \u00a0Time moves slowly in palliative medicine, there is time for message, for chats, for home visits.  \n \nNicholas hasn't died yet and I suspect that he has no plans to do so anytime soon. \u00a0But palliative medicine suits us very well. \u00a0Now in Ottawa, we have a wonderful doctor who is very like Chris. \u00a0His name is Dr. Robert Eaton - a GP with all the qualities of a gentle, knowledgeable caretaker and one who would go to battle for us and win. \u00a0He is a personal and a community hero. \n \nThe recommendations of the Quebec report \"Dying With Dignity\" include greater access to palliative care and protection for physicians who medicate their dying patients in order to assist them to die without pain. \u00a0Two physicians have to sign their consent for a terminally ill patient who requests assistance to die without pain, even if this speeds their demise.  \n \nSome might say that any assisted death is euthanasia and that it is wrong. \u00a0I suggest that those people read \"Dying With Dignity\" and listen to the sadness and wisdom in the voices of the parliamentarians who worked for two years listening to stories of dying - some good and some appalling. \n \nDeath is a difficult subject to talk about, personally and publicly. \u00a0But it is a necessary conversation and I for one, am glad that some politicians are working on protecting me from a terrible death. \u00a0\"Dying With Dignity\" is a public validation of best practice in palliative care - and palliative care means protecting life with all available resources, and then easing a transition to death as painlessly and peacefully as possible. \u00a0I have argued elsewhere many times against euthanasia because I believe it is a slippery slope for people with complex and severe disabilities, but I believe that \"Dying With Dignity\" is an honest effort to come to grips with some guidelines for helping all concerned have a long life and a good death.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2012/03/22/quebec-assisted-suicide-report-recommendations-cp.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/dying-with-dignity.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday I wrote about how Facebook can make lonely people lonelier. \u00a0But what is the flip side of all this doom and gloom about social media and how can these online tools help people who give or receive care? \u00a0Does social media contribute to my wellbeing? \n \nThe resounding answer to the last question is Yes! \u00a0I am part of a generation that can well remember life before the internet. \u00a0In the old days, I subscribed to a magazine called \" Exceptional Parent \". \u00a0On the first pages was a letter column where people would write in about their son or daughter's mysterious symptoms or undiagnosed condition. \u00a0Parents like me would devour those letters, scanning for recognition or familiarity that would make us feel less alone. \u00a0It was the first bulletin board about children like Nicholas where I would discover the power and comfort of shared experience. \n \nNow, I use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Blogger, GooglePlus, Pinterest, and email - just to name a few information sharing tools. \u00a0I blog and automatically share each entry on Facebook and a host of other linking sites. \u00a0I copy and paste my blog entries to neurology websites such as  Braintalk Communities  and  Disabled World . \u00a0Braintalk is an old friend and there, in the Child Neurology Forum, everyone knows that Nick had a chest infection last week and that the antibiotics upset his stomach, just as I know about the daily challenges faced by their children. \u00a0Facebook allows me to think out loud about my everyday life, but also to share my more political thoughts about caregiving in the 21st century. \u00a0Each of these social media sites has a slightly different role to play. \u00a0I feel comfortable with Facebook because it allows me to share both personal and political ideas and experiences. \u00a0On my home page, you will find links to the new Victoria and Albert Museum ballgown exhibition, but also a personal note of concern to a friend in Iowa who's daughter is ill with the complications of a genetic disorder. \n \nAll these tools enrich my life, but do they actually help me and my family in the wellbeing department? \u00a0Well, maybe not in a clinical sense, but there IS one social media tool that is essential to Nick's health and social care. \u00a0It's called  Tyze . \u00a0Tyze is an online social media platform that is completely private - it even has a vault to securely store sensitive medical documents. \u00a0It's a kind of highly specialized version of Facebook, but with a purpose of serving a vulnerable person at its centre. \u00a0The most unique aspect of Tyze is that it bridges formal supports (doctors, therapists) with informal supports (family, close friends). \u00a0On Nicholas' Tyze site, we organize his schedule of appointments and ensure that they don't conflict with important sports events in his life. \u00a0His GP can correspond with his nurses or me about side effects of a new anti-seizure medication. \u00a0When Jim and I took a holiday to the Bahamas a few months ago, we checked Tyze every day to for a glimpse into Nick's medical profile as well as his leisure activities. \u00a0Last year, Nick posted his Christmas wish-list on Tyze and family or friends 'claimed' gifts to ensure that no duplicate presents were purchased. \u00a0We use Tyze as a tool to coordinate medical care, but many others Tyze users employ it to help their vulnerable relative to be more involved in their community, either through social clubs, churches or informal visits. \u00a0Therapeutic goals can be monitored, tasks assigned, schedules made and information shared with loved ones and professionals alike. \u00a0Tyze is a Godsend for anyone giving or receiving care and that's a fact. \n \nSocial media sites are tools. \u00a0Ultimately, they are in someone's hand and how they are wielded will depend entirely on the individual. \u00a0I am fascinated by the possibilities information technology has to open our communications with people near and far. \u00a0I pay attention to my online friends and work at my relationships with them. \u00a0Very rarely do I lazily click 'like' on their post when I can make a thoughtful comment. \u00a0My internet friends ARE my real friends. \u00a0For me, I look forward to more, not less, innovation in allowing me to communicate with people I care about. \u00a0I have managed to create a safe, caring neighbourhood in my online communities because I work at it. \u00a0I guess I am just one of those people who is not lonely online or off - I'm happy and I'm grateful for my laptop. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.eparent.com/", "http://braintalkcommunities.org/forum.php", "http://www.disabled-world.com/", "http://www.tyze.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/our-familyour-computer-we-innovate.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nLast week I had the pleasure of speaking to parents at the  Holland Bloorview Kids' Rehabilitation Hospital  in Toronto.  The building is new with a welcoming, light and homey feel to it - certainly very different from the old Hugh MacMillan Rehab Centre that used to stand in its place.  Nicholas and I went to Toronto when he was three and four years old.  There, we had his first psychology assessment, seating clinics (we received his first wheelchair) and inpatient stays for gastro consultations that came through Sick Kids' Hospital.   I walked in to the new centre and was met immediately by a delighted squeal of recognition - it was the doyenne of all community connectors, Louise Kinross, chief of communications for the hospital and editor of \" Bloom \", a parent magazine about all things disability.   Louise and I had been emailing each other for months and we felt like fast friends, but we'd never met in person.  We hugged and began to tour me around the facility.  My eyes fell upon a bench, placed in front of a window to allow parents to view their children having aqua therapy in the pool below.  All the parents were leaning forward, pointing and chatting quietly.  I listened for a moment as they compared challenges and triumphs.  I was flooded with memories.   It's been a while since we did therapy with Nicholas.  We haven't given up hope for change in his abilities, but we accept who he is and we no longer feel the urgency of that desperate love of parents for their young children - children who hold so much potential for improvement.  We are in the middle age of our parenting.  But seeing the other families and hearing their stories at my talk, I wondered whether we should be more hopeful for change in Nicholas.  I looked at the weary faces of parents, young and old and I thought about our life.  There, at Holland Bloorview, there was so much help - so much hope for change.  Had I given up on all that? The morning that I packed and prepared for my drive back to Ottawa, Louise met me and said, \"Before you go, I want you to meet  Dr. Tom Chau .  He's the Director of Research here.  Have you heard of him?\"  I answered that yes, I had heard of his amazing work in using movement and music to facilitate communication in children with very severe impairments.   Louise guided me up to the fourth floor and knocked gently on Dr. Chau's office door.  A good looking, slim and well-dressed Asian man introduced himself and Louise left us to chat about communication technology.  The doctor explained about some of his new inventions and asked about Nicholas.  I hesitated a little - did I want to enter this territory of hope, therapy and worry again?  I breathed and began to tell Nick's communication story of computer switches, auditory scanning, coded verbal and non-verbal messaging that is his way of talking.  Dr. Chau nodded and I made a decision.  \"Can you help Nicholas?\"  I asked.  \"Of course, he is 23 years old and you work with children\", I added perhaps too quickly.  \"Of course we can help Nicholas\", the doctor said.  We work with all ages when we are researching new technologies.\"  Then he showed me a video of a young man, very like Nicholas, who used his voice to hum in order to prompt the computer to speak his chosen words.  A kind of necklace called \"The Hummer\" sensed the tonal vocalizations of the young man and turned these sounds into computer messages.  My eyes widened and I said quietly, \"Could Nick wear that and use it in bed  and  in his wheelchair?\" I asked.  \"Yes, sure\", Dr. Chau replied.  I began to feel the old excitement of potential and positive change.  \"I'll write to you and we are definitely interested.  Thank you so much!\" I went to Holland Bloorview to tell our family story.  People came to hear me and to learn.  But it was me who learned from the families there - I tasted hope and remembered. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hollandbloorview.ca/", "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/", "http://www.hollandbloorview.ca/research/news/chauhonoured.php"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/then-and-now-remembering-when-nick-was.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n Stephen Marche's article \"Is Facebook Making Us Lonely\" in the May issue of The Atlantic  pokes a sharp stick at social media and its effect on our sense of social fulfilment. Marche asserts, \"What Facebook has revealed about human nature\u2014and this is not a minor revelation\u2014is that a connection is not the same thing as a bond, and that instant and total connection is no salvation, no ticket to a happier, better world or a more liberated version of humanity.\" \n \n\u00a0Caregivers know a lot about the difference between loneliness and solitude.  Solitude feels delicious - it's when someone you love and trust takes charge of your loved one and brings him or her somewhere fun, somewhere safe.  You, as caregiver, can have a long bath or read a magazine.  Solitude is your chance to drink the tonic of silence with no one calling for your help. But giving and receiving care can be lonely because the lifestyle is, by its nature, one of isolation.  One mother I know from the parent bulletin boards has not been out to dinner since 1997.  She and her husband look after their 42 year old son in a home hospital setting.  Their older son, also affected by the same genetic disease, passed away at the age of 38 four years ago. I feel that I really know this woman, even though I have never met her.  To me, she is a  real friend .  Perhaps that is because our online relationship is not driven by narcissism, but rather a shared experience of caring for our sons with disabilities.  When we talk online, we discuss the perils of severe constipation or the side effects of anti-seizure medications.  For my online friend and me, the internet gives us a bridge for conversation about our unique, shared experience. \n \n\u00a0But there are limitations to Facebook and other social media sites too.  For people moving to a new city or country, Facebook and Skype can sometimes hinder settlement. One friend, an expat in England, wrote \"I found that using Facebook made me very homesick when I moved here. I have seen several young people spend all their free time on Facebook only to get super discouraged and move home without truly making a go at being in a new city...\" \n \n\u00a0Last summer, my daughter Natalie worked as a research assistant to Daniel Miller (author of \" Tales From Facebook \", amongst other fascinating works exploring the effects of social media on our real time relations).  For his newer research project, Dr. Miller was investigating whether Skype helped or hindered the settlement process of new immigrants.  That research is still ongoing.  One thing is for certain - lonely people will not be less lonely if they use Facebook.  People who are not lonely and who use Facebook or other social media sites to enhance their real time relationships report high satisfaction levels with both their online and their real life friendships. \n \n\u00a0But the inadequacy of Facebook as a tool for intimate communication is starkly illuminated when serious problems befall the real lives of people. \u00a0When a friend in London was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she reported that Facebook and Skype were too painful to use with her closest family and friends back home.  Nothing short of an embrace would heal her frightened heart, so she closed her online accounts and told her children that she needed them to visit. \n \n\u00a0So, what kinds of social media can be truly helpful to people who give and receive care?  That's the subject of tomorrow's post.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/8930/", "http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745652092"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/facebook-good-or-bad.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nWhat makes me really, really angry are people who commit a sin against the noble pursuit of beauty and engagement in public spaces.  Last week, there was an article in my local Ottawa newspaper that caught my eye.  \" Flower Power Struggle \" was the title.  Apparently, an Ottawa couple who own a flower shop regularly decorate the sidewalk adjacent to the store with rose petals, in an effort to attract customers and beautify the street.  Residents have been enjoying a small trail of fresh petals to the doorway since the shop opened ten years ago.  But last month, the owners of Bloomfields Flowers received a 'cease and desist order' from the City of Ottawa.  Apparently, someone complained about the 'debris' on the sidewalk and bylaw officers agreed with the Scrooge-like complainer.  \"What is the matter with some people!\", I raged to my unsuspecting husband. But my spouse knows that I really care about streets, beauty, conversation, inclusion and the idea of neighbourhoods.  When we lived in London, I had the pleasure and privilege of being a director of the  London International Festival of Theatre (LIFT).   LIFT is a festival of contemporary theatre work and often, it doesn't look like theatre at all.  One show that I remember with a poignant mix of memory, intimacy, and kindness was an 'experience' called  \"Beloved\" by an American artist called Nicole Blackman.   The artist had taken over a slightly derelict, but still beautiful National Trust home called Rainham Hall on the outskirts of London.  After a long train journey to the very eastern edge of the city, I found my way to a stately home.  The path leading from the street was strewn with blue rose petals and a sign beckoned me to enter silently, following the trail of roses.  Another sign instructed me to pick up a stone from the flower bed and put it my pocket - apparently I would need it later.  I entered the great house alone and followed the arrows and petals to the first room.  There, a man stood alone and gestured to me to join him.  He began to crank an old Victrola record player and gently put the needle down on the spinning disc.  He extended his arms in an invitation to dance.  We danced and after a few minutes, I was not embarrassed or nervous.  I remembered all the dances in my life, especially a father-daughter dance in high school.  Next, I entered a room where the artist's own old family photos hung from invisible wire from the ceiling.   Each print had a description on the back for me to examine alone - something like \"Aunt Dorothy always brought a picnic for everyone to the park\".  Every room in \"Beloved\" had something to say about kindness, the love of family, silence, gentleness and intimacy.  It wasn't a person who guided the one-at-a-time visitors to this exhibition, it was blue rose petals.  When I had experienced all the rooms, I went outside.  A little sign instructed me to write the name of someone I had loved and lost with chalk on the stone that still lay in my pocket.  I wrote the name of my father on the stone and placed it with others back in the garden.   Art, beauty and thoughtful public engagement is the 'other' great passion in my life.  If I could meet the philistine who complained about rose petals in my neighbourhood, I would make him or her experience \"Beloved\".  But maybe they have no loving memories that would spring to life.  Perhaps they would have nothing to write on their stone.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Flower+power+struggle/6426792/story.html", "http://www.liftfestival.com/", "http://www.liftfest.com/events/past-events/2010-lift-festival/lift-2010-programme/beloved-nicole-blackman"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/what-makes-me-furious-and-its-not.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n\"Have you ever lost something you loved?\" was the question that appeared on my computer screen.  I was sitting in a caravan outside the National Theatre in London, England.  This ersatz internet cafe was in fact an interactive theatre performance of  \"Live Streaming\", a show by Dutch director, Dries Verhoeven , produced by the  London Intl. Festival of Theatre (LIFT ).  The 'experience' was designed to explore the after-effects of the devastating tsunami and the ensuing outpouring of sympathy and money from the developed world.  I was matched with 'Natalie' a thirty-something actress on a beach, live and sitting on the beach in her native Sri Lanka.  We texted and she asked me about loss.  \"Yes, I have lost something I loved\", I responded, thinking of my father who is gone and my grandmother.  \"Do you have insurance?\" Natalie asked.  \"Yes\", I responded.  She wrote, \"Here, only foreigners have insurance\".  The unbearable loss of everything and possibly everyone for this young woman hung like a terrible inference between us.  The session ended when she wrote, \"if there was another tsunami and you saw people being swept away in the sea, would you look for me?\"  \"Yes!\" I wrote, shocked and humbled by the space, time and experience separating us.   Can we ever have insurance against the tsunamis, the human tragedies and just the bad luck in life?  Can we insure ourselves and the people we love against illness or disability?  Well, I suppose we can in a way - there is the incredibly wonderful  Registered Disability Savings Plan  here in Canada, and there are different types of incapacity insurance.  Most people have  home owners insurance  and car insurance, and  its easy to buy online .  In my family, we hold on to these and gratefully pay the premiums.  Of course, nothing can prevent us losing something we love - loss is part of life.  But having something in the way of insurance makes me feel safe.  And somehow, telling Natalie that I would look for her and meaning it perhaps gave her a tiny sense of insurance, because the best insurance is the company of others who care. PS: In my last post, I omitted a rather critical piece of background information - that my day was planned WITHOUT a visit to Nicholas, in order to 'get things done'.  Mercury being retrograde, I forgot to write the title properly and didn't accomplish anything on my 'to-do' list.  No insurance against days like that! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.driesverhoeven.com/content/uploads/media/application/Press-Coverage--Dries-Verhoeven.pdf", "http://www.liftfestival.com/", "http://rdsp.com/", "http://www.localberkshire.co.uk/classified/information/20129/lv3/", "http://www.localberkshire.co.uk/classified/information/20129/lv3/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/have-you-ever-lost-something-you-loved.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n For the last ten years or so, Jim and I have been coming down to the Bahama Out Islands for a week in midwinter.   Fernandez Bay Village in Cat Island  is our favourite and now habitual destination.     The out islands are sometimes called the Shallow Islands or the Family Islands, both monikers that are highly suitable.  Most people living and working in the capital city of Nassau are from the out islands, where the Caribbean sea is shallow and those who have \u2018gone away\u2019 (which is most young people) have mixed feelings about their birthplace.       For us, Cat Island is a tiny, remote desert island paradise.  Here, there are no phones in our cottage and certainly no television.  Only the main guest house has internet which works most of the time.       But it is not Cat Island\u2019s natural wonders that I want to speak about today (although I could  go on if anyone would ever care to chat privately about that!).  Today I want to talk about isolation, family and the universality of how we care for one another.     At Fernandez Bay, I have a friend who lives here year-round.  Her name is Uschi, a German short-form for Ursula.  Twelve years ago, Uschi Ingersoll took it upon herself to create a visiting and support programme for Cat Island\u2019s most elderly and isolated residents.  She bought two vans and hired a couple of assistants to keep the visits going, even when Uschi herself was off the island.  In total, The  Cat Island Relief Aid (CIRA)   visits 62 folks every  two weeks, bringing a small food basket, handfuls of sweets, toenail clippers, massage oil and most importantly, hugs.  Uschi says that the nail clipping followed by a massage of the legs and arms is the most important aspect of her care, because \u201ceveryone needs to be touched sometimes. It is so important.\u201d  Uschi knows that the only touch her elderly friends are likely to receive is her massage.      Last Tuesday, I had the privilege of travelling with the Cat Island Relief Team on their day of paying visits on the North Island. My sister-in law, Cathie, came too and we shared the responsibility of taking photos of each person visited.  Later, Uschi will develop the photos and bring them as a gift on her next visit.  Cat is only 50 miles in length, but  in the twenty five miles of the northern half, we visited 28 people who were largely shut in.  Homes here are simple cement affairs.  Often, they look uninhabited, with closed doors, boarded up windows and flapping roof tiles - the result of last August\u2019s Hurricane Irene when Cat found itself in the epicentre of the worst storm in most islanders\u2019 memory.  Almost without exception, the homes we visited were tidy and clean, but surprisingly dark.  I doubt that anyone we visited knows Uschi\u2019s name - they call her \u201cMama\u201d or \u201cBaby\u201d.  They also know that Uschi\u2019s daughter had a terrible accident two years ago here on Cat that resulted in spinal cord injury and quadriplegia.  Now, there is an additional bond of shared pain that resonates with the elderly women, who without exception tell me of their children who are living and those they have lost.  If life is raw here in Cat Island now, I can\u2019t imagine how it must have been sixty or eighty years ago.      Most of the folks we visited were women.  They are mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers who have worked all their lives.  Many continue to weave straw into hats to sell or tend their gardens.  All are, to me, the embodiment of resilience.       But there was one woman we visited who was different from the rest.  Walking up to her doorway, Uschi said \u201cthis woman is young, but she has two children who are disabled - and the family is very much alone.\u201d  When we lowered our heads through the doorway and adjusted our eyes to the dim light, my eyes fell on a child of perhaps ten, cradled in the arms of her older sister.  The younger daughter, it turned out, was 21 and very small due to her cerebral palsy.  There are no feeding tubes here, only the gentle persuading of a mother helping her daughter to swallow thickened water and mashed potato.  The older sister smiled nervously, her lips trembling.  I looked in her eyes and saw that she had a mild developmental disability.  \u201cDo you help to look after your sister every day?\u201d I asked.  She nodded and I complimented her devotion to her mother and sister.  \u201cMay I hold your sister?\u201d I asked.  Looking at the mother, I explained about Nicholas.  At first her eyes looked uncomprehending.  How could this white woman from a world away have a child with severe disabilities?  \u201cYes, you can hold her\u201d, said the mother beginning to study me with a different kind of interest.  Gently, I took the young woman into my arms, carefully supporting her head against my arm. I rocked and began to sing a song that I used to sing to Nicholas every day when he was little. \u201cHello, hello, hello and how are you?  I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. And I hope that you are too.\u201d  The frail limbs of my young friend began to stir from the unfamiliar touch and I helped her back into the arms of her sister.  We stood to leave and I took the mother\u2019s hand.  \u201cWe are sisters\u201d, I said.  \u201cYou are a hero, you must work so very hard to keep your beautiful girl alive, to make sure that she can drink enough when it\u2019s hot and eat enough.  I know.  I know.\u201d  I hugged this sister of mine and my eyes filled with the tears of a shared experience - an experience of pain, but also love, hope and despair.      Later, back at Fernandez Bay, I said hello to Sheila, the only registered massage therapist on Cat Island.  We chatted as she she waited for a lift to her next appointment.  When Sheila learned about the family living with disability, she immediately wanted to help - she knew her unique skills could help a tired mother's sore shoulders or limbs stiffened by neurological injury.  Soon Olive, a Cat Island entrepreneur who runs a bake shop and a taxi service, arrived at the doorway.  \"Here's my ride!\", exclaimed Sheila.  Sheila proceeded to tell Olive about the Cat Island family and I explained about our family back in Canada. Then Olive said, \u201cbut I am a special Mum too!  Come and meet my daughter, she\u2019s in the taxi!  My daughter has learning difficulties and she cannot speak, but she can smile....if she feels like it!\u201d  Olive\u2019s daughter did smile at me - a gorgeous smile of perfect teeth and twinkly eyes.  Olive and I chatted about her daughter\u2019s occasional deep depression, about mothering, and about the island.  We talked about starting a support group for mothers.  I can tell that Olive is an organizer and a leader.  We promised to keep in touch and I know we will remain friends.      Cat Island has white sand beaches that are lined with Casuarina pines and the occasional stone cottage.  But it also has people who are giving and receiving care in the same way we do at home in Canada.  The care here does not involve beeping monitors or social services, but it does come with hugs, deep gazes and knowing nods of recognition.  As every one of the people we visited said again and again as they gazed heavenward, \u201cGod is good.  Yes Lord, God is good.\u201d    \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DYeZryP0Fo4/T2H_MeF6zTI/AAAAAAAAAEI/MEDf6itAD-U/s1600/CatIslandfamily.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h_slF9ccOto/T2H9P1Z1wyI/AAAAAAAAAD8/lkuMkbR5pN8/s1600/Miss%2BThompson.jpg", "http://fernandezbayvillage.com/", "http://www.catisland.org/", "http://www.blogger.com/www.catisland.org"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/03/we-all-care-glimpse-of-devotion-in-cat.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday, I satisfied myself that Nick is feeling a little better, so I decided to turn my attention to other matters here on my blog.  Last week, a message appeared in my inbox requesting me to consider adding a couple of live links to disability related products or services to my missives.  The idea rolled around in my head for several days and I decided that because these particular goods or services sparked strong memories, I would agree to add these links.  They pay me a small fee to do so and I've decided to try this scheme out IF the product is relevant to me personally or the experience of living with disability generally.  Let me know what you think! What many readers will not know about me is that my father had three debilitating strokes before he died in 1975.  He was 54 years old when he passed away - I have already outlived him by seven years.  Dad had a minor stroke when doctors discovered a blocked artery in his neck - the clot would have to be removed surgically.  Our family was reassured that the procedure would be simple and successful.  But, when Dad came back from the operating room, he could not speak or move the right side of his body at all.  During the operation, a piece of the blood clot had broken off and travelled into his brain, causing millions of cells there to die.   Dad went to a rehab centre for a few months where he learned to stand for transfers into his wheelchair.  But for that former McGill star hockey player and WWII distinguished veteran, there would be nothing to be happy about after his stroke.  He died two years later after three days in a coma. When I think of Nicholas' disability and my Dad's, there are stark contrasts.  Of course, sometimes I feel sad about Nick's condition and once in a great while, as a I gaze at my boy's dear face, I enter that parental no-man's land of wondering what Nick would have been like without cerebral palsy.  But mostly, he is happy and so are we with the person he is and always has been.  My Dad, though, was another matter.  Dad did not want to be a person with disability - he did not know how to do it.  Nothing in his generation of maleness and unspoken emotions prepared him for the battleground of personal incapacity.   I have a memory of coming home after school and watching Star Trek.  There was a character on the show, a former captain of the SS Enterprise, who was disabled after some kind of intergalactic accident.  Later, I thought about him when my Dad could not move and I reflected on how this space captain could still command respect and have an important role in the running of things.  I wanted that for my Dad.   Dad never lived to have the benefit of technology that enables Nicholas to communicate, to be lifted, to be bathed or to attend hockey games in his own accessible van.  He sat, smoking, watching television and he did not want to venture out.  Could part of that choice have been the effort it took to scale the stairs in our Montreal town house?  Stair lifts are one type of revolutionary invention that spell freedom for those with mobility impairments - we had two in London to help Nick access various sections of the official residence.   I wish my Dad could have had  stair lift solutions  for mobility, a van, a communication device and a willingness to embrace all those innovations.  I wish he could have discovered that it is possible to have a good life within 'the four walls of his freedom'.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.worldofhealth.co.uk/your-stairlift-solutions-explained/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/03/my-father-my-memories-my-son.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nWhen Nick was a baby, he was a terrible sleeper.  He would doze off and suddenly, his arms would fling themselves outward, his legs extending and he would scream.  We called this his 'startle' reflex and put it down to Nick being Nick.  When he was tiny, we found it helped to keep him swaddled tightly, so that the jerks were contained.... I remember that at the cottage, we put a sign on the hallway door, \"Quiet, Baby sleeping...lightly!\"  Any tiny sound would result in a startle and then a scream.   It never occurred to any of us that his behaviour might actually be a seizure disorder. Then, when Nick was about 7, he had his first orthopaedic surgery.  It was a lengthening of his heel cords and adductor muscles.  The doctor in London suggested casting him afterwards in a 'broomstick' style paster, with both legs open wide and a pole wedged in between to keep the position stable.  His feet were cast as well, with his feet at 45 degrees in order to allow the heel cords to maintain their stretch.  When Nicholas came home after that surgery, he began to have terrible symptoms, but only during sleep.  He would be sleeping peacefully when, suddenly, his casted legs would jerk up into the air and he would scream terribly until we turned on the light and firmly woke him up.  During the worst times, this would repeat itself every  3 to 5 minutes. Only during waking hours was he somehow free from these terrible episodes.  Finally, Nick became so exhausted and ill that he was readmitted to hospital for telemetry tests.  A camera was put on Nick and when the neurologist viewed it, she diagnosed frontal lobe seizures.  The surgeon recommended removing the cast two weeks early.  When the cast came off, pressure sores down to the bone were revealed on both his heels.  Poor Nick, his heels looked like white jelly.  We were transferred to Great Ormond St. Hospital and the overnight test was repeated, but no seizure activity was seen on the tracing.  Everyone was mystified by the events and we were sent home to have daily nursing visits for almost a year in order to fully heal the pressure sores on Nick's feet.   Fast forward to this year.  We now have a diagnosis of nocturnal seizures and we know that Nick's arm jerks during sleep are, in fact, seizure activity.  Last night, the nurse reported 16 or more jerky movements AND Nick being disturbed by any small sound or movement.   Sometimes it takes a lifetime of staring at someone you love to understand what is happening to them, especially if that person is medically complex and non-speaking.  I can't help but wonder how our lives would be different if we had known to medicate Nick's seizures when he was young.  So much of what Jim and I battled was sleep deprivation....  I know that hindsight is 20/20 and that we did our best, but it is bittersweet to wonder. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/seizures-then-and-now-penny-dropped.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nWhen I was doing research for  my book , I read quite a lot of what American philosopher and Capability Approach expert,  Martha Nussbaum , had to say.   Nussbaum has been a slow learner where concerns of people with cognitive disabilities are concerned.  But in 2009, she came around.  In the  Journal of Metaphilosophy , Nussbaum wrote: In short: people with cognitive disabilities are equal citizens, and law ought to show respect for them as full equals.  To do so, law must provide such people with equal entitlements to medical care, housing, and other economic needs. That is the easy part.  But law must go further, providing people with disabilities truly equal access to education, even when that is costly and involves considerable change in current methods of instruction.  Even that, our society has begun to realize.  Now we must take the most controversial step of all, giving people with cognitive disabilities political and civil rights on a basis of genuine equality.  What that requires, and why it requires something that seems at first look so odd, has been the central theme of this essay.  Let the debate begin. Well,  the debate began and ended today in Canada's Supreme Court .  In an earlier lower court trial, a young woman with cognitive disabilities was prevented from testifying against her mother's partner who allegedly sexually assaulted her repeatedly.  Apparently, the woman failed to pass a required competency test requiring her to distinguish between truth and lies.  Without victim testimony, the accused was acquitted.  Today, a new trial was ordered for a young woman, this time allowing for her testimony.  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court sent a message to the courts of Canada that testimony of people with cognitive disabilities must be accepted without first having to pass a competency test.  If you care about fairness for vulnerable people, it's worth reading the Supreme Court decision.  Today, I'm especially proud to be Canadian. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1328923055&sr=8-1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum", "http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0026-1068", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2012/02/10/supreme-court-testimony-competency-ruling.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/02/todays-supreme-court-ruling.html", "title": ""},

Nick has a couple of heroes in the WWE - one is  Stone Cold Steve Austin .  In my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom , I wrote about the wish foundation trip we took to meet \"Mr. Stone Cold\".  But if there is another wrestler who could eclipse Steve Austin (aka Stone Cold) in Nick's list of top ten wild and craziest hulks-in-the-ring, it would be \" The Ultimate Warrior \".  The Warrior is retired from pro-wrestling now, but that doesn't stop him from blogging, philosophising and selling his 'fine art' online.

The Ultimate One is appearing live in Minneapolis on March 24th and he has two VIP tickets up for grabs, but there is a catch.

{"date": "", "body": "\nI first met Kathleen Jordan when she came to my home twenty-three years ago.  Jim and I had just received the diagnosis of cerebral palsy and possible mental retardation (as it was called then) for Nicholas.  As another mother of a son with disabilities and volunteer consultant to families like her own, Kath offered me information, encouragement and hope.  Kathleen and Bill Jordan still care for their son Christopher at home.  They depend on a local programme called  Real Plans for Real Life  to advocate for and secure the help they need to support Chris.  This week, all that changed when the Ontario provincial government suddenly announced that Real Plans for Real Life would cease to exist and that funding would be transferred to  Service Coordination , the local 'one stop' shop for adults with developmental disabilities in the Ottawa area.   Here is how the news reported the story  - Kathleen's tears reveal how families feel about this decision. Yesterday, the long awaited  Drummond Report  was released.  The report details comprehensive recommendations on how to reduce the deficit currently running on the books of the Ontario provincial government.  If no cuts are made, economists predict that the provincial deficit will hit 30.2 billion dollars by 2017-18.  Here is an important recommendation in the report relating to longterm care:  Recommendation 5-74:  Increase the focus on home care, supported by required resources, particularly at the community level. Too bad that Real Plans for Real Life was cut just days before senior public servants had a chance to digest Drummond's recommendations.  Someone on the end of the telephone telling you that there are no available places in day programmes or funding for respite is not helpful.  It may be transparent and accountable, but it's not helpful.   The pot has been stirred and now is the time to see what rises to the top.  I hope that creative entrepreneurs will see this need in our community as an opportunity.  Parents are smart problem solvers, but parents of adult children with disabilities are aging and they are tired.  Perhaps it's time for open sourcing solutions.

{"date": "", "body": "\nI think it was about two weeks ago that Nick and I came upon a notice online about a contest hosted by World Wrestling Entertainment superhero,  The Ultimate Warrior .  Mr. Warrior challenged his fans to impersonate him in a short film, then post it to YouTube where all Warrior fans could vote.  The winner would receive tickets to a live show in the States and a chance to meet the 6'7\" athlete/artist/philosopher/madman.   Nick has always loved the over-the-top antics of the WWE.  He guffaws at the outrageous story-lines and gasps when his heros are slammed to the mat.  A few months ago, Nick completed a long and arduous social services survey about his life aspirations.  Chief among them was to take a road trip with a friend in order to 'find' the Ultimate Warrior, who no longer wrestles regularly, but actively corresponds with legions of fans on a personal website amusingly named \"Warrior University\".  Warrior is a madman - he spouts incomprehensible 'philosophy' and uses his trademark growl to punctuate his tirades.  It's the stuff of legend and Nick adores it. Nicholas decided to enter the contest.  Nick already had the growl down pat.  In fact, when he wanted to tell me something new about his superhero, a growl was his code for Warrior (Nick cannot speak, but uses sound codes to great communication advantage).  Together, we made this shopping list:  Blonde or light brown mullet wig, strings to tie biceps, and face-paint in black, yellow and red.  Josh, Nick's helper and friend, has an arts background and managed to do a terrific job with makeup.  On computer, the boys worked together to embed theme music and visual effects into their film.  Josh read the Warrior script from offscreen and Nick took centrestage in wig and full make-up, growling ominously.  When the film was complete, Josh uploaded it to YouTube to be ready for its submission to the contest. The next day, Nick's video appeared on the  Warrior's Facebook Page .  Team Warrior located the film and posted it as \"a great first entry\".  Lots of other fans commented.  Most of the comments were positive and encouraging, but some were very upsetting.  A couple of people wrote that Josh had duped Nick into entering the contest and 'used' him in a cowardly and exploitative way.  Another person called the film simply 'disturbing'.   Some of the comments on YouTube were worse.  One wrote \"Ultimate Shiavo\" (sic), a reference to the Florida woman whose family fought about the removal of her feeding tube after doctors argued that she was brain dead.  The worst of the comments we had removed from the Warrior site and from YouTube.  But, the vast majority of the comments were positive, encouraging and even inspiring.  It's hard to focus on the positive though, when some are so hurtful. It's an unsettling sensation being on the receiving end of hate and ignorance.  My first inclination was to protect my treasured son from this poison and remove the film and any evidence of it from the web.  But Nicholas' cooler head prevailed.  \"Nevermind those idiots, I don't care.  I have warrior spirit!\"  I think Nick is used to the extreme trash talk that swirls around the WWE, but it's a language that I abhor.  I have to admit, some of the comments on others' entries were almost as harsh.  But the message here is not whether the WWE should clean up its act.  The message here is one about resilience, courage, imagination and yes, it's the message that is the moniker of the Warrior - \"Believe, Always Believe\".  I wavered and Nicholas did not.  He exposed himself and his dreams with courage, dignity, imagination and talent. Please vote for Nicholas in the Ultimate Warrior  contest, because there is only one warrior and it's Nicholas Wright.

I wrote about watching, fascinated, a family of birds make their home in our front door lamp: \n \n Outside our front door in Ottawa, we had a black wrought-iron openwork light fixture. \u00a0Each spring, a pair of tiny sparrowlike birds called redpolls came to nest in our lamp. \u00a0The first year they came, all their bits of straw and string simply fell through the mesh onto the ground. \u00a0Annoyed by the mess, we swept up and thought nothing more of it until one day, there on the ground lay two tiny, broken bright blue eggs. \u00a0I wept a little, berating myself for not understanding their simple need to have a safe nest for their offspring. \u00a0 \n \n The next year when we heard their distinctive chirps at the door, Jim cut some bits of cedar and created a floor o the base of the lamp. \u00a0Nest building began in earnest, and soon there were four tiny eggs tucked up amongst downy roan feathers. \u00a0That year, I watched as the mum kept her eggs warm and the father worried nearby. \u00a0The eggs eventually hatched into a noisy quartet of open beaks and soon enough, they were ready to fly. \u00a0I sat an entire day, watching in suspenseful anticipation as every redpoll in the area arrived on our pine tree to begin \"training\" with the youngsters. \u00a0By turns, each bird would fly to the top of the lamp, perch there for a second and fly off to the nearby branch. \u00a0The young birds had a tricky rite of passage: they had to fly inside the lamp and exit through the a narrow passage at the top of the ironwork. \u00a0By dusk, all the birds had left the nest and we could finally turn on the light and resume our life without our temporary tenants. \u00a0 \n \n These birds, living in my midst, nurtured by us and by the rest of the flock, gave me a certain antidote against loneliness. \u00a0I had genuine curiosity about the life in my garden and most certainly, felt \"some minute, divine spark inside me.\" \u00a0By this time I had given up on any idea of justice or natural order in the world. \u00a0Contained in my garden, I thought, there is transcendence; there is grace. \u00a0I began to think that peeling potatoes, raking leaves and mixing cakes were all a sort of prayer. \u00a0I began to understand that to be free, I had to have an antidote to despair. (pgs 84-85) \n \nYesterday morning, we were reading the newspapers when Jim whispered, \"Do you hear that?\" We stopped and listened. \u00a0It was an unusual, but familiar chirp outside our window. \u00a0\"Could it be?....\" I breathed. \u00a0We looked into our pine tree and there, among the bushes was a pair of tiny birds - one with a red breast. \u00a0We opened the door carefully and there, on the ground, lay a few tiny bits of string along with a few pine needles. \u00a0Jim went out onto the lawn in just his dressing gown and slippers - he collected some cedar branches from the hedge and carefully placed them into the lamp. \u00a0This time, there would be no broken eggs and hopefully, we would have the privilege of witnessing the birth of a new family at our door. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNurturing life and helping to create a safe and warm nest IS a powerful antidote to loneliness. \u00a0That I know. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552788903/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335651521&sr=8-1", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C2plGrxl5dg/T5xsc-Nu1II/AAAAAAAAAI8/twG1xgugJw4/s1600/nest.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mA342IGRAx0/T5xsjQGNm5I/AAAAAAAAAJE/AkEKJVOrM2M/s1600/Bird.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/04/surprise-reunion.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n Last week, Nicholas had an appointment at the hospital sleep study clinic.  Nick has severe apnea and we wanted a current read on how often he stops breathing during sleep.   We were to arrive at the hospital with his nurse and an overnight bag at 10:15pm and departure was set for 6:30am the following day.  Nick and his nurse were told that someone would collect them in a wheelchair van at about 7:30 in the morning.  The week before, the head nurse at Nick's residence had spoken at length to the receptionist at the clinic and informed her of all Nick's special needs.   Fast forward to our arrival at the hospital.  A smiling technician greeted us and commented, \"Oh, Nicholas is in a wheelchair?\"  I nodded and asked for the hoist that would work with Nick's special sling.  He said that there was no hoist and no one on the unit had any knowledge of Nick's special needs.  Without the right hoist, I explained, Nicholas could not be transferred from his chair to the bed.  If Nick couldn't lie in bed for the night, the study could not be done.  The technician managed to find two orderlies from another department who seemed bemused at having to help lift Nick into the bed.  Arrangements for the morning transfer back into the chair were uncertain, but we decided to go ahead and prepare Nick for the test.  We settled him into a comfortable position after all the electrodes and leads had been connected and left the hospital around midnight. The next day, I found out that Nicholas had been asked to leave the unit at 5:30am because that was the preferred time for the transfer out of bed by the orderlies.  Nick and his nurse waited two hours in the hospital lobby for their ride.  Nick was tired and sore - the hospital mattress had been uncomfortable and sitting is painful for Nick at the best of times.  A couple of days later, I was visiting Nick when I was called to the telephone.  It was the respiratory doctor who had ordered the sleep study.  He was full of sincere apologies.  He couldn't understand how the messages about Nick's special needs were not passed along and he was sorry for the pain and inconvenience caused to Nicholas and his family and carers.  Another mother's blog  this week described a visit to an ultra-sound clinic with her daughter that went badly.  Those clinic staff were simply surly and refused to assist in lifting this young woman from her chair to the examination table.   Today on my Facebook feed, I noticed a  story from the Guardian .  Apparently, in the UK, a new report into the treatment of elderly people in care homes recommends that nurses and doctors be hired based on their capacity for compassion as much as for their exam results.  Good idea, I thought, but then wondered whether compassion can be measured or tested.  So, I googled and found an  article on measuring compassion in the Nursing Times .  A tidbit from that article: A new King's Fund report \u2013 titled Enabling Compassionate Care in Acute Hospital Services and published this week \u2013 also points the finger at a \u2018technical shift\u2019, especially in training.  It described core training for the nursing and medical professions as essentially \u2018biomedical\u2019, adding that although \u2018effective clinical care is clearly fundamentally important\u2026 human aspects of care must also be valued in training and in terms of career progression\u2019. The article went on to offer opposing opinions from gurus within the medical profession as to whether compassion can or should be a recruitment criterion.  They all agreed on one point, though.  Professionals who are overworked, underpaid and treated with little respect by their superiors are more likely to treat their charges with little compassion or care.  I believe that we  should  use compassion as a criterion for recruitment and I think a good place to start would be with the senior management.  An ethic of compassionate care must come from the top and be expected at every level in the organization, not just for end users.  The radical idea of demanding that everyone be very nice to each other is being tried in Alaskan and Australian hospitals (see previous posts on the NUKA model of care).  No one in those centres has passed out or died yet from too much kindness.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://timeasweknowit.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/r-e-s-p-e-c-t/", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/29/eldery-care-your-experiences?fb=native&CMP=FBCNETTXT9038", "http://www.nursingtimes.net/whats-new-in-nursing/management/can-you-measure-compassion/5000543.article"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/02/compassionate-care-well-sometimes.html", "title": ""},

It is a story about when Nicholas was a baby and we had just received his diagnosis of cerebral palsy and possible 'mental retardation', as they called it then.   Jim's cousin arrived at the door with another woman in tow.  The stranger introduced herself this way: \"My name is Kathleen and I'm a volunteer consultant for parents of children with disabilities.  I'm a Mum myself.\"  Kathleen's arms were filled with piles of information about therapies and community resources.  She put the papers down on my dining room table and then reached out her arms to hold me. As I remember that day, I am reminded that we mothers and fathers of children with disabilities need two things more than any other:  information and kindness.  This is what my online friend Rose said about getting the information that is relevant and the kindness that she needs: We must always remain hungry for knowledge to help our children and inform our difficult daily choices. I want it all out on the table, the good and the ugly. I want options explained to me in detail. I want time to do my own research and to connect with other parents for their experiences to assist me and my husband in reaching our decision. We have a right to these things; our children have a right to our full awareness and understanding of their medical condition, treatment, and potential dangers/outcomes. Their lives are literally in our hands. Moreover, we are entitled to respect by medical professionals, who should realize that any decision we make is difficult. There are risks to doing nothing, as well as intervening drastically. Choosing which path to follow is enormously stressful, painful, and frightening. Overall, we need compassion as we wander our way through this twisting and complicated journey. Yes, we need compassion badly.  I remember perfectly clearly standing in the hallway of the hospital and saying, \"I really need you to be nice to me.  I am not kidding, it is so important.  Please.\"  But I remember his face - he didn't understand.  In the recent case of Amelia at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, for example, it seems pretty clear that the family received neither relevant information nor compassion.

{"date": "", "body": "\nJim and I took our first vacation in a year over the past couple of weeks.  Our trip to Cat Island, Bahamas, was fun, refreshing and relaxing.....until I found out that Nicholas had a cold, fever and atypical seizures.  Nick was on the downside of a mild cold when we left for our holiday.  Saying goodbye, I wiped his nose and kissed him on the forehead to reassure myself that he had no fever.  We left Cat Island to come home on Tuesday, but the previous Friday night, Nick had spiked a fever and his cold symptoms returned with a vengeance.  On Saturday, he was watching TV with his carer when his arms began to jerk upwards rhythmically.  Nick remained responsive throughout this episode, but could not control the movement in his arms.  This type of seizure is called \"complex partial\" and it's unusual for Nick - normally his jerky movements are limited to nighttimes when he is sound asleep.   By the time we arrived home on Tuesday night, Nick seemed to be a little better from the worst of the symptoms he had experienced on Saturday and Sunday.  We had a grand reunion on Wednesday morning with many hugs and kisses - Nick didn't even ask to clear the room before putting his arms around me.  We all laughed when someone mentioned the ad for Nyquil on television - that one with the beefy man who has a cold and says to his wife, \"Pam, can you call my Mom?\"  I felt we had missed the worst of Nick's cold and I felt badly about that, but at least my boy seemed better.  On Wednesday night, we were home after visiting with Nick all day, when the phone rang.  It was Josh, Nick's carer, calling to let us know that Nick's temperature was back up to 38.2.  One of Nick's daily medications is tylenol, so this was a real fever, especially given that his baseline temp is 36.  The nurse ordered a urine sample, but that came back negative for infection the next day.  Nick's chest sounded clear, but collectively, we decided to call in the doctor. Our GP, Dr. Robert Eaton, is a hero of our community.  He makes house calls for Nicholas and others who are bed-bound.  He is funny, gentle and smart.  After a thorough examination, Dr. Eaton deduced that a chest infection was the likely cause of the fever, even though nothing untoward was discernible by listening through the stethoscope.  \"No point in putting Nick through a trip to the hospital for a chest x-ray\", said the good doctor, \"it won't change anything.  Let's just give him some anti-biotics.\"   So today, Nick will start his penicillin and he'll be better soon.   Nicholas moving into the Rotary Home was a difficult adjustment for our whole family.  But we are learning to trust the staff and Nicholas himself.  The last days of my wonderful holiday were a little coloured by mental images of Nick calling for me through a fog of fever and coughing.  But I also knew that he was safe in his new home with caring and trained professionals.  I received scans of his daily flow charts via email and constant updates about his symptoms.  Jim and I sent Nick reassuring messages of love each day along with a countdown of days till our return to Ottawa.   Part of letting go is drawing the line between what you can and cannot do for a person you love who needs constant care.  We will take our holidays, but ensure that we are in constant touch.  In Ottawa, we will visit almost every day, but the days that we do not see our young man are days that we phone or email.  And we will feel very good about this arrangement until the next time we're away and Nick gets sick.  I tell myself that I would worry as much if it were Natalie who was ill, and I know that's true.  I guess it's just hard to let our children grow up.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/03/when-nick-is-ill-and-mum-is-away.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n Every doctor makes mistakes. But,  says physician Brian Goldman , medicine's culture of denial (and shame) keeps doctors from ever talking about those mistakes, or using them to learn and improve. Telling stories from his own long practice, he calls on doctors to start talking about being wrong.   In his recent  TEDX talk , Canadian physician and radio personality, Dr. Brian Goldman, called for a revamp of the culture of medicine.  He made a compelling argument to reinvent the mores in his profession that currently prohibit health care providers from admitting errors and most importantly, learning from those errors.   Last week, one of Nicholas' doctors made a medication error that caused our family to spend an uncomfortable night in the emergency room.  She apologized.  I drafted a suggested change in protocol that I thought might help to prevent any future errors in Nicholas' (or others') care, which she accepted graciously.  Perhaps this battleship of error denial is slowly beginning to turn around in the river. Today, Louise Kinross, editor of the special needs parenting blog/magazine \" Bloom \" shared with me the latest apparent turnaround in the Amelia Rivera case.  (Details of the case can be found in my previous posts.) Today, the Rivera family posted an update on the  Wolfhirschorn Awareness facebook page : Over the weekend, a meeting took place between a number of the key leaders of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the Riveras and wolfhirschhorn.org. The purpose of the meeting was to get an understanding of the chain of events that led to the  Brick Walls  posting. The meeting lasted a little over 90 minutes and the Riveras had an opportunity to tell their side of the story and the related concerns about Mia's needs and how CHOP handled the situation. CHOP agreed that the system is broken and that they are taking steps to fix the process. In addition to addressing Mia and the next steps with her transplant discussions, a few suggestions were made to CHOP about their involvement in a more macro-view of awareness around transplant rights for the disabled, and public and medical community education around the \"mentally-retarded\" phrase. CHOP agreed to follow up and communicate their action items by the end of this week. Mia and the Riveras are planning a visit to CHOP in the near future to determine CHOP's role in her transplant and her ongoing medical care. Once that meeting takes place, we will issue a statement on the status of Mia, her care, and CHOP's involvement moving forward. Nicholas has been on the receiving end of too many human errors in hospitals to list here.  The fact is that doctors and nurses ARE human.  Often, they are sleep deprived.  Mistakes happen.  But errors really do offer the opportunity for learning and changing, even if those errors lead to loss of life.  I'm with you, Dr. Goldman, because patients and their families can be team players too.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ted.com/talks/brian_goldman_doctors_make_mistakes_can_we_talk_about_that.html", "http://www.ted.com/talks", "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.com/2012/01/news-on-amelia-rivera-case.html", "https://www.facebook.com/wolfhirschhornawareness", "http://www.wolfhirschhorn.org/2012/01/amelia/brick-walls/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/01/medical-errors-breaking-culture-of.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThe ethics committee of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia must be feeling the heat.  Their decision to refuse three year old Amelia Rivera a kidney transplant because of her 'mental retardation' has kickstarted a vigorous and coordinated response in the worldwide community of parents of children with disabilities.  So far,  a petition to the hospital  has collected 27,811 signatures of those who would implore the Philadelphia paediatricians to reverse their decision on Amelia's transplant surgery.   I have been a member of online parenting support groups for many years.  I have made good friends of mothers and fathers of children similar to Nicholas.  I have never met these internet friends personally, but that doesn't change the fact that I pray for their children when they are ill and I look to my friends in this community for encouragement and strategic advice when I need it. One of the most devoted and wisest mothers I have met online is a woman called Rose.  This is what she wrote on one forum about the Amelia case: Amelia has an identified condition, which likely has a life span attached to it. My sons are undiagnosed, but that didn't stop medical and social services professionals from telling me not to expect my boys to live beyond the age of: 2, 5, 10, 13, 18, 21, etc. up to the present day. People defy the odds against them every day. But they have to be given a chance to defy those odds in the first place. To the social worker's query about who will administer Amelia's meds when she's in her 30's, my response would be, \"Wouldn't it be glorious if Amelia's kidney allowed her to live to be in her 30's? Or what if she lived to be 20? Or even 10? Isn't Amelia entitled to that opportunity?\" Who will take care of Amelia when she's in her 30's is a general question, isn't it? Her parents will have to plan for her future care, and whoever those persons are taking care of her will be responsible for her medication administration. Just as you have done for Nicholas, and every parent of a child with special needs must do. This social worker's concern is disingenuous. If Amelia's medical team presented solid reasons why medically Amelia isn't a good candidate for a transplant, then that would be worthy of consideration, of course. For example, if she is too fragile to survive the surgery, or if her condition would affect her body's acceptance of the kidney, or if she has a bleeding disorder, etc. Amelia's parents must be apprised of all medical obstacles to the transplantation, not left feeling that their daughter has no value, because of her condition. Rose is the parent of two adult men, both with an undiagnosed, progressive neuromuscular disease. One of her beloved sons passed away a few years ago; her other son is entirely dependent and lives at home with complex twenty-four nursing care provided by the family. Rose speaks from the battleground of love and dependency.  All physicians treating people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, should listen to parents like Rose. Otherwise, they risk forgetting that providing loving care for someone very dependent over time makes family members wiser and better equipped to make difficult treatment decisions.  Now, I'll sign that petition.  Tomorrow, I will blog about friendship amongst mothers.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.change.org/petitions/director-of-public-relations-allow-the-kidney-transplant-amelia-rivera-needs-to-survive"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/01/final-few-thoughts-on-story-about.html", "title": ""},

Today's Guardian  reports that people with disabilities are feeling the wrath of an able-bodied population suffering from recession, high unemployment and government ministers who label many of those on disability benefits as 'work-shy scroungers'.   Nicholas could never be accused of being a scrounger or being work-shy.  Recently, he applied for a job with EA Sports, suggesting that his disabilities give him the unique qualifications to evaluate Playstation Games for their useability by others like himself.  He suggested that payment in free games would be fair reimbursement for his work.  I often say to Nick, \"Never underestimate the benefits of a severe disability\".  He and I have learned that getting to the front of a line or meeting a celebrity are all easier with his visible impairments.  If Nick suffered from mental illness or another invisible disability, would he have the opportunities that he currently enjoys?  I don't know.  But I also wonder about what kind of reception he would receive these days in poorer areas of the UK.  The economy in Europe is going to 'hell in a hand basket'  - that much is clear.  But what happened to civil society?

Nick didn't go to the skills tournament or the all-star game - we bought a Senators seasons ticket package for Nicholas, so we told him that the All Star tickets were just too expensive at $400.  Luckily, the organizers of the tournament provided for folks like us and put on a \"Fanfair\", or exhibition about all things hockey.  You can see by the photos that a good time was had by all! Hockey means a lot to Nicholas - writing about it is the cornerstone of his Person Directed Planning process, or \"Path\".  Everyone on Nick's team has helped him think about his life goals and how to attain them.  One of Nick's dreams has always been to be a sports reporter.  He has a hockey blog called \" The Hockey Ambassador \", which he will be ramping up in the months leading up to the playoffs.  And he will be a roving reporter, tweeting live action results from the WWE Raw Live Event at the Scotiabank Centre in Ottawa on March 3.

{"date": "", "body": "\nSome months ago, before we left our diplomatic posting in London, my niece visited us.  Erin is a young investment banker who is searching for a professional path that offers a moral compass, weekends off, job satisfaction and the chance to indulge her other great passion - dance. Erin and her colleagues say, \"I can work 18 hours a day and put up with a lot of bad behaviour at the office, but I would rather not.\"  Anyone in the field of finance who reads this will be thinking, \"well, good luck Missie, you chose the wrong career!\"  (In fact, r esearch shows that in the field of finance, women make the largest sacrifices in their work/life balance. ) But wait.  Those people will not have heard of my friend  Herta von Steigel .  I first met Herta at a womens' networking event in London and I knew immediately that she would become my friend.  Herta is a banker who will not compromise her ethical OR her professional standards.  She made millions for Citibank and now is running her own sustainable energy fund in Africa,  Ariya Capital .   But the reason that I want to talk about Herta here is that she had a crazy, but superb idea.  Herta is a trustee of a disability charity in London and she decided to climb Mount Kilimanjaro with a group of people with disabilities from her charity.  Of course, each disabled climber had buddies, and there were porters to carry supplies.  Herta and her husband Hans funded the entire climb. And they didn't  stop there. They made a documentary film about the climb called \" The Mountain Within\" .  And then...Herta wrote a  book  by the same name describing all the lessons learned on the climb up Kilimanjaro and the application of those lessons to business.  'Failing fast and failing forward' is one of those lessons.   Herta says that when you fail, it's important to accelerate the failure in order to get it over with, learn lessons quickly and then change trajectory.  Use failure as a teaching tool and move forward, but do it as quickly as you can.  Everyone has failed at some point in their lives and of course, I am no exception.  I have failed spectacularly in my lifetime.  When I look back on my life, my imagination defaults to a visual metaphor - a throwback to my days as a theatre director.  When I think of 'me failing', I visualize myself walking down the street as a stylish, competent business person.  Suddenly, my heel catches in the sidewalk and breaks off.  \"Nevermind\", I think, no one will notice if I walk as if it's still there.  But, of course, I can't.  I trip and tear my stockings - my knee is bleeding.  Picking myself up, I dust off and continue walking, hoping no one will notice the gaping holes in my imaginary facade of absolute competence. This dream or visualization comes from a fear (or even an experience) of trying to repair the circumstances of failure when the writing is literally on the wall - failure is inevitable.   The problem is clear - I worry that I don't know how to 'fail forward'.  Of course, in the cold light of day, I reassure myself that I DO know how to fail forward and have done so lots of times.  Still, fear of failure is part of the human condition and so, I will continue to have these dreams of broken heels and bleeding knees.   I urge anyone who cares about inclusion, leadership, ethics and success to read \"The Mountain Within\" (and to see the wonderful film as well!)     Failing fast and failing forward is just one lesson that Herta teaches in her book.  There are many others and every one is applicable to success in life, business, being a mother, being a wife and being on a team of any kind, especially one that includes people with disabilities.                                                                                                                                            \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/01/family-or-fortune", "http://www.ariyacapital.com/index.php?page=herta-von-stiegel", "http://www.ariyacapital.com/index.php?page=about-ariya-capital", "http://www.themountainwithin.com/the-film/", "http://www.amazon.ca/Mountain-Within-Leadership-Lessons-Inspiration/dp/0071773061/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1319631007&sr=8-4"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/10/failure-and-other-fun-topics.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday morning, I attended a conference in Ottawa called  \"End Exclusion: A Celebration of Achievements\" .  It was a morning of lectures and lived experience relating to disability and poverty.   Our family is not poor, but we worry about money, especially because Jim has decided to retire from the Foreign Service and his last day of paid employment will be November 29th.  In the morning, I listened to Laurie Larson, the President of the  Canadian Association for Community Living , tell her story of mothering two sons with disabilities (plus another able-bodied son) while struggling to live modestly on her husband's salary.  Her story was one of isolation, frustration, determination, joy and despair - much like my own.  In the caregiving world, there are lots of us who nod our heads in recognition of shared experience.  Later in the morning, I heard about the disproportionate numbers of people with disabilities in Canada who are poor.  I listened as researchers from Quebec and Victoria picked apart the social policies that push those living on disability pension benefits into cycles of poverty.  There is no doubt that our researchers in the field of disability studies and poverty reduction know what the problems are.  Quebec has an impressive track record of social innovation and active citizenship incentives folded into their poverty reduction strategies.  Other provinces are still struggling to build consensus in order to kickstart their action plan. But it's not all bad news.  At lunch, I ran into Jack Styan, Managing Director of the  RDSP Resource Centre .  Anyone who has read my  book  or knows me will be rather tired of my banging on about the wonderfulness of this innovative savings tool for people with disabilities.   RDSP stands for Registered Disability Savings Plan - we have one for Nicholas and it's just like an RRSP, except that it's for Nick, not for our retirement.  It's a brilliant savings tool and not one of the provinces will cut back pension benefits for the recipient, even if you have a LOT of money in the plan.  Who says people with disabilities have to be poor? Earlier in the week, I went with Jim to two days of a three day retirement course offered by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Yesterday, Jim went to the third day (the psychology session!) and I opted for lectures on poverty and disability instead (not sure who made the better choice!).  Anyway, the retirement lectures were helpful, informative and optimistic.  We are very, very lucky that Jim has a pension, we have an RDSP and we have wills written that include a trust provision for Nick.    I feel optimistic that we will all be OK financially.  One disappointment is that I have very little benefit from Canada Pension.  Because I looked after the children, especially Nicholas, all of my 'working' life, I earned no CCP benefits.  I earned a tiny amount for the years up to the children's age of ten years, but so do all parents who stay at home looking after their children.  There is no provision for state pension benefits for those who stay home with their children with disabilities for an entire lifetime.  This is unfair and it has to change. In the afternoon, I opted out of the conference in favour of visiting Nicholas.  When I arrived, he was at the dining table with two helpers and plates of chinese take-away.  Nick is mostly tube fed, but he can eat a few bites of his favourite foods (like chicken balls and  poutine !) for pleasure.  Nick was busy planning a weekend outing to CD Warehouse to buy some new playstation games.  If there is a connect between disability and poverty, Nicholas doesn't know about it.  He just expects that all his family and friends will buy him whatever he wants.  As Laurie Larson, or any other mother would do, I put a damper on that attitude and told him that he could buy one new game.  And as the kicker, I told him, \"Eat the rest of your lunch, there are people starving in the world!\"  Of course, I learned that line from my mother.  Some things in life change and some things never do. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cacl.ca/action/events/end-exclusion-2011-celebration-achievements", "http://www.cacl.ca/", "http://rdspresource.ca/", "http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552788903", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/11/moneymoneymoney.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nWell, not really breaking up, but breaking apart.  At least that is what our family feels like, now that Nicholas is living away from home for the first time.  Like all transitions, this one has its stages.  First it was happy excitement.  That was followed by stoicism.  Now, we have tears and \"OK, this has been an interesting social experiment.  I want to come home now.  Mum, please, I want to come home.\" Jim and I visit Nick nearly every day.  Our extended family and close friends all visit for hockey games, playstation or just to hang out.  Nicholas is not lacking for company. I was thinking that it is more like this:  imagine that you have been in a bad car accident in China.  There are people taking care of you, making decisions about painful procedures that you do not understand.  No one speaks English.  I think it's like this for Nick - of course he understands what is being said, but everything is new.  Everything that is familiar is gone - poof.   Everyone will have played charades with the family at some point in their lives.  Inevitably, there are those who intuitively make connective leaps of imagination to guess impossibly complicated answers based on a few vague gestures.  Those are the winners.  Then there is the cousin or brother who stares at the words on the slip of paper, groans, laughs, begins to awkwardly count syllables, then gives up.  Nicholas is used to being surrounded by people in the former category.  We know all his little gestures, tongue clicks, eye rolls or hand movements - we can put together complicated messages using his secret code in no time at all.  We are his translators. I know that we will be OK, but right now we all feel a strong push and pull.  I know that visiting Nick every day gives him comfort, but is my hovering making his settling in more painful and less efficient?  Today, I have not visited Nicholas - I have had two routine doctor appointments, I've done the grocery shopping and I've cleaned the house.  All day long, I have worried.  Is my baby safe?  Is he happy?  Are his eyes glazed from the exhaustion of trying to communicate with people who do not understand his language? Yesterday, I gave a pep talk to Nick.  I said \"you are a great optimist.  You have never been faced with a challenge that you didn't meet.  We can do this, because we choose to.  Every day, we must choose to be happy and we must not choose to be miserable.  Each day, it's a choice.  Growing up hurts sometimes - that's why they call them growing  pains\".  Now,  I  must work at applying these lessons too.  Two years ago, I had to face this transition with Natalie when at 17, she crossed the ocean to attend university.  Now, I have to trust that my boy who is so dependent, will be alright without me.  There is no doubt about it, breaking up is hard to do. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/11/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n New scientific research  was reported today that showed people who suffer from chronic, long-term loneliness suffer the same damaging effects to health as those who smoke 15 cigarettes a day.  I have long been concerned with the scourge of loneliness, because I felt that Nicholas would be vulnerable to its awful effects without a strong social support network.  My colleagues at  Planned Lifetime Advocacy Networks, or PLAN  , work every day to ensure that those who might suffer from social exclusion will never do so because they are supported by a group of family and friends who love them.  The PLAN organization is a huge part of my life and is central to how we have crafted a good life for Nicholas. But today on my Facebook page was another idea about how to combat loneliness - learning to be alone.  Poet and filmmaker Andrea Dorfman created a  beautiful film  that extols the virtues of solitude and 'being happy your head', which is a world apart from the misery of loneliness.  In my book,  The Four Walls of My Freedom , I wrote a chapter about making friends with solitude - this is an idea that I began to learn about only when light appeared after bouts of depression in my adult life.  So, Andrea Dorfman's film got me thinking today, should we begin to think about teaching the techniques of 'being happy in your head' to those of us committed to social networks?  Is being alone and being happy essential to being a good friend?  Is it essential to listening to someone who cannot speak?   Eva Kittay  has written about the 'transparent self' of the good caregiver, or someone who has the capacity to subsume their own ego in order to completely know the needs of another.  I am beginning to think that my aspiration to become a transparent self is going to require a few more lessons in happy solitude. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leadership.ng/nga/articles/8010/2011/11/09/loneliness_more_damaging_addiction.html", "www.plan.ca", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7X7sZzSXYs&feature=youtu.be", "http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552789861/ref=tmm_pap_title_0", "http://www.stonybrook.edu/philosophy/faculty/ekittay/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/11/happy-solitude.html", "title": ""},

As if he doesn't do enough for our country every day, each year at about this time, Al asks a number of his colleagues to reflect on a question.   Last year, we all wrote about a trend or phenomenon we would like to see made more visible in 2011.   This year, Al usurped a metaphor from Wayne Gretzky, our national ice hockey hero (who could always predict where the puck would be on the ice) and asked, \"This year, what are you skating towards?\"   Here is my offering.  I encourage everyone to subscribe to Al's blog and to read the full complement of responses to Al's question for 2012.  They will be available to read early in the New Year.  What are you skating towards?  Frankly, I have no idea.  I am careening and I can\u2019t quite see where the winds of change are taking me.  Within the last four months, we have moved our family across the world, my husband retired from the diplomatic corps after thirty-seven years, and we helped our adult son relocate from the family home into a residence with nursing care.  In my book and my blogs, I write about disability, care in the community and our aging population.  Lucky that I have such rich material within my own four walls!  During the past few months, I described to a friend how I felt about the onslaught of change in my life - \u201cit\u2019s as if someone has removed all the floorboards from my house\u201d, I said.  \u201cIt\u2019s like I am walking on just the narrow joists and all the time, I worry about falling\u201d.   I know that others will write here about skating towards positive change, and I will be inspired.  But I would like to talk about \u2018defense\u2019 and not \u2018offense\u2019, to use another hockey metaphor.  A great defensive player also knows where the puck will be in order to stop a goal by the opposing team.   Over the last year, I have observed a pernicious trend, and in 2012, I will be skating defensively toward it.  Thanks to information technology, I have many friends all over the world who are also parents of children with disabilities.  One family, from Australia, I have known \u2018virtually\u2019 for many years - their son has developmental disabilities, is medically complex and has managed to survive over 77 hospitalizations in his 23 years of life.  This year, the professional advisory committee at their hospital took a unilateral decision that there would be no more ICU hospitalizations or resuscitation measures because these would \u2018not be in the best interest of the patient\u2019 and furthermore, they would be \u2018futile\u2019.  It was my guess that a meeting of hospital administrators had taken place that basically placed a cap on the public funds that one individual could or should consume in a lifetime - especially if that individual had development disabilities.  This is a story that I am hearing more and more from families the world over. In November of this year,  Louise Kinross, the editor of \u201cBloom \u201d, the Holland Bloorview family magazine, attended a conference on medical ethics and disability at McGill.  She reported that one neonatologist commented \u201cThere is a feeling among my colleagues \u2013 an unspoken and probably unconscious bias \u2013 between physical and mental disability. Sometimes neonatologists think if you're not perfect mentally, you're better off dead. But when it comes to physical disability, they will go a long way with interventions.\u201d  But also described at the McGill seminar was \u201c The Disability Paradox \u201d - that people with serious disabilities rate their lives as good or excellent while able-bodied people, particularly medical professionals, rate quality of life in people with disabilities as poor.   The elderly, especially those with dementia, are also in a risky situation.  In the absence of a strong and vocal personal support network, those who are vulnerable and voiceless risk becoming expendable, especially in a climate of austerity.  And I believe that negative attitudes toward those who are not employed or employable are growing. The worth of giving and receiving care is my 'defensive' strategy.   I believe that we urgently need a public conversation in Canada about a national ethic of care - one with a sustainable business plan.  If the 'product' in the business plan is the wellbeing of those who require care, how do we value that product as a nation?  Who performs the tasks of caring and who pays are the questions that require honest answers for all stakeholders.  And if we truly value the wellbeing of our citizens with care needs, governments need to nurture and enable innovation in social enterprise to operate in this sphere.  The giving and receiving of care IS a commodity, but so is every other facet of daily life.  I value the wellbeing of the vulnerable people in my family and I know I'm not alone.  The giving and receiving of care should be a valuable commodity for everyone. My hair is white and my son requires 24 hour nursing care.  My mother turns 90 this year.  Scratch the surface of Canadian society - my family is not that unusual.  Careening toward the future is not a good way to score goals and win the game OR make public policy.  We need  an honest and public appraisal of our strengths and capabilities in the arena.   In my family, we rate our life as excellent.  I want to make sure that we keep it that way, so in 2012 I'll be keeping my eye on the puck and designing my next defensive strategy. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://newsite.plan.ca/about-plan/test/al-etmanski/", "http://www.aletmanski.com/al-etmanski/becoming-visible-2011/", "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.com/2011/12/fate-worse-than-death.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10390038"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/12/new-years-reflection-for-al-etmanski.html", "title": ""},

Above is a photo someone snapped that evening of Nick's new extended family!  You can tell by their smiles that they are kind and fun - a great combination of qualities! After much hugging and collection of multiple bags, we assembled our convoy of vehicles.  I rode in the Ottawa Rotary Home wheelchair van with Nick and everyone followed to see our young man's new digs. We were all excited and nervous, but happy.  Natalie had said her goodbyes to London, Jim was contemplating retirement from the foreign service, I had plans to write more and Nicholas was moving out of our home into his own.  Our family was moving away from a home that was not really our home, although we tried our best to make it so.  Jim's job as Canada's High Commissioner to the UK meant that we lived in the official residence.  The house and its furnishings were beautiful, but we were just temporary tenants who shared the surroundings happily.  The real landlords were all Canadians. Every time our family has packed up to move, I have talked about the meaning of 'home' to the children.  As moving day approached, they felt keenly the loss of friends, cottage traditions and familiarity.  \"Home is wherever we are\", I would say, \"we carry it inside of ourselves.  All we need for home is to be together\".   Now that Nicholas is living in his new home (which doesn't feel like home to him yet), we have to rethink our ideas about our home too.  Natalie now considers her home to be Toronto - she has no romantic memories of her younger years in Ottawa.  As a 'global nomad' kid, it's no wonder that she is majoring in transnational studies at Trinity College.  \"Where are you from?\" has always been a complicated question for her.   So yesterday, I was visiting Nicholas and we were planning a visit 'home' this Saturday.  Jim had suggested that we no longer call our house 'home' when we are talking to Nick.  Rather, we should name it 'the old house', or 'Tillbury Avenue'.  We are trying out new language for these tricky new circumstances - Nick's place is variously called 'your apartment', 'Rotary Home' or 'your place'.  Yesterday, I slipped and referred to our planned destination this weekend as a visit 'home'.  I corrected myself and we all had a chat about why I don't want to use that word now.  We need a new language for this new life and we are being very, very careful with 'home'.  Because HOME is a loaded word and we don't quite know what it means yet.    \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A8VZiicQpPs/Ts0Cu88wpqI/AAAAAAAAADI/1biXYHqzLZs/s1600/320122_10150270979756227_503011226_8278218_4245437_n.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/11/home-is-loaded-word.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nI've been taking a break from blogging recently.  Every so often, I begin to feel brittle and sore from the jostling of everyday life - I feel as if someone has removed the skin from my body.  On the outside is flesh, nerve endings, sinew and muscle.  If a dog pants near my leg, it hurts.  I flinch if I brush by the kitchen counter. I think it's all the change in our family life, along with Christmas.  And then there were the events of this week.   Last weekend, we were asleep at 12:30am when the telephone rang.  It was Nick's nurse who reported that a beeping sound was issuing from his implanted pain pump.  She had googled the pump and found that this particular sound indicates a 'critical alarm' - either the pump is dangerously low in medication or it's malfunctioned for some other reason.  Either way, it means a trip to the Emergency Room.  So, we spent the night there waiting while the doctors tried unsuccessfully to locate any information on the pump and what to do about this odd young man and his mysterious pump.  In the morning, our own doctor came and refilled the pump with some medication to carry us over till Monday when a proper refill could be done.  Medication errors happen and we are fortunate that they are very rare.  All's well that ends well.   Fast forward to Thursday.  When I arrived to visit Nicholas, I noticed in his chart a note about a swelling under his right arm.  I lifted Nick's shirt and sure enough, there was a swollen ridge, red, hot and sore to the touch.  The doctor had been called and when he arrived later (yes, our amazing GP does house calls for Nick!), he lanced the thing and dressed it.  I felt so badly for poor Nick.  But although he shouted and cursed during the procedure (fair enough!), he smiled and asked for a new playstation game when the whole thing was over.  That's my boy - he's a great entrepreneur. I feel recovered enough today to write down some thoughts about an  internet story  that is making the blood boil of every parent in the child neurology internet fora.  A little girl called Amelia was turned down for a kidney transplant by physicians at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia because she has a developmental delay.  Apparently her quality of life came into question and the ethics department of the hospital could not sanction prolonging the life of someone so apparently diminished.  A quick reading of my last post on this blog will tell you that I and others have recognized this pernicious trend in medical professionals to limit the treatment options for those with cognitive impairments and it's a trend I think is very, very dangerous.  One comment on  Amelia's family blog  about the whole mess warned \"this is the beginning of the death panels\".  I don't agree.  This has nothing to do with such simple notions of widespread limits on treatment due to fiscal belt tightening.  No, this is an issue to do with  disability , particularly cognitive disability.  There is a current trend in the medical profession and amongst bioethicists to downgrade the worth of a life lived with cognitive impairments.  And those prejudices are playing out in transplant committees as evidenced by Amelia's story.   I will put my skin back on and start writing about this.  Today. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wolfhirschhorn.org/2012/01/amelia/brick-walls/", "http://www.wolfhirschhorn.org/2012/01/amelia/brick-walls/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/01/ethics-of-amelias-transplant-story.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nWell, today we finally had Nicholas' pain pump refill.  It went without a hitch, but I know the funding issues aren't solved yet.  For now though, we have a reprieve. The past few weeks have felt as if I was inside an installation at the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology that I used to visit with the children.  Their favourite part of the centre was called the \" Krazy Kitchen \".  It was a practical lesson in optical illusion - cupboards only a few feet away seemed much further.  The floor appeared flat, but walking on it revealed a steep tilt.  In the Krazy Kitchen, nothing was as it seemed.  Everyone reacted in a similar fashion - nervous laughter and clenched muscles.   The human body, mind and spirit do not like it if they can't predict next steps.  Chaos frays nerves like nothing else. So I take careful note of people who offer lessons in peaceful living, even amid chaotic surroundings.  Someone I pay close attention to is a man called Glen.  Glen packs groceries at my local supermarket.  He's about my age and is often seen wearing a neon yellow vest, stooped a little as he pushes long lines of trolleys into their place.  Glen has worked at my grocery store for many years and he has a learning disability.  Most people know him and call him by name. I notice the effect that he has on people, including me.  Last week, I was so worried about Nicholas - his pump medication, whether or not he could be happy living away from home, and if his new helpers understood his efforts to communicate.  Anyway, on Friday I needed groceries and it was raining.  \"Damn, just my luck\", I thought.   I left my trolley on the sidewalk and walked to my car.  When I pulled up beside my purchases, there was Glen waiting to help me transfer my bags into the back of the car.  Glen said \"I like the rain.  It's good for the trees, the flowers, the bushes, the grass....\"  And I said, \"Yes and the ducks and the rabbits\".  \"The rain is good for everyone\" smiled Glen.  I had to admit as we both looked at the sky that it was true.  \"Glen, you are the sunshine in my day!\" I said and we both laughed. I know how many people appreciate the tonic of Glen's gentle ways - I see them smile and chat with him at the store.  But I wonder about his life after working hours.  Where does he live?  Does he have family members at home who love him?   In the province of Ontario, there are 10,000 vulnerable people waiting for supportive residential placements.  Maybe one of them is Glen.  I believe that I am not alone in feeling a longing for the kind of companionship that someone like Glen offers....and there's a programme that we can build on this longing that might make a dent in that residential waiting list.  In the UK, that programme is called  NAAPS .  It's a bit like foster parenting, but for adults.  So perhaps it's a little like a dating agency too, because everyone has something to gain from living together happily.  If we had NAAPS in Canada and Glen signed up, I would recommend him as someone who brings gentleness, contentment and optimism to any household where there are people who appreciate those rare elements of life.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/science-zone-crazy-kitchen.cfm", "http://www.naaps.org.uk/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/10/glen-my-grocery-packer.html", "title": ""},

In the morning, we cancelled the wheelchair bus that was meant to take Nicholas to our house for his first visit to the old 'homestead' where he lived before our family moved to England in 2006.  It wasn't Nick's nerves that made us cancel our plans, it was his bad cold. Colds are unpleasant for anyone, but for Nick, it's a bit more than just a nuisance.  All of his carers are watching his fluid intake and listening to his chest for any ominous crackles.  Those sounds could mean pneumonia. This morning, after a restless and long night in bed, the nurse did detect a few crackles, but they disappeared after getting up for a relaxing bath.  Just moving around helped to dislodge the fluid in Nick's lungs.   Tonight, Nick's uncle is with him watching the Ottawa hockey team play on TV and tomorrow our wonderful GP will make a house call to see whether or not Nick should have anti-biotics.

{"date": "", "body": "\nA few months ago, I attended a conference of women leaders at Lucy Cavendish College in Cambridge, England.  Without exception, every woman reported being plagued by the sensation of feeling that she should be in two places at once.  If she was in the boardroom, she worried that her rightful place was in the park, playing with her children.  If a CEO took an extra hour in the morning to sew a costume for her child's school play, she worried that every stitch was potentially a threat to her hard-won career.  Serious business professionals are not supposed to need sleep, food, love or families.  They most certainly do not sew costumes for school plays.  The one (I hoped) optimistic comment that I made to the group that day in Cambridge was something I heard Gloria Steinem say a long time ago.  \"Girls today\", she remarked, \"can do everything they want in life.  Just not all at the same time.\" I am not, nor have a I ever been a CEO.  I am a mother who has sewn a few costumes and played a lot in parks with my children.  But I have longed for a responsible, adult role as one longs to visit a beautiful foreign country.  Now that my son and my daughter have moved away from home though, I identify with these women leaders.  I worry about my loved ones who cannot always take care of themselves without my help, my cooking, or my sense of knowing them so well that often, spoken words are unnecessary.   My friend told me that when she experienced the devastation of a natural disaster, at first she worried that she should be doing a myriad of vital tasks all at the same time - until she realized that perhaps she was learning an important lesson for living through  her dire circumstances.  In an instant, everything can change.  Very little of value that we rely upon as safe and predictable is actually any of those things.  Perhaps living in the present moment is more than a new age phrase - it is an aspiration that has the potential of giving meaning to our lives.   So, for this evening, I am going to enjoy a hot bath, say a prayer of thanks for an impossibly beautiful weekend with my family at our cottage up north and another one that Nicholas is happy and healthy in his new home.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/10/thinking-about-nownow.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nUncle. Tap out. I don't want to play anymore. I give up. This morning, the doctor called and said that she was leaving town at noon (returning next week) and had no more time to deal with our prescription situation.  She had found someone in Moncton, New Brunswick, who could prepare Nick's pump drug mixture, but we had to pay $2,000.00 for it.  This pharmacist in Moncton would call me in an hour and I would give him my credit card details.   By noon, I still hadn't heard from the Moncton, so I called them.  The pharmacist in question had left on holiday till next week. I called the pharmacy here in Ottawa, only to learn that Nick's medication uses a powder form of the drug that is not covered by the government funding plan for people with disabilities.  I called said government funding plan offices today four times, leaving urgent messages and never heard back. It's now 4:57am and Jim and I are both sleepless and nauseated by the prospect of being forced to consider paying tens of thousands of dollars (Nicholas requires refills of his pump every five weeks) for our sweet son to be free of pain. So, we have decided that enough is enough.  We are going to forget Moncton.  We are going to call the pharmacist here in Ottawa and tell her to contact the UK hospital and get advice on how to achieve the best possible mixture, using drugs that are covered by the Ontario government funding plan.  That is the only practical, sustainable solution.  We hope it works. Now, I am going to put on headphones and listen to the uncensored version of C. Lo Green's \"Forget You\" at a volume of \"eleven\", as Nigel Tuffnell would say. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/09/uncle.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nWhen people see Nicholas' belly for the first time, they are usually slightly alarmed.  That's because there is a large, circular protrusion of the skin just above his waist on the left side.  Nick and I always deadpan that he has an extra hockey puck handy any time if anyone wants to play shinny.   The circular object under Nick's skin is a computer.  It's a complicated drug delivery system that drips powerful medication into the spinal cord.  The titanium pump is controlled by an external computer (the doctor actually places the computer mouse on Nick's stomach at refill times) and a catheter under the skin connects the device to the spinal cord.  A mixture of three medications runs in the pump - a muscle relaxant, a pain killer and a spinal anaesthetic.   Of course, before returning to Ottawa, getting the pump refilled was in my top five priority problems to solve before I could smile about the move.  In fact, to my surprise, it was easy.  We located a physician and a pharmacy who all seemed to take Nick's pump in their stride.  They all agreed to help and I was thrilled. Fast forward to last week.  For our first refill appointment this side of the Atlantic, we had a rather large entourage.  We were all shepherded into the office and the doctor finally entered and introduced herself.  The first thing she said was, \"I'm sorry, I cannot refill your pump today.  The pharmacy sent the wrong medication in unmarked vials.  It's a good thing that I didn't inject it.  We need to find a new pharmacy that can fill this prescription.  It's very complicated.\"  She went on say that another of her patients has a similar mixture and that because he moved from Edmonton, he continues to source his prescription from that city.  Perhaps we could use the same one.  It seemed strange to me that we would have to go across our huge country to get this drug, but I have seen Nicholas in withdrawal before and I would rather die than see it again. Yesterday morning, the doctor called and said that we were going with Edmonton.  \"OK\", I said.  In the afternoon, I saw the light flashing on my phone with a voicemail message.  I dialled to listen and heard a pharmacist from Edmonton tell me that he couldn't fill this prescription until at least October 17 - a full week after the pump runs out and begins to beep inside Nick's body.  They would not fill the script without first testing for stability of the drug mixture and that takes two weeks.  By the 17th, Nicholas would be in severe withdrawal, full of uncontrollable spasm and pain.   So.  Clearly, Edmonton is out of the question.  I have left urgent messages at all the offices of everyone concerned.  I have emailed as well.  Now I wait.

{"date": "", "body": "\n This is a speech that I gave to the Diversity Group at Merrill-Lynch, Bank of America in London on August 15, 2011. It combines experiences and ideas that I have been reflecting on lately. \r \r I am a mother, an author and the wife of the Canadian High Commissioner to the UK. This is my family \u2013 my husband Jim and my daughter Natalie who is 19 and a student at the University of Toronto. My son Nicholas is 22 and is disabled with cerebral palsy. Until Nicholas was 18, I provided him with almost all of his nursing care. Since coming to London in 2006 though, we have professional nurses 24/7 in our home and this sudden change in my own circumstances allowed me to reflect on what it means to offer care to a loved one who is completely dependent.\r \r And Nicholas IS dependent. He has low vision, is non-verbal, is tube fed, and he has no functional control over any part of his body. To borrow a banking term, Nick looks like the embodiment of deficit. But those who see him that way would be wrong. Nicholas is sensitive, intelligent, funny, ironic and unashamedly optimistic. \r \r I have been thinking about what I could say to a group of bankers that might be interesting and helpful. The markets are in flux \u2013 some might say that we are on the verge of a new economic and political world order. Last week, parts of London were burning and we felt suddenly hostage to lawlessness. So, with this backdrop of chaos, I thought perhaps I could say a few words about resilience.\r \r Caring for someone who is completely dependent and medically complex feels very chaotic. It is an experience that has a daily, primary lesson of humility. When Nicholas was a baby, I believed that as a person with higher education, a will of steel and fierce mother love, I could \u2018organize\u2019 and execute a plan to overcome the effects of Nicholas\u2019 cerebral palsy. Believe me, I can say years later that I have learned my lessons in humility very well.\r \r After five years in London, we are packing to return home. Our posting is almost finished. On August 29th, we fly home to Ottawa and Nicholas will go directly from the airport to his new dwelling place, The Ottawa Rotary Home. For the first time, Nick won\u2019t be living with us. The Rotary Home is a beautiful new residence with caring and clever staff. I know Nicholas will eventually be very happy and very safe there. But for now, we are all nervous and worried. After thirty seven years in the diplomatic corps, my husband will retire and look for other opportunities. The future for our family is full of unkowns.\r \r Recently, I heard the British social scientist Charles Leadbeater say, \u201cYour vantage point determines everything you see.\u201d An analysis of anyone\u2019s vantage point can help provide insight into what is within personal control and what is not. And in my experience, an important element of resilience is appreciating that difference and then making a decision to see something good. Even just one thing. Nicholas\u2019 disability and his chronic pain have tested the resilience of every member of our family. In my book, I tell a story that I think demonstrates how resilience can be achieved by understanding your vantage point. The story is called \u201cWelcome to Holland\u201d and it was written by  Emily Perl Kingsley , a Sesame Street writer and mother of a son with Down Syndrome. I think \u201cWelcome to Holland\u201d is a good analogy for any set of circumstances that feels terribly chaotic and impossible \u2013 circumstances that call for resilience.\r \r \u201cWhen you\u2019re going to have a baby, it\u2019s like planning a fabulous vacation trip \u2013 to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It\u2019s all very exciting.\r After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The stewardess comes in and says, \u201cWelcome to Holland.\u201d \r \u201cHolland???!!!\u201d you say. \u201cWhat do you mean Holland? I signed up for Italy! I\u2019m supposed to be in Italy! All my life I dreamed of going to Italy!\u201d\r But there\u2019s been a change in the flight plan. They\u2019ve landed in Holland and there you must stay. \r The important thing is that they haven\u2019t taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It\u2019s just a different place.\r So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you never would have met.\r It\u2019s just a different place. It\u2019s slower paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you\u2019ve been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around\u2026.and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills\u2026and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts. But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy\u2026and they\u2019re all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say \u201cYes, that\u2019s where I was supposed to go. That\u2019s what I had planned.\u201d \r And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away, because the loss of that dream is a very significant loss. But\u2026if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn\u2019t get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things\u2026about Holland.\r \r It is my experience that the time people spend at the airport trying to get back to Italy will depend on their vantage point \u2013 those who leave the airport first have honed their ability to pick apart those things they can and cannot change as well as their determination to see something good.\r \r Last week, I had a most interesting conversation with my son Nicholas. On our to-do list before leaving London are two three hour skype interviews with the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services. These interviews are part of their process of assessment for social care funding. To prepare, I did a little research into the type of questions they might ask Nicholas and I found these examples: \"What are your dreams?\" \"What do you think other people like best about you?\" Nicholas uses an Ipad application called Proloquo2Go to communicate and it's slow going. But having an existential conversation with Nicholas is worth the wait. When I asked Nick what he thought others liked best about him, I was surprised and intrigued by his response. \"Different\" he chose from a long list of adjectives. \"You mean your disability?\", I asked. \"Yeah\", he said. \"So, you think that people like you because of your disability, because you are different?\" \"Yeah.\" Still wanting to explore this idea, I queried \"what is it about your disability that you think people like?\" \"Still.\" was Nick's reply. \"Wow, I think you're right\", I told him. \"You are a great listener. You don't run off when people are talking to you. You are very perceptive.\" The irony is that I suspect those same qualities are what he likes least about himself.\r \r Next, I asked \"What are your dreams?\" Nick's response tells alot about his character. After lots of stops and starts, I finally understood his response. \"I want to go on a roadtrip with my old friend Adam to find the  Ultimate Warrior \". For non-officionados of the World Wrestling Entertainment, the Ultimate Warrior is the loopiest wrestler in the history of that organization and for the past ten years or so, he is has disappeared from the public eye. Nick and I burst out laughing and googled more of the Ultimate Warrior's crazy rants on YouTube. \"Wait till the Ministry of Social Services hears your dream!\", I laughed, \"they'll have to fund it!\"\r It is absolutely true that some people like Nicholas because he is different \u2013 his disability certainly gets him a lot of attention. And I think people do appreciate his stillness. I do. \r \r Parenting is a form of service \u2013 and caring for a child who will always be completely dependent is extreme parenting. Central to surviving it is giving up on the choosing self. To relinquish choice and be left in the zone of stillness is an interesting and strangely liberating experience. That\u2019s why I called my book \u201cThe Four Walls of My Freedom\u201d. \r \r Facing adversity and facing the unknown require two things \u2013 NOT trying to change the unchangeable and seeing something good from a given vantage point. It\u2019s a decision to do those two things and then to put one foot in front of the other.\r \r Thank you for giving me this opportunity to share my reflections and experiences.\r \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Kingsley", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4PmIUtXIHc"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/08/resilience-what-does-it-mean.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nThe following is from a letter that I wrote to support the work of a Professor at the University of Bath (UK) who is also an inventor and a Dad of a six year old lad who is disabled with cerebral palsy. I met Dr. Tim Adlam at the International Festival of Conferences on Caregiving, Disability, Ageing and Technology (FICCDAT) where I was the festival keynote speaker on October 6, 2011, in Toronto, Canada. Tim told me about a concept that he wanted to pursue involving a tactile, multi-sensory object that could be used for two people to \u2018communicate\u2019 without the use of words. When touched, banged or stroked, the object would give sound, light or other sensory feedback that could be experienced by the second person simultaneously. Taking turns, each person could experience the effects of the other\u2019s handling of the object. In this way, a kind of conversation could take place involving even non-verbal people, including those with cognitive disabilities or dementia. Much has been studied about the lack of personhood assigned to people with severe disabilities, especially those residing in institutional settings. A device that would facilitate a shared experience of simultaneous exploration and discovery could, potentially, change carers\u2019 attitudes toward their charges, possibly leading to more positive outcomes in staff/client relationships. In this morning's  Telegraph , I happened to see an article about a \"profoundly\" brain-damaged woman, who relations say should be allowed to die, but who sometimes displays \"a bit of a smile\" when being gently teased about men, a carer told a High Court judge yesterday. The lawyer representing the relations said the woman's family feels that she would not want to live a life \"dependant on others\".  This is not the first case of its kind, where family members are pitted against each other or against the state in a fight to continue sustaining the life of someone very dependent vs \"letting nature take its course\" by removing hydration and sustenance. Often, as in this case, someone has brought the case who is so averse to witnessing dependency that they equate it with a loss of dignity so great that they no longer see personhood in their beloved relative. In my book \" The Four Walls of My Freedom \", I rely heavily on the work of Eva Kittay to pick apart issues relating to dependency and how an aspiration to the idea of independence harms many people with disabilities as well as those ageing with dementia.  If a woman smiles when being teased about men, is this enough to claim personhood and a life worth saving? I think it is. Our challenge is to explore how to spin this exchange between a highly dependent woman and her carer into a deeper conversation. For this, we look to inventors such at Tim Adlam. And of course, Eva Kittay who will guide us in our thinking about what it is to be human.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/braindamaged-woman-shows-smile-16025687.html", "http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552788903"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/07/personhood-toys-and-euthanasia.html", "title": ""},

We received an email from \"Team Warrior\" that confirmed Nick's win and asked for his mailing address so that an alternate Ultimate prize could be posted.  VIP tickets for a live event in Chicago on March 23 were the grand prize and Nick cannot travel because of his chronic pain.  Yesterday, Nick and I composed the following letter to Team Warrior.   I have thought a lot about what prizes from Team Warrior might be on my wish list.  One thing that I thought of was an interview with the Warrior over the phone or skype.  I have always wanted to be a sports journalist and I have a bit of experience in that regard.  I was the sports reporter for my high school newspaper and I have a hockey blog called The Hockey Ambassador (http://thehockeyambassador.blogspot.com/).  (The title is a play on words because my Dad was the Canadian Ambassador in the UK http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_R._Wright).  Of course the Warrior would pre-approve all my questions and give me advice on where such an interview could be allowed in print, including possibly on my blog.  My other choice for an ultimate prize would be any piece of original artwork by the Warrior.  I  think he's a terrific artist. For your background information, here is a bit about me: I am  a huge fan of wrestling and especially of the Warrior.  I am  23 years old and disabled with cerebral palsy (a physical disability).  This affects the control that I have over movement, vision, and speech.  Even though my disability is considered 'severe', I have perfect verbal comprehension, and an incredible memory.   In other words, I understand everything being said.   I have completed high school as well three online college courses including one called \u201cThe Study of Sport Online\u201d.  In my final year of high school, I won an award called \"Spirit of the Capital Youth Award for Academic Perseverance\" (ie Warrior Attitude).  Currently, I am learning about meditation - does the Warrior meditate by any chance?   My goal is to be a volunteer wrestling writer and reporter.  I am going to a WWE wrestling event (not televised) this Saturday night in my hometown of Ottawa, Canada and I am going to tweet results to a wrestling website.   A bit more about how I communicate:   When I was younger, I  used a 'speaking computer' with head switches to communicate (something like the astro-physicist Stephen Hawking uses).  The switches and computer were mounted to my  wheelchair.  Because I spend less time in my chair now due to chronic pain, I no longer use this system to communicate.    We are working on building a new system called Proloquo2Go on the Ipad.   Now, I use this combined with a few spoken words including a perfectly clear \"yes\" and \"no\" to great advantage.  With someone asking me 'twenty questions', I can communicate complex ideas.  I thought about using a computer voice for the competition, but decided against it.  The computer voice just did not have the 'warrior attitude.  People who know me well, have an easy time understanding me and if the Warrior was able to call me for an interview, there would be someone here to help interpret.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate in the contest and I'm thrilled to have won.  Luckily, I have a lot of friends in the UK and in Canada who helped me win.  Absolutely anything from the Warrior would be very gratefully received. Thanks so much, and by the way, I Always Believe Yours truly,  Nicholas Wright \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2012/02/you-can-get-what-you-want-you-just-have.html", "title": ""},

For some months now, I have been in talks with the Ontario government about Nicholas' care and I think that we have come to a happy solution - we agreed that Nicholas will go to live at the Ottawa Rotary Home, a gorgeous, brand new respite facility for young adults with complex care needs. At some point in the future, another residential opportunity might present itself, but for now, we are happy that Nick doesn't have to live at a hospital. There are hundreds of details to sort out. All of Nick's equipment here in London runs on 220 volt electricity rather than 110. The medical community in Canada operates differently than it does here - no more specialists for epilepsy, pain, palliative care or rheumatology. Nicholas will be managed by the same GP who managed his care before we arrived in the UK, a kind, intrepid and gifted diagnostician. I feel relieved and grateful with those arrangements. My current to-do list relates to the flight and transportation to and from airports. Will Nicholas be able to sit on board the aircraft comfortably? How will we manage the medications to allow for a five hour time difference? I am working on these tasks in a sensible way (I think) - one at a time. We are getting there. I haven't begun yet, however, to confront the idea of Nicholas living outside our home. I haven't begun to imagine our old house in Ottawa without him. I have kept my head down and concentrated on the tasks at hand. Nicholas is going to the only place in our home city that can care for him safely. It takes a lot of people and high tech equipment to keep my young man alive, healthy and engaged. I know that now we cannot meet Nicholas' needs at home. It is physically impossible for Jim and me. Nicholas is at the forefront of the first generation of highly complex and completely dependent young people who have survived against all odds far beyond their predicted lifespan. There is no policy, programme or service anywhere in the world that is ready for this demographic. Everyone is scrambling to figure out how to meet this unexpected and very great need. How does Nicholas feel about his imminent move? He's excited now and he'll probably be a little nervous closer to our move. But he knows that I have bought a beer fridge for beside his bed and tickets for ten Ottawa Senators hockey games this season in the wheelchair section. He also knows that we live ten minutes away by car and that I will stay with him at Rotary Home until he tells me to go away and leave him alone. So all fingers are crossed in our family for a smooth transition. There will be lessons learned, no doubt some of them hard in this move. Change is hard, but change is good. Wish us luck.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/07/time-has-come.html", "title": ""},

I am at the country house that my grandmother built - \"the cottage\", we call it. It is the home of my most treasured memories of safety in the loving relationships of our family. In my dream, a stranger has fixed the window behind the curtain so that they could get in when we were not there. An unknown intruder has access to my santuary.\r \r After five years in London, we are packing to return home. Everywhere there are piles of books, crockery and photo frames with post-it notes hastily affixed, shouting orders of \"Sea shipment!\" or \"Medical supplies - do not pack!\" or \"Belongs to the High Commission, leave alone!\". The packers arrive the day after tomorrow.\r \r On August 29th, we fly home to Ottawa and Nicholas will go directly from the airport to his new dwelling place, The Ottawa Rotary Home. The Rotary Home is a beautiful new residence with caring and clever staff. I know Nicholas will eventually be very happy and very safe there. But for now, we are all nervous and worried.\r \r We have two three hour skype interviews coming up with the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services. These interviews are part of their new Supports Scale process of assessment for social care funding. To prepare for those interviews, I did a little research into the type of questions they might ask Nicholas and I found these examples: \"What are your dreams?\" \"What do you think other people like best about you?\"\r \r Nicholas uses an Ipad application called Proloquo2Go to communicate and it's slow going. But having an existential conversation with Nicholas is worth the wait. When I asked Nick what he thought others liked best about him, I was surprised and intrigued by his response. \"Different\" he chose from a long list of adjectives. \"You mean your disability?\", I asked. \"Yeah\", he said. \"So, you think that people like you because of your disability, because you are different?\" \"Yeah.\" Still wanting to explore this idea, I queried \"what is it about your disability that you think people like?\" \"Still.\" was Nick's reply. \"Wow, I think you're right\", I told him. \"You are a great listener. You don't run off when people are talking to you. You are very perceptive.\" The irony is that I suspect those same qualities are what he likes least about himself. But I will probe further today.\r \r Next, I asked \"What are your dreams?\" Nick's response tells alot about his character. After lots of stops and starts, I finally understood his response. \"I want to go on a roadtrip with my old friend Adam to find the  Ultimate Warrior \". For non-officionados of the World Wrestling Entertainment, the Ultimate Warrior is the loopiest wrestler in the history of that organization and for the past ten years or so, he is has disappeared from the public eye. Nick and I burst out laughing and googled more of the Ultimate Warrior's crazy rants on YouTube. \"Wait till the Ministry of Social Services hears your dream!\", I laughed, \"they'll have to fund it!\"\r \r Later on in the evening, Jim, Natalie and I watched the news. London is burning. Friends who live in Hackney and Croyden dodged missiles and infernos.\r \r The old is burning - safety is a memory.

Yesterday, Anne and I were talking about ageing. \"I wanted to talk to you about something you said in your book that I found so interesting\", she said. \"It's the idea that when we get old we will look after each other.\" For a minute, I wasn't sure what Anne meant. But then I remembered a section in the Eldercare chapter of my book that relates to a unique programme in the US state of Maine where seniors barter services and skills to help each other free of charge. Anne asked, \"Do you think that we are raising a generation of children who have never been taught the skill of nurturing? It's not that our children are necessarily spoiled, but we have given them so much and we asked for so little in return.\" For a minute, we both stood silently, reflecting on this surprising and disturbing possibility. \"I don't know\" was all I could think of to say. But overnight, I have been reflecting more on this idea. I think Anne has a point here and it is that we need to teach the skills of giving and receiving care to our young people. Where should children learn these skills? At school? At home? At church? Eva Kittay, the moral philosopher and mother of an adult daughter with severe developmental disabilities would maintain that this type of education will never take place in a society that demonizes dependency of any kind. The coming to grips with dependency issues and how to manage caring for each other is a political issue, I believe. Perhaps an entire generation of voting seniors caring for each other will shine a light on this vital area of the political landscape.

{"date": "", "body": "\nI felt so privileged last evening to find myself standing in the great hall of Marlborough House, home of the Commonwealth Secretariat in London. It wasn't the cobalt blue and gold of the ceiling or the marble inlay of the flooring that made me feel like the luckiest girl in the world. It was that I was chatting about issues of justice with a diminutive octogenarian of Indian origin - Amartya Sen. Anyone who knows my book and and my blog will know that Sen's work is the cornerstone of my thinking. Sen's latest offering to those struggling with what to make of societies beset by poverty and violence is published by the Commonwealth Secretariat and titled \" Peace and Democratic Society \". Sen is its editor. In his new book, Sen asks us to consider the politics of identity. He asks us to see ourselves as members of a variety of groups and belonging to all of them. He writes, \"The same person can be, without any contradiction, a South African citizen, of Asian origin, with Indian ancestry, a Christian, a socialist, a woman, a vegetarian, a jazz musician, a doctor, a feminist, a heterosexual, a believer in gay and lesbian rights, a jazz enthusiast, and one who believes that the most important problem that the world faces today is to make cricket more popular across the globe, breaking the spell of 'silly' games like baseball. ....There is no reason to think that whatever civilisational identity a person has - religious, communal, regional, national or global - must invariably dominate over every other relation or affiliation a person may have.\" (pg.12) It is single identities, either racial or religious, that most often foment violence, such as in the case of Protestant v Catholic in Northern Ireland, or Muslim v Christian. Multiple identities give us individually and collectively, a chance to find shared experiences of being human as well as common objectives. Sen decries the interfaith movement as being at its core divisive, because it is based on the single identities of faith groups. This idea is very interesting for people with disabilities and their families - or for that matter, anyone else with perceived differences who is struggling for place and belonging. Take the case of my son, Nicholas Wright. One could easily say (and they do!) that he is a young adult with severe, multiple disabilities.  Or , one could say that he is a young adult, male, Canadian, keen Ottawa Senators fan, son, brother, cousin, wheelchair user, heterosexual romantic who values political incorrectness. Listening to Sen's keynote address last night, I wondered about the hierarchy of identities. How could we fail to rank identities on the basis of the power that we perceive to be inherent in each of those roles? The example that I thought of was a CEO who is also drug addicted. Couldn't this be a cause to 'choose' the most powerful identity in the list and just go with it, to the exclusion of those roles we deem to be less powerful? After the speech, I posed this question to Sen. He responded that \"it doesn't matter about rating a hierarchy of identities. Identities just  are  and the only occasion that you might pick out 'drug addicted' would be if you were trying to prosecute the CEO for illegal drug use. Identities have an important relation to justice and the danger is when we assign ourselves or others single identities that have the potential to be very divisive.\" That is, of course, paraphrased from my memory of our conversation, but the gist is there. This line of thinking is helping me to understand our own disability community and our relation to groups identified with aging and childcare. But I'll save that for my next post.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Peace-Democratic-Society-Amartya-Sen/dp/1906924392"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/06/my-conversation-with-amartya-sen.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n In today's Globe and Mail, Lisa Priest reports that Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto will open a new Acute Care for Elders unit next month.  The unit is designed to keep ailing seniors in their own homes for longer as well as to reduce the likelihood of readmission to hospital after a discharge. It is common knowledge that far too many acute care hospital beds are taken by seniors awaiting placement in nursing homes. For every day that they spend in bed, it will take elderly patients two days to gain back the strength they lost - to say nothing of the risk of secondary infections picked up in hospitals. The new unit will offer home visits by GPs as well as specialists and a new 28 bed inpatient unit at Mt. Sinai for non-surgical elderly patients. But what really caught my eye about this story was its link with Goa, India. The group  Alzheimer's Disease International  recently held its annual conference where new approaches like the one at Mt. Sinai were described alongside other initiatives from developing countries. Amit Dias of the Dementia Society of Goa (India) described one family who tied their wandering elderly relative to a bed (a practice that is all too common as means of controlling the behaviour of dementia sufferers all over the world!). The family loved their relative, but feared for her safety when they were out of the house, even for a short time. The society devised a system of training lay people as home-care advisors and now the lady attends church every day, where she is under the caring and watchful eyes of the practicing choir members.

Fifty executive women who had demonstrated talent in achieving success while \"swimming upstream\" came together to share their knowledge and experience.  I think I was alone in not being employed outside my home for most of my adult life, but I wasn't the only Mum of a child with disabilities in the room. Two other mothers sought me out during the coffee break after seeing my bio in the notes.  What did this group of very esteemed business leaders discuss? One entrepreneur talked about \"the voice in your head\" that sows the seeds of self-doubt. A CEO in a large national corporation spoke of \"outsourcing\" her childcare and other domestic responsibilities in order to ensure her success in the boardroom. Everyone felt pulled apart by their caring responsibilities which they felt competed with their responsibilities to the company and their co-workers. The power relationships of caring was a topic that I found fascinating. Never before had I heard women discuss the need to relinquish to their partners some of the 'special territory of nurturing' inherent in motherhood. A young political strategist spoke of her husband being snubbed by the mothers at day care. She told of him being eyed with suspicion when he asked to volunteer at his daughter's school for half a day every week. 'Women can have it all' seems to imply that we do not have to give up any sacred territory of motherhood. But if we want a seat at the board table, perhaps we do.  Organization at the office is a given for these successful women, but organization at home was seen as a more elusive key to effective leadership. My comment to the group was that the idea or ethic of independence was not helpful in society or in any group where people share objectives. Even the word 'leadership' seems to connotate one person alone, out in front of the group. The better visual metaphor, I suggested, was the leader conducting the flow in the centre of constantly moving concentric circles.  Perhaps women executives seeking better organizational tools for their home and work could benefit from Tyze - a secure IT tool to support and coordinate personal support networks that was originally developed for the disability community. We use Tyze to coordinate Nicholas' personal needs and professional supports, but it's like an 'app'. It can be whatever the user needs it to be. Who will walk the dog or pick up materials to make a school project can be put into a task list for family members or a select group of friends can sign up to. Anyone looking after young children or elderly parents feels the pull of competing responsibilities. Lack of organization in caring responsibilities can leave a person feeling nothing but guilt.

{"date": "", "body": "\nOn the morning of June 6, 2011, I gave the festival keynote address at the FICCDAT conference in Toronto (the Festival of Conferences on Caregiving, Disability, Ageing and Technology). Here is my speech on INNOVATION AND ETHICS. Recently, I heard the British social innovator Charles Leadbeater say \u201cYour vantage point determines everything you see\u201d. Let me begin by telling you about my vantage point. My name is Donna Thomson and I am a mother and an author. This is my family \u2013 my daughter Natalie is 19 and a student at the University of Toronto. My husband, Jim Wright, is the High Commissioner for Canada in the United Kingdom. My son Nicholas is 22 and is disabled with cerebral palsy. Until Nicholas was 18, I provided him with almost all of his nursing care. Thanks to innovations such as a computerised spinal cord pain pump, gastrostomy feeding tube, oxygen saturation monitors together with the loving care of our family, Nicholas has survived. But the social innovation required to sustain Nick in the community has not kept pace with the medical breakthroughs that keep him alive. Nicholas is so high-tech and high maintenance now, that no existing policy, programme or service can easily meet his needs. My vantage point has led me to reflect on how we might nurture innovation across the sectors of science, community and family.  Nicholas is representative of the first generation of people with disabilities who will outlive their predicted lifespan. Many members of this cohort will even outlive their parents.  But it\u2019s not only people with disabilities who are surviving \u2013 the average life expectancy in Canada is climbing. Babies born today can expect to live nearly 81 years. My mother who lives in Montreal is 89. Of course at that age, she has health problems \u2013 in fact she was in the hospital last week, but thankfully, she is better now and home again in her apartment. The theme of this conference is \"Living Longer and Living Better\". I believe that we can do that if we change our collective vantage point. Of course experiences can rearrange our vantage points, but so can ideas. The idea that changed my vantage point was something called \u201cThe Capability Approach\u201d. Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1998 and the Capability Approach is his great idea for rearranging the economist\u2019s vantage point when looking at extreme poverty. He decided that household income and GDP were poor indicators of human and even economic wellbeing. Rather, he proposes that we need to examine whether people have a life that they value and have reason to value. Money is just one factor in a good life. But there are others equally valuable \u2013 such as loving relationships and whether or not someone has the resources to convert money into good living, as in the case of disability or old age.  Looking at the entire range of possibilities for flourishing within circumstances of adversity was what won Sen the Nobel prize. He positions the idea of freedom to imagine, to choose and to act at the heart of his definition of a decent human life. Through the generosity of the Printing House Charitable Office and McArthur and Company Publishing, you will find a copy of my book \u201cThe Four Walls of My Freedom\u201d in your FICCDAT conference pack. When Nicholas was growing up and battling the effects of severe cerebral palsy, I believed that our struggles with Nick\u2019s disability were private and of no concern or interest to anyone outside our family and friends. But Amartya Sen\u2019s Capability Approach offered me a lens to evaluate my family experience with adversity so that it had relevance to anyone concerned with freedom, active citizenship and caring societies. The research and reflections for my book led me to the conclusion that innovations, policies, programmes and services for those with care needs should be designed according to the principles of \u201cleast restrictive and most supportive\u201d.  So, in the context of my family experience, what does an innovation for our community designed on the principle of \u201cleast restrictive, most supportive\u201d, look like? Well, I think it looks like an Ipad application. Nicholas uses a communication app called Proloquo2Go.  This is an app that was designed by someone with expertise in both computer programming and speech language pathology. But apps are designed to be whatever the user wants them to be.  The programme is totally customisable, which is least restrictive. But it has open source information sharing about its infinite number of uses and malleability which is most supportive. Inventors of Ipad applications often have no clear idea how their programmes will be used. The developer devolves creative ownership to the user so that ongoing problem solving can occur in a way that is highly responsive and personalised. In social care terms, I do not want a day programme for my son that runs only on Wednesday mornings, for example. Nicholas is bedridden, so couldn't access the programme anyway. For us, personal budgets or care vouchers would offer the flexible benefits of an \"app\".  Fundamental change, or radical innovation, nearly always necessitates the turning upside-down of power relationships. The idea of the consumer as co-collaborator is radical in itself. The former Shell scenario planner, now turned social innovator, Adam Kahane, wrote a book called \u201cLove and Power\u201d. Kahane defines power as the drive toward self-realization. And he defines love as the drive toward unity. Deep change, he maintains, calls for a balance of these two forces because systems based on just one of those forces alone will result in stagnation. And this carries the risk of the overall failure to respond to the chaotic changes that are the natural fallout of human relationships.  The impetus required to reinvent the most deeply embedded habits is called for when the results of ineffective systems are a great enough irritant to the majority, that a general consensus to throw in the towel ensues.  This happened in Anchorage Alaska when Dr. Doug Eby and his colleagues became so frustrated with the poor outcomes of traditional western medicine that they invented an entirely new blueprint for delivering healthcare.  The NUKA Model of Care was born out of the realization that the \u201cowner/users\u201d, as their patients are called, held a good deal of the power for achieving decent health outcomes. Particularly in the case of chronic care, it is often patients who decide whether or not to fill a prescription or to take a full course of medical treatment. The NUKA model of care retained a traditional model of ICU care, because in that setting, patients need systems to take over. But Dr. Eby describes the design of traditional health care delivery for chronic conditions as akin to throwing a stone at a target on the wall. In the messy business of dealing with people, he says, it is not a stone you are throwing at the target, but a bird. No matter how hard you throw that bird at the target, it still may veer off in another direction before it hits the wall. Systems that are rooted in the respect for freedom, yet offer support for our failings or changed trajectories, will result in better outcomes. So says Dr. Eby and he has the empirical data to prove it.  Thirty years ago, a group of aging parents from Vancouver began to worry about who would love and care for their adult children with disabilities after the parents died. These mothers and fathers felt desperate at first. Knowing that their offspring were part of the first generation of children with disabilities who would likely outlive their parents, this group decided to do something very radical. They gave up on the idea that government ALONE could be relied upon to love and care for their children. This realisation proved to be a watershed. Now, they had a blank slate with no rigid assumptions in their future planning. They changed their vantage point. They asked \u201cWhat IS a good life?\u201d This group decided that the key to a good life was loving relationships.  The next task was to build an organization that could broker, sustain and coordinate loving relationships that would endure for their children\u2019s lifetime. Everyone in the group agreed that their children would be safe with a circle of friends and family who truly loved and cared for them. Planned Lifetime Advocacy Networks, or PLAN, was born. Personal support networks consisting of family, friends, neighbours and community members were organized to offer a natural kind of love, friendship and constancy to vulnerable adults.  The network would also assume the advocacy and monitoring role that normally falls to parents.  Groups representing the interests of those with issues related to aging, homelessness, addictions, teen pregnancy, and mental illness began to take notice. They replicated the model of personal support networks for their vulnerable populations. And the unanticipated positive outcomes didn\u2019t stop there.  Social scientists and contemporary anthropologists were noticing a disturbing trend of isolation and loneliness in healthy populations. Isolation is a well documented negative health determinant. Current demographic trends mean that most people today live far away from their extended families. Many people are not acquainted with their neighbours. But those who participate in supporting a vulnerable individual as part of a small group reported feeling happier themselves. They were less isolated and enjoyed a greater sense of meaning in their lives. Canada is experiencing a climate of reduced budgets and increasing costs in health and social care. At the same time, public servants face a daily imperative for accountability, transparency and results-based management.  I am married to a public servant, so I can attest to that. But fiscal pressure can sometimes provide the impetus for change. PLAN is a model that provides an opportunity to shift from patient centred care to network centred care - a shift that front line professionals are beginning to realise holds potential to ease pressure on their budgets, by coordinating support for a vulnerable individual in the community. Accountability and transparency are natural outcomes of support networks which consist of people who share objectives that affect someone they love. In these examples of transformational change, the protagonists followed similar steps. They set aside their assumptions about the status quo and prepared themselves to imagine something different - something better. They rearranged their vantage point in order to generate a new set of fundamental objectives. They aligned with others who shared a vested interest in working to a common purpose. And every participant was considered an equal co-creator, regardless of professional qualification. The umbrella organisation had ultimate responsibility for outcomes, but collaborated with users right up to the management level. In business terms, all these approaches including the Capability Approach apply the principles of cultural decision-making rather than administrative decision-making.  These models build in the capacity to bend rules in a way that is responsive to the messy and fluid requirements of those living with challenging circumstances. These models build in authentic collaborative relationships across the spectrum of provider and end user because the authors understand the concept of interdependency. My family uses a wide range of services and innovations. I passionately WANT to collaborate with professionals involved in both my son's and my mother's care. And I am not unique in this regard. Family members who provide complex care to a loved one develop a myriad of skills and a wealth of knowledge. We want the freedom to use our knowledge and skills LIKE an app - in ways that will give us a life that we value and have reason to value. We want access to innovators so that we can customize our care and support on a continual basis. If we are the bird and we collaborate closely with the person tossing us toward an agreed target on the wall, believe me, we will fly toward that target and we will land there every time if we possibly can. Most of us here at the FICCDAT Conference represent cultures and societies that do not suffer from widespread extreme poverty.  But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have important lessons to learn from the slums of India, the favelas of Brazil or the economists who seek to create better lives for those who are very poor. Necessity is the mother of invention. And the worldwide recession, combined with the demographics of aging and an explosion of technological innovation, provide us the seeds of real, positive change if choose to sow them. And that vantage point is full of hope and possibility.  It is my vantage point. I wish you all a wonderful FICCDAT conference.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/06/innovation-and-ethics-across-sectors.html", "title": ""},

Well, I have heard from a number of mothers and fathers of children with disabilities and I am so pleased that our family experience touched a chord with others. One of the readers who took the time and trouble to contact me was the mother of Max Grange from Aspen, Colorado. Max is the same age as Nicholas and has many of the same challenges. When I received the initial handwritten and heartfelt letter from Max's mother along with a photo of the family, I found myself blinking away tears. Not tears of sorrow, oh no. Just a deep recognition of the love between mother, son .... and dog! I could see at once that this happy family enjoyed the same love, support and mutual respect as mine. So, I am proud to share Max's new website. I know that Max would love to be in touch with anyone who would like to know more about adapted skiing, art or any of his other interests.

{"date": "", "body": "\nMy name is Donna Thomson and I am a mother, an author and the wife of the Canadian High Commissioner to the UK. This is my family \u2013 my daughter Natalie is 19 and a student at the University of Toronto. My son Nicholas is 22 and is disabled with cerebral palsy. Until Nicholas was 18, I provided him with almost all of his nursing care. Since coming to London in 2006 though, we have professional nurses 24/7 in our home and this sudden change in my own circumstances allowed me to reflect on what it means to offer care to a loved one who is completely dependent. And Nicholas IS dependent. He has low vision, is non-verbal, is tube fed, and he has no functional control over any part of his body. To borrow a banking term, Nick looks like the embodiment of deficit. But those who see him that way would be wrong.  Because they would not know that Nicholas is a high school graduate with a city wide award for academic perseverance. They would not know that he has completed three courses on the Open University or that he is a top rated seller on E-Bay. They wouldn\u2019t know that he has an ice hockey blog called \u201cThe Hockey Ambassador\u201d or that he has a Canadian Registered Disability Savings Plan with a very healthy balance. They would not see that Nicholas is a great asset to our family, his friends and his country. Recently, I heard the British authority on innovation Charles Leadbeater say \u201cour vantage point determines everything we see\u201d. That thought stayed with me and helps to explain how I began to think differently about my life and that of my family. I began to see assets where previously, I had seen deficits. Of course experiences can rearrange our vantage points, but so can ideas. The idea that changed my vantage point was something called \u201cThe Capability Approach\u201d. Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize for Economics and the Capability Approach is his great idea for rearranging the vantage point when looking at extreme poverty. He decided that household income and GDP were poor indicators of human and even economic wellbeing. Rather, he proposes that we need to examine whether people have a life that they value and have reason to value. Money is just one factor in a good life, but there are others equally valuable \u2013 such as loving relationships and whether or not someone has the resources to convert money into good living, as in the case of disability or old age. Looking at the entire range of possibilities for flourishing within circumstances of adversity was what won Sen the Nobel prize. He positions the idea of freedom at the heart of his definition of a decent human life. Looking carefully at one\u2019s circumstances and IMAGINING possibilities is the key here. Nicholas has lessons in this department for anyone willing to listen. He is no Pollyanna and there isn\u2019t an ounce of sentimentality or technicolour dreaming in his decision to maintain a positive vantage point. Nicholas used his acceptance speech at the Spirit of the Capital Youth Award for Academic Perseverance to share his secrets of success: \u201cI thought that I would share with you my secrets of perseverance. Talking about pain or ongoing challenge is very boring to me. I would choose having fun and learning at school over sitting home and complaining any day. I will never give up school because, frankly, I am just too curious and excited to find out what is going to happen next in each of my classes. Some people call this approach having a positive attitude; I call it wanting to express my opinions. I have opinions in my personal life, my school, my community and my country. And if I want people to hear my opinions, I know I have to be involved. I know how to find information about my interests, and how to use that information. I AM NEVER BORED! My advice to other students is to keep trying, even if it takes a long time to achieve academically. The world is far more interesting if you know something about it. At times we all may face some difficulties, but it is important to remember to never give up, and never give in. Thank you all, and good luck.\u201d For good measure, Nicholas insisted on including the lyrics to the theme song of the Liverpool Football Club in place of a bio in the awards program; \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d. A lot of parents of children with disabilities will be familiar with a story written by Emily Perl Kingsley titled \u201cWelcome to Holland\u201d. Kingsley was a writer for Sesame Street and she is also the mother of a young man with down syndrome. She described the experience of parenting a child with disability this way: imagine that you plan a trip to Italy. You have read all the guidebooks, learned Italian and reserved all your hotels and tours. During the flight, the pilot announces that the plane has been rerouted to Holland. You land there with no reservations, no language or guidebooks. But slowly, you discover the beauty and unique qualities of Holland. You discover tulips and Rembrandt. There will be those who land in Holland and never leave the airport \u2013 they stand in queues, endlessly trying to get back to Italy. But those people will not innovate and flourish because they lack the imagination to apply the capability approach.  So how do some people turn the losing hand that life has dealt them into a winning hand? Well, Temple Grandin, for example, uses her autistic way of seeing the world to design more efficient and humane cattle slaughter facilities, because she knows how cattle see and how they feel. Of course, the Grameen Bank is an example of innovation with roots in adversity. When Nicholas was five years old, we were living in St. John\u2019s Wood. I was searching for a mainstream school and each one I approached had the same reaction, \u201cI am sure your son\u2019s needs would be much better met at another, special school.\u201d I knew that Robinsfield Infant School at the top of our High Street was not wheelchair accessible, so it was only after I had exhausted all other options that I picked up the telephone and said to the head teacher, \u201cI suppose there\u2019s no way you\u2019d want my son\u201d. \u201cWant him! He\u2019s in! Our school NEEDS your son!\u201d This school principal knew that other children would have a lot to learn from Nick \u2013 empathy, patience, enriched communication skills, tolerance and kindness. The worst behaved children in the class were given special responsibility for helping Nick with his work and teachers began to understand that Nick\u2019s need for assistance combined with his winning personality had a positive, productive effect on the class in many, many ways. Thirty years ago, when a group of aging parents from Vancouver, Canada began to worry about who would love and care for their adult children with disabilities after the parents died, they felt desperate at first. Knowing that their offspring were part of the first generation of children with disabilities who would likely outlive their parents, this group decided to do something very radical. They gave up on the idea that government could help in any way. After so many years of applying for more funding to look after their children without success or any guarantee that services would last for the lifetime of their sons and daughters, these parents hit a wall. But once they gave up on the government and had a blank slate with no assumptions of any other players in their future planning, they asked themselves a question that was the spark for innovative solutions. They asked \u201cWhat IS a good life?\u201d The group decided that the key to a good life was loving relationships. The next task was to build an organization that could broker, sustain and coordinate loving relationships that would endure for their children\u2019s lifetime. Planned Lifetime Advocacy Networks, or PLAN, was born. Personal support networks consisting of family, friends, neighbours and community members were organized to offer a natural kind of love, friendship and constancy to vulnerable adults. Eventually, groups and families representing the interests of those with issues such as aging, homelessness, addictions, teen pregnancy, mental illness and many other root causes of vulnerability took notice and replicated the model of personal support networks. And the unanticipated positive outcomes didn\u2019t stop there. Social scientists and contemporary anthropologists were noticing a disturbing trend of isolation and loneliness in healthy populations. Current demographic trends mean that most people today live far from their extended families and many people are not acquainted with their neighbours. But those participating in supporting a vulnerable individual as part of a small group, reported feeling happier, less isolated and more a part of their community. In all of these examples, the protagonists followed the same steps. They stopped expecting resolutions for intractable problems from traditional (but unresponsive) providers. They asked a different question about fundamental objectives. They aligned with others who shared the same objectives. They kept the vulnerable person and their wellbeing at the heart of every action and decision undertaken by the group. My story is one of adversity as well as blessings. But that\u2019s life. My intention was to write about my family in a way that allows the reader to put themselves into the storyline, reflect on what it means to be a caring citizen in a democracy today and how to live in a way that is most deeply human. The innovation consultant and former Shell scenario planner Adam Kahane wrote a book called Love and Power. He describes Power as the drive toward self realization and love as the drive toward unity. Kahane maintains that to solve big problems, you need both love and power. Taken together with the capability approach, this idea led me to decide that a guiding principle for any decision making regarding vulnerable people and their care should be \u201cleast restrictive and most supportive\u201d. So, for example, elderly people should have as much freedom as we can possibly offer them to do whatever they like, but when they fail, fall or need help, we need to be there with assistance. This gives the individual the opportunity to achieve power and the community provides love. I hope that today, I have offered some ideas that may be relevant to everyone\u2019s individual circumstances. And I wish you all well in achieving your own capabilities without ever sacrificing your personal freedom, love or power.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/05/turning-deficits-into-assets-talk-for.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nIn Toronto's Cummer Lodge, seniors sway to an aria written by Schubert.  Some weep; all are listening.  But this is no record or tape or television.  Before the group of very elderly people, some in wheelchairs and most in early stages of dementia, stands Teiya Kasahara, a professional opera star who sings not only the classical repertoire, but also Eidelweiss from the Sound of Music.   Today's Globe and Mail reported this remarkable story  and I hope that people around the world will get wind of this transformative programme.  But what exactly  is  transformed by offering a live opera concert to nursing home residents?  I reckon it is the witnessing of exquisite beauty collectively that bestows dignity on every listener- staff and residents alike.  The music raises listeners above and beyond their bodily needs to a shared humanity of great worth.  Music can have sacred powers, almost like a communion host.  Those who partake in the genius and goodness of Schubert are made better, wiser, prettier, smarter and happier just by listening.  And David Lemon, the philanthropist behind the  Health Arts Society of Ontario , understands this.  It is no coincidence that my blog is titled \"Connecting with families, policy, ethics and  culture\".   Because the languages of artistic forms transcend, transform and above all unify.

{"date": "", "body": "\nToday's Montreal Gazette reports on a disturbing trend in Canada and elsewhere - we are less caring and more individualistic. Read the artice: Poll paints a self-absorbed, less-caring Canada of the future Younger Canadians are more concerned about themselves and money By HENRY AUBIN, The Gazette January 22, 2011  Comments (4) What will the Canadians of tomorrow be like? We've heard a lot about Canada's changing ethnic and racial makeup. But what about its evolving values and aspirations? An ambitious poll by a Paris-based think tank provides hints. It probes the values of tomorrow's ruling generation -the 16-to-29 age bracket -in 25 countries. The poll suggests that Canada's up-and-coming generation could be more individualistic and materialistic than the preceding one. Retirees, take note: This generation could be less committed to Canada's social safety net. The poll for the centre-right Fondation pour l'innovation politique surveyed 1,000 young people in each country last summer. For comparison's sake, it also polled 300 people aged 30 to 50, which includes the last several years of the baby-boom generation -sometimes called the \"Me Generation.\" The results suggest that the self-centredness characterizing many baby-boomers has intensified among the generation that comes on their heels. The poll finds that 47 per cent of young respondents in Canada feel that it is more important for society to reward individual performance than to share prosperity more equitably. That compares with 39 per cent of their elders. Indeed, 54 per cent of young people in Canada (about the same as in the U.S.) say they want to \"earn a lot of money\" -only in China and India is the eagerness for wealth greater. Having children takes the back seat: Only 29 per cent of young Canadians want them, down from the preceding generation's 45 per cent. As well, 62 per cent of young Canadians say an ideal society should be characterized by the lowest possible taxes rather than by the optimal social benefits (exceeded only by the Americans, at 72 per cent). And 44 per cent of the Canadians say they are not ready to pay for retirees' social benefits. Only in the U.S. and countries with economic crises such as Greece, Japan and Italy is this sentiment stronger. To be sure, these samplings of opinion are too small to be authoritative. Still, the results do tend to be consistent with other research. Take, for example, studies on \"empathetic concern\" - an emotional response to another person's distress. A researcher at the University of Michigan, Sara Konrath, recently wrote that university students today are \"about 40 per cent lower in empathy than their counterparts of 20 or 30 years ago, as measured by standard tests of this personality trait.\" This coincides with a rise in narcissism, or self absorption, across North America. The popularity of social networks such as Facebook, with their culture of self, might be one factor, says Konrath. She also says that empathy suffers when parents drill into children the importance of success in a hyper-competitive world -getting into the best schools, making the team, winning the game, getting into top universities. More than ever, it seems, beating out others determines worth. What are the implications of this societal change for public policy? It's good news for the right. The idea that the affluent have a duty to help the less fortunate is on the wane. The next generation of political leaders might lack motivation for giving generous social benefits to the poor and old folks (as well as lack money, thanks in part to the public debt the old folks helped rack up). Don't expect armies of volunteers to compensate for the cutbacks in personnel in health and social services. Growing self-centredness could mean that the current decline in volunteerism will continue. (Governor-General David Johnston's excellent plan to encourage volunteerism is going against the current.) Don't expect today's Canadians to start producing more children. (Indeed, Quebec's eight-year upswing in births ended in 2010, and demographers predict we're entering a plateau period.) More than ever, population increase would have to come mostly from immigration. The poll's most sunny finding is that young Canadians are more satisfied with their country's \"general situation\" than are their peers in any other country. The satisfaction rate here stands at a robust 68 per cent, well ahead of the runner-up Australians and Chinese (both at 61 per cent). Americans, coping with joblessness, are way back at 35 per cent. There's an irony in this contentment. The values and ambitions of this rising generation could do much to alter the fundamentally caring, generous character of today's Canadian society -the very society with which this same generation finds such satisfaction. haubin@montrealgazette.com \u00a9 Copyright (c) The Montreal GazetteRead more:  http://www.montrealgazette.com/Poll+paints+self+absorbed+less+caring+Canada+future/4148570/story.html#ixzz1EaxO995A My sister posted this article on Facebook along with the status update, \"Does anyone have ideas about how to turn this ship around?\" Well, I answered, \"Yes I do. And it's a Canadian programme called  Roots of Empathy . Mary Gordon, an educator and social entrepreneur, recognized this selfsame trend in 1996 and decided to create a schools programme that would teach young children to be caring, kind and confident. Fifteen years later, the evidence is overwhelming. Roots of Empathy works and word is spreading. With the impetus of the  Ashoka Globalizer Award , Roots of Empathy and its sister programme for even younger children, Seeds of Empathy, will be in most G20 countries within the next ten years.

{"date": "", "body": "\nThis is an interview that I did with Louise Kinross, Editor of BLOOM, a magazine for parents of children with disabilities from the Bloorview/MacMillan Centre in Toronto.  To read more from Louise or subscribe to BLOOM, click  HERE . Friday, February 11, 2011 In Donna's book, a good life=loving relationships In  The Four Walls of My Freedom , Donna Thomson recounts life raising her son Nicholas, 22, who has cerebral palsy and requires 24-hour care. Donna is married to James Wright, the High Commissioner for Canada in the UK, and has a daughter, Natalie. Donna generously shares her thoughts on how one can find freedom, choice and wellbeing within any set of life circumstances, including severe disability. BLOOM: It struck me how you moved from one medical crisis to another with Nicholas early on. How did you personally stay afloat? Donna Thomson: As women I think we\u2019re socialized to expect that any capable person should be able to cope with any circumstances their baby presents with. I was so exhausted but I thought I should be able to cope. It took me a long time to put up my hand and say \u2018I am seriously not able to do this.\u2019 When my daughter was born I knew I needed practical help, and I realized that the only way I was going to access help through government programs was to be dramatic in the language I used. I realized words like \u2018family breakdown\u2019 and \u2018drowning in my son\u2019s needs\u2019 got attention. I think using that language strategically to get funding helped me understand my own limitations. There wasn\u2019t any question that I wasn't actually drowning. I just hadn\u2019t admitted it yet. It was a while before I found some peer support because this was in the days before the Internet. Family and friends introduced me to people they knew who had a child with a disability and I realized that my church could also be a place of acceptance and belonging. BLOOM: In your book you talk about others judging you \u2013 in how you were caring for Nicholas or whether you did something to cause his disabilities. Why do parents of children with disabilities feel so judged? Donna Thomson: The moment your child is diagnosed with a disability, they become public property. It\u2019s not the same with an able-bodied child at all. Professionals have a say in how you feed your child, how you hold your child, the kinds of activities you do with your child, and what you allow your child to do or not do. You\u2019re judged on these things absolutely. BLOOM: I identified with this quote: \u2018I remember thinking that modern medicine and the power of love could beat the effects of cerebral palsy. How wrong I was.\u2019 What is it about our culture that leads to the perception that people can \u2018overcome\u2019 disability? Donna Thomson: I think it has to do with the notion of independence as being the core value of our society. There is a great aversion to dependence. I think when you put the individual at the heart of society, as opposed to the family or community, then it\u2019s a natural outcome that you think you will be able to manipulate nature. It\u2019s man over nature, it\u2019s that arrogance that we hold that you would be able to change something that is utterly natural. I would never advocate not doing therapy with our children because we want to enable their potential. However, I think because we define a successful life by independent function \u2013 you want your child to live on their own and be employed \u2013 we never talk about the ones who can\u2019t aspire to that. The question at the heart of Western society that worries me is that people who will never be independent or employable are not worth supporting. Why would you support someone who could never give back to society what they consume? They\u2019re abandoned. BLOOM: Does the concept of overcoming disability help explain why good services in childhood evaporate when a person becomes an adult? Donna Thomson: I think that is true. I also think that policies and supports and funding mechanisms for disability in our society are not set up for the first generation of people with more severe disability who survive into adulthood. Everything has been geared to pediatrics, assuming that people will die before their 18th birthday. And the perpetuation of that idea has been good for children\u2019s charities. BLOOM: Why as parents of children with disabilities must we redefine happiness and achievement? Donna Thomson: I think because there\u2019s a lot of interest in wellbeing these days. I think that a lot of people are beginning to realize that having wealth and position in society doesn\u2019t make you happy if you can\u2019t convert your wealth into good living. And what is good living? Good living can be quantified by your loving relationships. I think there are many people who are realizing loneliness and isolation is something that is a contemporary scourge. What our children need in terms of their support is company, and to be with other people. And what our children need is what society needs. When I talk to the people who have cared for Nicholas or been friends with him they say they have been transformed in a very positive way by their relationship with Nick. I think that to a large extent we in contemporary society have lost the knack of neighbourliness that we used to have in more rural communities. And if we put our children at the heart of the idea of neighbourliness, we can use them as a lever to create a new kind of urban contemporary neighbourliness. I\u2019m a big fan of personal support networks and how they benefit everyone in them. BLOOM: What is the Capability Approach? Donna Thomson: The Capability Approach is an idea about how people can function well within circumstances of adversity. It\u2019s to do with the factors that allow a person the freedom to make choices to have a life that they value. Amartya Sen wrote about it in the context of extreme poverty, talking about the types of freedoms people need to have the basic level of functioning that allows a person to have human dignity. He was interested in minimum levels, but because I\u2019m a very middle-class person, I want to use the Capability Approach to look at maximum levels of flourishing. I want to know what are the supports and services and policies that will enable Nick to have the freedom to make daily choices to have a life that he values. Rather than to be spoon-fed programs he doesn\u2019t want. BLOOM: You note that Nick spends most of his time in bed, yet experiences the world richly. Can you explain? Donna Thomson: Nicholas has a big screen TV in his room connected to a computer in Canada that enables him to watch Canadian TV. He watches the CBC News and Hockey Night in Canada. He\u2019s very interested in hockey and can watch all of the NHL games if he wants. He writes a  hockey blog . He does all of this with a lot of assistance. He uses a communication program on an iPad with his helpers. He also has facebook and hotmail and he\u2019s a seller on eBay. He has great friendships with his carers and remains friends with them when they leave. BLOOM: Many parents of children with complex medical needs struggle to get the supports they need at home. Donna Thomson:  I think the issue of 24-hour care is an urgent concern for governments. Part of the public discussion we need to have is about a global or national ethic of care that we believe supports human dignity. How many baths does a person need per week, and is it okay to leave a person alone in a room in a facility for two, three, four hours? What\u2019s the cut off? We need to actually make those decisions about what is the kind of care we expect for someone we love if we drop dead tomorrow and they become the responsibility of the state. Then we need to figure out what\u2019s the responsibility of the government, national and provincial, and what is the responsibility of the community, the family and the individual. When making these decisions, I argue we should always think about how we can maximize human freedom to have choice and wellbeing. My guiding principle for policy making and funding is that it be \u2018most supportive and least restrictive.\u2019 That, of course, is most expensive. BLOOM: How can we financially support these services? Donna Thomson: Given this is the first generation of people with severe disabilities who will outlive their parents, we have to look at how we can mobilize communities to work together to enable a good life for all. This is an international phenomenon and an international concern. In Japan they\u2019re doing a system where if you volunteer to help the elderly or disabled, you get \u2018time credits\u2019 you can claim when you need care yourself later in life. Lots of people are looking at models of dealing with an aging population and people surviving with high needs. In the UK they\u2019ve had great success with shared housing that is a bit like fostering a child. You\u2019re paid a bit to take into your home someone who has a developmental disability. We need to look at how we can incentivize care. Most of the volunteers in today\u2019s world are over 50. How do we get people, particularly of the younger generation, looking after one another \u2013 volunteering, befriending? All of these activities are good for society. BLOOM: The Capability Approach is at odds with Western perceptions of what constitutes a good life. How can we change attitudes? Donna Thomson: I think adversity is the mother of invention, which is one of the reasons I was so taken with the Capability Approach. It comes out of the slums of India. I think the recession is going to be a good thing, in a way, for people. In the UK the recession has hit much more strongly than in Canada. As a result, you will have people forced to live in communal housing. One of the things that\u2019s made our communities such lonely places, particularly for vulnerable people, is the idea of individualized housing. Put someone in their own apartment and they\u2019re supposed to be fine. I think to the extent which we can pool resources and living space and financial resources, and where we begin to have multi-generational families again, that is going to be good. BLOOM: In the book you mention a time when Nick rates himself low in the area of meaningful work. How can parents maintain their children\u2019s self-esteem when they\u2019re not able to do paid work? Donna Thomson: That\u2019s a really tough one. It\u2019s very natural and deeply human to want meaningful work in your life. And it\u2019s also deeply human for Nicholas to want a girlfriend. And some of these things may not happen for him. So the job of the people who love him is to help him understand what his reality is, to help him make peace with his limitations, and to help him aspire to his dreams. BLOOM: What are Nick\u2019s dreams for the future? Donna Thomson: A girlfriend is probably his number one dream. And that\u2019s probably the most difficult one. He\u2019s looking forward to moving back to Canada and getting season hockey tickets. We\u2019ve talked about him moving out of home and I think he\u2019s starting to get quite interested in that new phase of his life. BLOOM: How can parents of children with more complex cognitive or communication difficulties assess whether they\u2019re leading the life they choose? Donna Thomson: It\u2019s very difficult to do. But the people closest to that person will have a strong gut feeling and a deep, fundamental knowledge of that person and if they\u2019re happy. Sometimes comfort is happiness, and things that are very humanly basic, like touch and intimacy in terms of singing and sound. That\u2019s why Snoezelen is so good. We know when our children are enjoying those kinds of physical and spiritual comforts and that is happiness. BLOOM: Should families use the wellbeing index you used? Donna Thomson: If you have a strong interest in trying to understand your life and to make it better, the index is helpful. BLOOM: What key policy changes are needed to give people with disabilities more freedom to choose their lifestyle? Donna Thomson: A saving mechanism is very important and we should be helping our vulnerable young people to have a savings plan. We have the RDSP in Canada. Couple that with whatever communities can do to incentivize and support networks of support to help someone have a good life in a coordinated fashion, so that it doesn\u2019t fall on the shoulders of one person. People talk about distributed justice. This is a sharing of those responsibilities. At the heart of those levers for a good life is the understanding in society of the worth of a life that is very different, and that dependency is not a bad thing. We all are dependent or will be in our life. Something we need to teach people is how to receive care. I would love to see a Grade 2 class of children sitting in pairs. One sits on their hands wearing a blindfold while the other feeds them. And then they trade places. We need to receive care with the same grace and dignity that we teach children to give care. There are still a lot of people who talk about if they get in a catastrophic car accident and need to be taken care of, \u2018just pull the plug.\u2019 That\u2019s because they don\u2019t know how to receive care. BLOOM: You talk about public/private partnership to support those with high needs. What is an example? Donna Thomson: I would be interested in looking at funding Nicholas between several ministries. That is a \u2018no-no\u2019 currently. I would be interested in having a government program that has to do with digital inclusion contribute to Nicholas\u2019 technology in his room. Perhaps the Ministry of Community and Social Services could fund some part of his leisure activities. And the Ministry of Health could fund needs that are carried out by health-care professionals. That leaves the task of who\u2019s going to pick up the iPad and change the TV channels and talk with him. He can\u2019t do anything by himself. That is, I think, where we have an opportunity to engage the community. For example, I used to get kids from Nicholas\u2019 high school to fulfill their community service hours by coming by to play Playstation with him. That\u2019s how I got them there, but then they became his friends and kept coming after they\u2019d done their service hours. BLOOM: What can others learn from our caring experiences? Donna Thomson: I think what others can learn is intimacy and grace. I think when I talk about receiving care well, our children are great teachers. And I think this is a very important lesson for the rest of society. I also think people can learn to listen by befriending someone with a disability. I have learned all of my listening skills from Nicholas. I am a very careful \u2018whole body,\u2019 \u2018whole soul\u2019 listener. It makes me have a much richer life. BLOOM: How have you changed as a person as a result of raising Nick? Donna Thomson: I think I\u2019m not so afraid of death as I used to be. Because Nick has had many near-death experiences. I\u2019ve worried so long about him dying, then all of a sudden I started worrying about him surviving. I\u2019ve thought about death an awful lot. If you read guides to happiness, or to making peace with yourself and having a sense of contentment, most of them say you have to come to terms with your own mortality. I think the experience for me of having Nick has enabled me to do that. I\u2019ve given a lot of thought to what it\u2019s like to walk through the unknown because I never know what\u2019s going to happen from one moment to the next. I had to reconcile myself to the unpredictability of life and that I wasn\u2019t in control. I think that has made me have a greater capacity for joy and happiness. I also think we have to make a choice to try to understand our most difficult experiences in some kind of a meaningful, even positive, light. So, I think that\u2019s a choice. Because otherwise we would remain bitter, and some people do. I choose very strongly not to be bitter. I love my son and he loves me and we laugh our heads off all the time. BLOOM: Sometimes I think there is a tendency for us to keep our lives private, because they are so different from the mainstream. Did you feel that way before writing the book? Donna Thomson: It was the Capability Approach that gave me the idea that sharing our experiences was important. Because if someone from the slums of India can have a good life with their hardships, through this idea, then I\u2019ve got something to say about how we can have a good life. And all of a sudden my experience as a mother and Nicholas\u2019 experience and that of our family have real importance to the discussion about what kind of a country we want to have. I really hope the book gives meaning, relevance, importance and dignity to people\u2019s personal experience\u2026 but also to us as a whole group who are raising children with disabilities.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.com/2011/02/in-donnas-book-good-life-loving.html", "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.com/2011/02/in-donnas-book-good-life-loving.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CXYRt4mkZGM/TVWh31G7-rI/AAAAAAAAApk/DXHPMPYPvhM/s1600/P1040023.JPG", "http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552788903", "http://thehockeyambassador.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/02/interview-about-parenting.html", "title": ""},

After the reading at Sotheby\u2019s, in London\u2019s Bond Street, there was a discussion with the audience, which was made up of invited guests of Women for Women International UK. Her book is the result of three years of research into how the work of  Amartya Sen ,  Martha Nussbaum  and other economists and philosophers can shape our thinking about distributive justice for those who give or receive care. Women for Women International bases its  programmes  on similar thinking to that of Amartya Sen\u2019s  capability approach , encouraging women to make their own choices in the way they build and value their lives and prioritising the giving and receiving of care from sister to sister across the world. Born and educated in Montreal, Donna began her career as an actor, director and teacher, but when her son Nicholas was born with severe disabilities in 1988, she embarked on her second career as a disability activist. When she moved to London in 2006 with her husband  James Wright , Canadian High Commissioner to the UK, Donna became interested in the ways in which innovation within the development sector could inform policy making for disability in Canada and the UK. She is also committed to issues related to development, women and the effects of conflict on families. Donna will also be speaking at the third Annual London School of Economics Literary Festival on Saturday 19 February. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SWAIxQIP04o/TTm9XT2zRhI/AAAAAAAAAAQ/z8d8IAiaudY/s1600/DonnaThomson2-e1295613588162.jpg", "http://www.womenforwomeninternational.org.uk/wordpress/%20http:/www.womenforwomeninternational.org.uk:/author/julie-tomlin/", "http://donnathomson.blogspot.com/p/biography.html", "http://www.amazon.ca/Four-Walls-Freedom-Donna-Thomson/dp/1552788903", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum", "http://www.womenforwomen.org/programs-supporting-women/programs-for-helping-women.php", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach", "http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/offices-bureaux/biography-biographie.aspx?lang=eng"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/01/women-supporting-women.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nLast week, I travelled with my husband to Edinburgh.  We were invited to attend First Minister's Questions at the Scottish Parliament, a weekly event similar our Prime Minister's Question Period in Canada.  It was fascinating to watch democracy in action as ministers took their turn to ask questions about issues ranging from transportation to health care.  There was some good natured heckling, but generally, everyone was well behaved.  So, I was in turn outraged, sad and reflective when I read in Saturday's London papers that a  British MP had been heckled in Westminster because of his speech impediment due to cerebral palsy .   Paul Maynard, a Conservative MP for Blackpool and Cleveleys, described an incident in which some Labour MPs made faces, mimicing the involuntary facial movements of Mr. Maynard.  Public reaction to this revelation has been understandable outrage on the part of the Equalities Chief, Trevor Phillips and other members of the government and public.  But I have been trying to lift the shroud off this ugly incident to understand it more deeply.  \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\" is Charles Dickens' opening to a Tale of Two Cities.  He encapsulates in this phrase how the seeking of power can be used to enoble humanity or diminish it.   Watching the government of any country in action can be educational in both regards.  My son has cerebral palsy and frankly, if someone in the street imitated his movements or speech in an effort to humiliate him or to silence his efforts to voice opinions, there is no telling what I might do to protect his dignity.  And there is no question that the MPs who bullied Mr. Maynard went too far.  But where is the middle ground?  No disability activist or MP, for that matter, would wish someone with disability who happened to be in a position of power to be treated 'better' than his peers on the basis of political correctness.  Government is meant to rule and to rule is to hold power.  Those who hold power jockey and employ whatever bully pulpit they can grab onto to one-up their political opponents.  I get it. But in a democracy, an elected government is also meant to embody the best of who we are as a people.  Surely this civic responsibility calls for decorum and some polite listening of opposing views? The behaviour exhibited by MPs who mocked Mr. Maynard is anti-social.  Their behaviour is not only a bad example to the society they represent, it impedes understanding of 'the other' both personally and collectively.  This behaviour does not belong in our school grounds, homes or streets. It most certainly does not belong in our governments.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1354323/Mocking-disabled-MP-feel-physically-sick-says-equalities-chief.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/02/it-was-best-of-times-it-was-worst-of.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\n A Column in the Ottawa Sun  followed by my response: \n \nA lobbyist by any other name ... by Anthony Furey\u00a0 anthony.furey@sunmedia.ca , Ottawa Sun, 12 January 2011. \n \n Lobbyists are retarded. Well, not quite. But the history of their linguistics is parallel to that of the retarded. \n It used to be that someone with a mental or physical disability was regularly called retarded. That\u2019s because that\u2019s what they are, it\u2019s a word in the dictionary and it has a definition. \n But at one point it changed. We labelled the retarded \u2018handicapped\u2019. That lasted for a while and now we label the handicapped \u2018challenged\u2019 and \u2018disabled\u2019. Soon there will be a new label and we\u2019ll all follow along in the name of political correctness. \n Lobbyists are similar. They were once openly known as lobbyists but then, because their profession was tainted, they changed it to \u2018government relations\u2019. Sounds sleeker, but we could still smell the dirt. So now they\u2019re known as practitioners of \u2018advocacy\u2019. What do you do? Oh, I\u2019m in advocacy. What the hell does that mean? \n I feel pity for the retarded. Human beings, particularly children, can be cruel without cause. We\u2019ve all seen retarded people be made fun of for how they look and act. It\u2019s unfair and unjustified \u2014 they already have enough crap to handle. But I guess some people are so insecure they need to make fun of others to feel better about their own failings. \n That said, I\u2019ve always thought it dumb that some people wanted to extract the word retarded from our discourse. If a kid wants to make fun of a disabled guy then he\u2019s going to do it. The problem is not the word we use to describe the retarded, the problem is just that if someone is different from the masses they\u2019re going to be made fun of once in a while. \n But do I have pity for lobbyists? Ha. Absolutely not. \n This is essentially the trajectory of a lobbyist\u2019s career: Some dude hangs around the political scene long enough to get to know people, to be one of those tools who is always handing out cards even though he doesn\u2019t have a job. He then runs for office. He either loses or is a backbencher for a while but eventually fizzles away. Out of office he realizes he actually has no skills. So he charges corporations outlandish fees for the simple fact that he can ring up cabinet ministers on their cell. \n Obviously there are exceptions to the rule \u2014 like people who use their influence to get attention for charities or the oppressed. But the exception is not the rule. \n So cigarette companies don\u2019t like how much their product is taxed? Yeah, well I don\u2019t like how much lung cancer healthcare costs affect me as a taxpayer. The fact that some guy is getting rich off of advancing the cigarette company\u2019s cause scores zero on the pity scale. The fact that he wants to reduce the stigma to his industry by changing the words means he\u2019s a walking joke and should take his money and run before someone resets his jaw. \n If you\u2019re a lobbyist and you\u2019re pissed at me, take up your beef with Rahim Jaffer. Take up your beef with Jason Reitman for making Thank You For Smoking. Take up your beef with the man in the mirror. \n And if you\u2019re paranoid that your job title sounds dirty it\u2019s probably because you\u2019ve done something to make it dirty. Nobody told you to accept money to encourage the government to bend their regulations for the gain of someone\u2019s overseas stock portfolio. \n I\u2019m willing to call a retarded guy impaired or disabled if it makes his daily life easier, but I\u2019m not willing to assuage the guilt of a lobbyist. \n \n MY RESPONSE: \n \nAnthony Furey is right - language has changed. But I thought that journalists were still supposed to have some background information or experience of their written subject. Recently, the Canadian writer and philosopher  Jacques Dufresne  wrote, \"the worst sort of\u00a0ignorance is the one that comes from not knowing and not wanting to know one's\u00a0self. This is the ignorance of the self-satisfied, blind and indifferent to the very\u00a0causes of their ignorance.\" He calls this totalitarian ignorance - the shouting down of thoughtful discourse and any exchange of ideas that happen to be based in fact. Yes, the word 'retarded' is gone from our vocabulary for very good reasons. People with disabilities have fought for and gained a place in society of real value. In Canada, we are proud to embrace an ethic in inclusion that responds to differences in race, gender, culture, religion, sexual orientation AND ability. We are the first country in the world to give people with disabilities a savings tool, the Registered Disability Savings Plan. Such a plan acknowledges the place of people with disabilities as full contributors to the marketplace. As employers of care staff, they become net contributors to the economy. \nI am a parent of an adult child with disabilities and I could describe to Mr. Furey in elaborate detail the myriad of reasons why my son is not an object of pity. In fact, I have done that in my book \u201cThe Four Walls of My Freedom\u201d. But I fear that my words will be lost on this \u2018journalist\u2019 because I am pretty sure that he does not read anyone else\u2019s writing but his own.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ottawasun.com/comment/columnists/anthony_furey/2011/01/11/16852216.html#/comment/columnists/anthony_furey/2011/01/11/pf-16852216.html", "mailto:anthony.furey@sunmedia.ca", "http://www.aletmanski.com/al-etmanski/2011/01/jacques-dufresne-becoming-visible-2011-totalitarian-ignorance.html"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/01/columnist-in-ottawa-sun-and-my-response.html", "title": ""},

This is the time of year for magic. It's also a time for connecting. So let me tell you a story about the magic that happens when different communities connect to include everyone. It starts with a women's drop-in centre next door to a high-end, sophisticated bridal boutique. The bridal boutique is all about silk and lace, pearl buttons, beadwork and embroidery. The drop-in centre is all about a community kitchen on a tight budget, about learning life skills and sewing seeds of hope. The young woman who connected the two is Rebecca Beayni, dancer, artist, teacher. Beayni has cerebral palsy and uses a power wheelchair. For someone who does not communicate verbally, she has a great deal to say. And she does it with PowerPoint presentations. I wrote about her five years ago when she went to New York to talk about the importance of inclusion before the committee drafting the United Nations declaration on the rights of people with disabilities. These days, closer to home, Beayni takes her message of inclusion to colleges, universities and community groups. She dances with the Spirit Movers, a group formed by L'Arche Daybreak, a community that includes people with developmental disabilities and those who assist them. She paints. And she also volunteers as a facilitator at the Royal Ontario Museum's hands-on biodiversity exhibit and helps out at the Mustard Seed, the drop-in centre which happens to be right next door to the Lea-Ann Belter Bridal boutique. One day when Beayni was talking to a community group about Mustard Seed, her audience included Nina Wright. \u201cYou know, I work next door at the bridal boutique,\u201d Wright told Beayni after the presentation. Then Wright offered to arrange for Beayni to pick up left-over fabric scraps and take them to the women at Mustard Seed. The women at Mustard Seed's sewing program take the scraps of silk and make them into tiny wedding dresses. Then they put the wedding dresses on tiny toy bears, which they sell at craft shows to help raise funds for the drop-in centre. \u201cFor the last 10 years, since government cutbacks, everyone has been struggling,\u201d says Mustard Seed director Sister Gwen Smith as she helps whip up a batch of cranberry sauce to serve with Christmas dinner. The group relies on community volunteers to step up to the plate and Beayni never fails to inspire, Smith says. \u201cShe waters the plants and sometimes she dances,\u201d Smith says. Once, when the drop-in centre had a group of visitors, \u201cone man said: \u2018Something special happens to that young woman when she dances \u2014 and something special happens to us.' \u201cA lot of people are scared of people who use wheelchairs,\u201d Smith adds. \u201cWhen they see Rebecca dance, they realize she's not an \u2018other,' she's another me.\u201d As for the bridal boutique, it's always looking for good homes for leftover scraps of materials. \u201cWe give them to seniors' homes and other community groups, says owner/designer Lea-Ann Belter. Just another way of making community connections. One more note about Beayni: One of her paintings was chosen as the centrepiece for the poster representing Ryerson University's school of disability studies.

If asked whether he speaks french, he will answer \"Oui\" and laugh. Nick has carers who hail from Brazil, Australia, Slovakia, England, the Philippines, and Italy. Recently, Nick had surgery to replace a computerized spinal cord pain pump that was made in the USA. His original pump was implanted in Canada with a mixture of medications that had only been tried in the United States. Last month, the hospital pharmacist, who is from Poland, managed to locate the anaesthic pump medicine in the dose we needed here in the UK, so I don't have to order it in from Canada anymore. Nick is happy to be home from hospital because here, he can watch his television which is connected to his computer, allowing him to watch NHL ice hockey.

{"date": "", "body": "\nMany people will recall the wonderful animated film \" The Man Who Planted Trees \" by the Canadian artist  Frederic Back . The film charmed millions, including the Academy Award judges of 1987. Based on an allegorical story by french author  Jean Giono , the film uses Back's delightful drawings to describe the life of Elzeard Bouffier, a shepherd who single-handedly re-forested a desolate valley in the foothills of the Alps. Giono's story was published under several titles: \"The Man Who Planted Trees\", \"The Story of Elzeard Bouffier, the Most Extraordinary Character I Ever Met\", and \"The Man Who Planted Hope and Reaped Happiness\". Frederic Back is a Canadian national treasure. He is a great artist, award winning filmmaker, passionate conservationist and dreamer. Back uses his memories, his talent and his love affair with nature to gently transport his audience to a place of great possibility. Even the titles on his webpage excite - \"Picture a Greener Future Contest\", \"Learning About First Peoples\" and \"The World Cultures Section: An Illustrated Travelogue\". On his website, Frederic invites children of all ages to share their artwork, ideas and their inspirations. The power of his narrative memory is in its beauty and longing for a better, greener, gentler world. Here, Frederic remembers the generosity of his mother: A welcoming home I told them my father was a musician and my mother an excellent cook, and brought many of them home.  My kind mother  always made something good. But one day a small orchestra - five musicians - came with me. I can still see them, climbing the five floors to our apartment with the bass drum, the cymbals, the cello and the rest of their gear! My mother's eyes opened wide, but she got them settled, peeled potatoes and found a few eggs to give them a good feast. Getting home from work, my father was very surprised to see the instruments piled in the landing and so many people at the table! But soon they were talking about what was happening to traditional music and the many, often talented musicians who played it. My parents didn't scold me, for they were very hospitable and sympathized with anyone in need, just as they welcomed the lost birds, dogs and cats I brought home. We always had  several cats  and for a few years we had a magpie that used to sit on my shoulder and noisily tell me its life story. It pulled out the fur of the cats sleeping under a sheet of newspaper, and every morning the cats would look for the little pieces of meat the magpie had hidden in its cage. The  family movement  of parents of children with disabilities have a natural and deep understanding of Frederic Back's intentions. We champion the idea that beauty is not disposable and that its longevity is worth fighting for. There is much to learned from nature and the everyday life of a loving family. For 86 years, Frederic Back has used his extraordinary talents in combination with a loving, generous spirit to nudge his public into creating a kinder world. Long may he live.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Planted_Trees_(film)", "http://www.fredericback.com/index.en.shtml", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giono", "http://www.fredericback.com/biographie/1924-37/une-maison-accueillante.en.shtml#P_1849", "http://www.fredericback.com/biographie/1924-37/une-maison-accueillante.en.shtml#C_1871", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Movement"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2010/11/delight-and-inspiration.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "", "body": "\nMy friend and colleague, Al Etmanski, has a blog series titled \" Tips for Solution Based Advocacy \".  It's a great series and I commend it to anyone concerned about social justice. This Christmas, I have been reflecting on the story of Jesus Christ and the lessons we might learn for advocacy from the New Testament.  (For those of other faiths, I am sure that there are equally important lessons in those texts too!)  Jesus Christ endured social exclusion and poverty as well as political and religious oppression.  Finally, he suffered a gross miscarriage of justice leading to a humiliating and painfully slow public execution. When most of us suffer life's ill fate, we cry heavenwards \"Why?  Why is this happening to me?\" But God had a big plan and so he sent his only son to be a changemaker in the world.  Jesus had many reasons to be bitter and angry, but every aspect of His suffering was part of His father's architectural framework for an enduring form of solution based advocacy.  God saw that there was not enough love in the world, not enough kindness or humility.  There was too much deceit, injustice and hatred.  And to top it all, there was no hope at all for redemption.  What He needed was a massive campaign for a new way of living that would give meaning to the lives of all who believed.  Throughout history, real leaders have understood the need for communicating their most important messages using metaphor, allegory and poetry.  Our most iconic heroes could ensure that legions of listeners would imagine themselves to be stronger by communing with a greater cause; made to feel great dignity, goodness and generosity of spirit simply by believing the message of a world made better.   Christ worked for inclusion, fraternity and for love to triumph over hate and the victory of hope over despair.   To achieve his goals, he put together a great team of friends, all with leadership potential.  He knew the value of a good education, so He worked with his team, continually teaching and mentoring until they were prepared to go it alone.  But His resurrection from the dead revealed the full spectrum of His plan for the human race.  Just when his team and followers had lost hope, Jesus showed that a message of truth must not die and that we need to continue to advocate, find solutions and communicate those with hope and vigour.

In fact, being on the receiving end of administrative decision making can sometimes cause blood pressure to rise and language to turn blue.  In my last post, I described the idea of cultural vs administrative decision making.  \n \nSo, what does cultural decision making in action look like?  Here in the UK, are two  fine examples.  The director of NAAPS, Alex Fox, was a friend when he was Director of Policy at the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, but now he is making even bigger waves as Executive Director of NAAPS. In this year's Queen's Honours list was Sian Lockwood, the Exec. Director of Community Catalysts.  Why are they examples to all of excellence in cultural decision making?  Read on. \n \nWho are NAAPS and Community Catalysts? \n \nNAAPS has three kinds of member: \n \n Shared Lives is where a family is paid a modest amount to include an isolated or under-supported older or disabled person in their family and community life. In many cases an isolated disabled or older person becomes a permanent part of a supportive family. There are around 10,000 SL carers in the UK, of which 3,800 are NAAPS members. \n Homeshare is small in the UK but significant in other countries. Someone who needs support to continue to live independently in their own home is matched with someone who lacks housing and they trade housing for low-level support. It often works inter-generationally, with matches benefiting a younger and an older person. \n Thousands of new micro-enterprises and mutuals are establishing new services based on the needs of an individual or small group of older or disabled people. Some are voluntary; others funded through personal budgets or people\u2019s own money. Some of these entrepreneurs are ex front-line workers or disabled and older people themselves. \n \nMicro-enterprises cover a wide range of services. Barbara personally delivers the first two weeks of home support to the older people who use her micro-scale domiciliary care agency, so that she can genuinely understand their needs and match them with the right staff member. With help from her family and her personal budget, Jenny set up DanceSyndrome as an enterprise delivering dance activities to disabled and non-disabled people alike. \n \nOur social enterprise, Community Catalysts, is bringing our values and messages to new audiences, through managing micro-enterprise support agencies for four local authorities (Nottinghamshire, Nottingham City, Dudley, Oldham) and supporting eleven others to set up their own support agency. Other customers include an education trust, MacIntyre, two health boards, a housing association and a prison.  www.communitycatalysts.co.uk \n \nThe UK and Canada are heading for cuts to social care.  The challenge to policy makers will be to seek models of good practice that at first glance, defy odds by combining forces across sectors and ministries where common objectives can be found.  Flexibility with respect to every aspect of planning and execution of public programmes will be necessary and cultural decision making is a must.  \n \nLooking at international models of good practice is a good place to start and NAAPS/Community Catalysts is one great model.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.communitycatalysts.co.uk/"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2010/11/what-is-cultural-decision-making.html", "title": ""},

I requested (rather energetically) an emergency appointment because Nick's left leg was stiff, painful and periodically in spasm.  I had a feeling that perhaps his spinal cord pain pump wasn't functioning properly.  We arrived at noon and waited in the lounge area of the neuro-rehab inpatient unit.  We had suitcases with us, because the doctor told us that Nick would be admitted.  A special x-ray of his pump using radio-active dye was planned for the afternoon.  An electric air mattress was located and placed on Nick's bed  after a member of staff had cleaned and disinfected his room.  Finally, we left the lounge to get settled.  At 3pm, we were brought to the x-ray area where Nick was to have his procedure.  We got him transferred to the narrow table under the cameras and I went outside to await the results.  After twenty minutes or so, the doors opened and our doctor came out, still drying her disinfected hands.  \"Nothing?\" I asked, thinking the test was normal and we would have to look for other reasons that Nick's leg was so stiff and painful.  \"Oh, no\", she exclaimed, \"there was something\".  Apparently the catheter leading from the pump to the spinal cord was completely blocked.  We had no way of knowing if any medicine at all was reaching its destination of the spinal cord.  A course of oral baclofen (the muscle relaxant in the pump) was ordered and we were told to monitor the pain and wait for surgery to replace the pump.  This week, Nicholas will have emergency surgery to replace and reposition his pain pump (in a new location in order to prevent a possible repeat failure if the problem related to its position).

Advances in medicine and technology mean that we are living longer, but not necessarily healthier.  A health care system based on the notion of equity for all has come to a point where all Canadians expect the same level of state of the art treatment, often involving years of complex, longterm care.   An aging and educated population with a strong sense of entitlement will spell the tipping point for ending our historical love affair with national health care. In today's Globe and Mail, Andre Picard spells out the grim numbers of our system and its shackles that inhibit reform in his article  \"Canada, It's Time to Get Our Health Act Together\"  .  Balancing a nation's deeply embedded value of national health as a right with the frustration of growing waiting lists and inefficiency due to diminishing budgets is tricky, but people are starting to talk differently about systemic change.  In my book, \"The Four Walls of My Freedom\", I point an accusing finger at our nation's obsession with the either/or of public or private health and social care.  Picard writes in his Globe article:  \"Canadians need to do away with the notion there is black and white choice between public and private.  \"There is no one-size-fits-all model for funding and there's no one-size-fits-all model for delivery.

The view is fantastic and the conversation is even better. One morning last week, I was sitting in the hospitality suite enjoying the morning newspaper with a cup of coffee.  A middle-aged man sat down on the sofa opposite me and we began to chat.  I asked him about his book and he asked me about mine.  I told him about \"The Four Walls of My Freedom\" and about my family.  He leaned forward and told me of his good friend in Washington State - a single mother with twin boys who suffer from a very rare, but catastrophic syndrome.   The boys, aged six, are now blind and their physical function is degenerating quickly.  Washington State has a list of fundable conditions and these boys' syndrome isn't on the list.  Their mother receives no help at all from government sources. My new acquaintance mused, \"When I'm not being an author, my real job is as a management consultant.  In business school, we learned about how young companies grow and change.  When a company is small, employees make 'cultural decisions' reached by an informal consensus based on knowledge of all parties concerned and the small business landscape.  When businesses grow too large for anyone to have that knowledge, though, cultural decision is replaced by administrative decision making.\" \"My friend with twin boys\", he said, \"is a victim of administrative decision making.\" I thought about my own experience in trying to persuade school boards, health authorities and social service providers that Nicholas' needs were complicated and compelling.  I thought about the myriad of administrative decisions that transformed programmes and policies from helpful to unhelpful. Over the last three years, I have done a great deal of research on  Amartya Sen's  Capability Approach.   Sen won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1998, largely for his revolutionary idea that measuring freedom, not money, will tell you about peoples' wellbeing, even those living in extreme poverty.   The  Capability Approach  examines if and how people have the capability to have a life that they value and have reason to value.  I felt an epiphany when I first heard about this approach, but I felt that Sen's idea gave tangible meaning in the context of my community and my country to our family experience with disability. But, the idea of cultural vs administrative decision making may add another layer of understanding.  Was Sen trying to create mass cultural decision making for the world's poorest of the poor?  Does the PLAN movement in Canada embody the inclination to dispense with administrative making in the lives of our children with disabilities? And finally, does the business model once again have something important to teach those of us in the battlefield of everyday life that includes great challenges?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Approach"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2010/10/cultural-decision-making.html", "title": ""},

Linda Jackson writing for the Guardian, tells the stories of adults with development disabilities who are being moved from residential settings into family homes for the first time.  For Stephen Gilbert and Nigel Webb, outings with a family to vintage car rallies, community swimming pools or a cinema are completely novel.  \n \nThese two gentlemen are now part of the family in the home of Brian and Val Johns in Redruth, Cornwall.  They have just begun swimming lessons in preparation for a family holiday to Majorca.  The Johns are paid a weekly amount of money for the support that they offer Gilbert and Webb.  But the benefits of living in an atmosphere of love and belonging far outweigh the payments made to the Johns (which are similar to those paid to foster parents).  \n \nShared Lives, an agency of NAAPS was even able to place a middle aged rural woman with development disabilities with a farming family in Devon.  What makes that story so remarkable, is that the woman refused to be placed without her beloved flock of geese.  Now, everyone (including the geese) are happy on one Devon farm. \n \nAccording to Alex Fox, CEO of NAAPS, the scheme is not widely used because it is poorly understood.  Currently, there are just 10,000 Shared Lives carers in the UK.  Hopefully, this will change in the future as more people discover the health and wellbeing benefits of living together and caring for one another.   \n \nLet's learn from NAAPS and Shared Lives.  These programs embody the values that form the template for a caring society AND they save money.  It is estimated that developing a Shared Lives project to support 85 people would cost 620,000 pounds, but save 13 million pounds in the long run.  \n \nCurrently in Canada, residential housing placements (group homes) that receive public funding are oversubscribed with long waiting lists.  The cost of private, for profit group homes is prohibitive for anyone, save those with large insurance settlements resulting from catastrophic accidents.

It's called \"  Cool2Care \" and it's been creating quite a buzz (see yesterday's  Financial Times ). I first met the founder of Cool to Care, Phil Conway, three years ago when he was starting his new business. A former IBM marketing executive, Phil is also the father of young son with autism. His own experience trying to get suitable carers from his local government authority drove him to innovate. Cool2Care incentivizes young people to become trained as caregivers, then matches them with families who have been allotted social care funds to pay for respite. Because all the employees of Cool2Care work from home (including its CEO and founder), the agency fees are much less than those of local government or other completely for profit care enterprises. Families are able to make their social care funding go further. \n \nCool to Care doesn't exist in Canada, but enterprises like it will surely spring up. Canada is now the only country in the world that boasts a   Registered Disability Savings Plan . The RDSP is a tax sheltered savings tool that allows people to accumulate wealth to use for care, housing or leisure. Even if governments cut back social service and health care funding, as was announced in today's  Globe and Mail , there will always be a need for good care provision in the community and there will be people who can pay for at least part of it. \n \nWith ageing populations, it is worthwhile for students of business to pay close attention to social enterprises like Cool2Care.

Why should I pay?\u201d  \n \nTo that taxpayer, I want to answer that to give and receive care is good for all of society.  It is a life-enhancing activity.

Every five weeks or so, we go to the National Neurology Hospital in London where a nurse empties a syringe of muscle relaxant and spinal anaesthetic into a rubber port in the pump.  The needle doesn't hurt too much, because we make sure that \"magic cream\", or Emla topical anaesthetic is applied to his skin beforehand.

They might believe that because Nicholas is mostly bed-bound and sometimes has difficulty making himself understood because of his very limited speech, that he has a right to show unbridled anger. I disagree. I believe that precisely BECAUSE Nicholas\u2019 physical handicaps require him to receive care, he has an  added  responsibility to curb his anger and behave in a civil manner. \n \nCare is a two way street and part of building a new paradigm for active citizenship will have to include some training in \u201c receiving \u201d care. What are the ingredients of playing that role well? How can one get the best out of one\u2019s helpers? Is it ever possible to ask  too much  of one\u2019s helpers? How and when is it appropriate to show anger or frustration? \n \nAge does not preclude anyone from enjoying the benefit of understanding the rules of engagement when it comes to receiving care. Children are taught to respect their parents\u2019 efforts to provide for and nurture everyone in the family. Why should this expectation diminish in the case of disability or ageing?\u00a0 \nPerhaps we need to start with ourselves.

The first step is accepting an offer of help. The second step is saying \u201cThank you!\u201d \n Educators have managed to incorporate lessons in ethics and self-esteem in the curriculum. I propose we add some learning objectives to our teaching that relate to giving and receiving care. At lunch one day, children could experiment with feeding each other. In a care home, residents could set aside one hour per week to wash the face and hands of the care home staff, or simply listen to their problems.\u00a0 \n If we believe that relationships are the key to a good life  throughout  life, it ensues that everyone will at some point give and at other points need to receive care.

{"date": "", "body": "\nHow does power in relationships work? This is a question that has always interested me. For my graduate thesis in Theatre Education, I looked at the work of  Augusto Boal  \u2013 the Brazilian theatre maker, political activist and social experimenter. From him, I learned to use \"Forum Theatre\" to help Ottawa children understand how to stop bullying. Later in London, I participated in workshops at \" Cardboard Citizens \" , a unique London-based theatre company using Boal techniques with and for people who are homeless.  \n \nWhat does the work of Augusto Boal, or Cardboard Citizens or an anti-bullying campaign have to do with disability or social exclusion? Plenty. At the heart of social exclusion and factors that marginalize some populations are issues of power. But often it is hard to identify and understand the mechanisms of power in our own society. Often we do not question unequal circumstances, so embedded are our assumptions of why some have power and others do not.  \n \n \nFrom Shakespeare, to Strindberg to Jacques Brel, theatremakers have always had a natural interest in the politics of power in relationships. It's the stuff of drama and conflict. But in Toronto, a new company of actors are going further to poke holes in our social assumptions. Darren O'Donnell, Artistic Director of the company \" Mammalian Diving Reflex \" calls it 'Social Acupuncture'.  \n \nDarren writes: In our Social Acupuncture work, we are exploring an aesthetic of civic engagement: the artistic use of the institutions of civil society - of community centres, schools, senior's centres, sports clubs, the media and public spaces. Civic engagement as an aesthetic uses the consensual participation of these institutions as material to create work that, seen from most angles, appears to be mostly not art, or even intervention, but that takes modest glances at simple power dynamics and, for a moment, provides a glimpse of other possibilities. \n \nMy life in London is made richer by my involvement as a trustee of the London International Theatre Festival,  LIFT . Darren and the rest of Mammalian Diving Reflex came to LIFT last summer with a 'show' called \"Haircuts by Children\". A beauty salon in East London was taken over by 9-11 year olds who, after a week of training, offered free haircuts to anyone willing to trust a child with scissors in their hands. \n \nOf course I went. Ronnie was the little girl who welcomed me to her salon station. \"Would you like a haircut?\" she asked politely. \"Actually, I just had a cut last week\", I admitted, \"but I have a party this evening. Could you do a party hairdo for me?\" Ronnie nodded firmly and seriously. \"This season\", she said, \"it's all about big hair\" and she gestured, holding her arms wide. \"OK! Let's go for it, Ronnie!\" After my hairdo was complete with backcombing and spray, Ronnie suggested that we try some temporary (spray-on) colour. I was game for that and here is a picture of the results.  \n \n \n \n \n \nHaircuts by Children was great fun, but it was also serious business and excellent social acupuncture. It was fascinating to watch these young children take on adult responsibility while their subjects swallowed fear and assumed a submissive role.  \n \nMammalian Diving Reflex does a lot of work with children, but they also examine issues such as sex and seniors. The concept of social acupuncture has given me inspiration and ideas. Recently, I had a conversation with two distinguished women who are leaders in the UK movement to promote awareness of Autism. We decided to use our contacts in the luxury fashion industry to kickstart a photo campaign showing people with disabilities in aspirational roles with luxury goods. A person with down syndrome dressed in Dior, followed by an entourage of bellhops carrying shopping bags\u2026..something over the top, but fun and fascinating. \n \nSocial acupuncture is a medicine that we all need. It balances power by flipping it. I want this for Nicholas, but I also want it for myself. I plan to keep watching the work of Darren O'Donnell and Mammalian Diving Reflex \u2013 they offer a cure for what ails us.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Boal", "http://www.cardboardcitizens.org.uk/", "http://www.mammalian.ca/", "http://liftfestival.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l5fHcXvomT4/TLLsT0dHVUI/AAAAAAAAAD8/gcvnGKNSe50/s1600/haircutbychildren%21-719594.jpg"], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2010/10/how-does-power-in-relationships-work.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nYesterday at the Harbourfront Centre, I was sitting on the outdoor terrace looking out at Lake Ontario and Toronto Island. My reading began at 2pm, but I had arrived over an hour early, to get my bearings and to meet with my sister who had come from Montreal for the book launch. The International Festival of Authors has taken over the Harbourfront Centre and book events will continue all week. As I reviewed my readings, I heard someone call, \"Is that Donna Thomson?\" My high school friend Sylvia walked through the door with a younger woman, her daughter. I had not seen Sylvia in almost thirty-five years. Quite a few of my high school friends came to the reading as well as other other friends and family. I was so moved by the effort that old friends had made to support me. There were about sixty in attendance - a good result, considering the Gardiner Expressway was closed in both directions for roadworks and it was challenging to travel in the city without access to that thruway. I chose to read the section in the book about the child protection action that had been filed against me during the worst time of Nicholas' pain in 2004. I followed up with two other short sections, the first about the role of government in supporting vulnerable citizens and the second concerning the resilience of families. John Ralston Saul is an old friend. His experience as a sibling of someone with severe disability and as the patron of PLAN made him the perfect conversation partner following the reading. John and I chatted about our views on citizenship and contribution. I expressed my worry about defining contribution too narrowly, excluding those who are not capable of purposive action. I was glad that John introduced his opinion that \"charity has nothing to do with disability\", which allowed me out outline a third way for community and government to ally for supporting vulnerable citizens outside of a charity paradigm. Questions from the audience were personal and sometimes profound. It was my first event and felt wonderful to finally have the opportunity to exchange ideas that are so close to my heart. Thank you to everyone at the festival and at my publisher, McArthur and Co.!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2010/10/we-have-go-book-is-launched.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "", "body": "\nThe trouble with writing a blog is that I always think I need to 'sort things out' in order to formulate a clear message that is worth sharing.  In the midst of what feels like chaos, what is clear - what is worth sharing?  Well, I realized this morning that I had better ditch that precondition to writing. In some ways, the situation is normal in our household.  All the optics reflect stability, organization and calm.  Our boxes are all unpacked and pictures are hung.  Nicholas is loved and very well cared for in his new home.   But I was awake last night from 2-5am again and my dreams were of giant snakes in our lake water at the cottage.  Why do I feel frightened and under threat?  I think there are two reasons.  One is that I had no idea how I would feel with my boy living apart from us.   I know that everything we did was right for him and for us, but at a cellular level, my heart and soul are objecting.  My sister Karen suggested that my feelings reminded her of when she stopped breast feeding.  Such longing for closeness, yet the power of reason forcing separation.  I think it's not a bad analogy, but the difference I feel is that I don't know if Nick is safe because I can't check on him in the next room.   Nick is doing quite well, but a few days ago, his bloodwork results came back with a toxic tegretol level.  Tegretol is one of his medications that stops seizures.  Nick's level was far too high and the strain on his liver showed in another very inflated marker.  So, of course our wonderful-hero GP advised lowering the dose of tegretol.  So far, we've had four nights of the lower dose, but on average, eight grand mal seizures each night.  This morning a note from the doctor advises us to increase the medication back to the old dose.  Aside from emailing me on a Sunday morning during his holidays, our 'hero of the community' as I call him, managed somehow to get an appointment with the best adult epilepsy specialist on November 1st (the waiting list is usually over a year).  Tomorrow, I will call that doctor's office and beg for an earlier appointment.   Last night, Jim and I attended the annual National Arts Centre gala concert and dinner.  Yesterday, I joined the board of the Canadian Centre for Disability Studies.  This week I give the AGM keynote to an Ottawa parent group called Families Matter.  Now, if only I could sleep.  Does anyone know how to get rid of snakes? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.donnathomson.com/2011/09/snakes-in-water.html", "title": ""}
