It is the math portion of her post that I\u2019d like to talk about and extend just a bit. \u00a0\u00a0I briefly grazed the subject in a comment that I left there;  mostly in response to an article she cites discussing the questionable value of algebra .\u00a0 At the risk of Ms. Cornelius coming over and kicking me in the shin, I\u2019d like to elaborate\u2026 I was not a math whiz in high school.\u00a0 In fact, I was pretty poor.\u00a0 I goofed off and never took a lot of interest in the subject, but I also had a considerable amount of anxiety about the subject.\u00a0 While I was able to escape having to take algebra in college, I did have to take some serious chemistry courses.\u00a0 And chemistry is seriously into math when it comes to figuring out the concentration of a solution, molality and molarity, gas volume, pressure and temperature. However, I am still head and shoulders above my special education teacher peers in the subject of math.\u00a0 Very, very few of us are expertly proficient else we would be in higher paying occupations like engineering.\u00a0 But there are some math skills that are crucial to making it in the real world that simply can not be avoided. Let\u2019s start in the grocery store.\u00a0 I can buy 12 ounces of chicken nuggets for $2.44 or I can buy 28 ounces for $4.99.\u00a0 Which is the better buy?\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to tell you, if you haven\u2019t figured it out.\u00a0 But my decision is based on more than price.\u00a0 How much freezer space do I have?\u00a0 Do I like the cheaper ones well enough or are the expensive ones worth the extra money?\u00a0 And do I have the extra money needed to buy the better buy? \u00a0Then there\u2019s the nutritional information; can I compare nutritional information even though serving sizes may be different? If, in order to buy the bulk amount, I have to charge it on my credit card instead of paying in cash, is it still a better buy at 21% interest? And speaking of credit cards\u2026as soon as these kids hit the college campuses they will be hit with all sorts of credit card offers.\u00a0 By the time they graduate from college, in addition to the student loans, most will be facing a mountain of credit card debt.\u00a0 Mostly because they can\u2019t do the math and read the fine print. So my question is this; where are these students going to learn these day-to-day skills?\u00a0 In algebra class?\u00a0 By taking an AP calculus course?\u00a0 How much good is calculus going to do a person if they are sleeping under an overpass because they cannot manage their money?\u00a0 There are a number of us that are concrete thinkers and the abstract thinking required for algebra is beyond the scope of many high school students.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going so far as to say that algebra is never used in real life, but frankly I rarely find myself having to simplify a binomial equation.\u00a0 More pressing is how to calculate a 15% tip in a restaurant.\u00a0 I can do it, simply because 10%+5% = 15%.\u00a0 !5% of a $12 meal is $1.20 + $0.60 or $1.80.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tip $2 just to avoid being cheap and this  is  the south, after all. Back in the day, we did have consumer math as a course for those of us not proficient in math.\u00a0 While algebra was still going to be a requirement at some point, there was at least one other course to choose from in order to satisfy the high school graduation requirement.\u00a0 Most of the students in that class were not destined for college.\u00a0 I do have a problem with a curriculum exclusively designed for the less than 50% of students going to a 4 year university.\u00a0 What about the rest? An argument might be made to teach consumer math in middle school.\u00a0 However, such a course is going to suffer from the same lack of relevancy that a high school algebra course does.\u00a0 Most middle school students, while they are consumers of a sort, do not have to worry about interest or paying regular bills.\u00a0 In high school, many of these same students will be hankering to go out and buy a car.\u00a0 Now interest, insurance, gas milage and the cost of repairs has some relevance.\u00a0 Many will be working or looking for a job, and they will begin paying taxes.\u00a0 If they are savvy enough to understand compound interest, they may even start saving for retirement and be gazillionaires by the time they are 50. In special education, we often have consumer math for individuals in a developmental or functional curriculum.\u00a0 However, it is at least as important to teach those in the regular curriculum because these people are going to be the economic \u201cheavy lifters.\u201d\u00a0 They are the ones who are going to be the real drivers of economic policies and innovations.\u00a0 And considering the increasing size of the national debt, the imminent failure of Medicaid and social security, and a new global economy, they are going to have some heavy lifting to do, indeed. Think I\u2019m joking?\u00a0 Being over dramatic?\u00a0  Read this article about credit card debt  in this country.\u00a0 Explore the whole site on the topic and read all of the interviews.\u00a0 If you\u2019re scared to death and cut up your credit cards after reading it, you\u2019ve passed your best literacy comprehension test. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://shrewdnessofapes.blogspot.com/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/02/15/BL2006021501989.html?referrer=emailarticle", "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/more/cement.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/22/a-case-for-consumer-math/", "title": "A Case for Consumer\u00a0Math"},
{"date": "2006/02/23", "body": "02/23/2006 Thursday Coach Brown  recently  wrote a post  about his experience with special education and IEPs.  In his post he gives several suggestions for regular education teachers participating in the IEP process. One of Coach Brown\u2019s major complaints is about how parents interpret the modifications part of the IEP.  The law is pretty clear that modifications and accommodations for sp.ed. students have to be a part of the IEP.  As far as regular ed. teachers go, it is THE major part of the IEP where their input is crucial. Coach Brown gave an example of where a written modification includes \u201cextra time to complete assignment or tests.\u201d  Coach Brown, who evidently teaches a college prep coach, interpreted this to mean a few extra minutes whereas the parents interpreted it to mean a few extra DAYS.  In his list of recommendations, Coach Brown goes on to encourage vaguely written modifications. Anyone else see a problem with this?  His example highlights the problem with vagueness in IEPs.  He correctly interprets the IEP process as creating a legally binding document.  In effect, it is a piece of mini legislation.  Vagueness in making a law is an invitation for a lawsuit!  For if neither side can agree to the interpretation of a section or clause, it becomes a judge\u2019s job to do it when one side challenges the other.  Coach Brown\u2019s recommendation is a contradiction to his own bad experience.  So let\u2019s see if we can straighten this out with some new recommendations. \u2013 Accommodations and modifications should be as  specific  as possible.  This is where a regular education teacher\u2019s input becomes very important.  For if a regular education teacher refuses to comply with those IEP directives, they can be held  personally liable.   Yes, you can be sued. \u2013 Keep documentation of how and when you are implementing accommodations.  It might be easiest to do this in the actual lesson plan.  I can understand why a regular ed. teacher would want these to be vague.  For if there are several sp.ed. students in a class, it is a lot easier to put a vague note that says \u201cextra time offered\u201d in the plan.  This is where regular ed. teachers can work together with those in sp. ed. to work out the interpretation and implementation of these modifications and then they can be properly written. -Is the student going to complete tests and assignments in the resource room?  Back when I taught Ag., when I had a test, I made two copies of assignments for my special ed. students.  One they did in class and one in the resource room.  Or, when I collected the tests, I would forward the ones for special ed. to the resource teachers. \u2013 Talk to the case manager about the student.  This should be done fairly regularly, but especially when you get a notice of an IEP meeting.  Yes, writing these things is a bitch.  But more input makes it a lot easier. \u2013 Let the case manager know of any \u201cissues\u201d prior to the meeting.  If a parent is going to be hot and angry, the case manager can do a better job of helping you if they have some prior warning.  Is the student failing?  Is there behavior problems?  Getting blind sided at the meeting in front of parents is NOT fun. \u2013 If there is going to be some problems implementing a modification, speak up at the meeting!  That\u2019s why you are there!  Coach Brown is correct that you should never say \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this.\u201d   You can be held personally liable!   Work  with  the team to develop meaningful accommodations for the students that are also practical.  I don\u2019t LEA a lot of meetings where students are actually in the regular curriculum.  But when I do, I try to be sensitive to the regular ed. teacher\u2019s circumstances.  With 30 students to a class, time and resources are limited.  It\u2019s better to have modifications that teachers feel can actually be done and are willing to do than try to burden them with a lot of extra work. \u2013 Don\u2019t be defensive.  Be sensitive.  Parents of students with special needs have the hardest jobs of all.  They have YEARS of experience with their child and can be either valuable allies or formidable opponents.  No matter what happens, THEY are the ones that are stuck with the final responsibility long after they leave your classroom.  And here\u2019s a newsflash:  They hate the IEP process as much as anyone.  They dread it and feel anxiety walking in.  More than you. IDEA 2004 has stronger language in it than any previous version of the law where the \u201cappropriate\u201d part of \u201cFree and Appropriate Public Education\u201d is concerned.  It goes from the minimal requirements of earlier case law and expands it outward even more.  Times may get tougher for school districts. Special Education and Regular Education teachers need to work closely together and communicate regularly when they have students in common.  While regular ed. teachers may not want to do modifications at all, the law says they have to.  Failure to do so can be costly to the district and to the individual teachers.   You can be held personally liable!   Even though the IEP process is a pain, it pales in comparison to a due process hearing. dick Update: See Ms. Ris\u2019 take  here .

You could cut the tension in the room with a knife.\u00a0 The young case manager was nervous and agitated, and she could barely read the present level of performance (PLOP).\u00a0 The parents were glaring at her the whole time.\u00a0 Other participants were nervous.\u00a0 The young LEA had been the head of the department only a year and only had one year of teaching experience under her belt.\u00a0 She became the head of the department by virtue of being the only special education teacher who was fully certified.\u00a0 This had the potential of becoming a real disaster. \u00a0 After reading the PLOP, the young case manager was almost ready to move on to accommodations when I spoke up.\u00a0 I looked at the parents, who looked at me, and asked, \u201cWhat are  your  concerns?\u201d \u00a0 They spent several minutes unloading their concerns, their hopes and their fears.\u00a0 And we listened.

Just how much vote-buying can Georgia politicians pack into one weekend?LOL!  The gift card is allegedly a way that the state can help defray the amount of money that teachers dig out of their own pockets for school supplies every year.  And it is true that I have done this when I have seen items that we needed and decided it was easier to just pay for it rather than go through the hassle of a request/purchase order/vendor order/special request and waiting days to months to get the actual item.  I bought a toaster and a microwave so we could practice making stuff in our kitchen.  The adults in my room also use the stuff plenty, which is okay.  The point is, I know what I need and having to justify every little thing becomes just one more hassle. The Feds have also gotten into it, with their $250 teacher tax credit.  All of this is lovely, but it still looks like a cheap vote-buying scheme, to me.  I don\u2019t think it is any coincidence that Sonny is up for re-election this year.

{"date": "2006/08/09", "body": "In case you haven\u2019t guessed, we have been a bit short on the sort of drama that this program has been famous for over the last 7+ years.  This is good.  Too good.  I\u2019m waiting for that other shoe to drop. So I thought I might do a series on the related services that I work with.  I chose to start with PT because this was one of the first services I came into contact with that is not considered direct.  When I first came, physical therapists developed their own goals and objectives.  However, now they merely support goals and objectives developed by the IEP team, which in practice usually means the teacher. In Georgia and probably throughout the country, there is a shortage of physical therapists.  Magnolia County has only 2 (Loraine and Elaine) that are serving over 100 students.  This means that the amount of time a therapist actually spends doing therapy is minimal.  And this is something that became a hard lesson for me learn; that PT is more of a consultative job in our system than an actual service.  They come by, answer teacher\u2019s questions, teach them how to do various daily exercises and move on. The first few years of teaching, I was ready to throw almost all of the related service providers out of my room.  They came in at odd times, interrupted, expected undivided attention and then left me with a pile of extra work.  Basically PT became a part of MY job description as these fly-by-night characters came through my room.  Every time the PT would open her mouth it meant at least 2 more hours of work for me.  Per child.  It has taken me some time and some education to learn to appreciate these folks who stay just long enough to get my kids upset with their turning, twisting, stretching exercises. I have since learned that by following their programs, the students do better with us.  For instance, Larry has an absolutely hideous case of CP, and his limbs are so tight we can barely position him in his wheelchair.  But by working him over a bit, he does relax more and moving him is less stressful for him and all of us. My son, Thomas, did get PT services his first year or two of school.  He had some delays negotiating steps and he did have a sort of funny gait, especially when he ran.  But he was just getting consultative services, meaning  that Loraine talked with his teacher as well as talked with me when she came through my school to work with my students.  It does sometimes feel weird talking to these folks about my own children while serving my students.  I can\u2019t explain why it feels weird, but it does.  Part of it might be that I wonder if I get preferential treatment because of who I am.  I know it has happened at times, as I\u2019m not sure Thomas really qualified for PT, and I have some doubts about Percy\u2019s whole eligibility for special ed. PT in the educational setting is different from PT in the medical or private setting.  Basically, PT assists with areas that directly impact a child\u2019s access to education which includes mobility, posture and body movement and orientation.  A student may have difficulties walking, but if they can get to class independently they may not necessarily qualify for PT services.     Also some benefit must be derived from the services, which is why I have seen non ambulatory students dropped from the PT caseload.  However, Loraine and Elaine both will retain a student if the parent insists.   I can not think of one single high school student who has PT who is on anything other than a consultative basis.  Because Loraine and Elaine only work for the county 2 days per week (they also have a thriving private practice) we have numbers like \u201c0.025 hours per week\u201d for this service on the IEP.  The joke is that we\u2019ll just line the kids up by the road and they can drive by and wave!  However they really do put in more hours than indicated because they are both dedicated. The logic behind having so few hours goes something like this: A student can not possibly obtain meaningful benefit from seeing someone one time for 30 minutes per week.  Most exercises can be done by a para or teacher once they are showed how to do them.   So the best context for PT is integrated into the daily routine and schedule where the teacher consults with the PT and obtains guidance as needed.  Over the years I\u2019ve come around to this point of view more and more.  I\u2019m there everyday, I communicate with the parents more and get to know the students better.  I can do it on a more regular basis than they can.   I\u2019m saying all of this because many parents of students with severe disabilities wonder why their child gets discharged from a related service when they clearly have not mastered even fundamental skills.  How can a student who has two legs but can not walk be discharged from PT?  Because there is no evidence of improvement.  However Loraine and Elaine have both been good about helping with all students. Physical Therapists have the big toys/implements of torture (depending on your point of view).  I\u2019m looking at an incline prone pad that looks like something from a dungeon or torture chamber Loraine brought today.  Larry\u2019s in for it tomorrow!LOL!  This equipment is not cheap, as most run in the hundreds and thousands of dollars.  That torture rack I\u2019m looking at runs about $3,000.  Of course, it seems like anything marketed through a disability catalog costs huge dollars.  Bean bag chairs in the disability catalog I was looking at were running $100 or more.  I bought 3 at Big Lots for less than $50.  Loraine has some influence with the system\u2019s maintenance people so they will often help construct some things for her or make adaptations to equipment.  As she tells it, they actually like doing it because it is a pleasant diversion from bookshelves. Over time I\u2019ve come to respect the expertise and professionalism of our physical therapists.  They are welcome additions to an IEP team.  Since they travel to every school in the system, they get to see a lot of parents and experience a lot of meetings.  When a student transitions from elementary or middle school, the physical therapist is often the only constant.  Loraine has been doing this in our county for over 20 years and has known Spaz since he was in preschool!  Which means she has also known his mother forever.  This is a great source of consistency in addition to information for a new teacher.  I\u2019m sure many systems don\u2019t enjoy this level of continuity so we\u2019re lucky to have it. The science of physical therapy is pretty straight forward.  Posture, positioning and movement influences all sorts of things you can\u2019t imagine from attention and behavior to eating issues and continence.  With wheelchairs it becomes a huge job keeping up with positioning needs.  PT can also help give tips on lifting, which we do a lot in our room.  Doing it safely becomes very important as kids get older, bigger and sometimes more frail.   For students with orthopedic impairments and mobility issues, physical therapists are going to be important resources for parents and teachers.

{"date": "2006/07/10", "body": "As long as I\u2019ve been teaching (off and on since 1987) I\u2019ve had several years when I did not miss a single day of work.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t remember EVER missing more than two.\u00a0 When I was teaching at the private school, the Headmaster publicly recognized those of us who didn\u2019t miss a day.\u00a0 In a faculty of 35, there were only two of us, and the other guy hadn\u2019t missed a day in 20 years.\u00a0 That happened 2 years in a row.\u00a0 Of course, there was no other compensation offered. \u00a0 When working for the county at the state mental hospital, I had 2 or 3 years of perfect attendance.\u00a0 This time, I was invited to attend the school board meeting and I got a nice certificate.\u00a0 And that was the last time I had perfect attendance for several years as I was in the midst of starting a family.\u00a0 Most of the days missed were for various surgeries my wife had, since she was able to take care of the kids for the most part.\u00a0  \u00a0 Here in Magnolia  County, they do offer compensation for perfect attendance.\u00a0 I got a check for over $300 the other day, and that\u2019s the only thing I can think it would be for.\u00a0 There was no letter or certificate or anything indicating what this was for, which is just the way they do it here.\u00a0 And the check is  very  nice, make no mistake!\u00a0 They do offer around $150 for only missing one day, which I\u2019ve gotten a couple of times.\u00a0 I usually just sign the check and give it to Jane since I really could not do it without her.\u00a0 She\u2019s the one who tends to the kids when they\u2019re sick and runs them to their appointments and picks them up from school if needed.\u00a0 This allows me to concentrate on my work. \u00a0 But there is also something to be said for planning around the various breaks we have.\u00a0 My paras, colleagues and peers seem to be either unwilling or unable to exercise that concept.\u00a0 Dollars to donuts, I\u2019m going to be short some paras during the first 2 weeks of school for some business that could have and should have been handled over the summer.\u00a0 For instance, Princess and Queen (and possibly Patience) will have to get tbeir physicals in order to drive our bus.\u00a0 I\u2019m getting mine the week before preplanning.\u00a0 They ALL know they need this and they need to do it every year.\u00a0 But they won\u2019t do it, and will wait until school starts in order to take time off from work to do it.\u00a0 The school already pays for it, why not do it beforehand? \u00a0 I think doctor\u2019s appointments are my biggest pet peeves.\u00a0 We have weeks and weeks of NO work where this stuff could be scheduled, but they insist on doing it during work days and work hours, even waiting until the week after break to schedule this stuff for them and their children.\u00a0 It\u2019s annoying, and puts everyone else off.\u00a0 Why can\u2019t they be more considerate, like Coach who waited until June to have his first child? \u00a0 We get something like 9 sick days and 2 or 3 personal days a year which are able to be accumulated over the several years.\u00a0 Those built up days can be used to retire early, if there are enough of them or cashed out.\u00a0 I have 65 or so days stored up, that I know of.\u00a0 I don\u2019t keep that close track of them, but I know they are there if I need them.\u00a0 I know several teachers and staff who had emergency situations where they had extended illnesses and ended up without any days.\u00a0 So, they ended up losing pay at a time when they needed every dime they could get to pay medical bills!\u00a0  \u00a0 There are lots of reasons to show up to work everyday.\u00a0 Consider the work that goes into planning for a substitute!\u00a0 In my present position, I have a lot less of that, but for most teachers it is SUCH a huge undertaking to make all the work and then having to correct and grade it all.\u00a0 It takes several days work to make up each missed day. \u00a0 Another reason that I run into more often is my students punish me for being gone.\u00a0 They tend to act out more and test me more.\u00a0 Whether this is to actually punish me or it is because of a lackadaisical substitute who let things go, I can\u2019t say.\u00a0 In any case, it takes a day or two to get the kids straight after either a break or I\u2019m out a day.\u00a0 I still miss a lot of days for staff development and tons for doing other\u2019s IEPs.\u00a0  \u00a0 I like routine and it really messes me up when I get out of my groove.\u00a0 Missing a day gets me out.\u00a0 Plus, the entire time I\u2019m out my mind is still in the classroom, worrying about what is going on.\u00a0 Crap happens when I\u2019m out, and the anxiety rules over me when I\u2019m worried about someone (student or staff) being hauled off in an ambulance! \u00a0 A certain amount of fate or fortune has also helped me along in not missing many days over the years.\u00a0 I simply do not get sick very often.\u00a0 And when I do, it isn\u2019t for more than a weekend.\u00a0 The few times I\u2019ve been laid up longer, it has been over a break.\u00a0 Over the years, I have actually had students get irate at me for NOT missing more days.\u00a0 Those are usually the same ones who punished me when I did!\u00a0 EBD kids, bless their ambivalent hearts! \u00a0 The recognition in the form of a certificate, or cash or even just being able to retire a year earlier is nice.\u00a0 I like what I do and look forward to doing it most of the time.\u00a0 The reward of that is pretty good and the rest is just gravy. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/07/10/perfect-attendance/", "title": "Perfect Attendance"},
{"date": "2006/07/03", "body": "There\u2019s a  story out there about a  New Jersey  girl with Down syndrome who wants to graduate with her class .\u00a0 Alicia Vitiello wants to walk with the rest of her cohort in 2007 but the local school board has a policy that a student can not walk across the stage until their program of study is complete.\u00a0 The linked story is about how the White House has even weighed in on the side of Alicia.\u00a0 The school board seems to be holding their ground at the moment, but I\u2019m sure that once the USDOE gets involved and threatens them with a section 504 violation, they\u2019ll cave in. \u00a0 The issue is not IF Alicia graduates, it is WHEN.\u00a0 Alicia is 17 and will presumably be 18 for graduation next year.\u00a0 She will probably have enough credits to graduate.\u00a0 So what is the issue? \u00a0 The issue is that students in special education are eligible to be served by public education until they are 21.\u00a0 Most special education students do not stay that long, however.\u00a0 When their class graduates, they graduate and that\u2019s it.\u00a0 They go on to get jobs, go to college or be unemployed hoodlums like their regular peers.\u00a0 But a select few who are in the moderate or severe intellectual range of functioning will stay in school until they age out and are more or less shoved out the door.\u00a0 Is it so these students can gain more skills and better transition into adulthood?\u00a0 Well, that is the the theory.\u00a0 That is the reason for having a longer course of study.\u00a0 But very few school districts have anything to offer a student beyond those first 4 years.\u00a0 So basically they are going to get more of the same thing for 3-4 more years that they got during the first 4.\u00a0  \u00a0 What Alicia\u2019s local school is trying to say is this: when you cross the stage and graduate, you are finished.\u00a0 It\u2019s the end of the line.\u00a0 Graduation is the last and final step before leaving school.\u00a0 But if Alicia\u2019s parents have their way, that will not be the case.\u00a0 Alicia will be back at school the next fall and for several subsequent years until she can\u2019t come back anymore. \u00a0 Is this a problem?\u00a0 Probably not so much for Alicia, as her parents are well-to-do, influential and Alicia seems like a sweet girl.\u00a0 She will do what they tell her to do.\u00a0 The problem comes when you get a student who has graduated, who comes back and then we try to get him/her to work for us teachers.\u00a0 Remember, they already have their diploma.\u00a0 What incentive is there to perform?\u00a0 Some kids do run into this, especially some moderate kids who have enough marbles to realize that they don\u2019t have to if they don\u2019t want to.\u00a0 Graduation is a goal for some.\u00a0 It is also an exercise that provides a sense of closure for parents, caregivers and teachers.\u00a0 When Alicia finally leaves her school, she will not have that, because her chance was spent years before. \u00a0 The articles states that Alicia should be given a chance to graduate with those she started kindergarten with instead of comparative strangers when she is 21.\u00a0 But the fact is, if Alicia is not fully included, she probably doesn\u2019t know that many of her classmates anyway.\u00a0 It is also a myth that she would be graduating with strangers at age 21.\u00a0 Fact is, while her cohort will be almost graduated from college by the time she finishes, she will be one of the best known students in the school as this year\u2019s freshman know her and so will every subsequent year of new students.\u00a0 Recall my earlier story of  Graduation Day . \u00a0 All of my graduates crossed the stage after they had gone the entire distance.\u00a0 They were not coming back. \u00a0 Our district in Magnolia  County leaves it up to the parents to decide when they want their student to graduate.\u00a0 And they generally choose to wait until they are 21 or finished.\u00a0 However, next year Spaz is planning on crossing the stage a year early with his younger sister, and then coming back for one more year.\u00a0 (Stay tuned for THAT one!LOL!)\u00a0  \u00a0 There are some good reasons for waiting: \u2013 It gives us teachers more time to prepare a student for that big occasion.\u00a0 We have a more mature student that can better tolerate all the silliness, boredom and waiting associated with a long ceremony. \u2013 That last year is EXPENSIVE!\u00a0 Taking a few years to save up for the pictures, the invitations, the prom, the limo, the graduation fees, the paraphanalia and stuff assocated with graduation can not be a bad thing.\u00a0  \u2013 Think more intently on transition.\u00a0 Most post-school sheltered workshops won\u2019t even take a student who is not 21.\u00a0\u00a0 It would be nice if high schools had something similar for the 18-21 crowd, but they don\u2019t.\u00a0  -It provides closure for everyone involved.\u00a0 Like my prior posts on the subject describes, it can be a bit like a funeral.\u00a0 But closure really is needed.\u00a0 And perhaps this is just my own personal bias coming through. \u00a0 In theory, that 18-21 time period should be for post school planning and transition.\u00a0 In fact, it is simply more time for the parent to procrastinate.\u00a0 If Alicia were truly ready to graduate and get a job, this would not be an issue at all.\u00a0 She\u2019d graduate in May or June and be working by July or August.\u00a0 But that is NOT the case, here.\u00a0 Her parents want the school to carry her for several more years because they can.\u00a0 I agree that the school should offer more, but they don\u2019t.\u00a0 If there is a better post-school environment, she should be in it.\u00a0  \u00a0 I get the school board\u2019s position.\u00a0 It sounds a bit cruel, but a person only graduates from high school once.\u00a0 It should mean something.\u00a0 It should mean that whole beginning/end thing the valedictorians and commencement speakers talk about.\u00a0 Alicia is not really graduating because she will be coming back in the fall, unlike all those other folks who will have walked with her.\u00a0 She will be more isolated and alone than ever, having already done all the graduation stuff.\u00a0 There is no longer a ceremony to look forward to. \u00a0 The school board WILL cave.\u00a0 Alicia\u2019s father is a leader in the township\u2019s Republican Party and the white house is involved.\u00a0 What do you think will happen?\u00a0 Frankly, it isn\u2019t worth fighting about.\u00a0 Let those parents have their way.\u00a0 The press paints a picture of a little girl with Down syndrome who just wants to graduate and makes it look like the school board is denying her rights and keeping her from her dream.\u00a0 It\u2019s a touching story and good for a headline or two.\u00a0 But it is not wholly accurate.\u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019ve actually graduated a few of my students earlier than was necessary.\u00a0 One of them had a job that I knew may not be there if I kept him his full 3 extra years, so we moved him along.\u00a0 Most of the rest would be 21 but eligible for another year based on our county\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cTHROUGH 21 policy\u201d which means the kid who turned 22 in August could have stuck around the whole year.\u00a0 But I moved him through and graduated him at 21 anyway.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because I needed more space for incoming kids and the parents were all simply procrastinating.\u00a0 They needed the kick in the rear that NOT going back in the fall provided.\u00a0 Another year would have done nothing for the student while enabling the parents\u2019 poor behaviors.\u00a0  \u00a0 Frankly, after 7 years in our program, I\u2019ve done as much as I can.\u00a0 I need the closure of a graduation ceremony as much as the parents after investing so many years and so much effort with these kids.\u00a0 Doing it 3 years prematurely is sort of a kick in the gut to me.\u00a0 But if the parents insist, I\u2019ll go along with it.\u00a0 I may try to talk them out of it, but they have the final say.\u00a0 I\u2019m fine with honoring their wishes.\u00a0 But when the last and final day of school finally comes for a post grad student (and it will eventually come), I\u2019m going to be getting ready for someone\u2019s graduation.\u00a0 That student and their family will probably be getting ready for a waiting list.  \u00a0My Prior Posts on graduation: Graduation

{"date": "2006/07/12", "body": "Thanks to  Liz , who shared a brief excerpt on what Autism looks like from Laura Schreibman.\u00a0 Jane and I are both familiar with her work and I have cited her several times in my own.\u00a0  The full article on the AFT site  is worth a read as it gives a comprehensive overview of autism and its treatment from a recognized expert in the field.\u00a0 That\u2019s not to say I agree with everything she wrote\u2026 \u00a0 For Autistic Children, Relating to Others Is Life\u2019s Greatest Challenge \n By Laura Schreibman \n Peter is a beautiful 5-year-old boy with blond hair, blue eyes, and\u00a0freckles. He looks like many other very cute kids. He is well\u00a0coordinated, active, and agile. However, while Peter looks perfectly\u00a0normal, it soon becomes apparent as you watch him that Peter does\u00a0 not behave like a typical child. He does not interact with the other\u00a0children in his class, and in fact he avoids contact with them. He is\u00a0 not attached to his parents or anyone else, preferring to be alone.\u00a0 Rather than playing appropriately with toys, he puts them in his mouth\u00a0 or flaps them in front of his eyes. He does not communicate but instead\u00a0 parrots TV commercial jingles or bits of conversation he hears from\u00a0 others. He throws frequent and intense tantrums, often lasting over an\u00a0 hour and precipitated by nothing more severe than the discovery of a\u00a0 drawer left open, the disruption of a precise line of toy cars he has\u00a0 arranged by color, or the removal of one of the McDonald\u2019s mustard\u00a0 packets that he insists on carrying with him at all times. Sometimes\u00a0during these tantrums Peter bangs his head against the floor or the\u00a0 wall or bites his hand. He has calluses on his hands from repeated\u00a0 biting. When not otherwise engaged, he will jump repeatedly while\u00a0flapping his arms and whistling. The teachers in his school try a\u00a0variety of techniques in an effort to help him. Understandably, his\u00a0 parents are immensely frustrated. They cannot reach their son\u00a0emotionally despite endless attempts. Their lives are complicated\u00a0 further by the fact that they avoid taking him places because of his\u00a0 disruptive, bizarre, and embarrassing behavior. Their son has autism. \n \u00a0 If there is anything I\u2019ve learned from being a parent and teacher, it is there is no comprehensive picture of what autism looks like.\u00a0  Autism Diva  looks a lot different than Charlie over in  Autism   Land .\u00a0 In my own land, I\u2019m finishing ESY for Darius, while also having some times with my own son, Thomas.\u00a0 Schreibman\u2019s picture is of a child disconnected, aloof and not socially involved with anyone.\u00a0 Charlie isn\u2019t like that. Neither is Darius or Thomas.\u00a0 You can see what autism looks like for Charlie on Ms. Chew\u2019s excellent blog.\u00a0  \u00a0 When I last mentioned Thomas, we had decided that the Concerta was not doing any good but was actually causing some rebounding.\u00a0 So we discontinued it, and Thomas actually finished the school year with some good days. \u00a0 However, vacations and breaks are very tough on him because he has so much unstructured time.\u00a0 Jane has season passes to the Atlanta Zoo and the Georgia Aquarium, which both boys enjoy.\u00a0 However Thomas has been getting harder and harder for Jane to manage.\u00a0 He weighs about 75 pounds, and if does the dropping-to-the-floor thing, she\u2019s pretty much stuck.\u00a0  \u00a0 Often a meltdown will start out over food.\u00a0 The Georgia Aquarium has a food court where they happen to have his favorite food; pizza.\u00a0 And it is plopped pretty much in the center of the place, so it is difficult to avoid.\u00a0 Thomas starts whining, \u201cI want pizza!\u201d\u00a0 Jane sticks to her guns (and the family budget) and promises them their lunches when they finish and get back to the car.\u00a0 Thomas whines and may even scream, \u201cI WANT PIZZA!\u201d and scream some more and flop on the floor.\u00a0 Now he\u2019s caused a scene.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t there this trip, so Jane is on her own.\u00a0 She eventually is able to get him and Percy out of the Aquarium (you HAVE to exit through the gift shop!) and to the car.\u00a0  \u00a0 Thomas likes to eat out and if it were up to him, we\u2019d do it every day for every meal.\u00a0 Which means that going to the grocery store turns into a meltdown when it comes time to go home. Or when going to the recycling center and we pass a McDonald\u2019s.\u00a0 Screaming often ensues and the meltdown can last a good hour. \u00a0 He also has a tendency to want to run off.\u00a0 In school and church, it\u2019s not a huge issue, but in the community it can be a dangerous thing.\u00a0 I\u2019m usually all over him when he is with me, keeping his hands on the cart.\u00a0 He\u2019s way too big to actually get  in  a shopping cart.\u00a0 But with Jane, he\u2019s been known to get away on occasion.\u00a0 In our yard he\u2019s learned to stay in the boundaries and is generally okay but still needs to be watched. \u00a0 There has been opposition and defiance, which I\u2019ll cover more in my next (and most controversial) post.\u00a0  \u00a0 I feel like I\u2019m sort of rambling here.\u00a0 Autism looks different to different people.\u00a0 To me, the parent, it is a world of constant diligence.\u00a0 I see other parents of NT kids just let their kids run all over the place, doing whatever they want in the neighborhood.\u00a0 That does not happen here.\u00a0 We are always watchful and diligent and always know where our kids are with our eyeballs fixed on them 90% of the time.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to believe the stuff that can happen that other 10% of the time! \u00a0 It is not an easy life, and this is the part of my life I totally had no choice in.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had to learn and grow and stretch in ways that are hard to imagine.\u00a0 All parents do.\u00a0 I think \u201cdiligence\u201d is the key difference between me and the NT parents.\u00a0 And Jane is even more hawkish than me over the boys. \u00a0 But I still can not tell you what autism looks like for other people.\u00a0 Schreibman\u2019s account tells someone\u2019s story, but not mine.\u00a0 There is some truth in it, but not for everyone.\u00a0 I\u2019m still learning about it and so is she.\u00a0 \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lizditz.typepad.com/", "http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/issues/summer06/autism.htm", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/", "http://kristinachew.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/07/12/what-autism-looks-like/", "title": "What Autism Looks\u00a0Like"},
{"date": "2006/10/01", "body": "I remember hearing another telling a story one time about when her son, Ricky, was at the clinic to get his shot in preparation for going to school so he was about 4 years old.    His mother had prepped him, and told him why they were there and promised Ricky a trip to McDonald\u2019s afterward.    So when Ricky walked into the clinic he was actually in a pretty good mood.    There happened to meet another little boy about his age.    \u201cAre you here to get your shot, too?\u201d he asked the little boy.   That boy\u2019s mother had NOT told her son why he was there and the result was a temper tantrum.    My question to you: what should this mother do?    Should she give in to his crying and demanding to go home?    Should she try to entice him with McDonald\u2019s?    The boy was clearly not negotiating.    He was crying, kicking and throwing himself on the floor.   Are there any other parents or teachers who have encountered this sort of behavior?    Are there any other parents who have a child who is not keen to get up out of bed in the morning to go to school?    Am  I  the only one?   One reader suggests ignoring as a legitimate intervention in such circumstances.    When the function of the behavior is to escape demands, escape responsibility or even escape consequences, ignoring is completely inappropriate.    I\u2019m not necessarily talking about overt behaviors like tantrums as much as refusing to move.    If your child doesn\u2019t get out of bed in time to go to school, and refuses to comply and he is allowed to sleep in, you are reinforcing noncompliant behavior.    Who wouldn\u2019t rather sleep in?      Thomas is such a textbook case of this.    Monday through Friday, it is a chore to get him up at  6:15  to catch a  6:45  bus.    He acts like he just can\u2019t stay awake and sometimes complains that he feels sick.    But, being the mean parents we are, we FORCE the boy out of bed and MAKE him go to school!    This is non negotiable.    Ignoring is not an option.   Guess what happens on Saturday morning?    Does he sleep in?    Does he take advantage of the opportunity to rest and sleep?    No, he is up at  5:30 !!    Heck, we might even let him stay up and hour or two later on Friday just to see if he might sleep in.    Not a chance.    But we are not quite as rigid on this point, although I\u2019ve been sorely tempted to keep in his room until  7:30  just because he can\u2019t be left alone.    But we just deal with it.    Jane does mostly.   If a person refuses to do something, they may be trying to access attention.    Then ignoring is a legitimate extinction technique, because it is matched to the function.   In the case of Jim, attention was not the function of his noncompliant behavior.    How do I know?    Because he could be left in the room completely alone and he would be perfectly content to sit in the chair with his head down between his knees all day long.    Attention from people is not real high on his agenda.    He\u2019d rather people left him alone and there are more times than not when I can totally relate!      So we have a situation where a student is not only escaping demands but also getting access to some sort of automatic reinforcement.    The first thing is to get the attention of the person.    In Jim\u2019s case it involved shutting down the whole vestibular feedback he had going on by leaning over his chair.    The intent was that by gently tipping his chair forward he would just stand up. making guidance a lot easier.    Instead, he rolled on the floor.   Upon some reflection, I now realize that what I wanted to do was put the escape behavior on extinction.    The only way to do that is to block escape.    Ignoring works when attention is the maintaining factor.    Since I couldn\u2019t get Jim to go to his class and he was too big to carry there, that is when I did some other work with him.    In this case, trying new foods was a much higher demand activity than what the other class was doing which was basically watching a movie.    And there was the key.   As a youngin\u2019 I didn\u2019t always want to go to school either.    But I rarely ever missed a day because I lived on the farm.    Farming involved MUCH higher demands than schoolwork ever could.    Dad wouldn\u2019t hesitate to dump me out of bed and kick my posterior out to the barn if I had a notion to skip school.    So yes, I am pretty old school.      Many kids today have absolutely no concept of authority.    Mine do.    If one of my own kids refuses to follow a teacher\u2019s instruction and dumping him out of the desk does any good, I say it\u2019s okay.    Parents nowadays are unwilling to project authority, and then wonder why their kids are brats.      I expect my sons\u2019 teachers to follow through on what they say.    If they threaten consequences, then there had better be some consequences.    Failure to do so merely trains the student to ignore adults.    This is how students begin training adults, as they begin putting parenting behaviors on extinction!  Ignore a parent long enough and they will throw up their hands and say \u201cWhat\u2019s the use?\u201d    So how do you put escape behavior on extinction?    By not allowing the escape.    And anyone who has spent more than a few weeks with a student can tell most of the time whether a student is trying to escape or gain access to something.    You know who in your class loves attention.    You also know the ones who will do anything to get out of doing work.  It is possible to have both things in play at thesame time. \n   I\u2019m not saying I haven\u2019t made mistakes.    Maybe I should spend a week chronicling my biggest snafus.    I don\u2019t care how much of a behaviorist one is, kids don\u2019t come with an instruction manual and each one will present something new and interesting.    That\u2019s one of the reasons I stay.   dick     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/what-if-it-were-one-of-your-kids-escape-extinction/", "title": "What if it were one of your kids?: Escape\u00a0Extinction"},

{"date": "2006/11/01", "body": "GAA is still the dominant influence in my teaching life, but I\u2019m going to take a shar p turn, here. \u00a0 Every Friday and every Monday, the principal of Magnolia High, Mr. \u201cFightin\u2019\u201d Joe Clark sends out an email to everyone announcing how many of the staff are out. \u00a0  Last Friday, about 20% of the staff were absent. \u00a0  Monday, about 12% of the staff were absent while only 8% of the students were absent. \u00a0  Our Superintendent mentioned this in a beginning-of-the-year speech he gavem where he said that teachers were missing more days than the students. \u00a0  It would be interesting to know how wide spread the problem is, and what the cause is. \u00a0 In my classroom, I rarely go a week without at least one person out for some reason. \u00a0  As for me,  last year I didn\u2019t miss a day  and haven\u2019t so far this year. \u00a0  But if it does happen where I have to, it\u2019s not a big deal. \u00a0  I just find it more of a bother to be out because it takes time to put things back together after just one day out and the kids like to punish me for not being there upon my return. \u00a0  \u00a0 But there is a problem that is lurking in the wings, and it seems to be growing nationwide. \u00a0  Last Sunday, I happened to catch part of a PBS special on it, and this months Reader\u2019s digest had at least 2 articles on it. \u00a0  The radio waves are filled with advertisements warning about it an epidemic that is mostly preventable. \u00a0  And it\u2019s not autism. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019m talking about diabetes, specifically Type II Diabetes. \u00a0  Apparently this is what happened to the little girl I was doing Hospital Homebound for last year, and they didn\u2019t know she had it. \u00a0  But it is a growing problem in the U.S. and threatens to overtake our healthcare system. \u00a0  It is also becoming a  global problem . \u00a0  Apparently having all the food we want is killing us. \u00a0 According to the PBS special, those of Hispanic or African descent have a 1 in 2 chance of getting diabetes at some point. \u00a0  That is an incredible rate! \u00a0  \u00a0 And the consequences of carelessly ignoring the issue can be quite dire. \u00a0  The good news is that it is controllable and perhaps even preventable. \u00a0  I\u2019m sure there are readers who are more familiar with this that I am, and could expand on the topic much more. \u00a0 Aside from the ads and publicity, this has been something that has been casting a shadow over my own classroom. \u00a0  Queen happens to have almost every risk factor there is for this disorder, including a temperament that is in deep denial of the problem. \u00a0  She already takes blood pressure medication that she does not take regularly as prescribed. \u00a0  She insists on eating the fattiest, most sugary substances within reach and is relatively inert when it comes to exercise. \u00a0  Her lack of physical mobility is becoming more of an issue as our students require more physical involvement. \u00a0 Coach is also being monitored for his blood sugar, his heart and his blood pressure. \u00a0  He is only about 25, but is overweight at about 290 lbs and about 5\u201911\u201d. \u00a0  The good news is that he has dropped almost 50 pounds over the last 18 months, and is getting serious about his diet and exercise. \u00a0  He seems to have some motivation in his favor, as well as being of European descent which for some reason helps. \u00a0 Patience is in her early 30\u2019s, is not significantly overweight and eats relatively well. \u00a0  She\u2019s probably the most fit of the 4 of us.. \u00a0  However, she is of mixed Hispanic and African descent and she says it is easier counting members of her family who *don\u2019t* have diabetes than ones who do. \u00a0  Both her parents and 5 of the 7 siblings of her parents have it. \u00a0  She suffers from low blood pressure, so her risk is still pretty moderate. \u00a0 And then there is me. \u00a0  I quit smoking months ago and have weighed 220 lbs for the last 10 years at 6\u20191\u201d. \u00a0  So I am a bit over weight but at least stable. \u00a0  My blood pressure and general health have been pretty good and my family\u2019s health has been good with no known risk factors. \u00a0  I know I\u2019m not getting enough exercise which is a challenge with a bad knee. \u00a0  \u00a0 As far as being physical, while we do lots of lifting and positioning and moving, it is not quite as physical of a job as my own ancestors who were all farmers. \u00a0  We have our own kitchen in our room, so we have access to food all the time. \u00a0 And parents\u2026egad! \u00a0  ALL of the parents of my kids are severely obese. \u00a0  Every. Single. One. \u00a0  I hadn\u2019t thought about that at all until just now. \u00a0  \u00a0 Am I being alarmist? \u00a0  I don\u2019t know. \u00a0  I do know that I would rather NOT have diabetes than have to deal with whatever complications occur with it. \u00a0  I see a lot of over weight educators (even bigger than me) out waddling around. \u00a0  Could we be smarter about it? \u00a0  Should we? \u00a0  Is our healthcare system on the verge of collapse because of this one disease? \u00a0  These are all sobering questions but I suspect I\u2019m not the only one thinking about the possibility of dealing with these issues.

As soon as school started, addendums were being written to adjust services and schedules from those written just months earlier, while transfer students were being put through the process from scratch.   I\u2019m visiting several middle schools this week, representing the high school for 8th graders transferring into the high school next year and without exception, I haven\u2019t seen a familiar face yet.  Every one of these teachers are new and I\u2019m seeing brand new folks lead the IEP process.  In many instances the LEA, the graduation coach and the regular ed teacher are also brand new.  What this means is that a lot of parents are the most experienced people in the room when it comes not only to their child but to IEPs in general.  These new teachers all use the same word to describe their experience with writing and delivering these IEPs: Overwhelming. In addition to attending and LEAing meetings for other teachers at this school and attending several others, I\u2019m busy writing IEPs for my own students, which is no small job hence my lack of posting around here.  It is THE most stressful and busy time of the year for special education teachers around the country.  My blog gets a tidal wave of hits as my IEP series pops up on other blogs, search engines and discussion groups.  I hope y\u2019all find it helpful. This business has put a crimp in my TeacherTube video postings but I have new footage that will be edited and posted at some point.  I hope to shoot some more in a couple of weeks as the paperwork craziness slacks off a bit.  I hope it slacks off a bit. I do have some good ideas, courtesy of those new teachers that I talk to.  Lesson plans, data sheets and data collection are towards the top of the list.  I\u2019m also looking forward to taking some classes this summer or maybe attending a conference or two and blogging those.  I\u2019d also like to get my online course up and running at least for our own county.  I\u2019ll be attending a class in a week that wraps up my Moodle training. To all of you new teachers looking for resources, ideas and help; hang in there.  Experience has taught me (if nothing else) is that every year it is crazy towards the end, and every year I am exhausted at the end and every year I some how make it through the experience.  Just take it a day at a time, one step at a time and things will work out.  Things will get crazy and sometimes very, very ugly.  But you\u2019ll make it if you\u2019ve made it this far.  Sometimes you just have to laugh to keep from crying. D.

{"date": "2007/02/07", "body": "\u00a0 I have no special reason why I\u2019m posting about this topic other than I think it\u2019s kind of important. \u00a0  Many people wouldn\u2019t believe that I used to get bullied occasionally as I was not always the big, ornery beast that I am today. \u00a0  But I thought I\u2019d share an idea or two about the subject from some of my experiences. \u00a0 First off, the most commonly cited cause of someone becoming a bully is their own low self esteem. \u00a0  They try to compensate for this lowness and smallness by picking on others. \u00a0  While this may be a true analysis it gives little comfort to the person being bullied to know the person victimizing them has low self esteem. \u00a0  Being a victim doesn\u2019t exactly raise a person\u2019s esteem, you know? \u00a0  And there is a slim likelihood that one can administer sufficient psychoanalysis to the bully in order for him to uncover his subconscious conflicts while he is pounding you. \u00a0  \u00a0 Individuals with autism are frequently targeted by bullies because they are simply easy targets. \u00a0  They may already have difficulty making friends which makes them vulnerable as being outsiders. \u00a0  Anyone who grazes outside the herd is vulnerable to being attacked by predators, and people with autism are not known for blending into the herd. \u00a0  While I personally see this as a positive attribute, this becomes a social liability especially when there is a bully about who is looking for trouble. \u00a0 As a parent who has been on the blunt side of the bully-victim equation, I can say that this dynamic is the stuff of nightmares. \u00a0  It\u2019s difficult enough for someone who is neurotypical (if I really ever was) but for people with disabilities and their caregivers, it is simply petrifying. \u00a0  So how do we deal with this possibility? \u00a0 First, there\u2019s a couple of ways NOT to deal with it, or approaches that are likely to result more trouble. \u00a0  Many people will counsel their kids to tell the teacher if there is bullying going on. \u00a0  And it is true enough that it is up to that teacher to have sufficient control over the classroom that any sort of abuse, assault or victimizing within should be verboten and met with a swift and decisive response. \u00a0  However bullying does not usually take place within the well-ordered and structured classrooms as much as in hallways, restrooms and other areas of the building where there is less supervision. \u00a0\u00a0  So the person who reports being bullied will be reporting it after the fact to a teacher who was not there. Any confrontation with the bully will result in result in one word against the other. \u00a0  Any subsequent investigation will take time and in the meantime, there may be swift retribution from the bully plus the victim becomes even more isolated for being a squealer. \u00a0 And then there is the time-tested response of confronting the bully. \u00a0  Bullies do feed off the fear of the person who they prey upon and becoming nonfearful or at least turning on the tormenter can sometimes effectively end the bullying. \u00a0  But it can also escalate it. \u00a0  Basically, in many cases we\u2019re talking about being willing and able to physically fight. \u00a0  We\u2019re talking fists to noses at the very least. \u00a0  And now days, there may be weapons involved. \u00a0  The confrontation approach needs to be considered with caution. \u00a0  Individuals with autism may not have the skills to successfully use a confrontational approach without escalating the situation and it may result in more harm. \u00a0 Bullying can be a serious problem because bullies not only go after the person\u2019s body and personal self esteem (and this is the highest cost) but frequently go after their property and possessions, using intimidation to steal. \u00a0  There\u2019s a very real cost, personally and monetarily to this. \u00a0  As teachers, we need to be alert and proactive. \u00a0  But as parents we need to be even more so. \u00a0  Do NOT leave it up to the school system to do anything about it. \u00a0  A lawsuit aimed at the school might move them into being less complacent but it\u2019s not going to help your son or daughter in the short term. \u00a0 The most effective method of dealing with a bully who is preying on individuals with autism may be the hardest one. \u00a0  It involves educating people about the condition and making them aware that they are attacking someone with a disability. \u00a0  It also involves doing some footwork on your own. \u00a0  From my experience, the most effective method involved seeking out and having a conversation with the bullying youngster\u2019s parents. \u00a0  If the parents are the least bit responsible, they do not want their precious offspring to be labeled a bully. \u00a0  They may deny and defend their little perpetrator. But giving that parent a heads up still puts them on notice that you are watching and are prepared to deal with any situation. \u00a0  Often, just the fact that the bully sees the victim\u2019s parent in his own home changes the whole dynamic of the situation. \u00a0  The key is to not necessarily make the other parents feel guilty but to make them aware and to close the distance relationship-wise between the bully and the victim. \u00a0  People who victimize others the way bullies do have to keep some distance in order to dehumanize their victims. \u00a0  Closing that gap can even turn the situation around but often it may take some intervention in order to do so. \u00a0 When our children are involved it is difficult not to respond emotionally when they are being hurt by others. \u00a0  But the key to bridging the gap that exists between people of differing races, cultures and abilities is to promote understanding. \u00a0  Education is our single best tool and as parents we are often much better agents of education and change than the school system, sad as that is to consider. \u00a0  \u00a0 So my idea for dealing with bullying: \u00a0 1. Get as many facts as you can from your child. \u00a0  I know all about the \u201ccode of the schoolyard\u201d but in an age of weapons in schools, one can ill afford to be passive. \u00a0  However\u2026 2. Be sensitive to fears of the youngster of being further isolated and sanctioned socially. \u00a0  Especially in adolescence they will be massively sensitive to social pressures. \u00a0  Making a huge, emotional scene will alarm them and may be as threatening as actions by a bully! 3. Let the school know you know what\u2019s going on and are willing to work with them. \u00a0  The school may indeed be negligent, but don\u2019t start off with that approach. \u00a0  The goal is to resolve this instance so your son or daughter can learn in relative peace. \u00a0  4. Call the bully\u2019s parent. \u00a0  This might be very hard to do, but it might be the most effective thing you can possibly do. \u00a0  Making another parent aware and educating them can do more to change the life of the bully than anything a school system can do. 5. Know the parents of your son/daughter\u2019s classmates. \u00a0  I just thought of this, and these contacts can be a good source of more information and support. \u00a0  Often a bully works over more than one victim and even students who are not being bullied will be afraid. \u00a0  Dealing with the fear and its source can only enhance learning for everyone. \u00a0 It would be a mistake to rely on a school to totally resolve bullying without community support and involvement. \u00a0  As a teacher, I can\u2019t be everywhere all the time. \u00a0  I do what I can where I am, but as a parent I recognize the mistake other parents make of relying on the school to do it all. \u00a0  Parents have much more clout and power to make a school system move than its employees and especially the teachers. \u00a0  They also can make a difference by talking to other parents and informing them and educating them about children with disabilities or children who are \u201cdifferent\u201d for any reason at all. \u00a0  I\u2019m hopeful that we can move beyond being afraid of people simply because they look, act or talk differently from us. \u00a0  And the key to improving the perceptions of the kids is to educate their parents. \u00a0  And the most effective educating agent for those parents is other parents. \u00a0 D. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/02/07/bullying-and-autism/", "title": "Bullying and Autism"},
{"date": "2008/05/01", "body": "This is something I\u2019ve been able to say the past few weeks that I haven\u2019t been able to say the last couple of years because I\u2019ve been busy trying to stay secret and anonymous.  During those years folks have crossed my path who might have been able to help me with stuff or who I might have been able to help more but these opportunities were passed by because I was intent on staying anonymous. Coming out has been exciting and scary at the same time.  Truthfully, I suspect a few folks might check me out a time or two and then move on with their lives and never come back.  Bloggers tend to be on the somewhat nerdy side, and most local people with whom I share my blog address are simply not on that page.  Others might look around and check back periodically.  And maybe a few others might feel like joining our little edublogging community. There have been a number of days, especially this week, where I was missing the opportunity to rant, rave and vent.  Some of my most popular posts were when I was spewing bile and vitriol upon my hapless readers.  That is trhe coolest thing about being an anonymous blogger in that you can flame the people around you for all the stupid things they do and few people are the wiser.  Yeah, go ahead and look in the archives.  If you think you found a post where I was flaming you, I might very well have been!  But most of my wrath is directed towards those in higher echelons of power on the state and federal level.  NCLB especially has received a lot of my rage along with the GAA. \nFWIW, I\u2019m known for being a prickly pear amongst the people who are directly above me, and more than once have been chided for being unprofessional in the way I share some of my views.  I have tried to tone it down a bit this year.  Honest!  But sometimes I think it\u2019s time someone just comes right out and tells the truth and exposes the fact that there is a king or queen running around somewhere with no clothes!  Ever seen a king or queen nekkid?  Not a pretty site.  A princess and an occasional prince might be able to pull it off, but not too many royals who actually wear the crown and sit on the throne. Put yer clothes on! For instance, in our county we have this entity called the Central Eligibility Committee (CEC).  I\u2019m not going to get into all the specifics of it here (local sp. ed. teachers can see for themselves on a sharepoint site) but I will say that the more interactions I have with that entity, the more vile and evil I think that it is.  I know most of the people that make up the CEC and like pretty much all of them.  But as an entity and a body that wields a considerable amount of power and influence, it has more in common with the old Soviet politburo that an entity designed to serve students with disabilities.  It should go the way of Soviet communism, and disappear entirely so that IEP committees (made up of people who actually know the student) make eligibility decisions based on more than a bit of paperwork. Anyway, I want to welcome whatever new folks happen to stumble into this from the Covington area, and note the disclaimer in my profile! D.

{"date": "2007/03/16", "body": "I write about paras probably more than any other teacher blogger because they are such an integral part of what I do.    I\u2019m supervising 3 right now, but have been in charge of supervising and training as many as 7 at one time.    I\u2019ve also done a fair amount of research on para issues, as well as have a background  as  a para at one time. \u00a0 \u00a0 In our weekly department meeting, teachers were admonished that they needed to be using their paras more effectively.    The department head said that they should not be sitting at their desks, reading books or doing some other personal work, but should be used to their full potential. \u00a0 I began to wonder how that translated into the minds of most teachers.    I have heard more than one teacher complain about the para being somewhat less than capable and some have even tried to get out of having paras in the first place because they think it is like simply having another student.    Math and science teachers seem to complain the loudest, at least from the small experiences I\u2019ve had with them. \u00a0 There are two issues that come to mind when I think about using paras effectively.    One is how the para is trained.    I\u2019ve commented before how I have met precious few (like NONE) that has bothered training their paras.    They treat them as incompetent underlings and then wonder why they are not getting anything out of them.    Or teachers fail to convey expectations, and then wonder why these other adults are not performing up to par. \u00a0 The second issue is also about training, but I\u2019m thinking about the training of the teacher.    There are currently no classes that I\u2019ve ever encountered at the university level that trains special educators on the training, supervision and evaluation of paraprofessionals.    In fact, I\u2019ve never met a teacher who was trained on what to do with those other adults in their classrooms.    In contrast, our county offers a class twice a year every year entitled  The Role of the Paraprofessional.    This class is required for every person hired as a para in our district.    Unfortunately, this class is taught by and for those in regular education, so the special ed. paras are often given material and content ill-suited to their needs.    But I\u2019m wondering about a class  for teachers  about the role of the para. \u00a0 I\u2019m thinking about possibly trying to teach an in-county workshop on the subject.  I\u2019m thinking it should include sections on training, supervision and evaluation.

{"date": "2007/03/15", "body": "Each year, I attend scores of IEP meetings and each one is unique in its own way. \u00a0  However there are a few things I\u2019ve noted, especially with those that involve students with milder disabilities. \u00a0  First of all, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve seen any of them go over the mastery of previous goals sufficiently. \u00a0  If you are a teacher new to the IEP process, this is the perfect place to start. \u00a0  Even I get all flustered when first starting to write an IEP and looking at the mountains of paperwork I have to chisel away at. \u00a0  I put the things off and off, and then wonder just where I\u2019m going to start. \u00a0  I have two of my own (Jim and Ravi) that I\u2019m working on for next week. \u00a0  I wanted to get drafts out today, so I had a hard deadline I\u2019d given myself. \u00a0  So I sat down with my pen and a copy of the previous year\u2019s goals and began working through them one by one to see how well they mastered them. \u00a0  Mastery of goals  should be done  in advance  of the meeting, not during the meeting. \u00a0  Assemble whatever data and grades you need. \u00a0  Once you do this, you have an idea of where the student is at and which goals need to be kept, changed, or simply were not good goals in the first place. \u00a0  Now you\u2019re ready to write. \u00a0 In the mean time, you also need to communicate with parents to get their input. \u00a0  In my experience, parents are not sure what to do or say at most meetings. \u00a0  Ask for input till you\u2019re blue in the face, but you probably aren\u2019t going to get much from them until you share some of your information with them. \u00a0  This is why I like giving my parents a weekend to look over a draft of the IEP. \u00a0  Make sure they understand that this is a  DRAFT  and that they can make whatever changes they like before or at the meeting. \u00a0  Obviously, I\u2019d like to know their intentions in advance, but if they want to wait until the meeting this is fine. \u00a0 As special education caseload managers, we have certain steps and procedures we simply must follow. \u00a0  These can take a lot of time, and frankly many of them are boring. \u00a0  My goal in giving out the draft is to concentrate discussion on the most salient features of the IEP, or those that the parent has the most concern about. \u00a0  They may be fine with most of your goals but have questions on a couple of them. \u00a0  They may have some valuable input for the transition plan or add things to the present level of performance. \u00a0  The more informed a parent is, the more they will be able to meaningfully contribute. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019m going to try something a little more advanced this year. I\u2019m going to put sticky notes throughout the draft with some questions that I have for them. \u00a0  The present level has many parts where parental input is needed, for instance I need to know what medications the student has and if there are any changes in medical status. \u00a0  Transition is really a huge thing, here. \u00a0  The school system has certain responsibilities, but we really are pretty limited when it comes to dealing with outside agencies. \u00a0  Therefore, parent input is crucial. \u00a0 For students who are not as severe as mine, getting inside their head can be equally as important. \u00a0  Find out what they like, what their goals are and where they want to be in 5 or so years. \u00a0  Obviously I\u2019m zooming in on high school students, but anything you can get at a lower grade as far as likes and interests will be helpful. \u00a0  \u00a0 Today, my parents will be getting a fairly substantial packet of stuff that I hope they\u2019ll look at and bring to the IEP. \u00a0  If there are portions of the draft that are unfinished (i.e. my SLP and the PT will probably not have anything finished yet) I\u2019ll remove them. \u00a0  But parents rights, a copy of a paper I wrote about guardianship, a copy of the mastery and any other assessment reports that I have will go home. \u00a0  The hope is that they will at least feel less anxious about the meeting walking in. \u00a0  I have had some parents say they\u2019ve felt better having their stuff ahead of time. \u00a0  I still worry a bit about it actually  increasing  the anxiety in some parents as the whole thing can seem overwhelming to them when they get this big, huge packet. \u00a0 Jim\u2019s mother will definitely come, because she always does. \u00a0  She has never NOT come to any sort of meeting we\u2019ve ever had. \u00a0  Ravi\u2019s mother, on the other hand, is a very big question mark. \u00a0  She will be getting a phone call before the meeting so that I can be sure I have everything I need and press her about her attendance. \u00a0  I\u2019m not going to pressure her into attending but simply try to get an  honest  response. \u00a0  \u00a0 It\u2019s pretty common that parents sign the notice and state that they will be at the meeting. \u00a0  Then they don\u2019t show up, leaving everyone waiting including an embarrassed student. \u00a0  They later claim they thought it was on a different day or at a different time which is far fetched simply because we try to deliver multiple reminders and we document the method and response. \u00a0  I think many parents are a bit embarrassed by their unwillingness to attend. \u00a0  Remember, no one really likes these meetings except possibly attorneys and paid advocates. \u00a0  So what I\u2019ve done with some degree of success is to assure the parent that if they can not attend, we are very much okay with it and  not  judgmental. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019ll talk to them and get whatever input over the phone and tell them this is fine with me if it\u2019s fine with them. \u00a0  I simply want honesty, and if they back out during that last phone call, I\u2019m okay with it. \u00a0  That will save the entire committee a ton of time and anxiety from waiting for someone who isn\u2019t going to show up. \u00a0  In other words, I\u2019m not going to wait until the meeting to get input from this parent who I think just might stand me up. \u00a0  I\u2019m going to make sure she gets to contribute in a way that may be less intimidating for her without guilt or blame. \u00a0  She will be able to advocate for her son in a meaningful way. \u00a0 With the above approach, I have managed to turn things around on occasion. \u00a0  I\u2019ve had parents actually decide to attend meetings who had not attended in several years. \u00a0  I think this may be because I did everything I could to limit the intimidation factor. \u00a0  Even if I had to go to the student\u2019s house and spend time with the parent that way, I was laying a foundation of trust and safety. \u00a0  \u00a0 As a parent myself, I totally get why parents don\u2019t bother showing up or participating. \u00a0  Every time Thomas has a meeting, the school redoubles its efforts at intimidation by inviting a slew of teachers and administrators from several agencies and services and then everyone tries to stare me down when its time to make a decision. \u00a0  Been there, done that. \u00a0  Gotten sick and tired of it. \u00a0  And his inexperienced caseload teacher is probably all but wetting her pants because she thinks she\u2019s going to get nailed for a lousy IEP. \u00a0  Thing is, despite goals and objectives and a behavior intervention plan that are totally lackluster, he continues to improve. \u00a0  That\u2019s really all I\u2019m after. \u00a0  But it would be nice if the red carpet of trust was laid down well in advance of the annual review. \u00a0  If school systems insist on cultivating this adversarial culture, they are going to reap the whirlwind of hostility. \u00a0 So if a parent doesn\u2019t want to go through these motions and hoops after having done it for over a decade, far be it from me to blame them. \u00a0  So perhaps one of my best strategies in getting parents to participate more is to not be so hard on them if they choose not to. \u00a0  They have lives beyond this one child and this one meeting with this one teacher. \u00a0  Unless you\u2019ve spent a lot of time with that child in his own house with his own family, you have no idea what sort of pressures and stresses that family is under. \u00a0  Being nonjudgmental can go a long way in forging some trust. \u00a0  Perhaps the family might come around to thinking that you might be someone worth spending some time with, and someone who will not make them feel small.  \u00a0 It is hard being a parent and not feeling very small and insignificant when surrounded by all of these well-dressed, well-spoken and well-educated professionals, especially when parents might barely have a high school diploma themselves. \u00a0 Dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

I wish I could report more on that, but I kept falling asleep.      However, according to the article, the GOP is only tweaking around with this abomination.    In the first place, they are providing some mechanism for states to opt out of the testing provisions of NCLB.    That sounds good to me, after my recent experiences with the alternate assessment.    Until I read this: In both cases, the states that opt out would still be eligible for federal funding, but those states could exempt any education program but special education from No Child Left Behind strictures. WTF?    So this means that special education still has to be shackled and cuffed to this leaky, stinky bureaucratic barge?    Of course.    Why?    Because the ignorant monkeys in  Washington  wrote and passed the IDEA 2004 re-authorization to align, heel and otherwise kowtow to NCLB.    Why?    Because those ignorant whelps don\u2019t bother thinking past the next fundraiser or martini.    The re-authorization of IDEA was not on the radar screen when Bush, Kennedy, Miller et. al. pushed and horse traded NCLB in its present form into existence.    They were so distracted by that stupid  Iraq  war, that they were 2 years over due on the re-authorization of IDEA.    And most members of congress probably didn\u2019t even bother looking at it and it passed with very little contention from anyone, aside from the usual spats about funding which they\u2019ve never honored and never will. IDEA 2004 final regulations were just handed down from the Feds last fall, so no one is even thinking about the next review of that law.    No matter what congress does with NCLB, those of us in special education are stuck.   In related news, I just heard about two teachers from the middle school that feeds into ours are leaving their positions.    Each have been teaching there since the school opened 7 years ago, but the rigors of the alternate assessment has made them seek other options.    Middle schools are no bargains in the best of circumstances, but they had to do the GAA on  every student .    I groused badly about doing 2.    Can you imagine doing 7 from 3 different grades?    They each had enough, and said \u201cadios\u201d to teaching severe and profound students.    Our county just had a recruitment fair last weekend.    Guess how many special education teachers showed up looking to teach the severe population?   How about NONE.    Zero. \u201c\u201dStatistics are not, of course, the whole answer, but nothing is as emphatic as zero.  United States  v.  Hinds   County   Sch.  Bd . 1970\u2033\u201d Mark my words: There is a real crisis brewing in special education that has been a serious problem for over a decade.    With the increased litigation, the increased legal red tape, the increased demands and the stress that goes with it, what are systems going to do?    There are simply not enough warm bodies to fill those positions open today. This fall it will be downright ugly.   dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/14/AR2007031402741.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/03/16/i-wish-the-news-was-as-good-as-it-sounds/", "title": "I Wish the News was as Good as it\u00a0Sounds"},
{"date": "2007/03/22", "body": "I had a chance to give a mini-clinic on goals to a teacher who didn\u2019t have them done at her IEP meeting. \u00a0  Yes, I know we are all supposed to develop them at the IEP with parent input all the time. \u00a0  I\u2019ve been to meetings where this has worked nicely and today\u2019s meeting was the first one I was able to do when I wasn\u2019t the parent. \u00a0 This was a student who was struggling with completing assignments, staying on task and using his time wisely. \u00a0  Unfortunately \u201cStudent will use time wisely\u201d with a criteria of 80% and an evaluation method of \u201cFormal and informal testing methods\u201d is one butt-ugly objective. \u00a0  It is meaningless. \u00a0  How the hell do I measure mastery on this abomination? \u00a0  The case manager was not the one who wrote the original goal, as it was done in middle school. \u00a0  I won\u2019t go into the trashy crap we get from the middle school in the form of IEPs, but this goal was the least of the offenses I\u2019ve seen. \u00a0 The parent and the regular education teacher got a bird\u2019s eye view, as well, of this process. \u00a0  The regular ed teacher, who is a young guy in his first year of teaching ELA courses caught on very quickly and was actually more helpful than the caseload teacher who has been doing this for 5 or so years. \u00a0  We actually put in some good goals that include some concrete mechanisms for accountability. \u00a0  \u00a0 Instead of \u201cUses time wisely\u201d I wrote \u201cWill stay on task during a 30 minute interval in his resource class for 4 of 5 days per week for a 9 week grading period.\u201d \u00a0  The method of evaluation is timed observation from the resource teacher and it is to be reported weekly on the weekly progress report. \u00a0  I picked on the resource class, because that is where there should be a trained teacher and para who can work on this skill. \u00a0  The 9 week grading period limit gives the teacher room to opt out of taking the data once the kid has mastered the goal. \u00a0  This was the carrot for the student, himself, who basically wanted his mother and everyone else to get off his back. \u00a0  I said he could have that IF he mastered his goal. \u00a0  He had to prove something first, and then we might let him off the hook. \u00a0  But not before. \u00a0  I also wrote in an objective or two about completing assignments and keeping an assignment log. \u00a0  In anycase, we did it like it was 100% supposed to be done, but only after the teacher bombed out and the meeting had already gone on over an hour. \u00a0  The parent was getting belligerent with her son to the point of embarrassment and the case manager had lost control. \u00a0 I\u2019m not against parents having their say, but getting loud and blessing the kid out in front of others over and over and over gets old quite fast. \u00a0  I can see why the boy has issues. \u00a0  \u00a0 I was also invited to another manifestation. \u00a0  Once I heard one of the facts, I told the inviter that they didn\u2019t want me there. \u00a0  The school would clearly not prevail if I was at another of these where an unsupervised para was teaching the student\u2019s resource class.  \u00a0 We are now short no less than 4 special education teachers in this building. \u00a0  It\u2019s hard to imagine a more secure profession than special education with so many positions that are fully funded yet unfilled. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/03/22/goal-objective-clinic/", "title": "Goal-Objective Clinic"},

But in the meantime, I have students here who need me and I\u2019m going to do my best to make it a banner year for them and for me. \u00a0  I\u2019m going to do everything possible to make it such an outstanding year that everyone else in the building will weep bitterly at my departure! \u00a0  It\u2019s about being proactive and making things happen and advancing. \u00a0  That\u2019s going to be the hardest thing, but it\u2019s the most important thing. \u00a0  I need to really reach and strain ahead. \u00a0  I need condition myself into stretching. That\u2019s me, giving myself a pep talk! Each year there are always changes. \u00a0  This year, I get to meet the 4 th  principal I\u2019ve had since starting at this school 9 years ago. \u00a0  It seems like people come and go so quickly around here! \u00a0  The new guy looks like he\u2019s trying to tighten things up around here and he has a big job ahead of him. \u00a0  Our school was among the  52% of Georgia high schools that failed to make AYP  this past year. \u00a0  We have to make it this year in order to keep off of the dreaded \u201cNeeds Improvement\u201d list. \u00a0  As a county district, we also failed for the first time ever, to make AYP. \u00a0  And it\u2019s going to be harder to do that in order to meet the federally funded mandate of 100% by 2014. \u00a0  So we can expect every school in the country to be on the Needs Improvement list by 2016. \u00a0  Students with disabilities continue to be the major subgroup that cause a school or district to fail. \u00a0  It\u2019s ridiculous to think that every single student is going to master rigorous curriculum standards at the same rate or with equal proficiency as everyone else. \u00a0  No accommodation or modification is going to erase the reality that some students are not going to learn everything we teach them, even if they want to. \u00a0  And politicians seem to ignore the reality that there is a small percentage that just doesn\u2019t care that much about doing well in school at any given time. \u00a0  Preplanning involves lots of meetings and getting to know new teachers and staff. \u00a0  It also involves training my own folks and setting the pace for the coming year. \u00a0  We\u2019ve gotten our room pretty much straightened out. \u00a0  This isn\u2019t a small task since they removed some teacher desks. And moved everything around when they redid our floor.  \u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m going to do my best to have a good attitude this year and fend off the weariness that got to me last year. D.

{"date": "2008/06/09", "body": "Since school is out, I\u2019ve been having the time of my life, exploring new mediums and modes of expression and teaching.  I took over an hour of footage before school let out and am taking some time to edit and post them to  TeacherTube .  But I\u2019m also connecting within the  YouTube  community.  I\u2019m planning on doing more creative things on YouTube, which means not everything will be as \u201cprofessional.\u201d The great thing is watching what other people are doing and how they are doing it.  I was talking  to an assistant principal awhile back and letting her know  some of the things I was doing.  \u201cYou mean they have educational videos on YouTube?\u201d Yes, yea they do.  In fact, YouTube is a treasure trove of knowledge and information.  Yeah, I subscribe to an  X-men cartoon channel  and  Al Yankovic\u2019s \u201cWhite and Nerdy\u201d  video is among my favorites along with the  Guacamole Ukulele song .  Kind of a theme going on there. But there is a world of knowledge out there waiting to be discovered.  My one subscriber, so far, is  Dr. Melvin Koplow aka drmdk .  His  YouTube channel is here .  There\u2019s some good information there, as he got the idea to videotape  short interviews with doctors and experts from a variety of fields and disciplines, making medical information available to anyone.  The information is fascinating and cutting edge and he is truly on to something.  I will warn you that it helps to have a keen interest in the content, as the interviews and videos are a bit on the dry side, but they are also less than 10 minutes long each.  And in these videos, especially in the autism section, you can see what the doctors and experts say. While information and knowledge is power, it\u2019s up to individuals to decide whether or not they want to be ignorant.  Hat tip to  Liz  who found a  good article about the costs  of unproven and sometimes dangerous treatments for autism.  Dr. MDK does cut through much of this with a number of his videos on the subject.  In fact, one of the the reasons Dr. MDK started making these videos is linked to Liz\u2019s  latest blog entry here .  You can see Dr. MDK talking about why he\u2019s making these videos  here .  He talks about how there are ghostwriters done by people who didn\u2019t even do the work or research.  There is something about having a face and a voice attached to the information instead of just a written page. And that\u2019s part of what I\u2019m doing.  I\u2019m putting myself out there, where you can see what I\u2019m doing and who I am with real, actual students.   You see who I am.  This isn\u2019t just some anonymous blogger anymore.  It\u2019s someone more real.  Back when I posted my  Fleecing article , I initially got a lot of comments from people who agreed with it, but as time wore on, more and more parents started commenting and many of them  stated how  these controversial therapies had helped or cured their kids. Where\u2019s the before and after YouTube videos? I have some that I\u2019m working on, and you can judge for yourself.  Before and after videos are one reasonable measure of validity, according to  Kazdin\u2019s authoritative work  on single-case research designs.  But I haven\u2019t seen any.  Why isn\u2019t this very simple method used to lend at least a minimum of validity to any of these treatments?  Because there is none?  That\u2019s not to say that method alone would be sufficient to prove anything as much as support some of the ideas.  Yes, YouTube could be a vehicle for helping promote legitimate treatments for autism.  You can look and see several  videos of kids getting behavioral therapy and track the progress yourself of some of the kids. There\u2019s good information out there, it\u2019s just a matter of finding it.  Or better still, creating it. D.

{"date": "2008/06/04", "body": "In making my course for teachers and paras for students with severe disabilities, I\u2019ve been looking for content related to what we do in the classroom.  Today I decided to work on Discrete Trial Teaching (DTT) sometimes also called Discrete Trial Instruction (DTI).   Same thing, different name. I prefer video over text alone, so I went first to TeacherTube, since the school system doesn\u2019t block that site.  However, the only video there on the subject is t he one I posted .  Oh well.  YouTube is a better source for videos on anything and a search there was much more fruitful.   Here\u2019s one  working with a very young child.  No matter the age, the same rules always apply.  Keep the instruction consistent, reinforce independent responses, and record the responses for data analysis.  The YouTube video gives very comprehensive, yet concise instruction on the topic and I\u2019d love to use it. There is also a series of Lovaas training videos on YouTube which are much more advanced, behaviorally speaking, but the one listed above gives a better overview in a lot less time .   Part 1  shows how  not  to do it in the beginning, which you can see from the comments elicited strong reactions from a few viewers.  It\u2019s a bit dated, but you get a good view of a purer form of DTT from the Lovaas people.  There are many YouTube videos in a variety of languages worth looking at and these are mostly used for and by parents.  Teachers and paras really need to tap into this information, too. Typing in \u201cABA\u201d reveals a lot of videos showing it in action, mostly with very young children with autism.  DTT is  not  the same thing as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).  ABA is more of a global description of a system.  It\u2019s sort of like referring to \u201crain\u201d as \u201cweather.\u201d  Yes, rain is weather, but it\u2019s only one aspect of weather and even precipitation.  Weather encompasses all manner of meteorological events including wind current, barometric pressure and the jet stream.  ABA encompasses a whole lot more topography beyond just DTT, but a lot of people outside the field confuse the two. I recently put a couple more videos up showing some of what I do with a type of DTT  here  and  here .  This is also serving as a sort of tutorial in modeling for para instruction at the same time instructing the student.  I probably need to make a more explicit para training video since that is a big issue for most special ed teachers. I like DTT because it is straightforward,  and something that paras can learn and do pretty easily.  It can yield some good data and works well with short-term IEP objectives.  It is something that is not expensive to set up, and it is accessible to anyone who wants to learn how to do it. Catherine Maurice\u2019s  Behavior Intervention for Young Children  remains one of the best and most accessible resources on the subject even though she makes the common mistake of confusing ABA with DTT.  Many of these interventions can be used with older students with severe autism and you\u2019ll recognize what we do in the videos compared to what is done with the youngsters.  It\u2019s only been within the last 10 years that DTT really took off in the autism community, so students in high school were probably never exposed to this behavioral technology at a younger age.

{"date": "2008/06/30", "body": "I just finished my Advanced Moodle Course (which my county calls Elearn)\u00a0and did manage to get a decent course laid out that might be useful for the teachers in our county.\u00a0 You can see most of the content on my  TeacherTube  or  YouTube  sites.\u00a0 If and when I add more content, that will appear on one of those sights.\u00a0 I learned a lot by taking this course, since my course is also about teaching adult teachers.\u00a0 One of the problems with this course about interactive learning is that it is still taught in the traditional 20th century way.\u00a0 That means you have one teacher in front of 20-30 other people and that one person disseminates the content out to the students.\u00a0 However, there was a group of teachers that did get together and collaborated on their online course.\u00a0 However it was tough going for them as they hadn\u2019t actually taken a Moodle course before.\u00a0 Many Moodle courses still look like they could have been produced years ago, as they involve a ton of reading and then an occasional quiz to measure understanding.\u00a0 what these courses really and truly need is to incorporate the production of actual content. This course is being or has been taught by 3 different instructors, and I\u2019m wondering why they didn\u2019t pool their time and resources in developing content for this course.\u00a0 Each instructor could take a topic or a day (it\u2019s a three day course) and really and truly demonstrate the power of this technology.\u00a0 For instance, this class had a few other nerds like me, but also had some people who have difficulty managing\u00a0basic computer functions.\u00a0 By having recorded content online, it would allow those people who needed to see something multiple times to actually see those instructions multiple times while the faster people could keep progressing or enhancing our own courses/sites. You can get the gist of what I\u2019m saying by  looking at this video . \u00a0 So I\u2019ll be off and traveling for the next 3 weeks, and we\u2019ll be driving about 3,000 miles!\u00a0 Fortunately, both of my kids travel really well.\u00a0 Having an extra mp3 player and laptop/DVD player will make things a little easier.\u00a0 Stay Cool!

{"date": "2008/07/23", "body": "Inspired partially by this story: \n \n \n This topic has been a bit of a mindworm for me for several weeks, ever since we visited the church of my father-in-law while on vacation.  And again this week, while a local church is having vacation Bible school (VBS). \n Churches and houses of worship are pretty central to the community life of a lot of people, especially families.  It is often considered an extended part of the family where friends are made and met.  Churches provide a valuable source of social interaction that can be less pressured than the formal structure of school. \n Or is it? \n It\u2019s difficult for me to think of a place where a meltdown is less welcome than at church.  At school, in stores and parks tantrums are pretty common amongst all children.  They also happen at church, but for some reason they inspire a level of shock and horror of Biblical proportions.  People can and will complain, gossip and talk about a child\u2019s behavior.  When it comes to support, church can definitely be a mixed bag. \n Some of the earliest indications of troubles for Thomas were evident in church.  When he was in the nursery, it seemed like Jane was always getting called down there to tend to some sort of mishap.  We moved to another community when he was 18 months old, and this church\u2019s nursey had a beeper system.  Parents would get a vibrating pager and if there was a problem, we would be paged.  And it seems like we got paged alot.  All.  The.  Time.  In fact I remember the first Sunday we  didn\u2019t  get paged.  We were nervous and convinced that the batteries had gone dead or that the pager was broken!  Thomas was prone to meltdowns in the church setting, crying almost the entire time or to a point where he would throw up.  The fact that he was prone to reflux didn\u2019t help matters. \n Before he was diagnosed, we thought he was just fussier and more temperamental than other kids.  I don\u2019t think other parents were so judgmental in the early days as much as they were thankful this wasn\u2019t  their  child!  \n Neurotypical kids often meltdown when they separate from parents, especially when the parents don\u2019t attend very regularly.  I remember volunteering for a two year-old nursery one Easter Sunday.  9 little girls, all dressed in their best Sunday Easter dresses cried, screamed and tantrumed for a good 30 minutes before we could redirect them into some play activities.  And then it repeated when parents started to pick up their kids, and those left behind thought they were being abandoned.  Most of these kids had not been in a church since Christmas or Easter the year before! \n But Jane and I were regular attenders.  We were there pretty each and every Sunday unless someone was sick.  We also were involved in other church activities outside of Sunday mornings.  But Sunday mornings were a source of constant anxiety.  \n First, we had to get there.  A lot of families can relate to the struggle involved in getting everyone there on time, without some sort of meltdown.  And these are regular, neurotypical intact families!  Getting Thomas ready involved extra time as he does not do well when he\u2019s rushed.  And it seems like we were always rushed. \n Then we would drop him off to his Sunday school class, while we went to our adult Sunday school class, which I sometimes taught.  But invariably, the beeper would go off, and usually it was Jane who would have to see what the problem was.  It got to the point where Jane just quit going to our adult Sunday school class and stayed with Thomas in his class.  The anxiety of waiting for the pager to go off was just too much. \n After Sunday school, we went to the worship service.  At 3, Thomas was too big for the nursery, and attended with us.  This posed a big challenge as he often wanted to \u201ctalk\u201d and make noise at exactly the wrong time, which was during the pastoral prayer.  Keep in mind, this prayer and the sermon were often taped and broadcast over the radio the next week.  I remember actually being able to hear him while listening several times!  Then there is the business of staying in your place and following the liturgy which involves standing up and sitting down at certain times.  Outside of school, church is often the most structured place a child attends, but unlike school, the rules are not so explicit.  However, there is a decent level of consistency in the service they he eventually started catching on to.  \n Midway through the service, before the sermon, the kids up through 3rd grade go to children\u2019s church.  So the big task was getting him through the children\u2019s sermon, which segued into the kids leaving to go to children\u2019s church. \n Getting through to that point often involved bringing candy and snacks.  This was actually pretty successful as long as they didn\u2019t give him too much during Sunday school.  As long as he was munching away, he seemed fairly content.  Mixing the snacks up also helped slow him down as he would first get the peanuts, then raisins and finally the cheerios.  Otherwise, he would finish the snack before the pastoral prayer, and then we were in trouble. \n The children\u2019s sermon took place in the front of the alter, where all the kids would gather around the person delivering the short message.  Sometimes it was the pastor or assistant pastor but sometimes it was someone else from the congregation.  Since we sat in the back in the balcony (an attempt to keep from being too much of a distraction) it took extra time for Thomas to get up front.  Either Jane or I would have to go with him him and then try to keep him contained during the short children\u2019s sermon.  More than once he got away from us and would walk around the sanctuary, much to the amusement of the congregation but mostly to my own horror.  He really never got into the children\u2019s message and pretty much had to be forced to stay in his spot.  And then it was time for him to go to children\u2019s church. \n Children\u2019s church was not as structured as Sunday school.  The kids were often wilder and more unruly and the people who volunteered for this were not always very well prepared.  The chaos and noise didn\u2019t sit well with Thomas, so either Jane or I would have to go with him and stay.  \n The end result was that we (but mostly Jane) were missing a lot of church.  The reason to go there is to participate in a corporate worship experience in order to facilitate a more complete experience of Joy with God.  But often for us, it was anything but joyful.  It was almost hellish.  Jane was seriously whithering on the vine, spiritually.  It was stressful pretty much from beginning to end. \n An associate pastor saw our plight and started a program where other adults or teenagers would go with Thomas to children\u2019s church.  This was called \u201cAngel Buddies.\u201d  They even brought in Thomas\u2019 preschool teacher to help answer questions and help them understand how to deal with kids with autism.  We had about 7 volunteers at the beginning of this program and it did seem to work out pretty well at first.  Jane and I could finally attend church together and it was often the only time we were together without any kids all over us. \n But the Angel Buddy program\u2019s success was short-lived.  The associate pastor left within the year and the next person who took over the schedule was not very diligent.  In fact, Jane or I were included in the rotation every month.  We were told this was so that the other helpers wouldn\u2019t get worn out with it.  But often, the helpers would be out of town or not at church and we would have to do it anyway.  While we were grateful for any assistance we got, we hated to impose on other people.  The list of volunteers who were faithful and diligent to this ministry got smaller and smaller as people moved on to other ministries and as teenagers went to college.  \n I should mention that the few teenagers who volunteered were some of the best and most diligent people in the Angel Buddy program.  I think Thomas and they both benefited a lot from being together.  But it became less and less of a program and was dwindling away. \n In the meantime, people were talking and complaining about Thomas\u2019 behavior.  He seemed to choose church as a testing ground for defiance.  One of the  only times he was ever spanked  was outside in the church parking lot.  And the side effects from that weren\u2019t exactly desirable.  Jane and I were not together during church time, and one or both of us were not among other adults.  It was a source of stress and conflict with each other and within the church community.  \n One would think that the safest place in the world for children with disabilities would be in houses of worship, among people dedicated to God, love, mercy, grace, compassion, faith, and forgiveness.  But this is not true at all.  The worship service itself, with constant demands for compliance and conformity, is hostile for those who are inherently different from everyone else.  Anyone who is unable to conform to the structures of the service is not welcome and asked to leave.  The larger the church, the more true this will be.  \n I may editorialize more on my feelings toward church and those with disabilities later, but I want to talk a bit about how churches attempt to deal with this unique and growing population.  In this particular church spoken about above, they attempted to recruit helpers in order to help Thomas participate in the same activities as his peers.  I think the intent of the program was excellent, and it started out well enough.  But without diligence by a committed coordinator, it becomes just another chore to dread like ushering, parking lot duty, being a greeter or assorted other mundane tasks and ministries in the church.  Yes, we are the boy\u2019s parents and he is our responsibility which we take seriously.  But no one was caring much about our own spiritual growth or struggles.  Staying home is a more Holy, peaceful and rejuvenating experience for many families that have children with disabilities.  Church is often a hostile, hellish experience where families are segregated or ostracized. I don\u2019t think Jesus would approve. \n That\u2019s not to say Thomas got nothing out of it.  He did memorize the Lord\u2019s prayer and the Apostle\u2019s Creed.  He also picked up on it enough to threaten his Sunday school teachers with crucifixion more than once! \n Other churches set up a separate class and program for people with disabilities that is set apart.  On one hand this makes it easier to concentrate human volunteers and resources in one area, but it also segregates people with disabilities into a sort of modern-day leper colony. \n When we visited my father-in-law\u2019s church, Thomas spent a bit of time during the service just wandering around.  I was keen to hold him down or take him out, but Jane tried letting him loose.  Talk about anxiety!  An usher came up and said something to him, so I retrieved Thomas.  The usher said that we could use a back room where we could here the whole service.  I decided to try that. \n Many churches do have a \u201ccry room\u201d where parents can take crying babies or mothers can actually nurse their babies while being able to see the whole service through one-way glass.  This room was actually pretty cool because it had nice comfortable couches and Thomas found some toys to keep him content and occupied.  It was like a little living room or a one of those box suites they have in stadiums.  The usher even brought him a cookie!  I was totally into this until a couple mothers came in and wanted to nurse their babies.  So we spent the balance of the service in the large lobby area, just walking around.  Last summer, at my parents\u2019 small church he was getting disruptive, so Mom took him out to walk around the block. \n Jane and the boys have been going to another church where the structure is a bit different.  The kids spend the entire service in their own big area where the have plays, they dance, sing and basically have a big party.  The staff have been pretty good with him and have worked so that he feels comfortable there.  But he still has his moments.  The setting is very, very loud.  They probably amp up to over 100 decibels at times, which means he spends a considerable amount of time with his fingers in his ears.  The open space, the loud contemporary music and the dancing around are more conducive to Thomas just walking around the room in circles, which he prefers in such settings. \n I remember years ago attending a service at a small country church near my parents that they attend sometimes.  There wasn\u2019t more than 25 people in the place and people dressed fairly casually.  Thomas wasn\u2019t with me, but the was a boy about his age, wandering around the little sanctuary and amongst the people.  No one made a big deal about it, as it was a fairly informal setting.  Plus, the boy was the pastor\u2019s son so that probably carried some weight.  But I never forgot the comfort the boy and other members felt in that place.  There a distinctive  lack  of anxiety or concern there.  Basically, it was a bunch of neighbors getting together, and they weren\u2019t too concerned about impressing one another. \n It occurs to me that larger congregations and groups are going to have a harder time with people with disabilities.  In large groups and institutions, conformity is a big deal.  It\u2019s the only way to have any sort of order in these places.  But smaller groups may allow for more inclusiveness and flexibility.  That\u2019s just my general impression. \n This is not an exhaustive treatment of the subject, but I\u2019m just throwing this out there for discussion where maybe others can expand or extend with their own experiences.  I\u2019ll be jumping back into school related stuff soon, as us teachers report back this Friday! \n D. \n \n\t\t Tags:  Autism/Asperger's ,  church ,  discipline ,  Parents and parenting ", "outgoing_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=4885322&page=1"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/church-and-kids-with-autism/", "title": "Church and kids with\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "2008/08/01", "body": "I\u2019m often asked about why our district starts on a Friday instead of just waiting until Monday.   The reason is, is that opening day glitches always occur and instead of having only a 16 hour turn-around time, we have more than 48 hours to work things out.   And there are always things to work out.   For instance I know that several bus drivers had not driven their routes before having to pick up children this morning.   I know of at least one who got had no idea how to get to the child\u2019s house before calling late last night to let them know the bus number and time of pick-up.   Other issues include not enough books, not enough desks, issues with the cafeteria and basically all of the logistics. As a teacher, the first day of school can be a very long and painful process, and we are very thankful to have a weekend the next day!   No matter how much planning is done, it is never enough until the kids come.   And there are usually surprises.   In this case, my program was really surprised.   At the end of last year, it looked like we were losing some kids as they were going to be attending their home schools.   However one appealed and the other moved simply to remain in our school zone.   In addition to the one new student I knew we were supposed to get (who didn\u2019t show up) we got a new one who moved into our zone.   So that zone next door had exactly  one  student show up, while we seemed swamped with 6!   And there are more coming.   I didn\u2019t expect to feel this short this fast. In other news, Georgia is once again observing a sales tax holiday this weekend.   It started yesterday and is supposed to be for school clothes and supplies.   And once again, teachers are getting a $100 gift card so that we can buy some needed supplies.   I\u2019m looking for some news on this, but apparently I\u2019m going to be the one breaking it: \n The Georgia Department of Education has received reports from teachers that some merchants are experiencing difficulties processing payments involving Teacher Gift Cards. \n The Department has communicated these issues to Bank of America who has determined that there is an issue with the scan feature of the Teacher Gift Cards. Bank of America has assured the State that the problem will be corrected by tomorrow morning \u2013 Saturday August 2. \n Bank of America recommends that if gift cards are used before tomorrow morning, merchants manually enter gift card information instead of using the scan feature. \n The Georgia Department of Education regrets any inconvenience and greatly appreciates your patience as we work to resolve this issue as expediently as possible \n Regards, \n ____________________________________ \nScott D. Austensen, CFA \nDeputy Superintendent, Finance & Bus. Opns. \nGeorgia Department of Education So there you have it.   Teachers have to wait until tomorrow to use their gift cards because Bank of America    has screwed them up.   Why not just give us all $100 in cash?   No glitches to worry about there!   The reason for the gift cards is so that teachers who often dig into their own pockets for items won\u2019t have to dig as deep.   It\u2019s along the same lines as the federal $250 deductions that teachers can take for buying stuff for our classroom s.   It\u2019s kind of an effort by the governor and the state legislature to buy more votes.   In this case, teacher votes. This year, we\u2019re going to end up buying more than usual because the orders for supplies that we filed  last February  have not even been sent.   So I can either buy my own stuff or ask parents to supply it for me.   I don\u2019t ask too much as the parents of my students are not rich by any stretch.   They have their own needs and expenses, and I have learned to deal with what we have, mostly.   But I think we\u2019re going to need more bean bags for positioning and I\u2019ll need more media storage space to back up computer files.   The one thing I need most, but can\u2019t really buy, is more time.   I\u2019ll just have to do better with the time that I have! See you next week!

{"date": "2008/08/09", "body": "Just completed our first full week of school, and this year is going to be a busy one!  But I have a feeling it\u2019s also going to be a good one despite several niggling things that we always have to go through as we start. Indulge me as I get my whining out of the way: \n A computer that seems to have a dead power supply.  I reported this a couple weeks ago and the tech folks are taking their time on it.  This is probably because I have one working machine plus I resurrected an old 550 Mhz PII and got it online using a  Puppy Linux 4.0  CD so the paras can get online. \n Anemic air conditioning which make our room the hottest in the building.  Try doing all the lifting we have to do in the GA heat without getting cranky \n Gloves; this one is solved, but every year I order gloves to use for changing.  And every year the order mysteriously gets lost as those responsible for delivering/obtaining the order tries to get their stuff together.  I don\u2019t like having to complain to the highest levels for something that seems so trivial. \n My class roster still doesn\u2019t include two of my students which makes my numbers look smaller than they really are.  Seven students still look small until you consider that they are almost all students with PIDs and in wheelchairs. \n Nothing was ordered from what we submitted last year as far as supplies. \n I\u2019m already feeling behind! \n Lesson plans \u2013 I\u2019ll get to that in a minute \n Now for some good points: \n New paras \u2013 I have a couple new folks on board and I think we\u2019re going to really do well together.  I have to get my act together to get them trained up, but that\u2019s on me, not them as they seem to be pretty quick to pick up on what I\u2019ve taught so far. \n Despite the nigglers above, I feel like some folks are listening to me when I complain ( not that I give them much of a choice!).  There are some benefits to being irreplaceable. \n The parents have pretty much all bought-in, so far as far as communicating back and forth.  Having them on board can really make a difference on the year. \n The new principal wants all teachers to submit lesson plans on a weekly basis.  He\u2019s flexible as far as allowing the teachers to collaborate and work together but he\u2019s also working towards having some sort of uniform lesson plan for everyone in the building.  I have no idea of how I\u2019m going to fit into that scheme.  One of the most common questions I get asked by the new PID/SID teachers is \u201cwhat do you do for lesson plans?\u201d  I don\u2019t have a good answer to that.  The state DOE has  some resources  that might be helpful, especially the stepwise worksheets (if the links aren\u2019t broken).  But I\u2019m having difficulty getting my mind wrapped around the standards-based nature of it.  My kids are anything but standards-based!  They are entirely too exceptional for anything to be \u201cstandard!\u201d This is why I fear and loathe the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d mentality of our educational system.  It inherently discriminates against everyone who does not fit.  It takes my wheelchair kids and throws them down the proverbial stairs simply because ramps are not standard.  I have to write standard lesson plans because there is some rule that everything must be standardized.  Welcome to the educational system of the 19th century and the industrial revolution. Plans are a good thing, and I do have educational programs in place.  For sure, I need to do a better job of adding structure to our day so the students and paras function a bit better.  My lesson plans would be better written in a format the lends itself to picture schedules. These ideas are not helping at the moment, as my lesson plans are due at 8:20 Monday morning.  So I I\u2019m starting with the ideas I had  last year  and building on those.  We did do a few of those things, but honestly never got to most of it.  In fact, it broke down within a month.  But this is a new year and hope springs eternal! Yeah,this time last year I was was making it my farewell tour.  So much for that idea!  Here I am again!  Let\u2019s see if I can get it right this time. D. Here\u2019s some quick and dirty plans  that sort of align with the GAA.\u00a0 Not very good, but hopefully I\u2019ll improve that this year.

TOTY = Teacher Of The Year.\u00a0 Our school does this in the fall, which I always thought was a really funny time to do this.\u00a0 I mean, about 1/4 of the faculty is brand new and don\u2019t know anyone let alone who would be teacher of the year.\u00a0 So they do what I did my first year and voted for the one they know best or who their more experienced friends suggest.\u00a0 But since this is an honor bestowed on a teacher based on teaching, it would make more sense to do it at the end of the year when we can look back on what the teacher actually did.\u00a0 but maybe that\u2019s just me. It the preliminary round, teachers nominate one of their colleagues for TOTY.\u00a0 Then the ballots are counted and I think the top 8 or 10 are listed on the next ballot.\u00a0 Then you circle your favorite and then the nomination is down to 4 or 5.\u00a0 Then it narrows to 2 or 3 and finally the winner is chosen.\u00a0 This process takes a few weeks as the teachers always have a few days to fill it out and turn each ballot from each round in.\u00a0 Then a faculty meeting is called and the winner gets flowers, some cake and a reception or something like that.\u00a0 The winner of the school TOTY then competes with all of the other TOTY\u2019s from the other schools in the district to become the County TOTY.\u00a0 This involves filling out a questionnaire and being visited by the school board and superintendent.\u00a0 Plus there\u2019s all sorts of media coverage.\u00a0 It\u2019s great fun\u2026unless you\u2019re in the middle of it.

I don\u2019t mind the national exposure of an internet blog or Teachertube, but the scrutiny of my peers\u2026it was an awesome amount of pressure.\u00a0 This was made even moreso, because I had some really and truly awesome peers.\u00a0 There were too many better folks than me that didn\u2019t make the ballot and I knew it.\u00a0 Fortunately, one of those awesome folks won it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember who won it, but I remember the guy who got 2nd place.\u00a0 He got 2nd place for the next 3 or so years before finally winning it.\u00a0 I even kept the first 2 round ballots and didn\u2019t vote because I was just so proud to have my name there!\u00a0 I may or may not have cast a ballot for myself in my final round, but still made a copy of it that I still have somewhere.\u00a0 I was proud and scared at the same time. My first pick didn\u2019t make the first cut this year, which is unusual.\u00a0 I usually do better at picking someone who at least shows.\u00a0 However, my name did appear on that list again.\u00a0 And exactly like 4 years ago, I have some mixed feelings. It\u2019s a great honor to make the ballot at all, as we have over 120 faculty in this building; the largest in the county.\u00a0 And if any of you fellow teachers read me, I totally get what you\u2019re doing especially if you read my last couple of posts!\u00a0 It\u2019s okay to vote for someone else\u2026REALLY!\u00a0 I did. Seriously, there are some good candidates everywhere in every department.\u00a0 Fact is, I idolize most everyone else who is \u201cout there\u201d teaching 25-35 students at a time.\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if I could do that.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to try someday.\u00a0 And a bunch of these folks are stepping into other roles like club and class sponsorships, activities like the prom and homecoming plus tons of activities in the community and churches in addition to being awesome teachers.\u00a0 They are SuperPeople. I\u2019ve seen many SID/PID teachers become TOTY in their respective schools but they don\u2019t do as well at the county level.\u00a0 As I\u2019ve said before, we are not increasing test scores or improving the graduation rate. I think a lot of it amounts to a sort of respect that comes from a body saying \u201cGeez, I could never do that!\u201d\u00a0 So the faculty gives some recognition and TOTY is a good vehicle for that.\u00a0 Actually, it\u2019s one of the only vehicles faculty have for honoring one of their own.\u00a0 I wish they had a Para of the Year award as well, as I think it would help boost their level of recognition. So I get it.\u00a0 Thanks for the support, and I like it as long as I don\u2019t make anymore of the cuts.\u00a0 Been there, done that and it was sort of fun but it really is stressful!\u00a0 I feel the love, really.\u00a0 Now go vote for someone who really deserves it and can carry the MHS* TOTY torch to a district victory! dd *MHS = Magnolia High School which is the blogname for the school I teach at.

{"date": "2008/08/22", "body": "The list just seems to keep growing, doesn\u2019t it? I have talked about NCLB and its effects upon the severe population ever since the it forced everyone to align with it through the use of the alternate assessments. \u00a0  While I have always had individual lesson plans attached to data sheets, I\u2019m now required to turn a set in every week that includes standards, standard numbers and eventually I will have to follow some sort of centralized mandated format. \u00a0  The all-wise powers higher up the chain are busy deciding what format we all have to follow. \u00a0  Heaven forbid that we actually have anyone be an individual or deviate from enforced conformity! \u00a0  Novelty, creativity and originality are frowned upon in this new paradigm of education. \u00a0 The biggest casualty has been community-based instruction. \u00a0  The high cost of diesel along with NCLB have successfully obliterated this last vestige of relevant instruction for students with severe disabilities. \u00a0  Those with moderate intellectual disabilities are the biggest losers here. \u00a0  When I began teaching, we had many moderate students in my program and we went to actual jobsites where the students did actual meaningful work. \u00a0  Some of those students managed to get actual paying jobs right out of high school as a result of their successful experiences. \u00a0  However, those days are gone. \u00a0  NCLB, at least as our students have interpreted it, mandates teaching the core academic subjects on grade-level with grade-level materials. \u00a0  There is no time for job training or community-based instruction (CBI). \u00a0  When I started 8 years ago, we went out every single day. \u00a0  Now, we have not gone anywhere yet, and school has been in session for 3 weeks. \u00a0  There seems to be no real urgency to begin CBI for these students. \u00a0  They will be required to learn literature, algebra, history, economics, biology, geometry and chemistry just like everyone else. \u00a0  And when they leave this institution, they will be dumped back on to their parents or on to the street with no employable skills. Those that I teach today are on the most severe end of the intellectually impaired spectrum and they have always been shunted off to the side and marginalized. \u00a0  However I have felt an increasing marginalization myself, as the shift toward the standards and academics has taken over. \u00a0  My students are not helping to increase test scores or increase the graduation rate. \u00a0  So as a teacher, my role as a teacher has become increasingly isolated. \u00a0  The self-contained setting has always been a somewhat desolate and lonely condition. \u00a0  But I\u2019m feeling it even moreso this year. \u00a0  It just hit me all-of-the-sudden this week, as I was trying to get my \u201cadvanced\u201d group to identify their own names and pictures of themselves that this academic crap is just a huge joke. \u00a0  At first, I had mixed feelings about being irreplaceable. \u00a0  \u201cHey! \u00a0  I\u2019m important!\u201d \u00a0  But that isn\u2019t the case at all. \u00a0  The reason why I can\u2019t be replaced isn\u2019t because of the stellar job that I\u2019m doing. \u00a0  It is because no one else wants it. \u00a0  And that is singularly depressing enough. I do feel the administration has been as supportive as they can be given the fact I only have 7 students while everyone else serves close to 100. \u00a0  I don\u2019t blame them for keeping me in place for another year even though I requested a move as it is a good strategy for the short-term. \u00a0  \u00a0 They figured that it wouldn\u2019t be too disastrous, as I\u2019m likely to put student interests ahead of my own. \u00a0  I would do the job and do my best, no matter what sort of students I\u2019m serving. \u00a0  They all can learn, but not at the same pace, the same time or even the same content. \u00a0  These kids with severe cognitive impairments; we need to look at reality and admit that they are not going to college. \u00a0  We need to admit that there are plenty of very happy people who have  never  gone to college and quit trying to guilt parents, teachers and the students into conforming to a standard that fails them. \u00a0  \u00a0 My kids will not be reading on the 12 th  grade level no matter how rich of a literacy program I expose them to. \u00a0  No matter how highly qualified their teacher is, they are not going to solve for X. \u00a0  But they might learn how to answer the question \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d or respond to \u201cDo you want more?\u201d I feel fairly confident with what I do. \u00a0  I pretty much know how to deal with most of these students even though I still get nauseous from all the noise. \u00a0  A poopy diaper barely phases me anymore. \u00a0  It is just a significant part of what I do and separates me from the folks who can\u2019t hack it. \u00a0  But I am ready for a little different life to choose me and since it won\u2019t be at this school, I need to be looking at other schools. Anyone else ever had to effect a transfer like this, where your present supervisor/employer is reluctant to let you go? D.

{"date": "2007/03/23", "body": "I was surfing around and came across  this older post  from  California Teacher Guy  (who is at this moment drinking a pilsner in some haufbrauhaus to help him get over his jet lag) that got me to thinking. \n [WARNING: I\u2019m not going to water this down so it might be \u2018R\u2019 rated for the potty talk.] \n In that post, a fellow teacher refers to an EBD student as a \u201cPiece of Shit.\u201d   Later on,  he posts some advice given  to him by others as to what he should do, including being a good example, watching a video tape and taking hidden camera footage. \n I have only occasionally come across this attitude since working kids with severe intellectual disabilities.   However, I know that it is out there.   I also know the causes of it.   I once had a similar attitude, myself. \n Twenty years ago, I was teaching a regular education elective class at the high school level.   Vocational agriculture to be exact.   20 years ago, colleges began changing their admission standards and tightening them up.   They began requiring 2 years of a foreign language along with more core subjects which meant precious little space for electives.   And this meant that I got very few college-bound kids in my agriculture classes.   Who did I get?   Us agriculture teachers had many names for them.   Rum Dums.   Sweat hogs.   Dummies.   Speds.   We resented their presence mightily.   I remember getting after a guidance counselor for steering students away who might actually want a career in agribusiness from taking my classes.   I ended up sort of fleeing the situation by getting certified in general science, biology and chemistry.   But I ended up at a school that boasted being able to teach kids with learning disabilities.   And I kind of liked it.   I was on the road to reform.   I still had issues with student behaviors but I was learning to deal more proactively.   \n There are a couple of reasons why teachers dislike special education students as much as they do.   The biggest one is ignorance.   As an ag teacher, I had no idea what to do with these people and hadn\u2019t received any instruction in dealing with kids with special needs.     And yet, over half my class was made up of kids with some sort of disability and many of the others simply weren\u2019t identified.   The other reason is lack of support.   When I had all of these students with special needs, I had no help or guidance as to what to do.   I was on my own and since I was a brand new teacher, I was going to struggle no matter what.   I met with a couple of special education teachers but some seemed more interested in piling more work on ME in having me fill out assorted checklists for evaluations.   The end result was that I had very few fond feelings towards a group of students who needed a lot more support than I was capable of offering at that time.   I don\u2019t remember  saying  a student was a piece of shit, but I think I probably  thought  it more than once.   My fellow agriculture teachers had every bit as much hostility as I did as this was not the sort of situation we had studied about in our college classes. \n One could probably say that it was poetic justice and God kicked my ass for having such evil thoughts by placing me in the most special of the special education settings and by virtue of having a child of my own with exceptionalities.   I had no choice but to become more educated.   Being more educated about the people around us is the cure for a whole host of ignorant prejudices, and as educators that\u2019s sort of what we\u2019re called to do.   We are fighting the war on ignorance. \n People say all sorts of things without thinking.   Anyone who would say something like that around me would be in for some sort of education with a fair amount of personal counseling to boot.   That teacher was voicing her frustration, and it is wrong of her to take it out on the kids, but confronting her and being hostile isn\u2019t going to improve her outlook at all.   Getting her reprimanded will help neither her nor the students unless maybe she\u2019s fired.   But then you\u2019re back where you started with the next ignoramus who decides to try to teach these challenging learners.   So those who know have to educate those who don\u2019t.   It\u2019s just part of my job, and I try to take a supportive role especially for the beleaguered vocational teachers who get the bulk of the exceptional students.   So part of the answer is protect our students but also do so without being too harsh on teachers who say silly stupid things.   Not that I haven\u2019t jumped on a few, but the sad part of that is that those teachers I\u2019ve gone after were special educators!

{"date": "2007/03/30", "body": "It was brought to my attention that perhaps there might be some discrepancies between what people \u201cinside the beltway\u201d might be thinking versus those \u201coutside the beltway\u201d as far as NCLB and IDEA, specifically in regards to testing students with disabilities. \u00a0  So I\u2019ll address issues specifically in regards to testing those students with the most severe cognitive disabilities. \u00a0 First off, let me define people inside the beltway. \u00a0  Over there on the right, in my blogroll, you will see a category for  Ed Policy Discussion . \u00a0  If you are in that category, I\u2019m thinking of you as an \u201cinside the beltway\u201d entity. \u00a0  Everyone else is probably outside of it.  \u00a0 I don\u2019t blogroll a lot of beltway/policy bloggers because I\u2019m not quite as interested in what they write compared to real people with real stories. Real parents, real teachers and real people who actually have exceptionalities are infinitely more interesting to me. \u00a0  \nBut a couple of these policy entities caught my attention early on, namely  Eduwonk  and  NCLBlo g , almost as much for their repartee when they go back and forth as anything else they write and publish. \u00a0 Eduwonk wrote a  recent response  to a  post published by John on  NCLB log that sort of caught my attention and I\u2019m only just now getting a chance to respond. Eduwonk observes: \u00a0 \u00a0  The parent is impassioned by not completely right about the  mechanics of the law  in terms of students with more severe disabilities, but no matter for AFTie John, it\u2019ll do! In fact, it reads like a more general criticism of testing, let\u2019s hope the AFTies aren\u2019t bending to the pressure to come into the fold with all the other groups! \u00a0 One problem I have with beltway entities is that they are in love with testing. \u00a0  They have a love affair with standardized tests because they are relatively cheap and easy compared to almost any other type of assessment. \u00a0  This has become the tool of choice when determining how well a child is learning or how highly qualified a teacher is. \u00a0  I\u2019m actually totally fine if you want me to take any sort of standardized test. \u00a0  When normed properly, I usually score towards the top. \u00a0  On the last Praxis I took, I was in the 100 th  percentile. \u00a0  \u00a0 Eduwonk then goes into some discussion about the various types of students with disabilities and for arguments sake, I\u2019ll use his categories for special needs students: \u00a0 To oversimplify only slightly, there are really three primary groups* of special needs kids: Those that should be included in the mainstream system (eg vision or hearing impaired kids need access not a different set of standards and most students in the learning disabilities category should be included also), those who should be but with some modifications, and those that need something substantially different . \u00a0 The NCLB policy is still clumsy with regard to that last group but the answer is, I\u2019d argue, to be found in using data drive local flexibility rather than blanket exemptions as is basically the policy now. But, that last group is a distinct minority, despite the rhetoric the fact is that the \u201caverage\u201d special education student does not have Down Syndrome or severe autism, more than half have learning disabilities and many of them just haven\u2019t been taught to read well. \u00a0 This is the problem. \u00a0  I teach the third group. \u00a0  There are maybe a dozen teachers in our county who teach that third group. \u00a0  We are a minority, yes. \u00a0  And at the hands of Eduwonk and the rest of the beltway entities, we repeatedly get tacked on as some sort of asterisk footnote. \u00a0  We get forgotten. \u00a0  When NCLB was written, special needs were barely considered at all and then were finally thrown in as an afterthought. \u00a0  When Highly Qualified teacher provisions were written, no one thought about special ed. teachers.  \u00a0 We had to wait until IDEA 2004 came down and then we only had a few months to become HQ in order to comply with NCLB! \u00a0 Eduwonk has a link to explain the mechanics of the law, which allows for an alternate assessment for students like mine. \u00a0  You  can read it for yourself , but there is one theme that is hammered into that document and NCLB over and over and over. \u00a0  That is the concept of  \u00a0 academic grade level standards. \u00a0  There is absolutely no way to comply with NCLB without it. \u00a0  The centerpiece of NCLB is that every single child,  no exceptions,  will master  grade level content standards  by 20013. \u00a0 So let\u2019s talk about the most abstract of concepts to beltway entities: reality. \u00a0 Larry will be undergoing the alternate assessment next year. \u00a0  He is profoundly intellectually disabled with severe CP. \u00a0  He can not feed himself, speak or do much of anything independently. \u00a0  He does know how to smile when he likes something and cry when he is wet and needs his diaper changed, or to express his displeasure at having to sit in one position for too long. \u00a0  Larry\u2019s last psychological was done over 7 years ago, but his functioning has not improved substantially. \u00a0  His independent functioning according to a recent assessment is at a level of someone 5 months old. \u00a0  His IQ 7 years ago was 3. \u00a0  Now, at the age of 17, I don\u2019t think it would have risen substantially to get out of the single digit range. \u00a0 You should have seen his mother\u2019s eyes bulge when I showed her Larry\u2019s academic goals for next year:   \u00a0 The student identifies, analyzes, and applies knowledge of the structures and elements of American fiction and provides evidence from the text to support understanding; the student: a. Locates and analyzes such elements in fiction as language and style, character development, point of view, irony, and structures (i.e., chronological, in medias res, flashback, frame narrative, epistolary narrative) in   works of American fiction from different time periods. \u00a0 This is taken, word-for-word, from the state curriculum standard and it is from a list of required elements that had to be included in the alternate assessment this past year. \u00a0  Remember, he is going to be in 11 th  grade. \u00a0  He must be assessed according to  grade level academic content standards! \u00a0  It is true that I\u2019ll put together some sort of portfolio showing some sort of proficiency instead of him taking the graduation test. \u00a0  It will be watered down and show him accessing the 11 th  grade curriculum in some way. \u00a0  But tell me: how is this meaningful? \u00a0  In addition to American Literature, I\u2019m going to have to assess Larry\u2019s academic proficiency in American History, Biology or physical science, algebra and geometry. \u00a0  \u00a0 It is this nightmarish absurdity that makes me absolutely disgusted with pretty much anything inside the beltway or under any dome of any capitol. \u00a0  IDEA was put in place to deal with how school systems discriminated against students with disabilities, but NCLB is counteracting that by pushing for conformity. \u00a0  There is no possible way for the beltway to be able to micromanage what is taking place out in real classrooms. \u00a0  As Eduwonk says in an asterisked footnote: \u00a0 I\u2019d argue, paradoxically, that IDEA\u2019s vital emphasis on individualization has actually had the effect of working against customization for kids. You want customization at the school level but it\u2019s less important and more unwieldy the further up the policy chain you go. But, that\u2019s not an argument, as some Republicans are now making, to leave all decisions to the local school districts, it\u2019s just an argument to get the balance and incentives right. \u00a0 IDEA\u2019s vital emphasis on individualization is the  only  provision that has made IDEA work at all. \u00a0  Every single time they try to tweak it with incentives, it becomes mired in more red tape.\u00a0 Eduwonk seems to think individualization could better be dicided in Washington D.C. \u00a0  To diminish the individualization aspect of the law is to in fact repeal it and to increase the power of government at the expense of the students and their parents. \u00a0  \u00a0 Lawmakers actually listened to parents on that one and I hope they continue to do so, rather than various beltway entities. \u00a0  I would sooner trust my son\u2019s mother, me, and his teachers and therapists to make the most informed decisions as to what he is capable of and at what pace he should be learning. \u00a0  NCLB makes no provision for that, thus the empowerment of IDEA has been diminished. \u00a0  I read Madeleine Will\u2019s testimony and actually do agree with some things she said. \u00a0  I also agree with what Eduwonk says in regards to some of those with milder disabilities not being adequately educated. \u00a0  However in regards to the students I teach, common sense has been totally abandoned by the people in the beltway. \u00a0  \u00a0 Perhaps upon successful completion of his alternate assessment, Larry can get a job designing ballistic missiles for the Pentagon, inside the beltway. \u00a0D. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://eduwonk.com/", "http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/", "http://www.eduwonk.com/2007/03/special-ed-and-nclband-where-are.html", "http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/2007/03/highstakes_testing.html", "http://osepideasthatwork.org/toolkit/tk_lrgAssmnt_ES.asp", "http://osepideasthatwork.org/toolkit/tk_lrgAssmnt_ES.asp"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/03/30/thinking-about-nclb-outside-the-beltway-those-with-severe-disabilities/", "title": "Thinking about NCLB Outside the Beltway: Those with Severe\u00a0disabilities"},
{"date": "2006/04/21", "body": "I went over to the  document linked  by John over at the  AFT NCLBlog , and started reading it.\u00a0 John was being enormously kind in  posting some  of the relatively tame suggestions and the less controversial language and proposals.  It\u2019s useful to put my reading of this document in perspective.\u00a0 While John is a member of the AFT, which is considered the more militant of the two major teacher unions in the country, I\u2019m note a member of any of the unions.\u00a0 The Council for Exceptional Children is not a union, although some of the same functions are performed, such as offering liability insurance and its own political lobbying.\u00a0 In the state of \nGeorgia, I can join the Georgia Association of Educators (GAE), which is the state branch of the NEA.\u00a0 Or I can join PAGE (Professional Association of Georgia Educators), which is actually a larger force in the state.\u00a0 However, neither of these is a very strong union at all, as unions go.\u00a0 There really is no proper collective bargaining, as you folks in other states know it.\u00a0 If I have a problem with an administrator, my union representative is not going to be able to do much for me, aside from maybe giving me a referral to a competent attorney.\u00a0 In the state of \nGeorgia, unions outside of the pilots at Delta, are notoriously anemic.\u00a0 They call it having \u201cthe right to work.\u201d\u00a0  I do agree that much of the way unions do business seems to be outmoded.\u00a0 Back when I worked in a factory, I wasn\u2019t written up by management.\u00a0 I was written up for breaking  union  rules!\u00a0 That\u2019s just what the union gave management (tougher rules) in exchange for the $0.25 raise.\u00a0 Unions seem to become as inflexible or more so than the management on some issues.\u00a0 There are troublesome policies that seem to rule school cultures.\u00a0 For instance, if I were a school principal, I\u2019d like to be able to hire and fire employees based on their performance.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to have the best instructional team I could put together.\u00a0 But unions seem to protect those with the most seniority, which is not always the same as having the best. Mr. Pyle is a case-in-point.\u00a0 The man has at least a decade of seniority over me, which means he is getting paid substantially more than me.\u00a0 He does not attend conferences or classes to extend his knowledge.\u00a0 He is not interested in learning how to be a better teacher.\u00a0 He is interested in getting by long enough to retire.\u00a0 He has said that he wants to stay in the classroom with me, so that I can continue to carry his load in addition to mine.\u00a0 My paras are sharper than he is, when it comes to student instruction and behavior management.\u00a0 He\u2019s interviewed at two middle schools and neither of them has called him back.\u00a0 And I\u2019m thinking that our own administration is reluctant to give him a class of his own.\u00a0 Which means I\u2019ll be stuck with him. I started writing this with an intention of panning the Hess and West Article as not having much of an effect on student learning.\u00a0 But when I look at my own classroom and the reluctance of an administration to do much about a person who at least shows up everyday, on time, I\u2019m thinking\u2026\u00a0 The fact is, Mr. Pyle\u2019s students are  not  getting the same education as the ones on my caseload.\u00a0 Mr. Pyle and his paras feed their students during breakfast and lunch.\u00a0 Me and my paras teach our students to feed themselves.\u00a0 Mr. Pyle and his paras change the diapers of their students.\u00a0 We do too, but we are also trying to trip train them to use the toilet.\u00a0 We change the position of our wheelchair-bound students, standing them and stretching them and making them work their muscles.\u00a0 Mr. Pyle might take them out of a chair and lay them on the floor\u2026and leave them there for a couple of hours.\u00a0 My team works on communication and I\u2019ve designed intensive programs for the paras to carry out with individual students.\u00a0 Mr. Pyle rarely does any communication work with his students. Here\u2019s the problem with anything coming from a government think tank, foundation, institute or whatever: there is no state test in existence that measures any of these things.\u00a0 My students are not taking a state test.\u00a0 Any merit-based pay scheme will not cover what we do or even what our kids are learning.\u00a0 Or what an art teacher does.\u00a0 Or what the vocational agriculture teacher does.\u00a0 \nReading and math are important for 99% of the students in school.\u00a0 But not to my kids and their parents.\u00a0 Being able to eat, use the bathroom independently, communicate or just move around are much bigger issues.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t move, communicate, use the toilet or eat, math and reading are not going to mean much. This does not mean I am against a differing pay structure.\u00a0 Compensation based on scarcity might have some effect, at least for those subjects in higher demand.\u00a0 True, teaching 4 th  grade might be every bit as daunting as teaching physical science.\u00a0 I know lots of jobs that are tougher than teaching physical science where the pay isn\u2019t as good.\u00a0 Like the temp job I had moving furniture.\u00a0 Or the hot summers spent on the farm.\u00a0 Or the summers spent training in the Army Reserve.\u00a0 But there is more of a shortage of science teachers than elementary teachers or furniture movers.\u00a0 Even the military offers differential bonuses based on specialty supply and demand, even though pay and benefit is the same\u00a0within rank.. I think a more robust evaluation system would have a far greater benefit to student learning than any pay scheme.\u00a0 The evaluation would have to be more in-depth and occur more often and it should be done by people who know what they are doing.\u00a0 Administrators can know good instruction in the broad sense, but I think a peer review should also be involved somehow.\u00a0 Test scores could be one indicator, but how about student and parent ratings and reviews?\u00a0 The point being is that there should be several sources of feedback for a teacher and any decision as to merit should be based on more than one single assessment or observation.\u00a0 Just as one test does not sufficiently measure student learning, one observation or test score does not measure a teacher\u2019s ability. \u00a0 The best teachers who have the most powerful impact on their students are the ones who are introspective, reflective and are always looking to improve and fine-tune themselves.\u00a0 This is why I like peer-review as an indicator.\u00a0 We all know those teachers who are really with it.\u00a0 And we also know those that are just putting in the time.\u00a0 I have not seen a merit-based pay scheme that has a lot of merit.\u00a0 I'm open for suggestions, though. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/pepg/PDF/Papers/BetterBargain.pdf", "http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/", "http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/2006/04/will_changing_teacher_compensa.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/04/21/unions-and-student-learning/", "title": "Unions and Student\u00a0Learning"},
{"date": "2006/04/19", "body": "This post is prompted by  Rob , who left a comment where he said he was going to get his Master\u2019s in order to teach special education. Two of my paras are currently working towards the business, albeit at a lower level and slower pace. Princess is actually just trying to get a B.S. knocked out, so she can get her foot in the door. I think she\u2019s taking something along the lines of nursing management or something. She\u2019s still in the core part of it, with math, history, English, psychology and such. Coach is working on the community college level, getting an associates in early childhood before moving on to a more focused program. Patience has an associate\u2019s in something, and I\u2019ve encouraged her to make a move to go back and finish a B.S. before she has to pay for her own daughter\u2019s college. These three have seen enough to see the reality of the job; the good, the bad and the ugly. The fact that Coach and Princess are still keen to go on is a testament to their dedication to the cause. Not that they haven\u2019t had cause for doubt at various times. Sometimes the ugliness gets me scratching my own head. \u201c What was I thinking ?\u201d Special education is actually a fairly broad field. The good news is that if you get burned out of one area, you can move over, or down or between areas. For instance, I got my feet initially wet with learning disabilities and then moved on to EBD, before landing in with the severe and profound. Settings can also vary a LOT. Within EBD alone, I served in a self-contained setting in a regular school, and then served in a psychoed and then for a few years in a psychiatric hospital. Most of these were on the high school level, although I did teacher younger kids in the hospital as young as 5. Don\u2019t ask me how a 5 year-old gets into a psych hospital. You don\u2019t want to know. But one thing is certain: opportunities abound. Job security for a fully certified special education teacher is pretty much a done deal. But it\u2019s important to be mindful of this: there\u2019s a good reason for that job security. According to the article linked in my last post, the attrition rate for special education teachers is hideous, and more than twice the rate of anyone else in education. While math and science teachers can be lured out by better opportunities elsewhere, special educators are more often driven out by the workload, the high liability and just the general stress of dealing with a population that is there precisely because they stress regular education beyond its tolerance. Fully 50% of special educators that begin teaching this fall will leave within 5 years. 50% of those remaining after the first 5 years will leave before they have done 10 years. So you basically have what looks like a 75% turnover every 10 years. But even this does not reflect future need as more kids are being diagnosed with developmental disabilities, including the pervasive ones like autism. One reason I\u2019ve survived the stresses and pressures is because I am always planning for a change. That doesn\u2019t mean I necessarily carry it through, but I\u2019m always looking. I expect change, and am up for dealing with it. Being able to cope with change is such a key part of this business. One reason Mr. Pyle is constantly depressed and frustrated is because he deals with change very poorly. He wants things to stay the same all the time. But it never does. Ever. Things change and change is hard. \nGeorgia\u2019s services are not what I would call outstanding, but they hold their own against most other states. Remember the U.S. congress has never ever met their obligation of covering 40% of the funding for special education. They have never even funded it at 20%. NCLB is going the same way. Get used to it. I might not have gotten this far into special education if I hadn\u2019t become a parent of a person with special needs. That extra fire in my gut seems to be a key to my resilience and determination. Is pure dedication good enough? I don\u2019t know. To put this in perspective, it\u2019s important to note that Princess has three younger adoptive brothers with special needs. Coach has dyslexia and went through school with an IEP. You see a bit of a thread running through here? I\u2019d like to think I could still do what I do as well as I do it without having to be so intimately involved with exceptionalities. But that\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s just part of who I am. I think all teachers who make it past 10 years are there because they are called to it. This seems especially true for special education, where many start out trying to answer the call, but few are actually fully ordained into it. Many of my colleagues in both regular and special education have come up to me and told me they couldn\u2019t do what I do. I used to think that absurd since so much of what I do isn\u2019t especially rigorous. At least not intellectually compared to the folks doing regular ed stuff on the high school level. But I have come \u2018round to seeing that there is something more to it and not everyone can do it and not everyone should do it. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll always be doing it. I admire those folks looking to get into this business of special education. It is not getting any easier and I don\u2019t see the trend reversing any time soon. One has to be a bit of an oddball to get into education nowadays, and this is doubly so for those coming into special education. If you\u2019re a skilled oddball, we really need you in special education! If you\u2019re not very skilled, go learn and acquire the skills you need. Learn to be observant, take and keep data, train and supervise your paras, communicate with parents, use research-based methods and do your own research. Oh, and try to keep ahead of the paperwork. Love the paperwork. Embrace the paperwork. Become one with the paperwork.

However, today I\u2019m just frustrated generally about the increasingly tight restrictions and procedures dealing with NCLB. \n It has been awhile since I have vented my spleen on this particular legislation and the idiots who developed the law and the clowns who continue to push it as if it were the greatest thing in the world.  I will  never  vote for any politician who supports NCLB.  Period.  And for the record that includes every senator running for president.  I\u2019ll sling the crap on GW Bush for assembling the unholy coalition that allowed this travesty to be inflicted upon this country\u2019s youth.  And what it does to kids with severe disabilities\u2026.there is no spot in Hell vile enough, hot enough or painful enough for those perverted sadists who would inflict even greater discrimination, humiliation and degradation upon these kids.  \n Every one of my kids will get a regular education diploma, even though none of them can write or spell their names.  Few of them can pick out a picture of themselves from an array of 3.  Even fewer can pick  out their written name from an array of three.  We are working on identifying the numbers 1 and 2.  We are working on counting to 2.  They have absolutely no concept of what \u201c2\u201d is.  And yet, I am expected to address high school math and literature standards.  They will each have a portfolio of pictures sent showing evidence that they have accessed the standards.  Then, they will get a regular education diploma after they put in 7-8 years in my program.  That means they will get the same diploma as every other student who has actually passed the real graduation tests and did all the work.  Which immediately begs the question: just what exactly does a diploma prove?  \n There will be many students who will not get a diploma, but none of them will have severe disabilities.  They may have studied as hard as they could, but they could not pass the test.  They may be very employable, but they will not get the diploma that my kids get.  The state will say they did not earn it. \n And then there\u2019s case where my students get the exact same diploma as your sons and daughters who took advanced classes and got all A\u2019s.  It\u2019s the same diploma\u2026are the standards  really  the same?  Just how much is a Georgia diploma worth?  I\u2019d say it isn\u2019t worth squat when someone with at IQ of less than 20 can get one.  I\u2019d say that the fact that these kids are expected to do the same as those who have IQ\u2019s of 120 is a gigantic farce!  But NCLB says that anyone not getting a regular education diploma is considered a drop-out.  This is what happens when the baboons in the legislature decide to stick everyone under the same (unfunded) rule.  It makes everyone equally worthless! \n The time that has not been spent trying to teach them their own names, faces and the numbers 1 and 2 and the shape of a circle has been spent cleaning up drool, snot, pee, blood and poop.  Lots of poop today.  Almost as much poop as is produced in the federal and state capitals on a daily basis.  Too bad poop isn\u2019t considered for the alternate assessment.  Too bad poop isn\u2019t one of the standards for graduation as much as it is for being a lawmaker or government bureaucrat.

{"date": "2006/04/21", "body": "I haven't written a whole lot about my life as a parent of a child with ASD, as my work provides a good amount of daily drama.  But this is not to say there is no drama at home to keep life interesting. \u00a0 Thomas is our oldest at 7 years old, diagnosed with PDD-NOS which is on the autistic spectrum.  He is currently in his second year in kindergarten.  He reads on the 3rd grade level and has for quite some time.  However the reason he was kept back relates to his behavior and his social development.  Those who have kids with high functioning ASD know something about which I speak. \u00a0 His behaviors primarily involve being easily distracted and being impulsive.  \"Easily distracted\" meaning an inability to stay on an academic task for more than 5 minutes.  \"Impulsive\" being defined as doing things that he knows better and will often express regret about right after doing it.  But he still does it.  Stuff like running outside and into the street.  Or hugging his little brother or smaller classmates too tight around the neck. \u00a0 Today he had his annual neurology appointment.  And like last year, she wrote a prescription for  Concerta .  Unlike last year, we're filling it. \u00a0 Going the medication route is a hard pill to swallow for this old behaviorist.  I do have a considerable amount of his behaviors under stimulus control, with myself as the discriminating stimulus.  Transferring that to Jane or his teachers has not been so successful.  And it requires an inordinate amount of diligence to deliver consequences for certain behaviors and reinforcers for others.  In fact, with all of the impulsive stuff, he doesn't have much access to reinforcement. \u00a0 So the idea is that the medication takes enough of an edge off the impulsivity that he can get into a more positive cycle of reinforcement or what  Alberto and Troutman  describe as \"trapping.\"  Apparently, they are taking some data at school, so we'll see.  We're going to try it this weekend before school starts to see what it does.  We're planning on doing this blind with the school system, just to see if the data path changes.

{"date": "2006/04/24", "body": "Actually this is a continuation of the fleecing that has been taking place and continues to take place. This time, the target is Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. Full-blown autism is a difficult condition for parents to deal with. Asperger\u2019s can also be difficult for someone who has no prior experience with it. But this is the population that, as adults, come resent a lot of the efforts to \u201ccure\u201d them. FWIW, I believe that as young children, parents are going to do the best they can with the knowledge that they have.

I\u2019m always fascinated by the whole biomedical remedy brand of quackery. And Native Remedies does not disappoint. Actually, I will confess to being one who is searching for the possibility of more natural treatments that might hold out promise apart from the the more traditional meds, such as the Concerta we are now trying with our son. If there is some sort of herb or plant, something I could grow myself, I might give it a try. So if I visit an herbal medicine site, I look to see what is the active ingredient. But Native Remedies gives no such information. Instead of saying they are treating anxiety with St. John\u2019s Wort or lavender, they simply say that they offer something called  PureCalm.   Instead of treating ADHD with Ritalin or Concerta, how about the all-natural  Focus ADHD Formula  combined with the all-natural herbal  BrightSpark  for symptoms of defiance. and who knew that meltdowns could be eliminated so easily with the magical elixer called \u2026.are you ready for this?\u2026.

Are these tinctures first filtered naturally through the kidneys of the packaging people, after they\u2019ve been smoking some of these miracle weeds? This may be one instance where smoking various weeds would be a job requirement!LOL! Okay, I\u2019m being silly. But these things are not FDA approved, they are not regulated by any agency.

{"date": "2006/04/25", "body": "Liz  asked a very good question: Why is Lindamood-Bell  marketed as an intervention for ASD when it\u2019s mainly a reading program?   The answer is pretty obvious.  Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) hype is like a runaway freight train.  Like ADHD in the 90\u2019s, this thing is huge, and everyone is jumping on the bandwagon.  Autism is simply the hottest thing going in health, education and now business.  Once something makes the claim as a treatment for ASD, the marketers can slap a premium price tag on it, and it is going to sell, sell, sell.     I\u2019m only now beginning to understand the vitriol that some in the autism community (meaning those actually diagnosed with ASD) treat the numbers bantered around by parents and other professionals.  The whole epidemic mentality of fear has created a ripe and fertile climate for quackery the likes of which humanity has not seen since the plagues of the dark ages.  I\u2019m getting increasingly weary of it.  Is it easy being a parent of a child with ASD?  No, but parenthood isn\u2019t easy, anyway.     So what should one consider when looking at treatments for ASD?  Make sure to read  this article   first.  Here are more proactive considerations:   \n Consider monetary cost.  Sorry, but cost is a consideration, even when it comes to the care of our children.  Money is NOT unlimited and putting the entire family on the road to financial ruin will not save anyone. \n Consider the cost of time.  Time is arguably in even shorter supply than money at times.  Are siblings and spouses going to be sacrificed on the alter of \u201ccuring\u201d autism?  Are there other interventions that might be more efficient and effective that get sacrificed for the miracle cure? \n Consider the cost of effort.  Time, effort and money are the three considerations that need to be put together in order to weigh benefits against investments.  If you are a caregiver, and are depressed from the lack of sleep, the exhaustion, and fatigue, you are probably visiting other psychopathologies upon your family.  You might treat ASD in some marginal way only to incite some sort of mental or personality disorder upon them. \n What works with ASD children also works with regular children.  The reverse isn\u2019t as often true, simply because NT children learn and get on  in spite  of what parents and caregivers do, sometimes.  However, increased structure, increased diligence and increased supervision that goes on with ASD children can benefit ALL children.  In fact\u2026 \n Consider the impact of any intervention on the family as a whole.   I would be reluctant to put my ASD child through anything that I wouldn\u2019t put my NT child through.  Degrading the quality of life for the entire family in order to try some questionable treatment is not a fair trade-off.  At the same time, there may be activities and interventions that benefit several members of the family.  Instituting routines and consistency makes everyone\u2019s life easier but it takes discipline to establish and stick to them.  Keeping a routine can also help insulate the family from the frantic pace of life your neighbors have adopted and the stress that comes from always running.  Increasing the security of a home to prevent ASD children from eloping increases the general security of the family.   \n Protect your marriage, if you still have one.  Raising a child is difficult, and raising one with special needs even more so.  The statistic that I was able to find cited an 80% divorce rate for parents of children with ASD.  If 4 out of 5 parents are getting divorced, this gives some indication of the stress levels involved.  The chairman of the Autism Society of America, Lee Grossman, is a member of the divorce club.  Marital satisfaction declines after the birth of a child in the most typical of families.  The cascade with children with ASD is even more precipitous.  Even if a partner is marginal in the support they are providing, it is still better than no help at all.  The literature on the effects of divorce upon typical children is fairly conclusive: it is not something that is good.  Having a happy marriage might be the single, most comprehensive intervention parents can offer themselves and all of their children.  If someone offered you a $100,000 dollars to try an intervention that had a possibility of making everyone\u2019s life better, would you do it?  The monetary cost of divorce can easily get up to 6 figures, not to mention the emotional and physical costs involved. \n   I\u2019m merely suggesting that parents lower the stress level and consider a more holistic view when it comes to treatment of ASD.  There needs to be a point at which parents stop looking for causes and cures and move on to accommodation and adaptation.  ASD, in and of itself, is not life threatening.  It is not a death sentence.  Is it a real disease or ailment?  Is it something we need to \u201ccure?\u201d  Are individuals with ASD freaks of nature that must be fixed?   I believe we are obligated to do the best we can with the time that we have.  The temptation for parents of children with ASD is to allow ASD to consume every resource, every bit of time and every bit of energy that we possess.  I believe that is a serious mistake that will lead anywhere but to a happier, saner place.   dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/04/25/80/", "title": "Considerations in Choosing Treatments for\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "2007/02/08", "body": "\u00a0 \u00a0 The  Georgia Professional Standards Commission (GAPSC)  is sponsoring a survey for teachers in the state of Georgia.    It takes a few minutes to fill out and covers many aspects of working and teaching within a school district in the state of Georgia.    Basically, they seemed to be interested in what sort of factors influence a teacher as far as staying within the field of teaching.    They covered items such as salary, supplements, working conditions, training, opportunities for advancement, extra duties, planning time and many more factors that may or may not make teaching an attractive profession. \u00a0 The director of the GAPSC is enjoining all educators in the state to fill out this survey and to encourage others in the state to do so.    I\u2018m going to assume that all teachers in Georgia will be given the proper URL that is supposed to keep participants secure and anonymous.    When you get it, go ahead and fill it out.    \u00a0 My biggest complaint about teaching and the reason for the exodus from the teaching profession is the fact that we have gone from an orientation of student learning and achievement to one of school/teacher compliance and accountability.    I totally get why compliance to the laws and accountability are important, but the orientation of our country towards those things as a national movement disenfranchises the students themselves.    Student learning and student achievement places the burden of the outcome upon those who have the most power to make it happen; the student.    Modern reformists like to call this \u201cblaming the victim\u201d but how is labeling students \u201cvictims\u201d empowering?    It\u2019s so baffling to hear conservatives using this sort of language.    No wonder they are so off-message from the optimistic outlook offered up by their fellows from 10 and 20 years ago. \u00a0 More to the point, the major thrust of my day-to-day teaching is increasingly devoted towards satisfying the requirements of the state bureaucracy rather than those of the individual students.    Meeting the needs of any individual student is subordinated in favor of meeting the needs of some subgroup; namely the cause of meeting AYP.     Yes, you can bet that my objections to the extra paperwork generated by Georgia\u2019s alternate assessment figured prominently in the responses I gave in this survey.    But I also mentioned the lack of training and the lack of opportunities for discussions amongst fellow teachers as major shortcomings. \u00a0 As far as benefits and pay, I deemed these okay or adequate.    I would like to see more money going towards some supplies and updating some of the aging technology, which amounts to quite a lot for my classroom.    \u00a0 It will be interesting if we will ever see the results of this survey.    At the very end, they tell you to write any last and final words you might want to include, in case it wasn\u2019t covered in the survey.    I basically said that I doubted anyone would ever read what it is that I took the time to write.    When it came to NCLB, IDEA 2004, the alternate assessment or any of these other reform movements, no one bothered to ask the teachers what they thought, and if they did, they didn\u2019t listen.    I think that is the most depressing thing about the entire reform movement culture.    No one seems to care much about those who might actually have to do the work, take the tests, give the tests, abide by the rules, follow all the guidelines and otherwise toe the line.    Sorry if I sound cynical but I can\u2019t help but be suspicious of anything coming from people who work in a building with Greek columns and/or a domed rotunda. \u00a0 Okay, I\u2019m curious: are there any things that have made any of you consider leaving the profession?  What keeps you in? \u00a0 Alright, what the heck\u2026. here\u2019s a link  to the survey for those who didn\u2019t get it and should have. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.gapsc.com/", "https://survey.gapsc.com "], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/02/08/gapsc-survey/", "title": "GAPSC Survey"},
{"date": "2006/04/30", "body": "I'm not sure if I've answered this or not.\u00a0 I do know I've talked about why I'm teaching and such.\u00a0 But the blogging bit is different.\u00a0 And somewhat similar. \u00a0 Last year, I came across a few education blogs and became somewhat interested in what other teachers were talking about.\u00a0 Only somewhat, because not many were talking about things that explicitly interested me.\u00a0 That's the cool thing about blogging.\u00a0 If you don't like what's out there, you can start your own.\u00a0 I like parts of what is out there.\u00a0 There are a lot of education blogs that function as a variation of the old Paul Harvey's News and Comment show.  The Education Wonks  and  Eduwonk  come to mind as two blogs that move briskly from topic-to-topic in fairly rapid fashion, providing access to both news and editorial thoughts on education topics and policies.\u00a0 Many of us teacher blogs try to emulate their success to varying degrees.\u00a0 I've been known to rip into a news story on occasion, and editorialize.\u00a0  \u00a0 Then there are those blogs who go into more limited areas, plunging deeper into editorial and policy content with a more narrow focus.\u00a0  NCLBlog ,  Sp. Ed Law  and  Teach Effectively  come to mind as blogs with more focus and depth into specific areas.\u00a0  \u00a0 The above are a wealth of information that teachers can draw upon.\u00a0 The question is: what do I do with that information?\u00a0 Most of the time, the authors hit relevant information and insightful commentary and readers are left to be dazzled and amazed by the intelligence of the writer.\u00a0 But, and this is kind of hard to say to people I like reading, but teachers remain mostly untouched.\u00a0 The same is true of parents and other folks interested in teaching and the learning of students.\u00a0 And there are so many doing it, it gets a bit dry after awhile. \u00a0 There are also some teachers who have some good storylines, and they blog about day-to-day drama, and the daily grind of teaching.\u00a0  Mad Tedious ,  Reflective Teacher  and  Ms. Ris  are some good ones.\u00a0 Good writing and good stories that are amazing and inspiring.\u00a0 Unlike the news and comment blogs, we get to know the writers and learn to care about them and their students.\u00a0 They may venture into the politics of education but they bring it home.\u00a0 These are the more entertaining to read. \u00a0 On all of these blogs, there is some education of the reader taking place.\u00a0 Being educators, what else would you expect?\u00a0 And so it is, with me.\u00a0 I'm enjoying putting together an edublog and the challenge that goes along with balancing content with entertainment.\u00a0 Unlike a personal journal, an edublog is explicitly written for others to read.\u00a0 While it can be cathartic for a writer to let loose with thoughts, I think we are all hoping to help larger segments of the population.\u00a0 The focus is on the audience as much as the author.\u00a0 It isn't written just for myself, although I do often get something simply from writing things out. \u00a0 \u00a0 My major focus is special education and everything that goes with it.\u00a0 I'm aiming for other teachers to give information about special education.\u00a0 I'm aiming towards parents as a parent, trying to offer up useful material.\u00a0 Against the educational focus there is the storyline of the day-to-day drama of my own classroom and a secondary storyline of being a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.\u00a0 The second still needs more fleshing out which I can do over the summer. \u00a0 It's taken a few months to shake all of this out and to see how it all fits together.\u00a0 There's been complexities to deal with the ambitious nature of this blog, but it has become a definite labor of love.\u00a0 If it weren't enjoyable, I wouldn't do it.\u00a0 But I do see people searching for answers and ending up here.\u00a0 I hopeful that readers will find some use in reading my various ramblings. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://educationwonk.blogspot.com/", "http://eduwonk.com/", "http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/", "http://specialedlaw.blogs.com/", "http://johnl.edschool.virginia.edu/blogs/TeachEffectively/", "http://madtedious.blogspot.com/", "http://thereflectiveteacher.wordpress.com/", "http://mentormatters.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/04/30/why-blog/", "title": "Why Blog?"},
{"date": "2007/02/25", "body": "Sorry to leave you all hanging like that, if there was anyone who felt that way. \u00a0  I wasn\u2019t even intending to post today except that I was catching up with  Reflective Teacher \u00a0  who graced me with the title of \u201c The hardest working guy in the business \u201d or something like that. \u00a0  Funnily enough, this hardest working guy was on vacation! \u00a0 One of the benefits of starting school in July is getting a week-long winter break in February and I\u2019ve used it catch up tree pruning, gardening and some family time. \u00a0\u00a0  And blog reading, as I\u2019m so woefully behind. \u00a0  I really really needed the break but it is not without cost. \u00a0  We have one week until the GAA is due. \u00a0  Yeah, that thing. \u00a0  I\u2019ll just be glad to have it finished. \u00a0 Every year, almost without exception, I always wonder if I will be back next year. \u00a0  I never take my position for granted and am always looking around for whatever. \u00a0  Last year it was the behaviorist position. \u00a0  I\u2019m actually glad that one didn\u2019t work out as the person who got it is that good and it is that big of a job. \u00a0 This year I\u2019m having thoughts about a different sort of move. \u00a0  I like what I do, at least as far as the kids. \u00a0  But the extra work of the alternate assessment has totally sucked all the time away from what I would and should normally be doing with them. \u00a0  Between that and LEAing IEP meetings I rarely get to see them at all! \u00a0  \u00a0 It was while LEAing IEP meetings that I realized there is an opportunity out there that I just might be able to take advantage of, if I so desired. \u00a0  The students who were having IEPs last week were higher functioning and were in almost all regular education classes. \u00a0  Some of these students were in serious need of extra help and were not getting it. \u00a0  Many of them were in a resource class where the teacher just left two weeks ago and all that\u2019s there is the para. \u00a0  There are collaborative classes, especially for history, computers and some English. \u00a0  But there are virtually no special education collaborative teachers available for math or science. \u00a0 Again, this is a bit of fall-out from NCLB. \u00a0  According to NCLB, students are to be taught be teachers who are Highly Qualified (HQ). \u00a0  If a student is in a regular education class, they will have a regular education teacher who is HQ. \u00a0  No problems, right? \u00a0  However, at least the way the HQ provision is being applied at  our  high school the collaborative Sp. Ed. teachers also have to be HQ in the subject they are collaborating. \u00a0  IOW, the collab history teacher needs to be HQ in special education  and  history. \u00a0  History is no problem at all, since many special educators are old social studies majors. \u00a0  However, how many old math or science majors are out there who also have degrees in special education? \u00a0  I do know of one science teacher who did special education but he is now doing science full-time. \u00a0  \u00a0 That is the way this wind is going to blow, folks. \u00a0  There is a lot of talk about requiring teachers to get dual certification. \u00a0  The problem is that anyone with the certificate in math or science will teach those subjects instead of staying in special education. \u00a0  This is one reason we have such a shortage of HQ special educators is because the pipeline flows in such a way as they leave to teach something else as soon as they can. \u00a0  And this field is not getting any easier. \u00a0 So what does this have to do with me and those IEPs? \u00a0  So many students need to be in collaborative classes in biology and science and the school doesn\u2019t offer it because they don\u2019t have a teacher HQ in both science and sp. ed. \u00a0  Sometimes they\u2019ll staff a para in there, but that\u2019s really not a substantial help especially since the newest teachers are often the ones who are saddled with all the special ed. kids. \u00a0 And do we need to talk about NCLB and AYP? \u00a0  There is a dire need here. \u00a0 It just so happens I might be able to get HQ in science fairly quickly. \u00a0  At least biology plus I\u2019m also HQ in Vo-Ag. \u00a0  And those folks get creamed with gobs of special ed. kids! \u00a0 I\u2019m just thinking about it and looking into it. \u00a0  There are a lot of factors to look at. \u00a0  I\u2019m looking at the fact I\u2019m getting older and less able to lift these kids who need tons of lifting and who are weighing tons. \u00a0  I\u2019m looking at the wearing affects of being the undertaker year after year. \u00a0  \u00a0 One benefit of special education is the ability to try some different things which I think is important to avoid getting stale or just burned out. \u00a0  I would rather fade out than burn out any day and if things stay on the present trajectory there will be more sp. ed. teachers being carried out on stretchers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I\u2019m just trying to stay ahead of the game for the next 20 years. \u00a0 D. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thereflectiveteacher.wordpress.com/", "http://thereflectiveteacher.wordpress.com/2007/02/20/you-make-me-think/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/02/25/trying-to-keep-ahead-while-being-behind/", "title": "Trying to Keep Ahead (while being\u00a0behind)"},

This memo should be given to parents.\u00a0 It contains important information for families to think about and to begin planning for when their son or daughter becomes an adult. \u00a0 S ignificant and rather magnificent changes are coming that will have great impact on people with developmental disabilities.\u00a0 The State Office of Developmental Disabilities is writing new Medicaid Waivers that will give each person an individual budget of financial resources based on his or her exact needs.\u00a0 These resources must only be used to purchase services or supports of significant benefit.\u00a0 But let me back up a bit, introduce myself, and the reason I am writing this letter to you.\u00a0 I would like to explain what a Medicaid Waiver is and why it is important to you. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am Steve Hall and I am the Georgia State Director of the Office of Developmental Disabilities.\u00a0 I lead a team of folks that are dedicated to the health, safety, well-being, and the realization of a meaningful life for everyone in Georgia that has developmental disabilities. \u00a0Over the past several months we spoke at dozens of public forums and conferences statewide about the coming new Medicaid Waivers for Developmental Disabilities.\u00a0 At those meetings, time and time again, families of children who currently attend public school in Georgia would come to me and say, \u201cSteve, this is so important.\u00a0 Few families are even aware of what you are talking about.\u201d\u00a0 Sometimes special education teachers said the same thing.\u00a0 Medicaid Waivers are how States \u201cwaive\u201d or change the federal Medicaid rules in a manner to better serve their citizens with developmental disabilities.\u00a0 Before there were Medicaid Waivers, most of these federal Medicaid funds were used by each state to run their government institutions.\u00a0 A more proper name for the Medicaid Waivers is Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Waivers.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What happens to your children, teenagers, and young adults during their public school years is very important to me and the citizens of Georgia.\u00a0 What happens in school makes all the difference in the world.\u00a0 I have been a school teacher, school administrator, have taught teachers going back to the university for their masters degrees, and have worked as an executive leader for almost two decades.\u00a0 Based on these experiences, I must share three best practices with you that I learned along the way: 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Good Special Education greatly reduces the need for supports and the taxpayer cost of supports throughout the person\u2019s life.\u00a0 Good Special Education supports the student in the regular classroom.\u00a0 Good Special Education provides community-based instruction outside of the classroom to better prepare the child for an adult life in the community. \u00a0 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The best special education services occur in the regular kindergarten classroom, elementary classroom, middle school classroom, junior high classroom, and high school classrooms that are located where the other children in your neighborhood are in class.  \u00a0 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  For most children with developmental disabilities, the Individual Education Plan (IEP) should be written to include non-school building instruction in work and other community environments during the school day, beginning by at least age 14.\u00a0  \u00a0 Georgia \u2019s new Home and Community Based Medicaid Waivers are prepared to support children and adults to live, work, and participate in full community life alongside other citizens who do not have developmental disabilities.\u00a0 \u201cPlaces for them,\u201d day centers, sheltered workshops, and taxpayer dollars staying with the government to run institutions are being replaced and closed all around the United States, including Georgia.\u00a0 Instead of facilities, buildings, and other \u201cfor the disabled only\u201d programs, taxpayers are investing in people with developmental disabilities themselves and want professionals to provide the services and supports in the real life of the community with everyone else. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employment is very important.\u00a0 Over 200,000 people with developmental disabilities, who professionals and parents thought could never hold a real job, are employed throughout the United States through a practice known as Supported Employment. In the past, our own fears and lack of knowledge was the greatest barrier to people having a real job and becoming taxpayers.\u00a0 In addition to meaningful productive work, membership in clubs, groups, churches, and associations is just as important.\u00a0 Parents do not live forever.\u00a0 This is why I have written this letter to you.\u00a0 People with disabilities need to be valued members of their community so they are not solely relying upon their parents for resources, safety, companionship, and love. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our children will be successful throughout their adult lives to the extent that we as parents recognize the importance of their living alongside others who are different from themselves\u2014not just people who have similar disabilities, not just people who are paid to be with them, and not just family members who already love them.\u00a0 I want you to remember that your son or daughter did not do anything wrong.\u00a0 People who have never done anything wrong are not put in special places just for them or excluded in any other way from the workplaces, groups, or places where all the rest of us live, work, and enjoy ourselves.\u00a0 Special centers, special classes only for others who have such disabilities, and any program that takes our children away from the other children, do not result in people spending the rest of their lives with the rest of us in the real world.\u00a0 All citizens with disabilities, including those men, women, and children with the most significant disabilities, should develop relationships with other citizens and be a valued member of the real world. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disability World is not the real world.\u00a0 When children begin their educational lives in rooms and other places separate from children of the same age, they start down a path that most often ends as an adult existing outside of where everyone else in society lives, works, and plays.\u00a0 An adult with a developmental disability who is a part of, not apart from, society is the result when children are alongside the other children that they will spend their adult lives with right from the start. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I hope this letter is helpful.\u00a0 I do not expect you to agree with everything that I have said and it is you, as your child\u2019s parent, who will always know what is best.\u00a0 If you agree with what I have said, then many others agree with you, and if you disagree with me, then you\u00a0 have plenty of company also.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this letter is to share my knowledge and experiences that when children with disabilities are educated alongside children who do not have disabilities, and it is done right, then the outcomes as an adult are better.\u00a0 Less support is needed when they become an adult.\u00a0 People live longer.\u00a0 They are happier. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You are welcome to copy, email, and share this with others.\u00a0 I am looking forward to working on behalf of your son or daughter throughout his or her adult life.\u00a0 Please let me know what you think about what I have said, whether you agree or disagree.\u00a0 Your opinion matters to me. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sincerely, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stephen R.

{"date": "2006/12/12", "body": "I\u2019ve been procrastinating on this GAA stuff.   I\u2019d rather do ANYTHING else but that junk.   I mean there are some things have been sort of fun.   We actually finished the science project totally.   We simply grew two types of plants, watered them and left them outside.   When the cold weather came, it killed off one group of plants but not the other.     \n A small tear streamed down his face as he picked up the small jiffy pot.   He pointed to the plant and gave me this plaintive look, sort of grunting and pointing.   He knew his little plant that he had put in the soil and watered and nurtured was now dead.   It would never live to bloom or enjoy the sun and the water again.  He didn\u2019t understand why, all he knew was that his plant was dead. \n Thanks GAA.   Thanks a lot!   You\u2019ve clearly caused grave psychological damage to this innocent student because of your blood thirsty ways! \n Just kidding. \n While he did acknowledge the fact that his beans were no more, and he did look at them he moved on in about 5 seconds.   The boy has a notoriously short attention span.   It\u2019s entirely too short for something like mourning a dead plant.   He does get excited about watering the remaining plants every day, though.   And we did do some measuring which was hilarious (while being excruciatingly annoying) the first day.  He did get better at holding the meter stick steady while I snapped a picture.   The measuring and dying plant phase is actually collection period 2, so technically I\u2019m ahead of the game.   But since I haven\u2019t started filling out any forms, I\u2019m actually behind.   This whole collection period one nonsense is due this week. \n Moving on\u2026 My kids are going to get a bunch of home made FOOD for Christmas, as are my paras.   I also usually put a few lottery tickets in with the cards to the paras.   At least there\u2019s always the  potential  of someone getting a huge bonus.   In years past, Christmas was an ungainly production in our program with so many kids and staff it was nearly unmanageable with so many gifts.   Thank goodness for student loans.   I did get a few nifty little sensory toys from the  Oriental Trading Company .   It\u2019s a great place to buy cheap junk that kids like.   Parents, OTOH\u2026 \n A couple of years ago, I actually had a theme going where I bought various musical instruments and noise makers for the kids.   Kazoos, sliding flutes, maracas, bells and assorted whistles.   Yes, it\u2019s true.   There really is a conspiracy to drive parents crazy!   However, our kids being who they are and the stuff being as cheap as it is, had many of the items broken before they got home.   So at least there\u2019s that.   For the most part, though, I stick to durable things like balls that light up or spinning things. \n I\u2019ve gotten some nice gifts as a teacher, the nicest being from a parent who was a Special Olympic sponsor and gave me a nice Special Olympic shirt.   But I can tell you that most of us teachers have gotten entirely too many coffee mugs.   Especially since I\u2019m not a coffee drinker.   I know, it\u2019s the thought that counts and I appreciate the thought.   But I don\u2019t necessarily expect anything from anyone.   The good people of Magnolia County pay me for doing what I do and I\u2019m okay with that.   \n As a parent of a couple of kids in a combination of special and regular classes and each riding a different special bus with driver and monitor plus assorted therapists\u2026you can see this can quickly become an out-of-control ordeal.   So that is why we go with the Christmas cookies which the boys enjoy helping to decorate.   Food is always a winner for the giving and receiving.   \n Oh, as far as the title of the post, well that was obviously just a ploy for getting you to read.  But I\u2019m sure there might be a teacher out there that wouldn\u2019t mind! \n dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.orientaltrading.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/12/12/i-want-a-mistress-for-christmas/", "title": "I Want a Mistress for\u00a0Christmas"},
{"date": "2006/12/13", "body": "\u00a0 In my \u201c Fleecing\u201d article , I come down hard on pretty much every single treatment as being a potential refuge for quacks and quackery. \u00a0  And anyone caring to read the comments can see that there is a considerable amount of passion on both sides of the issue. \u00a0  I have one comment in moderation that I\u2019m still trying to decide what to do with it because it is so inflammatory. \u00a0  \u00a0 Parents of children all around the world are trying all sorts of different interventions and approaches. \u00a0  I don\u2019t believe there is any one cause of autism so there will not be any one treatment or preventative measure a body can take. \u00a0  However, I am not going to believe ANY claims of miracles and cures. \u00a0  Sorry. If you have one, submit your DVD videos to some respected science professionals and get your story published in something that is peer reviewed. \u00a0  Then we can talk. \u00a0  Until then, you\u2019re an aberration at best, and a liar who is in denial at worst. \u00a0  I simply do not trust such claims. \u00a0  I have been robbed, cheated, hoodwinked and bamboozled out of tens of thousands of dollars because of the crap people peddle in the name of a cure. \u00a0  \u00a0 I don\u2019t even want to hear about it. \u00a0  Really. \u00a0  I know there are tons of parents out there in the mad scramble to find the miracle and I wish them all well. \u00a0  But I\u2019m moving on. \u00a0  \u00a0 Thomas has issues that look a bit more serious than his more typical sibling. \u00a0\u00a0  He is different than most people. \u00a0  He\u2019s exceptional. \u00a0  What Thomas brings to the world is a challenge to others. \u00a0  People who would like everything to be perfect and stress-free and \u201cnormal\u201d and simple and easy are going to have a hard time with Thomas. \u00a0  None of those things apply when dealing with him. \u00a0  Instead of the merry-go-round we got a rooler coaster, and he\u2019s a real screamer! \u00a0  It is never boring. \u00a0  It never stays the same. \u00a0  He requires diligence and patience. \u00a0  He constantly challenges the world to become a better place. \u00a0  People are challenged and stretched when he is around. \u00a0  This is not a bad thing. \u00a0  He makes spotting lazy, intolerant, simple-minded people a lot easier. \u00a0  He brings out the best and the worst at the same time. \u00a0  \u00a0 He\u2019ll be turning 8 in February. \u00a0  For almost 8 years we have been fighting the good fight and he is what he is despite our efforts to turn him into something we think is better. \u00a0  For my part, I\u2019m looking at giving the search for a cure a rest. \u00a0  I understand those who are looking and understand why they look. \u00a0  I don\u2019t mean to rob anyone of their hope. \u00a0 But it is also okay to move on, towards peace, acceptance and even a joy. \u00a0  This is sort of what the Christmas season is supposed to be all about. \u00a0  Hope is truly part of it, but the other aspects are as well. \u00a0  We are not less loving because we happen to love our children the way they are presented to us. \u00a0  I think when they are very young, we should try to do the best we can to help them and move them towards having an easier time in a world that values conformity. \u00a0  But at some point (and I don\u2019t pretend to know where that is) there comes a time when the person has to be themselves and they and the world are going to have to find a way to get along with each other. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019m all for trying various interventions but I would enjoin readers to be wary of any approach that demands that you get married to it or turn it into some sort of religion. \u00a0  I guess that\u2019s what is bothering me most about the various factions within the autism community, is that each is trying to gain more and more converts to whatever their gospel happens to be. \u00a0  And whenever one person speaks against it or fails to subscribe to it, they are treated as some sort of heretic. \u00a0  \u00a0 As a Christian, I believe God\u2019s grace extends to all those with various disabilities and extends outward to those who care for them. \u00a0  But woe to those who attempt to create a new religion surrounding the disability! \u00a0  And so it is that I\u2019m not interested in joining any sort of cure cult or treatment cult or intervention sect. \u00a0  If I try one thing or another and it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll feel just fine moving on without believing that my soul or the soul of my son is in mortal peril. \u00a0  In fact, I live with the assurance that his soul is just fine no matter what kind of label is put upon him. \u00a0  He is not \u201cincomplete\u201d or \u201clost.\u201d \u00a0  He is still becoming and I\u2019ll do my best to help him become all he can be. \u00a0  And I\u2019ll be proud of him whether or not he still has autism. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/12/13/heretic/", "title": "Heretic"},
{"date": "2006/12/14", "body": "Fact is, I just resent the attempt to wreck my holidays.   \n There is no possible way to describe NCLB and its associated ramifications without using the word \u201ccluster.\u201d   For the longest time, I really did buy into the garbage the Whitehouse was producing concerning wanting accountability and having qualified teachers and making opportunities available for all students regardless of background.   It\u2019s all a bunch of    shit, no matter if it comes from Kennedy\u2019s office, the Whitehouse or the outhouse.   \n I thought it might actually be possible to tweak and fix whatever was broken in order to streamline it.   Make it better.   Like my friends at  NCLBlog  like to say, \u201cLet\u2019s just get it right.\u201d \n If NCLB was a horse, it would have to be shot. \n First off, it actively and openly discriminates against students with disabilities at every level.   It minimizes IDEA and makes it a second rate law thus rendering IEPs impotent.   Second, if a student\u2019s IEP team decides that accommodations are necessary for state testing it can render test results as not being valid thus imperiling the school\u2019s AYP status.   In addition, it makes students with disabilities a scapegoat for not making AYP.   When a pay-for-performance formula is applied to teacher pay, with test scores being linked to teacher bonuses, NO ONE wants a special education student mainstreamed in their classroom!   Special education students were a pain-in-the-ass before, but now they are truly a liability. \n But apart from special education, this law is a piece of crap.   There is no possible way that we can turn out a population of students that achieve a 97% proficiency rate on any test that is worth a crap.   This is a guaranteed formula for mediocrity if there ever was one.   It goes against anything resembling genuine achievement in favor of total conformity. \n One of the bones the Whitehouse threw to Republican lawmakers was that the states could set their own standards.   Again, this was a load of horse shit.   If that bore any resemblance to the truth, why in the hell was Georgia sanctioned for its alternate assessment system? \n I just was hit with another thought in my musings. \n There seems to be this huge fear amongst teacher advocacy organizations (unions) and other advocates for public school concerning vouchers for private schools and school choice.   I guess I got there by thinking about how NCLB became an issue only after clamping down on the revenue stream.     The idea is that students going from a public school will take resources away from public education. \n I\u2019m wondering: why would anyone who likes, values and appreciates school choice and private education push for this sort of thing?   As soon as the funding stream opens up to private education, so will the federal regulations.   Everything that makes private schools work will be totally destroyed in the process.  Anyone who supports private education and yet think government vouchers is a good idea is a total dumb ass.  You can not possibly get your cake and eat it too.  Unless it is a shit cake like NCLB.  In which case, you WILL get it and you WILL eat it!   That is the price you will pay for your precious vouchers.  Anyone fleeing the public education system needs to be mindful of that.  Otherwise, you simply make your nice private school into the den of iniquity that you just tried to escape.  If the money follows you, so will the rules and regulations.  There may be a slight lag, but these bad ideas will find you.  And bind you.  THEN where will you run?  \n Someone please explain to me: how does Washington D.C. become the source for educational reform and innovation for the rest of the country?   Georgia routinely ranks in the cellar on various educational measures but they have the virtue of scoring above the D.C. schools as does every other state in the country. \n Federal regulation and control represents a millstone hung around the neck around every educator in the country.   We no longer can afford to care about the needs of our students because we have to be preoccupied with meeting the needs of the state. \n We spent the better part of 45 years defeating the system of Communism.   Now someone has the bright idea that the best way to improve education is to adopt a system that has more in common with a vanquished ideology than the forces that conquered it.   The ESEA was better when it was ignored.   It certainly was a lot less damaging when it was an impotent turd.

{"date": "2007/04/19", "body": "IEPs will probably dominate this blog for awhile because that is what is dominating my life. \u00a0  Sort of like what the GAA was doing a few months ago. \u00a0 It occurred to me that I quite like doing this. \u00a0  No one likes IEP meetings, but in a twisted sort of way I sort of do. \u00a0 Am I going nuts?!?! \u00a0 I like seeing how different teachers do these things. \u00a0  I see a lot of mistakes and try to help correct them, but it\u2019s also nice to see how a teacher deals with their students and the parents for good or ill. \u00a0  I also get a chance to see the students in a unique setting. \u00a0  Some are definitely in the hot seat, as they might be failing or have been goofing off. \u00a0  Sometimes it gets embarrassing when a parent blesses the kid out in front of the rest of the committee. \u00a0  Or when a student and a regular ed. teacher start battling back and forth at each other. \u00a0  I\u2019m trying to think of a time when two teachers went at it\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen that although I\u2019ve probably had some get annoyed with me. \u00a0  In fact I know I did last year when I took the parent\u2019s side at  Bella\u2019s IEP. \u00a0  And they get annoyed when I insist on doing things properly, thus dragging the meeting on longer. \u00a0  And other teachers HATE it when I start asking about data or get up into their objectives. \u00a0 Oh well. \u00a0 But generally I\u2019ve been having a decent time meeting new students and new teachers. \u00a0  Our faculty is looking younger and younger to me! \u00a0  Or maybe it\u2019s just the youngest ones that get the special ed kids. Or I\u2019m just getting very old. \u00a0  In any case, I\u2019m meeting teachers that I would not ever have any interaction with, otherwise. \u00a0  I\u2019m feeling some sympathy for the young teachers who are teaching for the first time and having a rough go with students who are masters of manipulation.  \u00a0\u00a0 They care so much and are sooo deeply involved and committed! \u00a0  But someone also needs to tell these regular education teachers that they need to stop feeling sorry for the kids with disabilities. \u00a0  For others, they need to be mindful of how the disability effects their behavior and performance and make the necessary accommodations. \u00a0  In both cases, these young teachers get a bit emotionally enmeshed and get sucked into conflicts and confrontations and frustration follows. \u00a0  It\u2019s really hard to do anything meaningful or well when a body is frustrated. \u00a0  A certain amount of compassionate aloofness can result in better judgment and better results. \u00a0 Each student is like a new puzzle that needs figuring out. \u00a0  Each committee member has a different vantage point and sometimes when everyone is brought together, you can just feel the synergy. \u00a0  Things start fitting together and a more complete picture becomes visible. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019ll be attending 2-3 meetings per day, every day for the next 4 weeks or so. \u00a0  This isn\u2019t terribly beneficial for my own students but I feel pretty good about where my paras are. \u00a0  They are capable of managing and teaching at this point, and require a minimum of management themselves. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019m able to impact a different population with all of these meetings. \u00a0  For many of these parents, this is their second go \u2018round with me as LEA and they do remember me. \u00a0  In my aging feeble-mindedness, I don\u2019t always recognize them tho. \u00a0  But once we get going, what we did last year usually starts coming back. \u00a0  Being a parent has helped me identify and relate better with most parents. \u00a0  I have only really made it an issue one time.  Last year, an irate parent flew into me and said I had no idea what life was like for her raising a child with a disability. \u00a0  I said I couldn\u2019t say what her position was exactly, but I did know something about raising a child with autism. \u00a0  And that totally changed her outlook and we were able to move on and be productive. \u00a0  She felt like she was being heard, which was sort of new experience for her at an IEP. \u00a0  I\u2019m a bit of a collector of stories, so I do enjoy hearing about the experiences of parents. \u00a0  With my own child working his way up the system, I am particularly attentive to these parents of high schoolers. \u00a0  These are the trail blazers for me, and it makes me a much more attentive and invested audience. \u00a0  They are facing issues that I will eventually have to deal with. \u00a0 Having said all of this, I will be exceedingly glad when IEP season is over with. \u00a0  I\u2019m not even planning on attending my own sons\u2019 IEPs as my presence isn\u2019t always the most helpful of things. \u00a0  It seems like I escalate the tension in the room, and then everyone is nervous and then they get overly meticulous to the point of being ridiculous and the meeting drags on for  hours! \u00a0  Jane is more than capable of handling things and she\u2019s really the one they should be watching out for as far as being satisfied or not. \u00a0  When I go to a meeting to register some complaint or level of dissatisfaction I\u2019m most often speaking on Jane\u2019s behalf who tends to be a bit more shy than me. \u00a0  She\u2019s the one who is more likely to get upset and angry with a sort of Mama Bear intensity. \u00a0  Everyone thinks  I\u2019m  the one who they have to please and perform for, when I\u2019m actually just a front man! \u00a0 Dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/04/19/other-lea-thoughts/", "title": "Other LEA Thoughts"},
{"date": "2006/12/30", "body": "I\u2019ve enjoyed this blog over the past year.   It\u2019s allowed me to think out and consider some new things and actually \u201cmeet\u201d some pretty cool people.    Of course sometimes things I write are a bit raw and edgy and generate no small amount of emotion.   This might be one of those.   This past week has been  Dog Whisperer  week on the  National Geographic channel .   Ceser Milan describes himself as a dog psychologist who treats dogs and trains humans.   He big three essentials for a balanced dog are Discipline, Exercise and Affection.   He goes around, helping people with wild, aggressive dogs or nervous dogs or dogs that otherwise have some sort of behavioral problem.   He then talks to the owner, meets the dog and then attempts to treat the dog while training the owner in his methods.   Milan  is using behavioral techniques but they involve much more dog-cognition than what most dog trainers and behaviorists would use.   He often talks about dominance and submission in the context of pack behavior.   I was especially interested in seeing how  Milan  taught the human owners to control their dogs.   Ceser is good at what he does.   He\u2019s excellent.   But his greatest skill is  transferring  his knowledge and skill to the real owners so that they can do what he does in order to have a more balanced dog.   And that is what he does time after time.   I know I\u2019ll get busted by the \u201cpeople-first\u201d crowd in this for looking at kids and comparing them to dogs.   I say people treat their pets like kids and that\u2019s a big part of the problem when it comes to raising their pets.   However there are many comparisons that are inescapable.   As are the results of using similar techniques in dealing with dogs and kids.   Hear me out.   First off,  Milan  often tells owners that when their dogs are being aggressive or exciting not to talk to them.   Talking adds to the excitement level and makes them more agitated.   Hello?   This is exactly what I\u2019ve tried to express to paras, teachers and parents when their kids are going into meltdown/tantrum mode.   Basically, when a kid is into an emotional meltdown, talking and yelling add to confusion.   This is true even of higher functioning people, as I discovered back in the days when I worked in the psychoed and the hospital.   That principal still works today.   \n   Many of these dogs were adopted from pounds and shelters and have histories of abuse and neglect.   He says that you can not help the dog if you feel sorry for them because you will be constantly projecting weakness instead of leadership.   Owners like to make excuses for their pets and for some, their sympathies often are major contributors to the dog\u2019s bad behaviors.   I see this all the time with students with disabilities and their caregivers.   Yes, the kid has disabilities, but having low expectations makes them  more  disabled!   I watched a mom at an autism support Christmas dinner we had do everything for her son who was 18 and we exchanged a word or two.   She did almost everything but chew the food for him!   The boy is functioning in a moderate severe range even though he\u2019s able to read at about the 6th grade level.   What made this behavior more shocking to me is that she is a para for some of my ex-students at  Northside   High school !   She  knows  better and even complains about other parents and teachers who do the same thing!   AAAAHHHHHH!     She didn\u2019t welcome my criticism.     I often crawl up a caregiver\u2019s butt for being too helpful and hovering thus creating \u201clearned helplessness.\u201d   Which leads to another principle\u2026   Ceser Milan often tells owners that their dog needs lots of stimulations and challenges.   This is especially true for those with high energy and high intelligence.   And so it is with our kids.   So much misbehavior occurs when our kids are bored.   They need and want to be challenged which is  enabling .   And really, that is our primary job as caregivers is to be enablers for our students and children.   Christmas time is filled with all sorts of opportunities for bad behaviors with all of the stimulations, crowds, attractions, sweets and pitfalls for adults as well as children.   Thomas has had a few meltdowns which happen mostly when he is tired or hungry.   And during them meltdowns I\u2019ve actually tried out some Dog Whisperer techniques.   Even the \u201cTssst\u201d while pointing that he uses. And you know what?   It works.   At least until he imiatates this with his younger brother.   People often criticize behaviorists for treating people like animals.   I\u2019m here to tell you that enabling my children to behave more like humans and less like animals is the proper and humane thing to do.   It\u2019s our job as adult to bring up and raise children into adults with instruction and support and correction when necessary.   I don\u2019t want my children or students to behave like animals. But animals and children both need assistance in an environment that is sometimes antagonistic to their needs.   It should not be surprising that the techniques would overlap.     After doing a bit of research, I\u2019m aware of the  controversies  surrounding some of  Milan \u2019s techniques.   I\u2019m not advocating using choke chains on kids or the use of the flooding technique that he uses to treat many of the issues the dogs he works with has.   Neither do I advocate approaching aggressive dogs or even aggressive kids if they are strange to you.   However, being quietly assertive and setting boundaries, providing security through leadership, and being proactive are all just good practices when dealing with all children and those with autism in particular.    Say whatever you will about some of the dog whisperer\u2019s methods, his ethic of never giving up and always learning is a good lesson for us all.

{"date": "2007/04/09", "body": "I should note here, when I speak of student volunteers, much of what I write will apply to  any  sort of volunteer, whether it is a high school or college student volunteer or someone else from the community. \n I\u2019ll preface my discussion by giving a bit of a back story on myself.   One of my first experiences in special education was as volunteer while in college.   I was actually going for an additional year after graduating and working, and was picking up science courses in order to get a science endorsement on my certificate.   I also needed some time to figure out what I really wanted to do with my life.   I knew it would be teaching, but there was that  what  question that we see  Erin  dealing with over on her blog.   I\u2019ll get to a question or two of hers in a bit.   But my experience as a volunteer was somewhat accidental. \n It was the second semester and this was it for me at Iowa State.   I knew this was my last year there ever.   I was ready to move on and was running out of money.   I was taking a sign language class and the instructor passed around a flyer from the local special needs preschool.   A teacher of hearing impaired children wanted a volunteer to come \u2018round, and she was especially keen to have a male volunteer since almost all her students were boys and she wanted some sort of male influence.   So I signed up and I fell in love.   I mean I seriously  loved  going over there and was terribly disappointed when they went on fieldtrips or said they didn\u2019t need me. I liked working with those little kids, and would have considered a career change on the spot if I had any more money to spend.   But it would be almost another 15 years before I came close to that sort of experience again, and I still wonder about going back to the preschool level. \n One of the reasons why I liked volunteering so much is that the teacher and her para gave me a lot of trust and latitude working with the kids.   I was able to play with them and it also helped me use my sign language which was at about the preschool level, handily enough.   But I learned a lot more than sign language.   The boys just loved having a big kid to climb all over and chase them around.   I actually teased some verbal language from a couple of them, almost accidentally.   \n Now, 20 years later, I\u2019m just starting to figure out what to do when I have volunteers of my own.   The second year I was teaching my current positions I had 3 student volunteers.   Fortunately they came during PE time as I didn\u2019t know what to do with them otherewise.   And then there was the one and only time I took one on a fieldtrip to downtown Atlanta and the bus ended up leaving us stranded at the MARTA station.   She didn\u2019t sign up to come the next year.   None of those girls were interested in going into special education.   A couple years later, I did have one who seemed very interested, but I still couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with her. \n This year, I\u2019m just figuring out what I can do.   I have one who just started today, who I\u2019ll call Ellen.   I had her come in and work on stretching Larry for awhile but she actually seemed to prefer working with Ravi.   I had Ravi on the prone wedge and was letting him use a switch to run a tape player playing  The Temptations Greatest Hits .   This involved trying to teach him to use the switch which involved some risky physical prompting, as Ravi  will  bite if you get between him and his hand.   But Ellen managed to dodge his snapping successfully and he showed some progress in independently manipulating the switch during the hour she was in class.   So that\u2019s one good thing.   I have no idea how often she\u2019ll be visiting as her class is right next door.   But basically I plan on running her through the same sort of training I go through with my paras.   I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get to any lifting, but that is an important thing to learn. \n Ellen said she\u2019d like to go into special education but wasn\u2019t sure what grade or what disability area.   She\u2019s in 11 th  grade so this is a good time for her to get some exposure in order to decide what she wants to do.   Better to learn if/that she hates it before investing a lot of time and money.   But I\u2019ll do whatever I can to encourage her.   \n Now back to Erin and a few things she  was wondering about  on her blog: \n She wondered about special education teachers with disabilities and their job outlook.   Do you have a pulse?   You\u2019re outlook looks bright! \n Actually, long term job satisfaction figures the most as to if a person stays or not.   And this seems to correlate with the amount of training a person has.   People with more and higher levels of training last longer in special education as competence goes a long way towards buffering against burnout.   I did have a colleague who was wheelchair bound the past couple of years and he seemed to do very well.   But he was doing mostly consultative-collaborative teaching in the regular education setting.   So he had none of the physical demands that go with teaching students with severe disabilities.   But it is possible to do well with orthopedic disabilities.   I have heard of people with vision and hearing impairments working in the field, but this is quite rare, especially with in the more severe end of the spectrum.   \n Erin wondered if she should just let the aides do all the toileting.   The answer is, if at all possible, NO.   There are several issues that come into play, not the least of which is equity and fairness. I believe in leading from the front, and I can change a diaper better and faster than any of my staff.   And I do it often, without reluctance, because griping and complaining is totally bad for morale.   I don\u2019t complain and I don\u2019t allow them to complain around the kids, either.   Lifting  always  is done in teams of two, so weight is not a huge issue, although it can be with heavier kids.   \n The other issue is actually training the paras.   Now it might seem rather silly to have to train paras to change a diaper especially those that parented their own kids.   But it is definitely different with older kids with sensory issues and disabilities.   I do have to train the paras not to complain about the smell in front of the kids and to do the job well.   And the best way to do that, is by example and talking them through it.   I also train them how to lift, again by example and then talking them through it.   Often just being there and showing them can help build confidence.   And often, confidence is the deciding factor in whether a para is successful or just drawing a paycheck. \n It also shows interest in the kids.   Changing diapers and toileting is decidedly unglamorous, but not much of what I do with this population is very exciting.   However, to a kid who is nonverbal except for moans of discomfort, that extra time seems to mean something to them.   Finally, if you are a parent, who would you rather change your child?   Oh, and there is also the issue of toilet training, but that\u2019s not the issue raised here. \n Something I had to learn the hard way is to NOT run after a kid that bolts away.   I did that when I was younger and screwed my knee up badly enough that it still bothers me to this day.    I don\u2019t run after anyone nowadays and neither should any of you.   I suppose there\u2019s some sort of noble illusion of throwing myself in front of the bus to save a student, but what of all the other students that I leave behind who had sense enough not to run in front of the bus?   I\u2019ll walk gingerly after a kid who thinks it is funny running away, but I refuse to play chase.   A body just learns how to anticipate things like eloping, with some experience.   \n How an administrator would feel about hiring someone with their own physical disabilities is an unknown.   In the job climate of today, I wouldn\u2019t consider mild CP to be a huge problem.   I have worked with paras and teachers who were not at all very mobile because of their age or weight.   Lifting is a big thing, though.   Being healthy is a big thing.   I have a para right now whose back is too fragile to do the type of lifting and positioning we need to do on a daily basis.   I need to make sure that  everyone  can help lift equally well so that none of us are overworked.   I still do the lion\u2019s share because I\u2019m leading from the front. \n Volunteers can be very helpful or they can be an additional burden.   In fact, they almost always represent an additional burden at least in the beginning.   Once they get familiar with the students and with the classroom routine, they can fit in and be very helpful.   I have issues with using volunteers to fill gaps created by staffing shortages, though.   My main goal with these particular student volunteers is to recruit them into the business or at least give them some exposure to decide if they like it.   \n dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://futureofsped.blogspot.com/", "http://futureofsped.blogspot.com/2007/04/accommodating-future.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/student-volunteers/", "title": "Student Volunteers"},
{"date": "2007/04/06", "body": "  The Queen of the day time talk shows had a special on autism and I had a chance to watch portions of it while doing some other things.    Jane was the one who knew about it and was extremely keen to watch it.    I was not so keen, but watched a lot of it anyway, since spring break hasn\u2019t given me a lot to blog about.   I did not see any segments of the Autism Speaks video that she might have shown.    However, I did see some of the discussion of parents talking about the heartbreak at their \u201clost\u201d children and the devastation this disorder has caused for these families.    It seems almost every media presentation on autism has to cover the devastating impact of the disorder and the emotional, financial and physical hardship.    These struggles do make for good press.   But at the very end of the program, the young father tried to articulate how much he has learned and grown from being around and raising his young son.    The other parents all seemed to agree with this, and I thought it was the best part of the whole show, but was the shortest segment.   For sure, autism is mysterious and scary and I wouldn\u2019t exactly wish it on anyone.    It is a difficult challenge that seems to just go on and on.    I\u2019m glad there is an effort to educate the public about it, despite the fact there is such a rich mix of information and disinformation on the subject.    The scariest aspect, I think, is the isolation parents feel from other parents who are raising neurotypical children.    Raising awareness can help lessen that feeling of being alone.    I remember trying to explain autism to our own family members who just didn\u2019t quite get it.    From that standpoint, the exposure is definitely a good thing.   The dissention within the autism world is not a good thing.    Oprah had an expert who I hadn\u2019t heard of before, who said the vaccine connection had been largely refuted.    When she said that, Jane about jumped out of her chair, saying, \u201cNo it hasn\u2019t!\u201d    Even within our own house, we\u2019re not of one mind on this.    After a commercial break, Oprah allowed a parent to speak to the other side saying that she was convinced there was some connection between autism and vaccinations.    I think Oprah handled this very well, which goes to show why she is #1 in her business.    But it is disconcerting to see parents and experts sniping at each other all the time.   Just for the record, Jane is convinced there is a connection to vaccines and I am not.    I\u2019m not outright refuting her beliefs so much as saying that we don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not going to jump on the anti-vaccine bandwagon whole heartedly without more and better evidence.    And anyone trying to convince me one way or another will only hurt their case, so they can just shut up.    Argue amongst yourselves, and let me know who wins.       Thank goodness Oprah didn\u2019t delve too much into all the different treatments and \u201ccures\u201d that I\u2019ve had to endure.    Save that discussion for a more appropriate forum, like  The Jerry Springer Show!   Being the parent of a child with autism is difficult, but it is not hopeless.    Far from it, I\u2019ve seen a lot of advances in the education for parents and their children in the past 8 years.    If I had to point to one group that is doing it right and is somewhat outside of all the controversial treatments, it is the speech language pathologists.    I\u2019ve seen some that weren\u2019t so good but a whole lot more that were sharp, on the ball and performing quasi-miracles.    For parents of ASD children my best advice is to find a good SLP and learn from them to do what they do with your kids.   We\u2019ll probably see a lot more in the media since April is Autism Awareness Month.    For my part I\u2019m suffering from autism fatigue as I have lived and breathed it for the past 6 years or so and there is just so much out there.    For the first time in a couple years, I\u2019m not going to the autism conference.    I looked at the programs and felt like I had pretty much seen it all.    I know that\u2019s not altogether true, and I did see some programs that were added late that I might want to see.    But it is the same weekend as our Special Olympic bowling tournament and I felt like I needed to be there for that.    But I\u2019ll keep my eyes open for new information and will pass on any new thoughts/ideas as they come along.   dick \u00a0 Head over to Kristina\u2019s  site  for an the Oprah show overview. \u00a0 I also have an  updated review  of the latest Oprah material.

{"date": "2007/04/20", "body": "Emails from the principal today: \n I want to tell you all that I truly appreciate your professionalism, today.  I know that the kids are excited and fearful.  I ask that you do what you can maintain a calm environment in your room.  Do the best you can to teach as usual and keep the students as busy as you can given the circumstances.  We currently have 13 deputies on campus.  Let them and/or an administrator know if you hear or know of anything unusual.   And later on:   Teachers, Regardless of what your students may be saying, we have had no incidents whatsoever, today.  Just continue on with business as usual. There were all sorts of rumors starting Tuesday and they progressively became more and more involved and threatening as the week wore on.   By today (Friday) the entire school was gripped by some sort of hysterical fear.   My paras were no exception, so we loaded the kids on the bus and spent the morning off campus.   But lunch time scared them the most.   But I decided that we needed to keep the schedule as we were directed to do.   And the place was crawling with police officers, making their presence known.   But students still streamed out during the day and went home.   Some parents picked up their kids.   \n For my part, I was not terribly scared or worried and I feel like I was in the minority.   I had several teachers come up to me and express their fears and I just told them that I thought there was just a lot of foolishness going on.    We are always a potential target and we always will be.   I\u2019m thinking of that school in Russia, where the terrorists kept the teachers and kids hostage with bombs strapped to them.   Or the Amish school that was attacked.   Your odds of being killed in a car are still greater than being killed in a school.   But I don\u2019t see the use of cars declining or people calling for tougher car laws.   All of my paras are going to get in their cars and go home, despite the risk.   \n What happened in Virginia was tragic and I mourn with those who have lost loved ones.   But I refuse to live in fear.   I\u2019m going to live my life as fully as ever.   There\u2019s enough things to fret and fuss at every day without importing new issues.   While my students have little real knowledge or understanding of what is going on, they certainly do get keyed into the tension of the adults.   And I\u2019m sure if I was all keyed up that would simply add to the anxiety of my paras.   Our principal and other administrators have made it a point to be out and visible in order to instill some confidence.   I\u2019m not sure if the emails helped or not, but keeping things running in such circumstances has to be difficult.

LEA. \u00a0  LEA = Local Education Agent who represents the local educational agency (also sometimes referred to as an LEA). \u00a0  I don\u2019t know how well I represent our district as much as I try to do best by the kids while balancing against local resources. \u00a0  But most of the time my best move is to be quiet while parent and teachers work it out. \u00a0 With the decreasing supply of trained special educators, more demand is placed on those of us who are trained. \u00a0  Functioning as the local agent is one of those increased responsibilities. \u00a0  \u00a0 Teachers introduce me as the LEA and I\u2019m not sure what parents think. \u00a0  Administrators probably do most of the LEA duties around the country, and yet I\u2019m not one of those nor am I their child\u2019s teacher. \u00a0  It\u2019s not until we are well into the meeting that my role sometimes shapes up and becomes clearer. \u00a0 My primary goal is to make sure that every parent leaves feeling satisfied. \u00a0  The route to doing that involves different paths for different parents.  \u00a0 One way I do that is by trying to make sure the teacher is at ease. \u00a0  It\u2019s important to be a bit nervous without being a wreck. \u00a0  Being confident is the best way to instill confidence in a parent. \u00a0  If you\u2019re new to special education and IEPs, make sure there are some other competent teachers at the meeting to support you. \u00a0  Having that sort of support can be crucial to being at ease and keeping people at ease. \u00a0  As a parent, I\u2019m every bit as nervous as I am as a teacher which might contribute to tension in the room. \u00a0  A decent LEA should be able to keep tensions low. \u00a0 Another way is through competence. \u00a0  While I have not met most of the students I\u2019m doing meetings for, I do know enough about disabilities and have been around the block enough to know what I\u2019m hearing when a teacher or parent begins to describe difficulties they are having with a student. \u00a0  I can tell when I\u2019m hearing about learned helplessness or problems with self-regulation which are common amongst those with milder disabilities. \u00a0  Sometimes I can spot a problem that hasn\u2019t been addressed before. \u00a0 Another thing I do is push without being pushy. \u00a0  I am definitely an advocate for a lesser restrictive environment if at all possible. \u00a0  Most of the time, parents also seem to want to move their students ahead while a teacher may take a more conservative approach. \u00a0  If I get the feeling the student has a chance of handling more time in regular education, I\u2019ll see about making it so. \u00a0  I\u2019ve noticed that new teachers are more prone to wanting to keep the status quo, because that\u2019s their comfort zone. \u00a0  But with a bit of encouragement the committee can take a chance in favor of the student. \u00a0  \u00a0 One of the most common experiences I hear from frustrated parents is that they feel they are not being heard by the school system. \u00a0  A big part of my job as the system\u2019s representative is to listen and make sure they know I\u2019m hearing. \u00a0  There are certain points where a parent needs and wants to speak, and it is important to give them the opportunity. \u00a0  The present level is a big one, but since it comes at the beginning, parents are not warmed up yet. \u00a0  I can often hit some present level concerns later during the discussion about transition since this takes place later. \u00a0  \u00a0 It\u2019s during the transition discussion that parents and students often hit their stride in the discussion. \u00a0  At the high school level, this is a hugely important discussion that is too often rushed over. \u00a0  I\u2019ll do another post about it in the next couple of weeks, but this does impact goals and service options most heavily. \u00a0  It\u2019s also where every parent\u2019s anxiety lives. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019ve been to meetings where the LEA was an absolute pinhead. \u00a0  They knew nothing about special education and treated parents as idiots. \u00a0  At other times, when tensions were abnormally high, they got stuck in an adversarial posture nearly dooming themselves to a future court appearance. \u00a0  At some point, these administrators would do well to turn down the administrative intimidation and think like human beings. \u00a0  \u00a0 If you\u2019re a parent who is stuck with one of these jokers and paired with a new or incompetent teacher, look to the specialized service provider for some competence and sanity. \u00a0  The SLPs, PTs and OTs have likely been around the block enough times to know the business. \u00a0  And since their stake isn\u2019t as intense as the caseload teacher, school system or parent, they might be more objective. \u00a0  They still have to tow the company line but they usually see dozens and scores of meetings per year. \u00a0  Ms. Cleo has a caseload of 50-60 this year which is not far out of line for PTs and OTs. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 Last week I did a meeting with a teacher who has a history of difficulties and she had a parent who she described as difficult. \u00a0  It turns out the parent was a former special education teacher who knew a thing or two about the business. \u00a0  Her son was doing well enough and had actually made a stellar transition to high school. \u00a0  So listening to parent and student talk, we actually moved the young man from resource to a consultative model. \u00a0  What we ended up with was a meeting where the parent was thrilled and so was the teacher. \u00a0  And that\u2019s really the beauty of cooperation. \u00a0  If the parent is thrilled, everyone else on the committee will be too. \u00a0  If the parent is not happy, neither will anyone else feel good about the meeting. \u00a0  This is why committee members and especially the LEAs need to have some background and knowledge in order to deliver something everyone can feel good about.  \u00a0 D. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/iep-leas/",

{"date": "2007/04/25", "body": "I was not even planning to go to Thomas\u2019s IEP meeting this year. \u00a0  I thought that we had it  out last fall  and all of those issues just sort of disappeared once I required data and he got a new para. \u00a0  Last month, the new para wrote a note how perfect he was and said there was nothing to report so she was wondering why he needed the data sheet. \u00a0  So I said it was okay to not take the data as long as we were kept informed of any problems. \u00a0 So now this teacher is raising issues again and she told Jane that she was going to request that he attend some sort of community-based resource 1x a week in addition to special Olympics. \u00a0  There\u2019s some concern as to him being able to function in a regular PE class as these are large classes and PE tends to be on the loud, wild side anyway. \u00a0  So they want to look at adaptive PE. \u00a0  The thing is, adaptive PE, special Olympics and the community-based program would effectively decrease his hours in regular education by about a third. \u00a0  \u00a0 The regular setting is where he has the majority of his problems. \u00a0  He would go to a special setting and he would probably succeed with flying colors because he is so high functioning. \u00a0  \u00a0 But it is the regular setting where he has to learn. \u00a0 The other major concern is that they are pretty much dragging people off the street to fill special education positions. \u00a0  There is a mass of incompetence and/or inexperience that makes up the special education programs around the county. \u00a0  I think that bothers me more than anything, as qualified regular elementary teachers are easier to come by. \u00a0  \u00a0 ACK! \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019m busily following my own advice on the  whole IEP process , trying to get a  parent input statement  squared away. \u00a0  I still don\u2019t really want to go and it would be nice if these things could be kind of ironed out in advance. \u00a0  I\u2019m glad I wrote that IEP series so now I have a guide to work from! \u00a0 On a related note, we got Percy\u2019s notice on Monday for his IEP on May 1 st . \u00a0  HELLO!?!? \u00a0  What happened to getting notice? \u00a0  Fortunately his biggest issue will be to either continue resource or do a consultative service. \u00a0  He\u2019s really pretty much \u201cnormal\u201d aside from some oddness he got mostly from his brother. \u00a0  He has a best friend his age that acts pretty much like Thomas. \u00a0  I think its because they both ride the special bus. \u00a0  I need to remind Jane that he needs to take the regular bus next year as the special bus schedule has been erratic and crazy this past year. \u00a0  Since regular routes stay the same regardless of who is added to the system, they run pretty reliably. \u00a0  Plus he\u2019s ridden it before and did okay and he actually has a couple of friends in our neighborhood to look out for him.\u00a0 That\u2019s one that Jane can easily handle. \u00a0 I have no IEPs scheduled for the rest of the week. \u00a0  Can you believe it? \u00a0  Next week I have a bunch of middle school IEPs to attend. \u00a0  Those are always interesting. \u00a0 I also have my remaining 3 scheduled in 3 weeks: Jim, Spaz and Taz. \u00a0  I\u2019m having them all the same day. \u00a0  Call me insane or crazy, but it was the only way I could be sure I would have all of my principle members present. \u00a0  At least I am finally seeing the end of all this. \u00a0  \u00a0 So to all of you parents who are going through this: I HATE IT TOO! And to all of you teachers writing these things: I DON\u2019T LIKE IT EITHER! \u00a0 Hey! We\u2019re coming up on only having 4 more weeks of school! \u00a0  WOOHOO! \u00a0 Dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/04/25/iep-issues/", "title": "IEP Issues"},
{"date": "2007/04/27", "body": "Erin  recently posted a  question about placemen t and placement decisions.   Namely: \n What are the IDEA classifications that allow a student to be placed in a resource setting? What is the boundary between a CBI/EBD and just a resource class?   Placement/services is the trickiest question most IEP committees deal with and it is often the most contentious.   The fact that Thomas\u2019 first grade teacher is recommending CBI is a case in point.   Just because  her  child is in CBI doesn\u2019t mean it is appropriate for someone else.   And is adaptive PE a reasonable option? \n In my IEP series , I wrote  an article  that dealt with the service option question, but didn\u2019t go into detail as to exactly how such a decision is made.   We consider the present level of performance, special factors, accommodations and modifications, goals and the transition plan and all of these should point to a possible group of services.   This is why, if you are a parent, you can best shape the placement by contributing to these earlier sections of the IEP.   I\u2019ve seen many parents sit tight lipped through almost the whole meeting, enduring all of the earlier spiel only to open up and let loose when we discuss placement options.   But by then, it is too late.   \n The law is pretty plain in that the least restrictive environment (LRE) is the main aim of placement and service options while delivering appropriate services.   As a parent, teacher or LEA, I find myself being pretty aggressive in this regard.   Many other committee members will take a very cautious and conservative approach with the idea that they don\u2019t want the kid to fail.   However, a more restrictive environment also means less chance of meaningful success.   Of  course  Thomas can succeed in adaptive PE!   He has very few physical limitations!   Is it meaningful for him to succeed in some sort of Special Olympic competition against those who  do  have significant physical limitations?   So I\u2019m more likely to go ahead and test a student and offer the less restrictive as an option if needed.   More conservative committee members want to offer a more restrictive service or setting and offer the less restrictive option contingent on success in the lower setting.   But the bind is that they will later claim the more restrictive setting is working, so why change it? \n The most restrictive setting is a self-contained setting.   In the elementary grades, several disabilities may be in the same classroom together with the same teacher and para almost the entire day.   The class will be smaller and hopefully more structured.   However the abilities of students can vary widely which makes this a very difficult setting in which to teach.   The EBD student may be doing some advanced material while the MID student is doing material that is very basic and way below grade level.   You can guess a major downside of this; the MID student will be learning some new behaviors from his EBD friends that his parents might rather he not.   Also, the EBD student has few positive behavioral models with whom to practice his social skills.   The LD student typically needs both academic and behavioral assistance.   One of the few positive results of No Child Left Behind is that the self-contained setting is limited to those with the most severe disabilities, while the milder disabilities are spending more time in the mainstream environment.   Even those with severe disabilities are getting more regular education time. \n \n Things have to be fairly bad for me to recommend a self-contained setting for a child.   And even then, I\u2019m going to push for some classes in the regular setting.   The intention of the law is to compel school systems to consider as many accommodations as possible before modifying the curriculum.   So a student should have failed in the regular setting repeatedly and even with lots of accommodations before I go to the self-contained route.   And sometimes, even with failure, I\u2019ll try to go a bit further.   As Erin points out  in another post , the collaborative teachers are sometimes a fry or two short of a happy meal and aren\u2019t giving much help.   This is one reason I\u2019m looking at getting into that side of the business. Resource is the service model that seems to be the most common.   It is relatively cheap, easy to implement and does not impact LRE nearly as much as a self-contained placement.   It can also have dubious value as it depends heavily on the skill of the teacher.   This might be the way we go with Thomas, but I\u2019m a bit reluctant to go from full-inclusion to the resource model.   The resource setting serves many functions and purposes.   It is sometimes used as a study hall, so students can get their work done.   It also functions as an enrichment setting, where supplementary instruction is delivered on organization, test taking, studying and social skills.   It\u2019s the latter that they are pushing for Thomas, but I\u2019m thinking just giving Thomas a break from the regular setting might be beneficial for him, his regular teacher and his para.   So much of what I end up hearing is the result of emotional fatigue caused by having a student that is so disruptive and demands so much attention. \n Collaborative classes can be used along with the resource model of service delivery.   In our district, the special education teachers doing collaborative teaching are universally the most inexperienced and least trained of the lot.   How the collaboration and regular teachers are paired up depends on the school.   But consider the fact that it seems like the newest teachers always get the majority of mainstreamed special education students because the experienced ones have seniority.   Pair them with the most inexperienced special education teachers and you can end up with the blind leading the blind.   In theory, both teachers are supposed to be adding something to the environment and make it a better one for all students.   In reality, it\u2019s a bit different.   I spoke with one young biology teacher who said she didn\u2019t really want a collaborative teacher in her room because they didn\u2019t seem to know what they were doing.   And having a para was almost like having an extra student.   So she handled the 10 IEP students in her class of 30 by herself.   It\u2019s teachers like her that I worry about because she\u2019s obviously dedicated but she\u2019s also on a fast track to burnout. \n Collaborative classes can be beneficial if the two teachers can get into a real teaching groove together.   It takes some work and some effort but the payoff can be significant because it can allow some students to succeed in a regular setting where they might fail otherwise.   Plus, in the land of NCLB testing, this addresses those students in the \u201cgolden band\u201d who are just failing.   Science remains the hardest part of the high school graduation test and yet this is where there are the fewest HQ collaborative teachers. \n Despite what I\u2019ve said above, I\u2019m a big fan of the collaborative model with or without resource.   I think there is a lot of potential to give more access to the general curriculum for more students with this model.   But it depends on the individual teachers involved.   It would make more sense to me to pair a novice in one discipline with a veteran of the other just so one can learn from another.   \n The consultative model is basically a transition out of special education or barely staying in with accommodations only.    A student being served here should have shown mastery of the grade level content in the regular classes.   My youngest will probably end up here next year because he needs very little support.   He might still qualify for OT services and that\u2019s about it.   Academically, he is right where he needs to be.   He\u2019s not the brilliant super-fast learner his older brother is, but he also doesn\u2019t have all the silly interfering behaviors, either.   \n Most students in special education served under IDEA should be in the resource/ collaborative services.   The whole concept of an alternative curriculum for students with mild disabilities is rapidly on its way out.   Our school is still doing it, but I see things changing even though many teachers don\u2019t like it.   I think parents and teachers need to be fairly aggressive in moving students along to less and less restrictive environments if at all possible.   In fact, I wish we had an elective or two that MY kids could participate in, even if it was just a few days a week.   But the shortage of space and teachers has put us in a bit of a squeeze that way. \n I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve clarified anything here, but at least I\u2019ve cleared some of my own mental back-log! \n Dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://futureofsped.blogspot.com/", "http://futureofsped.blogspot.com/2007/04/resource-classrooms-whats-difference.html", "http://futureofsped.blogspot.com/2007/04/reasons-1000002-1000003-and-beyond.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/04/27/iep-service-options/", "title": "IEP Service Options"},
{"date": "2007/01/03", "body": "Anyone reading this for any amount of time (and you continued to subject yourself to my screeds!) can see that NCLB, and the alternate assessment in particular, has gradually increased my stress levels, not to mention my workload. \u00a0  \u00a0 So I\u2019ve had to spend some time getting my nerves back together. \u00a0  Working with the kids that I do who require much and assorted physical handling in order to meet their positioning and mobility needs is actually pretty good therapy. \u00a0  There aren\u2019t any other teachers in the high school whose jobs demand this sort of physical mobility and effort. \u00a0  The PE teachers could get in more, but the job hardly demands it and many of the teachers avoid it. \u00a0  When Jim or Ravi hollers, they are communicating a need for some sort of shift and often it involves changing diapers. \u00a0 This isn\u2019t light work as both these boys are over 16 years old and weigh over 120 pounds with some pretty severe muscle contractions.\u00a0  \u00a0 Working on Taz\u2019s tasks for the alternate assessment has been stressful but it\u2019s been manageable. \u00a0  I\u2019ve been able to actually incorporate a fair amount of fun into the process. \u00a0  However, I have this other student that the administrators dumped on me, that has been nothing but a huge headache. \u00a0  The other teachers don\u2019t want to it so it falls back on me. \u00a0  This is why committee work absolutely SUCKS because people find ways to get out of doing things and then the case manager (ME) is left flapping in the breeze. \u00a0  I don\u2019t teach the kid. \u00a0  I never have. \u00a0  I\u2019ve laid eyes on him exactly twice. \u00a0  But the administrators who are leading this process seem to be in a coma when it comes to exercising some sense into the process. \u00a0  Harry and Carrie are the two Assistant Principals (AP) that are leading this process. Harry used to be a special ed. Administrator before he was promoted to the AP in charge of testing. \u00a0  Carrie is now the AP in charge of special education. \u00a0  Harry seems to have totally forgotten everything he ever learned when we worked with him in special education. \u00a0  Carrie, in her 2 nd  year with us, is still learning the ropes. \u00a0  Neither of these have a background in special education. \u00a0  Still, one would think that having a teacher who actually  knew  and  taught  the student might be a good choice for making informed decisions as far as leading the effort to evaluate him. \u00a0  \u00a0 So while I\u2019ve bashed NCLB and made it a very convenient scapegoat, not all baboons reside in Washington. \u00a0  We have some right here in Magnolia County. \u00a0  This is the problem with handing down mandates from the highest levels of government. \u00a0  It has to be passed down from one sapiens to another and it is continually reinterpreted, added to, modified and reworked. \u00a0  By the time it gets down to us lowly serfs who actually have to implement a thing, it is screwed up beyond all recognition. \u00a0  However, sometimes it is good for a hearty laugh. \u00a0  \u00a0 Yesterday, when we were in our GAA meeting, we were talking about some particular about how the submission forms had to be filled out. \u00a0  Someone made a comment that it shouldn\u2019t make too much of difference how the thing was dated (the directions are somewhat vague) and Harry said with a totally straight face, \u201cBut, we need to be as precise as possible for the benefit of the kids.\u201d \u00a0 Benefit the kids? \u00a0  Benefit the students? \u00a0  Are you kidding me? \u00a0  This process has LONG left the domain of benefiting the kids! \u00a0  It\u2019s become all about advancing some ideology, and accountability and some political agenda. \u00a0  I laughed so hard my sides hurt! \u00a0  HAHAHAHAHAHA! \u00a0  \u00a0 I had not laughed so hard and so much in a very long time. \u00a0  All of these students are going to get a special education diploma. \u00a0  It does not matter one WIT whether the dates on the submission forms have dashes or slashes! \u00a0  How much does a kid with an IQ of 35 care about the school\u2019s AYP? \u00a0  And  should  they care about how their subgroup performs in math? \u00a0  \u00a0 I do get out  once  in awhile, and  Eduwonk  caught my attention with a  little snippet  that I checked up on. \u00a0  The links are worth reading, as there are people within the disability community who do like NCLB. \u00a0  In fact,  Madeleine C. Wil l, Vice President of Public Policy,  National Down Syndrome Society , wants NCLB to be  more  stringent in its standards for individuals with disabilities. \u00a0  The  other article  from an elementary school in Georgia credits NCLB with more special education students being mainstreamed. \u00a0  Actually,\u00a0 the state DoE has set a goal for 90% of students with disabilities be included at least 80% of the time. \u00a0  And by reading the article, you can see that even this elementary school is falling short of that target. \u00a0  I\u2019m actually for more inclusion as long as it involves both skill sets in the form of two teachers, regular and special educators working together. \u00a0  For some reason, school districts have resisted that model and favor the more restrictive settings. \u00a0  \u00a0 As a counterpoint to Eduwonk\u2019s offering, I\u2019ll pony up a  letter by a state school superintendent  who has actually been in favor of accountability for a long time but who points out several instances where NCLB and specifically the Federal DoE has fallen short and sometimes is outright dishonest. \u00a0  Definitely worth a read, and hat tip to  Jim Horn  whose blog sort of pointed the way to this little gem. \u00a0 Dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://eduwonk.com/", "http://www.eduwonk.com/archives/2006_12_31_archive.html#116775018150897407", "http://www.aspeninstitute.org/atf/cf/%7BDEB6F227-659B-4EC8-8F84-8DF23CA704F5%7D/Madeleine%20Will%20Testimony.pdf", "http://www.ndss.org/", "http://www.macon.com/mld/macon/16331967.htm", "http://www.ade.state.az.us/pio/Press-Releases/2006/CongressmanMcKeon.pdf", "http://schoolsmatter.blogspot.com/2006/12/nclb-and-soviet-style-micro.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/01/03/a-good-laugh-and-some-nclb-links/", "title": "A Good Laugh and some NCLB\u00a0links"},
{"date": "2007/01/29", "body": "I\u2019ve been going on and on and on about the Georgia Alternate Assessment (GAA). \u00a0  NCLB states that every child must be on grade level by 2013 and to that end requires regular testing in order to obtain accountability. \u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about accountability for a second. \u00a0  I\u2019m quite in favor of accountability, as I\u2019ve seen more than one of my colleagues skate by doing very little in their classrooms. \u00a0  Then when their ways are exposed to the light, it results in some new rule, regulation or system which burdens everyone else. \u00a0  A regular and reliable method of accountability would catch errors, mistakes and slackers a lot sooner to the betterment of the students. \u00a0  If a student is failing or is not performing, wouldn\u2019t it be better to find this out as early as possible? \u00a0  If there is an incompetent teacher, wouldn\u2019t it be better to know that sooner rather than later? \u00a0 Accountability was the carrot that George W. offered the conservatives in congress in order to gain passage of NCLB. \u00a0  And it has been the mantra of the various conservative voices in the education debate. \u00a0  They practically beat and whip the progressives with the mantra that opposing NCLB is akin to being afraid or in opposition of reform and accountability. \u00a0  I\u2019m a conservative, and I can think of any number of reasons and ways to beat and whip progressives and liberals. \u00a0  But this \u201caccountability\u201d and \u201creform\u201d as represented in NCLB isn\u2019t one of them. \u00a0  Remember, it was Ted Kennedy who stood in the rose garden behind G. W. when he signed that abomination. \u00a0 First off, \u201caccountability\u201d in NCLB always means a standardized test. \u00a0  Well, almost always, and we\u2019ll get to that. \u00a0  But accountability for teachers being highly qualified means passing a test. \u00a0  For students, it means taking a test. \u00a0  For paras, it means passing a test. \u00a0  For schools, it is how many in each subgroup pass the test. \u00a0  It is all about the test. \u00a0 My students can not take a standardized test. \u00a0  It\u2019s just not physically possible and there would be no valid results derived from such a test. \u00a0  So my kids pose the most significant challenge to NCLB. \u00a0  Advocates of NCLB do not wish to discuss my kids. \u00a0  They want to ignore them. \u00a0  They wish they\u2019d just disappear. \u00a0  But they can\u2019t because it\u2019s  NO  Child Left Behind, not All But 1% Not Left Behind. \u00a0  So they had to come up with something, and in the state of Georgia it is something they call a \u201cportfolio.\u201d \u00a0  And the \u201cportfolio\u201d is a hell of a lot more work for the teachers than the students. \u00a0  There are many, many ways that a portfolio can fail and count against the school\u2019s AYP. \u00a0  NONE of those ways have anything to do with student achievement. \u00a0  So teachers in Georgia have to log in scores and scores of extra hours making sure that every form is filled out correctly despite the fact that the forms themselves have their own flaws built in. \u00a0 But I have not mentioned the unkindest cut of all. \u00a0  It\u2019s the flem in the spit that is spat in the eyes of every teacher who has to endure this ordeal. \u00a0  It is the salt in the raw wound. \u00a0  It is the twisting of the knife in the belly. \u00a0  \u00a0 I hope you\u2019re sitting down. Because according to our testing administrator, they aren\u2019t even going to look at and score every one of these portfolios. \u00a0  \u00a0 How\u2019s that grab you? \u00a0 All that work. \u00a0  For nothing. \u00a0  All the writing, editing and rewriting and no one is even going to look at it. \u00a0  Apparently they are going to take a random sample and score just some of them. \u00a0 That\u2019s the face of accountability. \u00a0  See, scoring these things is a massively time-consuming exercise which means it will cost money. \u00a0  Perhaps the state doesn\u2019t have the money. \u00a0  Or they don\u2019t have the time. \u00a0  You ain\u2019t got no money honey, I got no more time. \u00a0 Whatever the reason, that\u2019s what I was told. \u00a0  I could not believe it. \u00a0  I can not accept it. \u00a0  It just takes an already cruel joke and takes it beyond the absurd. \u00a0  Why put so much into something that no one will even look at? \u00a0  If these were regular education students, there would be a shit fit because no student is going to expend all that effort for so high of stakes and not have every test scored. It\u2019s just plain cruel. \u00a0dick \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/01/29/the-unkindest-cut/", "title": "The Unkindest Cut"},
{"date": "2007/01/19", "body": "\u00a0 I\u2019m thinking about Assistive Technology (AT) lately.    This is the time of year when we look at our budgets and buy things for next year.    With the miniscule supply money we have, it makes it difficult to choose.    Anyone who knows anything about disabilities knows that the minute a thing becomes useful to people with special needs, the price automatically doubles.    It\u2019s almost like vendors figure out that they have a desperate consumer base and they are determined to squeeze everything they can out of them. \u00a0 For instance, I\u2019ve always bought a lot of ground turkey instead of hamburger because it\u2019s tons cheaper and has tons less fat.    As soon as they slapped a label on it that said \u201cGluten Free Casein Free\u201d on it, the price went up $.40 a pound!    As if printing those 4 words suddenly increased their overhead or something.    This is another reason why I\u2019m such a skeptic, and an angry one at that, because if you are a parent of a person with disabilities you are going to have other people\u2019s hands in your pockets all the time. \u00a0 As I look through various catalogs, I see stuff costing hundreds of dollars that might only be $25.99 in the regular retail marketplace.    And the more severe the disability we\u2019re marketing to, the higher the mark up.    Various talking, vibrating, flashing toys for $50 where you might be able to find something comparable for less than $10 though a junk outlet like  Oriental Trading Company .    I\u2019m looking at a wooden puzzle for $50 in a special needs catalog, where one can go to the dollar store and pick up 3 for $10.    \u00a0 Assistive technology can be sophisticated or it can be simple.    I\u2019m the sort that prefers simple although make no mistake that I love the flashy toys as much as any guy!    Two years ago, Spaz\u2019s mother had a technology assessment done and they authorized the purchase of a  Dynamo  for about $3,000 or so.    Most of it was paid through Medicaid, so you and I footed a lot of the bill.    Within a year, the thing was unusable for a couple of reasons.    One was the fact that Spaz is simply hard on stuff.    He has to mouth and bite everything and squeeze it and occasional hit it.    This isn\u2019t good for electronics, generally speaking.    The other reason is because they bought the Dynamo at the end of its support cycle.    Every 3 years,  Dynavox  comes out with newer, flashier and more expensive gadgets and then quite supporting the old ones.    So when the Dynamo broke or the memory cards quit working, dynamo said \u201ctough.\u201d    They might have supported them for a year, but they eventually quit.    This, despite the fact that Spaz\u2019s mother  did  purchase the extended warranty for another $1,000 or so. \u00a0 Meanwhile there is Taz, who absolutely is  not  any easier on his stuff, comes along.    Instead of a dynamo, he has a PECS book made of a 3 ring notebook bought at Wal-Mart, with various laminated pictures and pages with Velcro in it and he has had it since middle school and he  still  uses it despite the fact it is falling to pieces.    But when this book eventually visits the landfill, I\u2019m not out gobs of $$$. \u00a0 It\u2019s so easy to be seduced by vendors peddling assistive devices and technology.    They do so many seemingly wonderful things and it\u2019s easy to be sucked into believing that a child absolutely must have a certain thing.    Parents of neurotypical children have the same problem, but with the miracle of mass production and mass advertising and competition (the free market) they don\u2019t get pinched nearly as bad.    Individuals with disabilities are a seemingly captive audience and it seems like this population is very susceptible to various scams and slicksters.    The folks at Dynavox are not necessarily scammers, but they are hustlers.    There are populations where their devices are very appropriate and useful.    I once had a student with a traumatic brain injury who used one, and they did offer extensive training to all of us educators who worked with him.    However, when that went bad, they no longer offered support for it.    The turn-around on offering support is about 3 years, which is not untypical in the consumer electronics industry.    However, this particular machine cost over $7,000 without the extended warranty.    I do have problems with a company who handholds a person through the purchasing process but then leaves them seemingly high and dry 3 years later.    And these machines don\u2019t seem to be especially durable as I have never seen one that was used regularly that lasted the full 3 years. \u00a0 Parents, teachers and service providers have limited budgets and it is important to make those resources we have go as far as possible.    I\u2019ve met teachers who basically blow their funds and say, \u201cOh well, it\u2019s not MY money!\u201d    I think that is a glib and irresponsible attitude.    Some thinking needs to be involved in what we spend money on as to how important a thing is and how we\u2019re going to use it.    As an educator, I\u2019m also mindful of if and how I can transfer a thing home.    For instance, I just had a workshop on  Intellitools , which is a wonderful bit of software I\u2019m going to use to get my students through their alternate assessments.    The cost for this suite of programs is around $285.    The cost of the Intellikeys keyboard which makes this software accessible for my kids is $375.      The cost of Boardmaker which we use for all sorts of activities (like Taz\u2019s PECS book) and other programs runs about $370.    See a trend here?    And each of these pieces of software have other supporting bits of software going for $50-$150 each. \u00a0 Last year, I was given $125 by our department and another $100  from Governor Sonny Perdue .    That\u2019s it.    And I can\u2019t save my money in a piggy bank, I have to spend it all during a specific time or it is forfeited.    In the case of Sonny\u2019s money, I could only spend it during the 3 day tax holiday.    \u00a0 So I can and do appeal to the county office for these big ticket items.    Personally, I want a digital camera that won\u2019t be taken away for some other pet project.    I can make my own overlays with my own pictures that are actually relevant to what students do everyday.    But I\u2019m also going to need the Intellitools to get through the alternate assessment with some degree of sanity. \u00a0 But back to parents for a second; parents of students with disabilities are usually not wealthy.    Especially those on the more severe end of the disability spectrum.    The parents of my students are lucky if they have a computer at all, let alone DSL or high capacity processors and memory and multimedia add-ons.    I know of 2 of them who have computers, while the other 3 do not.    There are not going to be able to afford a touch screen much less Intellikeys and all the stuff that goes with it.    They have more important needs like housing, clothes, medical bills and food.    I don\u2019t send long lists home to parents of my kids of stuff I expect them to provide.    At the beginning of every semester, Thomas and Percy both bring home lists of supplies that their teachers want parents to send in.    Wipes, napkins, tissues, sanitizer, air fresheners, paper towels and on and on.    In addition we get asked to bring in snacks.    In addition, we get hit up to buy wrapping paper, candy, magazines, school pictures, annuals, spirit shirts and clothes and participate in every PTA activity.    Raising children is a costly venture, but more so those with special needs.    I\u2019m not a big fan of the GFCF diet, but I at least admire the resourcefulness and dedication of those who are. \u00a0 All of the above is simply my way of saying that I\u2019m looking for ways to bring technology to those who can\u2019t afford the bleeding edge stuff.    If I can find a way to make Power Point (or better, Open Office\u2019s Impress) work, I\u2019m going to do it.    If I can find a way to give parents access to the internet on the cheap, I\u2019m going to do it.    That is part of the driving force behind my Linux/open source blog.    I\u2019ve been able to save a buck or two by having access to eBay and an open market place.    I\u2019ve been able to find lots of information and learn from other people by virtue of having such access.    You all reading this probably takes this sort of access for granted.    But within the realm of students with disabilities it seems that those are the people who could probably most benefit from technology and those are the people least likely to be able to afford it. \u00a0 OMG \u2013 I just realized\u2026I\u2019m coming up on my Blogiversary!  I\u2019ll see if I can get in some sort of self-indulgent sentimental post in on the weekend.

{"date": "2007/01/22", "body": "\u00a0 One year ago I officially became an education blogger. \u00a0  It really has been a labor of love and I have really enjoyed getting to know other bloggers and readers. \u00a0  The initial idea for this blog was to help fill in a niche among education/teacher bloggers, mainly dealing primarily with special education and special education policy issues from the point of view of both parent and teacher. \u00a0  There are many things that impact those in the disability community that others might either not think about or take for granted. \u00a0  Probably nothing has turned things on their head since the first public law guaranteeing an education to individuals with disabilities as much as No Child Left Behind. \u00a0  During the past year, I had to take another test, my paras all had to take a test and I am being tested again through the alternate assessment. \u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 I went from being an advocate for high quality and accountability to being a being a bitter enemy against centralized control of education and yet another unfunded mandate. \u00a0  There\u2019s such a difference between turning my children over to other people in my own community and turning them over to the federal government. \u00a0  IDEA provides protection from discrimination, but it\u2019s my local district providing the education according to the curriculum and plan we set up on a local level. \u00a0  But with the weight of the Feds upon us, the needs of the state take precedence over the needs of the individual child. \u00a0 The most popular posts, by far, has been the  IEP series  that I did. \u00a0  I might get 150 hit per day, and 100 of those are directed at posts specifically dealing with that series. \u00a0  The  Fleecing article  was the first one that really caught a lot of attention thanks to  Liz  who nominated me for the  Skeptic\u2019s Circle . \u00a0  No other single post has done as much as that one as far as putting me on the map. \u00a0 I often get posts from parents and teachers asking for advice. \u00a0  I try to do what I can, but I\u2019m still learning the same as everyone else. \u00a0  I don\u2019t know it all and have learned a lot from the writings of others. \u00a0  This past year has been a grand adventure and I hope I can continue to be a resource for those in the special education community. \u00a0  Perhaps I\u2019ll have a little bit more in the way of making a big deal over this place in another year!\u00a0  \u00a0 Thank you all for stopping by! \u00a0 dick \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lizditz.typepad.com/", "http://terrasig.blogspot.com/2006/03/31st-meeting-of-skeptics-circle.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/01/22/one-year-blogiversary-a-word-or-two/", "title": "One Year Blogiversary: A Word or\u00a0Two"},
{"date": "2007/01/16", "body": "Hannah\u2019s Question RE: Working with EBD Students \u00a0 I worked for 2 years for a \u201clive in/work tons of hours\u201d wilderness camp for EBD boys. I loved working with them, they were such interesting and spirited people. Now I am looking at special ed graduate schools, but I\u2019m not sure if its exactly suited to what I want. I want to work with this type of population, but is the public school system the way to go? With all of your experience do you think this is the best route? \u00a0 \u00a0 There are many routes for working with the EBD population.    Those with Emotional Behavior Disorders (EBD) are actually a very diverse group.    \u201cInteresting and Spirited\u201d is a fairly accurate description!LOL!    Since they are so diverse, they often require a diverse range of services from mental health to juvenile justice to educational and vocational services.    I would rate humor and patience as the cardinal virtues for working with this group.    These traits are needed for  any  teaching position, but you\u2019ll need an especially generous helping for working with these youngsters. \u00a0 I\u2019ve had 3 different types of experiences working with this population: Public school (high school and middle school self-contained), psychoed (part of the public schools, but a specialized school) and a mental health facility for children and adolescents.    In the latter position, I was part of a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists and sometimes even juvenile justice personnel such as probation officers and teachers. \u00a0 In my case, I needed a lot more structure and support for working with this population.    For me, there is no worse den of horrors than a self-contained EBD classroom in a regular school.    But administrative support is the key here.    If the administration just wants you out of their way, you\u2019re on your own.    Not many teachers do well in this type of isolation and the average rate of burn out is hideous at something less than 3 years on average.    I know some who have been doing it much longer and some who didn\u2019t last more than a few months.    Tough job, but opportunities abound.    There are loads of jobs out there for the taking. \u00a0 In Georgia, we have a psychoed network, which serves students with severe emotional disabilities who are too severe to be in a regular education setting.    This is a more restrictive setting and the disabilities are much more severe but administrative support isn\u2019t quite as much of an issue.    The program coordinator is most definitely on the same side and everyone is pulling in the same direction. \u00a0 The state hospital was the most restrictive setting of all.    It was a locked facility, and we had teams of people working with relatively small numbers of clients with very severe problems.    Our clients ranged from the normally intelligent who happened to be suicidal or homicidal to those with significant cognitive impairments.    While the severity was worse in many ways, the level of support was actually higher.    I didn\u2019t have to deal with the worst of the behaviors as a teacher because there was a medical and behavioral team standing by and they could use more interventions like seclusion and medications.    Generally, I found that more restrictive settings translated into more support but it also means more severe behavior issues. \u00a0 It takes a special temperament to work with those who are, by definition, difficult to get along with.    When I told an old teacher of mine that I was going to be teaching those with EBD, she half-jokingly said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know someone is getting in the business who knows something about it!\u201d    I wouldn\u2019t say my temperament is the best, though.    While I am extremely calm on the outside, inside I tend to be a roiling bucket of nerves.    My tolerance hasn\u2019t improved much with age!    I can work well with this population in limited doses, meaning not all day, every day.    Being a consultant, psychologist, counselor or some other service provider that works 1:1 wouldn\u2019t be quite as bad as teachers who typically have several EBD students at a time who tend to feed off of each other and escalate every little situation.    They quickly become proficient little button-pushers as they can often be quicker and more streetwise than students with other disabilities.    They can also be very creative, so any person dealing with groups of this population should be equally nimble mentally in order to keep ahead. \u00a0 The rewards can be rich, but sometimes require much effort and patience compared to working with other kids.    They aren\u2019t always appreciative of your efforts and frequently sabotage their own success which can be very frustrating.    They can be enormously charming and then enormously vicious in the space of seconds.    I knew many who seemed to have interests in psychology and law, which also made things quite challenging as they were constantly gaming the system.    They usually also come from very rough environments which can also be heart breaking. \u00a0 I\u2019m not telling anyone what to do, because only you know what your own temperament and tolerance is.    There\u2019s a reason why there are always EBD positions open in school systems.    If a person has the skills, talents and temperament, they can enjoy their success and reap the admiration of everyone.    Seriously, tell someone you\u2019re an EBD teacher, and most people will bless you while genuflecting.    Many of those attracted to EBD teaching    aren\u2019t exactly saint material, themselves, which helps them identify with the kids sometimes.      My background, as tough as it was, has served me well where I am now and I have no regrets although I wouldn\u2019t care to go through some of it again.    That\u2019s one of the good things about special education is that there is considerable room for movement between areas, subjects and grades. \u00a0 Good luck! dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/01/16/on-being-an-ebd-teacher/", "title": "On Being an EBD\u00a0Teacher"},
{"date": "2007/01/05", "body": "Hat tip to  The Paraprofessor  for scooping this  one up .    I\u2019m eternally grateful that he\u2019s provided me something to discuss other than alternate assessments.    \u00a0 The Baltimore sun is reporting that a bunch of its para educators are being transferred in the middle of the year in order to comply with NCLB requirements.    NCLB requires all Title I schools to be staffed by paras who are highly qualified.    \u201cHighly qualified\u201d in this case means two years of college or passing a test.    The school system in Baltimore is the only one in the state and possibly the only one in the country going through this sort of upheaval, according to an AFT representative identified as an expert on teaching assistants. \u00a0 What happened is that not all of the Title I school paras have met the highly qualified requirement.    So the solution the school system has implemented is to take the highly qualified paras from non-Title I schools and transfer them in to the Title I schools. Right now, as in in the middle of the school year. Imagine being a parent in one of those non-Title I schools and now your child is going to lose their HQ para which will be replaced by one who is  not  HQ.    And sure enough, parents are pissed.    Paras are pissed.    \u00a0 System officials, parents and paras in the system opine that they should simply wait and finish the school year instead of disrupting the whole system.    The thing is, this provision was supposed to take effect in January 2006 and the feds granted an extension until June 2006 for just this reason.    Baltimore is already a year overdue!    We ALL knew about this since 2002.    In fact, the paras knew about their HQ requirements long before special education teachers.    This is gross incompetence on the part of the Baltimore school system.    It perfectly illustrates the reason why law makers felt the need to write such a law and implement sanctions in the first place!    If it weren\u2019t for incompetent idiots like these clowns in Baltimore, accountability, standards, deadlines and sanctions would not be the issue they are today. \u00a0 In Magnolia  County, we were a little on the slow side, or it seemed like it by not getting information to the paras until 2004.    The school system made the decision that  all  paras in the entire school district had to meet HQ requirements by June 2006.    Any who did not would not be re-hired and they were not hiring any who did not meet the HQ requirement as soon as the law went into effect.    This eliminated the whole shell game Baltimore is now forced to play between those schools that are Title I and those that are not. \u00a0 They should have gotten all of their paras highly qualified and now the schools that  did  their part in Baltimore are having to take up the slack for those that didn\u2019t in the Baltimore system as the savvy principals non-Title I schools lose their HQ paras to the bumbling Title I schools who failed to meet the requirements.    Thinking about it, a body can see that a pattern of failure does exist in some schools.    I\u2019m extraordinarily angry because every school district in the nation has to pony up and pay for the outright  stupidity  of a few districts who can not get their act together.    \u00a0 If school systems had blanket parties for screw-up school systems, the Baltimore one would be a prime candidate.    Every administrator, parent, student and teacher who has had to suffer under NCLB\u2019s most burdensome provisions should get a crack at walking by the clowns in the Baltimore system and delivering a punch or kick in the place of their choice.    There\u2019s just no excuse for this sort of incompetence.    \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://paraeducator.info/blog/", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/education/bal-md.ci.schools04jan04,0,2809110.story?coll=bal-home-headlines"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/01/05/the-screw-ups-who-made-nclb-necessary/", "title": "The Screw-Ups Who Made NCLB\u00a0Necessary"},
{"date": "2006/10/03", "body": "I briefly chronicled my professional exploits  elsewhere . \u00a0  But with all of the ruckus about paraeducators and what I think of them, I figured now would be a good time to go back to those days and color in a bit more detail. \u00a0  Just so you know. \u00a0  \u00a0 I originally wanted to begin being a para earlier, but was tempted and seduced into trying my luck as a full fledged EBD teacher who was supposedly supervising a couple of different paras. \u00a0  This was a disaster. \u00a0  One para was a mother who was just looking for a little extra work and money, and the other was an ex-music teacher. \u00a0  Thankfully Music Teacher knew a thing or two and supported me and propped me up in ways she\u2019ll never know. \u00a0  The Mother was more clueless than me, which was very bad. \u00a0  I really had no idea what to do with either of them. \u00a0  It was a divine act of mercy that got me out of there, even though being let go was seriously demoralizing. \u00a0 The next summer I was working at Arbys and going to school to finish that Master\u2019s. \u00a0  I was taking a class on instructional strategies that included folks from the MR, LD and interrelated disciplines. \u00a0  You could invariably tell who the EBD folks were, because we were the ones smoking during class breaks! \u00a0  It was during these breaks that I met Juliet. \u00a0  Ah,yes. \u00a0  Juliet with the long and gorgeous red hair. \u00a0  Jane will have at me for writing that, but oh, well\u2026 \u00a0 Juliet walked up to me and asked me if I was looking for a job, and I told her I was. \u00a0  It just so happened she was looking for a para. \u00a0  Thing was, it was 50 or so miles from where I lived. \u00a0  She said if I was interested, I could call the coordinator of the psychoed outpost, which I did. \u00a0  I interviewed with the coordinator and the  Magnolia   County  director of personnel. \u00a0  I told them of my history and they were very interested in me. \u00a0  They sort of wondered if I was that interested in them but I was determined not to seduced away again. \u00a0  \u00a0 My wife Jane and I were engaged and living together at the time. \u00a0  Jane had a good job making good money and I was a student working at Arbys. \u00a0  So in essence Jane partially subsidized my living expenses which I could never have afforded on what I was paid as a para.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Juliet also subsidized me in a way. \u00a0  Yes, the lovely crimson haired young woman lived less than 10 miles from where I was.  \u00a0 So we ended up car pooling, meaning she drove most of the time. \u00a0  I would meet her every morning a little after  6 a.m.  at a shopping center, and she would drive us to the psychoed in  Magnolia    County  by  7:30 . \u00a0  \u00a0 Juliet was just a few years younger than me, and had been a para just a year before I met her. \u00a0  She had been a para for a teacher who resigned in the middle of the year so Juliet took over. \u00a0  She had a degree in psychology and was in the same Master\u2019s degree program that I was. \u00a0  She was a para who became a teacher, and I was a teacher who became a para. \u00a0  We were equals in almost every way, except of course she was my boss and got paid twice as much as me. \u00a0  \u00a0 Juliet and I were teaching middle school aged students with severe emotional disorders in a psychoed outpost. \u00a0  Georgia  has a network of psycheducational schools just for students with very severe emotional behavior issues. \u00a0  There are center schools and then there are outpost schools. \u00a0  Magnolia    County  had a small outpost which had a coordinator, a social worker, 4 teachers and 5 paras as well as an itinerant art therapist. \u00a0  All of the paras who were with me that year have since become special ed teachers. \u00a0  It really was that special of a place. \u00a0 Since we were so small, we were also a very cohesive unit. \u00a0  I learned from paras who had been there awhile, as well as from Juliet herself. \u00a0  In many ways I had the most ideal situation a teacher/para could possibly have. \u00a0  Juliet and I had a good relationship all around. \u00a0  With the hours of commuting, we had a lot of time to talk and communicate. \u00a0  To people who know me now, it might be difficult to believe I could be a good subordinate to a woman younger than myself who had really no greater depth of knowledge than I did. \u00a0  But I had no problems with it. \u00a0  I\u2019ve been in the military, and have no problems with taking orders and following direction. \u00a0  \u00a0 Juliet was not a hard supervisor at all. \u00a0  The role of supervisor was one she was just getting used to, herself. \u00a0  I made it as easy as possible on her\u2026 most of the time . \u00a0  I really never forgot who was in charge, so she never had to think about it. \u00a0  We were just very comfortable with each other and had lots of respect for each other. \u00a0 Paras seem to really grouse about the differential in authority between themselves and the teacher. \u00a0  I have tried to explain this as a teacher. \u00a0  Let me try to put it in perspective of a para, at least how I understood it. \u00a0  Mush of it goes along with my military background and training. \u00a0  Having superior rank does not mean a person is superior personally. \u00a0  It has nothing to do with the quality of character or even technical skills. \u00a0  In the military, every person in the squad has a specialty and a job which they perform with greater skill than anyone else on the team. \u00a0  The officers can not do it all. \u00a0  They coordinate and make sure things get done amongst all the parts. \u00a0 Juliet was not better or smarter than me. \u00a0  But she was higher on the totem pole, and I followed her and supported her all the way, no matter if I agreed or not. \u00a0  Most of the time, we did agree. \u00a0  But not always. \u00a0  I sometimes thought she was too verbal with the boys and talked and lectured too much. \u00a0\u00a0  I didn\u2019t always like all of the activities we did and thought a lot of them were silly and dumb. \u00a0  But you know what? \u00a0  I carried out her will because it was her job to think of the stuff and my job to carry it out. \u00a0  It helped that I liked her, even though I did not always agree with her. \u00a0  We had a good relationship. \u00a0  She never lorded her position over me, and listened to what I had to say.  \u00a0 I let her know when I thought things needed some tweaking and we worked together. \u00a0 This cohesion worked for the betterment of the students. \u00a0  Juliet and I were on the same page. \u00a0  The students knew that I was not going to be able to be played against her. \u00a0  Our classroom was a safer place because of that. \u00a0  We could actually enjoy these challenging students together and when things got tough we each had the other to go to. \u00a0  \u00a0 Because we had the relationship that we did, Juliet gave me lots of opportunities to try new things. \u00a0  I added to the behavior management plan, and enhanced it with visual charts and tracking gimmicks. \u00a0  I instituted a sort of token lottery system that also incorporated academics into it. \u00a0  IOW, a student could earn a reinforcer for so many tokens but first they had to answer an academic question. \u00a0  I also planned and delivered all of the science lessons we did, which gave Juliet a sizable planning block plus it was one less planning period she had to do. \u00a0 I\u2019m feeling the need to write more about this, but I\u2019ll extend in another chapter. \u00a0  I think the most important \u201ctake away\u201d points are: \u2013 I had a good relationship with my teacher \u2013 I let her be the boss, and did so without resentment \u2013 I supported her jealously and zealously. \u00a0  \u2013 I took initiative in making her life easier while challenging myself to try new things. \u00a0 Basically, I submitted to her for the sake of the greater good. \u00a0  I\u2019m not sure I could have done that for someone I did not like or get along with. \u00a0  Juliet was a hard word working and dedicated teacher. \u00a0  It would have been more difficult to submit to someone who was not so competent and diligent. \u00a0  She engendered respect and I happily gave it to her. \u00a0  In return, she respected me and my opinions \u00a0 In future posts I\u2019ll talk a bit more about the programming and behavior management issues we had. \u00a0  But I thought it was important to lay down the foundation which was the teacher-para relationship. \u00a0  The more severe the disability, the more crucial it is that people work together as a unit and team. \u00a0  Juliet and I were, in many respects, a perfect team. \u00a0  It was a wonderful experience and I learned a lot. \u00a0  I miss those days, sometimes.

{"date": "2006/09/11", "body": "\n I was recently talking with a teacher who was thinking about going back for her Ph.D.  She is also doing social skills training for various groups of students who are on the autistic spectrum.  She is an excellent teacher and has a lot of good ideas and techniques.  I have no doubt that she will excel if she decides to get into the PhD program. \n The thing is, is that when she pursues her advanced degree it\u2019s almost a marketing thing for her social skills classes.  That part bothers me just a bit.  I\u2019ve  written   extensively   about  how so many services and service providers are getting fat off of dollars from families who have disabilities.  It isn\u2019t just autism, but autism currently is the most lucrative gravy train at the moment.  This might be followed closely by ADHD and learning disabilities. \n So if one were legitimately trying to help the autism community, just what would their service or product look like?  What sort of model would best serve parents of young children with autism or any other disability?  If it were me peddling goods, and I was more interested in helping people than getting filthy rich, what would I do and how would I do it? \n First, let\u2019s look at the way it is done now.  Basically a parent gets the sad news from a pediatrician or neurologist that their child has some form of autism.  Once that happens, the search is on to find the cause and the cure.  And there is no shortage of people peddling both at the same time.  The people with their hands deepest in a parent\u2019s pocket is going to claim some sort of advanced expertise, knowledge and skill out of reach of anyone else.  Their treatment is going to be highly specialized in some way.  And they are going to tell you that you are a bad parent for not at least trying it.  So you start forking over money.  Lots of it.  Obscene amounts, sometimes, all for the sake of your child.  I mean, it\u2019s your  child!   $50 an hour will look like a bargain compared to what some of these people charge.  In the \u201cget all your money\u201d model, a parent will be subjected to an infinite number of \u201ctreatments\u201d which are on a regular basis, usually once or twice a week.  Afterall, we know there isn\u2019t any shortcuts.  These things take time, which is why it is best to start as early as possible!  By the time a parent gets through, they are bitter, broke, skeptical, angry and still stuck with autism.  Meanwhile, the service peddler has moved on to other victim/clients.  It does not mater  what  the treatment is.  I don\u2019t care if you are just writing a book, you are still cashing in. \n I\u2019m not saying a person should not be paid for their time.  I believe a person with a great idea should be rewarded.  There\u2019s a lot of folks with bad ideas getting rewarded, so paying people who are competent shouldn\u2019t be too objectionable.  But any service worth anything needs to be as accessible to as many who need it as possible.  and it\u2019s possible to make a living at it, but not necessarily getting filthy rich.  I\u2019d much rather live modestly and know I lived righteously than to be filthy rich and know that I cheated massive amounts from the people least able to afford it. \n Social skills, ABA, OT, speech and homeopathic medicine: these are the hottest things going for individuals with autism right now.  The most educationally and morally sound approach should involve some form of parent education in order that the parent can provide and continue the therapy on their own without the therapist having to be there.  That means that the parent should be present for each and every therapy session and learn to do what the SLP, OT or behaviorist is doing.  This does not mean the parent becomes those things, except to the extent that it applies to his/her own child.  Parent education is one of the most efficacious and empirically supported interventions when it comes to students and children with behavioral difficulties.   There is no reason why this shouldn\u2019t apply to other interventions, as well.  A parent should be able to be trained sufficiently to provide the services needed for their own child, including some medical ones.  The idea is to make the family as independent as possible, and to make meaningful support available when needed.  The running around to clinics and treatment centers serves to further isolate and differentiate families affected by disabilities from those of more typical family dynamics (whatever that may be). \n And this is what I told my teacher friend.  If she wants genuine legitimacy in my eyes, she would include a parent training and follow-up component to her social skills program so that the good she does can live on long after she retires or moves to a more upscale location. \n Many parents have the resources to pay for someone else to provide services to their children.  They can afford to hire the nannies, experts and providers and if they have the means than I say go for it.  But not every family with a disabled child is financially secure.  They are all too willing to fork over money that they don\u2019t have in order to obtain help.  This is where teaching them to help themselves can pay greater dividends and improve the well-being of everyone in the family, not just treat the one with the disability while bankrupting the parents.    Show the parents how to do it and tell them, \u201cI\u2019ll show you how to do it.  Once you learn, I\u2019m available for consulting.  Or you can pay me to do it if you don\u2019t want to do it yourself.\u201d  At least you aren\u2019t holding them over the barrel by claiming that only you have the answer and that their child will suffer needlessly if you aren\u2019t making the big bucks to serve him/her. \n I\u2019m all for capitalism, but only when it is done responsibly and with some sense of not harming others for personal gain. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/09/11/a-more-moral-way-to-make-a-buck/", "title": "A More Moral Way to Make a\u00a0Buck"},
{"date": "2006/07/12", "body": "Spanking (Autism) \n [ slight name change because of the fetish traffic\u2026not that I don\u2019t appreciate it or anything!] \n I\u2019m treading lightly on this one, and trying to be sensitive about it. I\u2019M sensitive about it and hope readers might at least try to be likewise. This is not easy reading. It certainly wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to write. \n A few weeks ago, Percy and Jane were out, and Thomas and I were at home. We were fiddling around out in the garden and then came inside. He demanded pizza and I told him it wasn\u2019t time to eat yet. He then goes to the microwave and punches the numbers to make it 5:00. I informed him that wasn\u2019t going to cut it. He screamed and I told him screaming was finished and put him in the brown chair. Then he did something he had never done before; he hit me. He just hauled off and whapped me in the leg! \n Up until this point, neither Jane nor I had ever spanked the boys. We both grew up getting a belt (me) a spoon (her) or a switch (me again) but have been using a time out chair (the brown chair), like Supernanny uses. And for the most part it has worked. The next step is to put them in their room for time out. Problem is, starting last month Thomas took to throwing all of his books off the bookshelf and trashing his room. \n Thomas hit me when I told him to sit on the chair and yelled \u201cNO!\u201d  He and Percy have gotten a lot more defiant this summer. \n All this is to say that Thomas\u2019 defiance to me ended at that moment when I gave him two hard swats to his bare bottom. Then I put him in his room and warned him not to clear his book shelves. \n Actually, his defiance didn\u2019t end until the next moment, when I walked in and his books were all over the floor which garnered him two more hard swats. I then told him he was going to get more if he didn\u2019t have it cleaned up when I came back. This was a couple weeks ago, and I have since not had the compliance and defiance issues Jane continues to have. \n I\u2019m not a big fan of beating kids. The behaviorist in me understands that punishment only suppresses behavior, and does not teach new and better behaviors. But the old style behaviorists knew something the more modern version has forgotten: Punishment works. In fact, the famous Lovaas Young Autism Project (YAP) used punishers extensively in their famous study where so many students \u201crecovered\u201d from their autism. That\u2019s not to say I want a researcher or anyone else spanking or striking or shocking my children. But my parents, Jane\u2019s parents and now me understands that it can be an efficient tool if juxtaposed with good teaching and good guidance. \n Jane wanted to accuse me of teaching the boys how to hit, which I said was utter nonsense. They learned how to hit at school from their peers! Actually, I think hitting is more of an instinctual thing, anyway. I was not hitting to counter hitting, I was using it to counter defiance. \n Hmmm. That spanking was not my intended focus, here. But now I see where I\u2019m going to be accused of beating on my autistic child or something. The last word on that is this: I believe that part or teaching and parenting kids (NT or AS or otherwise) means turning them into productive human beings. Kids today (and many of their parents) often act like selfish animals. I\u2019m not playing that, and my kids have a very concrete understanding of my authority. I care enough not to condone poor behavior. I\u2019ll do it again if I have to. It\u2019s not capricious and I take absolutely no bloody pleasure in it at all. Ever. But it works. I still get hugs and kisses. But if I tell them to sit on the brown chair, they do it and I do not get this \u201cNO!\u201d nonsense. Jane still does get an awful lot of grief, especially from Thomas. Sometimes she\u2019ll just look at me, and I\u2019ll give him the same instruction she just did (i.e. pick up your shoes) and he\u2019ll do it right away. \n Spanking is a controversial topic among parents and I feel somewhat like a traitor to behaviorists who have spent decades developing nonaversive and effective techniques. Not everyone can or should do it. I think it is a decision and a practice for parents to decide for themselves and their own situations. Any practice can evolve into abuse, and it is important to guard against that, but swatting a child on the bottom should not be confused with using knuckles across their face. In our household, I think we do have a good balance between Jane, who is ambivalent about the practice and me, who is cautiously okay with it. Thomas gets the connection between the behavior and the consequence, which is the most important thing. It\u2019s not just about compliance (although that is a big deal) it is about learning some control. The consequences for impulsiveness can be dire, and I\u2019m trying to work on that aspect of his behavior in a way where his life isn\u2019t on the line. At this point, I know he thinks a bit more when he\u2019s trying to decide whether or not to listen to what I\u2019m telling him. I\u2019ll take that. \n dick Comments to this post are closed due to some posters who wish to abuse others and other such foolishness.

{"date": "2006/09/18", "body": "Yes, I am.  Most special ed. teachers in the county know it and I\u2019m sure I am the butt of many jokes because of it.  I have worked over many a SLP, OT and even the PT folks about data, or more likely, the lack of it.  They travel around to different schools, so word gets out.   I  travel to different schools occasionally, and may get up on the data-high-horse if I\u2019m feeling particularly brash.  and of course, my own kids have different teachers every year so the infamy spreads far and wise. \n I wasn\u2019t always this way.  However, very early on in my Master\u2019s program I had an instructor who was teaching applied behavior analysis and something clicked.  I did several mini-interventions, kept track of my data points and was delighted to see when things worked.  Since I was using behavioral interventions, that was most of the time.  B. F. Skinner once joked about how behaviorists were always in a better mood than any other psychological clinicians because their stuff was working  and they knew it!   Keeping score is the best and most efficient way of knowing if what you are doing is working. \n However, the pretest, post test model that NCLB currently relies on to keep score is highly flawed.  The biggest problem I have with it is that it takes only one measurement per year (at most).  What if the child isn\u2019t learning and the score goes down?  You have no idea,  until the next year!   An entire year could be going down the drain.  Fortunately, most good teachers actually assess as they go along on a regular basis.  At least when it comes to spelling or reading or writing or mathematics.  However, when it comes to behavior, no one seems to keep track of much of anything.  Getting teachers to do it is like pulling teeth.  The thing is, behavior plays a huge and crucial part of what goes on within a classroom.  There is not a teacher alive who will tell you that classroom conduct and behavior are not important.  There\u2019s enough examples of what happens when the behaviors get out of control.  They can make a teacher\u2019s life miserable!  It is the bane of most brand new teachers and all of the substitutes.  Ask a sub what makes for a bad experience: Is it kids who can\u2019t read?  Is it kids who can\u2019t add?  Is it kids who are less than bright?  No, it is kids who misbehave! \n Just like academics, tracking behavior is the key to working on it.  You track reading or spelling performance and hopefully want to see signs of improvement.  Same goes with behavior.  And this means keeping some sort of data on a regular basis. \n I\u2019m trying to work with Thomas\u2019 para and gently ease her into the role of data collector as well as facilitator.  My operatives at his school tell me that there is a significant amount of hovering going on, which is what most paras do when they don\u2019t know what else to do.  Their main qualification is that they care.  Caring is important, but paras deserve to have more knowledge and tools at their disposal which means some investment of time and yes, money.  Training materials and trainers cost money.  I\u2019ve learned over the years that a modest investment in equipping paras pays huge dividends in how the students are treated and the advancements they make.  Unfortunately my data lacks sufficient fidelity and reliability measures to get published, but I have results that show students doubling their level of independence simply by virtue of having a trained para versus an untrained one.  You see what a bit of data can do?  I can show the effectiveness of what a person is doing.  Or it can show that things need to be done differently.  For instance, we had been taking data on Spaz for years and years and had notice little appreciable change in the number of agressive (pinch, kick, hit, spit, scratch, grab) behaviors per day.  It was all over the place and variable depending on the season, the day, and the phases of the moon, or so it seemed.  We were getting no where.  I did a full-blown FBA and started working on everything I could think of to bring him around. \n With an erratic data path, it\u2019s hard to see anything at all.  He might only scratch and kick 5 times one day but then be up to 50 times the next and then back down into the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s for a few days before depressing and spiking.  The Excel trendline showed that there was a slightest of inclines in the data path.  I stayed with it.  His neurologist stayed with it along with me, loving my graphs.  Then we hit paydirt.  Something happened that we would never have anticipated.  Spaz discovered friends.  He liked having friends and wanted friends.   Especially girlfriends.  And we noticed that his aggression began plummeting when we had some higher functioning girls around who volunteered to help with some of the wheelchair kids.   We heaped on other rewards, too, but that was the turn.  Those girls wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him if he was being aggressive, but once he found his charm, he discovered his social life improved dramatically. \n Now it comes to me, I might be able to use that for a few other things with him. \n The point of this was that just the exercise of keeping behavioral data put me in tune with what was going on throughout the day.  I was able to see changes much quicker than doing an annual assessment, and if I could spot a trend early, I could either promote or suppress things in the environment to enhance positive change.  A body can not do that if they are unaware of what is going on.  Keeping data is the way to increase awareness.  Ideally, a teacher could do this everyday on every student.  But that\u2019s not realistic, especially in a class of 25+.  This is why having trained paras is important because they can help with this while a teacher is delivering instruction. \n Here\u2019s a shocker: I don\u2019t really take data at home.  I have tried to track some things that happen or don\u2019t happen, but for the most part, I believe home should be more relaxed.  I do keep a strict record of finances, but not of behaviors of my family.  The idiot assistant principal at that last meeting actually suggested that I take data at home so they wouldn\u2019t have to do it at school.  Problem is, talking out, being out of his seat, bothering classmates, not doing schoolwork, being off task\u2026.anyone else see a problem with keeping track of these behaviors (which the school is complaining about) at home?  What an idiot.  God help the school she ever becomes principal for.  But at school, as a teacher, I am a voracious data collector.  With the kids I have, it is the only way to know anything. \n One last thing about data collection, and why I like it: \n In addition to paras and teachers improving what they do simply by virtue of keeping track, this also applies to students, themselves.  Students can actually be trained to monitor their own behavior, and  this  is actually the ideal.  Then all the teacher or para has to do is occasionally check for reliability and provide feedback.  The functional goal of any behavioral program is to teach students to monitor and regulate their own behavior.  Teaching them to keep their own data is an efficient way to do this.

{"date": "2006/09/12", "body": "I haven\u2019t been very good about doing homework, lately.  Mainly reading blogs by and for other educators.  And when it comes to blogging, at least 50% of the process should be reading what others are saying.  It\u2019s silly to think I\u2019m the only blogger/educator with anything meaningful to say. \u00a0 Special thanks to  Michele who brought up something about homework , by way of the original  Washington Post article .  First, a thought or two on homework: \u00a0 As a student, I was as anti-homework as a body could get.  I  never  took a book home and  hated  those special projects assigned by various creative teachers.  It seemed like the social studies teachers were the most oppressive, there.  Students were putting together model ships, making home-made waterwheels, putting together miniature Apollo orbiters out of toothpicks and tin foil, or sewing together a 6\u00d76 foot flag.  all of these were made with obvious \u201chelp\u201d from a parent.  Mainly, the parent did it.  My projects were obviously 100% student made.  That means they were shoddy, messy and slapped together hastily.  I grew up milking cows; I had better things to do after school than homework.  \u201cHomework\u201d for me entailed hours of chores, outside, in the weather.  Not that I would have devoted free time to schoolwork at home, anyway.  All homework was tedious, boring and repetitive.  and my parents were not of the mind to fight and argue with me about it. \u00a0 Now, as a parent, Thomas brings home tedious, boring, repetitive homework.  Jane tries to encourage me to get more involved with the boys and helping with homework is one of her ideas.  And it is not a good one.  I can get him to do it, but my heart is absolutely not in it.  I do not see anymore value in doing a bunch of busywork than he does.  He\u2019s inherited his father\u2019s abhorrence for all things redundant, at least in regards to learning.  I think I might actually hate helping with homework with the same passion as I hated doing it when I was in middle/high school.  He knows how to do the stuff and I basically function as task master, making sure he doesn\u2019t get distracted and that he finished before bed.  The boy is only in 1 st  grade!  I agree with Alfie Kohn: kids have better things to do outside of school. \u00a0 As Michele said, teacher education does nothing to prepare teachers in giving homework.  Like discipline, it is an almost inescapable part of teaching and being a teacher.  But it is not explicitly taught or addressed when one is studying about how to do the things that teachers do.  School policies and practices are way out of tune with research. \u00a0 Just to extend on the topic a bit more, I\u2019ll add that private schools may be even more out of touch than public schools.  Homework and study time are integral parts of the private/charter school experience.  The one I taught in years ago mandated that every student be given at least 40 minutes of homework every single day.  That\u2019s for every subject.  And then if they failed a quiz or test (and quizzes were given daily) they were to be given an extra study hall and an extra hour of homework.  Some students had so many extra study halls, that they spent every Saturday at school, all day, sitting in that room at a study carrel.  And no one gave any guidance on the type of homework except to say how long it should take.  Too bad if it took longer.  what was the penalty for incomplete homework?  An extra study hall with an additional hour of homework. \u00a0 I got away with doing less homework as a student because I lived in a rural area.  A lot of my classmates were milking cows before  and  after school (where I only had chores after school) and were often sleeping during school hours.   The teachers had to be somewhat flexible, although they typically regarded us as a bunch of hillbillies. \u00a0 Today, in suburban America, there are expectations and policies that say homework  must  be given and in practice it is usually just busy work.  Sometimes schools try to play the role of social agent by sending work home that actually  requires  parents to participate.  I can think of very little homework sent home with a student in kindergarten that does not require some form of parent participation.  And last year, Thomas had well over an hour of it every single night.  With my poor attitude about homework, it fell on Jane to crack the whip in getting him to do it.  And you can just imagine how she felt about me, and the resentment THAT kicked up. While it didn\u2019t appreciably increase Thomas\u2019 academic skills at all, it certainly did put an even greater strain on a marriage dealing with 2 children with disabilities and the busy schedules surrounding the extra work involved in doing  anything. \u00a0 But the pro-homework folks are not thinking about that.  Everyone thinks that family involvement is all good, and any activities designed to get the family involved should enhance a child\u2019s education.  So schools go out of their way to encourage it, if not try to force it.  But instead of binding a family together, it ends up being a sore spot and a source of stress.  We are working longer hours, driving further to work, with limited quality time with our children.  Now, what little time we have is dominated by squabbles over homework.  Thanks, schools.  Thanks a lot. \u00a0 It\u2019s small wonder that a good percentage of homework is actually  done by the parents.   Let\u2019s just get this crap done, so Johnny doesn\u2019t flunk, and then we can get on with our lives!  The temptation to just grab it and do it just to be done is  enormous!   I feel kind of silly writing each letter of the alphabet 30 times, but I figure that if Jane takes 10 letters, and I take 10 letters and Thomas takes 6 letters, we should all be able to finish before bed time. dick \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/2006/09/if_i_were_queen_for_a_day.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/11/AR2006091100908.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/09/12/thoughts-on-homework/", "title": "Thoughts on Homework"},
{"date": "2006/10/08", "body": "A reader asked me about spanking and it remains one of the most  popular posts I\u2019ve ever  written. \u00a0  I figure about half the folks looking at it are pervs and end up moving on. \u00a0  But I remain amazed at the response all the same. \u00a0 So I figure an update is needed about now. \u00a0 He question was, do I still use it? \u00a0  The answer is no. \u00a0  I\u2019m not saying I will never do it again, but there were some bad byproducts that were totally not anticipated. \u00a0  While Thomas did and still does fall into line around me, the spanking brought on an obsession of sorts for him. \u00a0  The last time he got it was actually in the church parking lot when he started seriously back talking. \u00a0  And then for the next month, when we\u2019re wlking in chuch, he is saying very loudly, \u201cI\u2019M GOING TO HAVE GOOD BEHAVIOR SO I DON\u2019T GET A SPANKING! \u00a0  I SURE DON\u2019T WANT A SPANKING, DADDY! \u00a0  THERE WILL BE NO SPANKING TODAY!\u201d \u00a0 I can just see child protective services ringing my doorbell. \u00a0 It was traumatic for him, which I suppose is sort of the point in a way. \u00a0  He does listen to me better now.  \u00a0 I\u2019m hoping it sticks around but not so much it rules all of his thoughts, you know? After a couple of months, he doesn\u2019t go on and on about spanking anymore. \u00a0  \u00a0 It was traumatic for me, as well. \u00a0  Sure, I know it works but I\u2019m no Ivar Lovaas. \u00a0  It\u2019s not something I want to do every day, every week or every month. \u00a0  Having said that, I will give his arm a squeeze at times while making my point, but that\u2019s about it for anything physical. \u00a0 Jane is convinced that I taught him to hit, which is patently false. \u00a0  The boy was hitting long before I took a hand to his backside. \u00a0  Some things just don\u2019t need to be taught. \u00a0 So, to the reader looking for advice I\u2019m not going to say to do it or not to do it.  \u00a0 But I will say that you might be a wee bit preoccupied with punishment. \u00a0  Change your thinking and turn it around a bit. \u00a0  For instance, church is a traumatic time for Thomas and his brother or any child his age. \u00a0  But sitting still and quiet for extended time is a useful skill and is worth working on. \u00a0  So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. \u00a0  I have a train magazine for him that he is ONLY allowed to look at during quiet time at church. \u00a0  He  lurves  trains and it is a powerful enough reinforcer to get him to fly right for a time.  \u00a0\u00a0 Think about enticement rather than coercion. \u00a0  Give choices instead of threats. \u00a0  These are less traumatic for everyone. \u00a0  And I am SO for less trauma. \u00a0 When spanking Thomas, it basically was a nuclear option resulting in an instantaneous meltdown. \u00a0  There was no more learning, talking, consoling, explaining, teaching that was going to happen for a long time and maybe even the rest of the day.  \u00a0\u00a0 Even longer, perhaps, considering the ensuing obsession. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Every single person out there says that it should be controlled and done without anger. \u00a0  I\u2019m all for the controlled bit, as it is the adults job to be in control. \u00a0  But I\u2019m not so much for the \u201cwithout anger\u201d part. \u00a0  That seems a bit silly, actually. \u00a0  Of  course  I\u2019m angry! \u00a0\u00a0  And registering measured anger is not a bad thing. \u00a0  One of the biggest problems kids have today is the inability to self regulate. \u00a0  They need to learn to regulate their own emotional reactions and modeling controlled anger is one way adults can help. \u00a0  You can even tell them you are angry, and why you are so mad.  \u00a0 Guilting parents for being angry is annoying at best and harmful at worst. \u00a0  And if you are going to make a good and convincing go of spanking you may need some anger. \u00a0  It\u2019s gotta hurt some. \u00a0  The child, I mean. \u00a0  It has to register. \u00a0  I might have tried a mild swat years ago, and it simply did not register at all with Thomas. \u00a0  Fact is, it is has to hurt. \u00a0  No one wants to see their child hurt so the fact that it\u2019s going to hurt you as a parent probably goes without saying. \u00a0  But in order to get past my own issues, I needed some of the anger to muster up the nerve to do it and to do it \u201cright\u201d. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u201cRight\u201d being defined as being severe enough that I would not have to do it again. \u00a0  I\u2019ve seen parents beating their kids repeatedly and that bugs me. \u00a0  I\u2019d rather get one good strong stout swat and be done with it. \u00a0  Make the point once, and it is finished. \u00a0  If it still doesn\u2019t work, then doing it over and over again isn\u2019t going to make much difference accept just help the kid get used to it and require ever more beatings. \u00a0 So I\u2019ll probably get lambasted for this one all over the place, having violated several rules of society, good parenting, behaviorism, the IRB, Good House Keeping, the APA and my own professional code of ethics, except I\u2019m speaking as a parent, not a teacher. \u00a0  \u00a0 Okay, since I\u2019m knee deep, I might as well enjoy the coolness of this squishy substance I\u2019ve waded into: \u00a0 When I was a kid, my mother used a belt on us kids and my Dad used a stick. \u00a0  A stick he made US select. \u00a0  Jane\u2019s mother used a wooden spoon. \u00a0  Some use rulers, hairbrushes, ping pong paddles, tennis rackets, shoes, and other assorted utensils. \u00a0  Some schools have recently returned to corporal punishment and use various wooden paddles, some with holes drilled in them. \u00a0  Some may recall the kid who got it in Singapore with a rattan cane. \u00a0 But I do not advocate the use of such devices. \u00a0  I have used my bare hand every single time. \u00a0  And yes, it hurt my hand every single time. \u00a0  Oh well. \u00a0  It might have actually hurt me more than him, since he had jeans and underwear between my hand and his bottom. \u00a0  But that\u2019s okay. \u00a0  Another incentive to give it one good blow and be done with it. \u00a0  I\u2019m not trying to wear out my hand or his bottom. \u00a0  I am registering displeasure at a behavior that I want to stop immediately. \u00a0  I am expressing intolerance. \u00a0  I am enforcing my will. \u00a0  If my hand is too sore to continue, it is time to stop. And one time is sufficient for me, physically and emotionally. \u00a0 Spanking really is deep water in parenting today, and even moreso with kids with disabilities. \u00a0  In schools, it is deeper water infested with mines and sharks. \u00a0  I can\u2019t believe anyone in a school actually does it now days. \u00a0 For me, it was a very mixed result. \u00a0  I do get tons more compliance. \u00a0  Jane does not, and I\u2019m not sure she could get my level of compliance even if she beat him diligently and daily. \u00a0  There is some real difference in the way fathers and mothers relate to children, and fathers usually can get more compliance if they are motivated to gain and keep it. \u00a0  Even though my own mother was generous in her use of the belt, Dad still was the ultimate even though he only spanked me maybe twice that I can remember my whole life. \u00a0  But that was sufficient, as he made a deep enough impression. \u00a0  That doesn\u2019t mean I was a perfect child but I knew there were lines I dare not cross with him where I might try Mom many more times. \u00a0 I\u2019m not giving advice, I\u2019m stating my one opinion and experience. \u00a0  For kids with autism, they are all different and everyone\u2019s mileage varies. \u00a0  Please apply all disclaimers you have ever seen, read, heard of or dreamed of right here. \u00a0  \u00a0 Dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/10/08/another-word-or-two-about-physical-punishment/", "title": "Another word or two about physical\u00a0punishment"},
{"date": "2006/10/09", "body": "A while back, I made a post using the term \u201cComment Whore\u201d which is a term designed to generate a bit of emotion and reaction. \u00a0  I would define a comment whore as someone who is putting out content with the express intention of getting lots of comments. \u00a0  I suppose there is a kinder, gentler name for this practice, but I\u2019m not sure what it is. \u00a0  I know of at least one blog out there, that this is all she does. \u00a0  She asks questions to her readers like, \u201cWhat if you were a pencil, what would life be like?\u201d \u00a0  or \u201cTell about any goal that you had as a child that remains unfulfilled.\u201d \u00a0  And she gets tons and tons of comments. \u00a0  Some of the posts are shallow, some are deep. \u00a0  Most of them do really provoke some thought. \u00a0  \u00a0 It\u2019s what she does, and she does it exceedingly well, generating hundreds of comments. \u00a0  \u00a0 Another blogger just happens to have a huge enough and interested enough readership that she can generate 100 comments just by writing about mayonnaise. \u00a0  Seriously. \u00a0  I could not believe it myself and left her a comment telling her so. \u00a0 Bloggers  lurve  comments. \u00a0  The ones that say they don\u2019t care are lying. \u00a0  But I will say that when my comment box exceeds 10 comments, I get really nervous. \u00a0  It\u2019s sometimes a good nervous but sometimes bad. \u00a0  If I happen to look at the number and it is too large, I\u2019m wondering what the heck is going on! \u00a0\u00a0  Did I offend some group? \u00a0  Did I start a fight somewhere? \u00a0  Usually, it is because  Liz  has posted my URL on some other prominent board or to some group or linked to me somehow, which results in this dramatic spike in readership. \u00a0  If I was making money from this thing, I would seriously have to put her on the payroll. \u00a0 There is a price to be paid for generating a lot of comments, and not many bloggers are keen to pay this toll. \u00a0  Namely, many of the comments are going to be critical, angry, nasty screeds that will flatten a body\u2019s ego. \u00a0  In the above mentioned mayonnaise controversy, there was more than one flame on the person\u2019s character about her treatment of mayonnaise packets. \u00a0  This was a ludicrous waste of bandwidth, which is why I left a comment flaming the flamers for being so petty and shallow. \u00a0 I accept that most people who read will not comment. \u00a0  It takes awhile for most bloggers to really and truly accept the fact that most readers who like reading don\u2019t always feel like saying much. \u00a0  I subscribe to many more blogs than appear on my blogroll, and RSS does not lend itself to commenting, especially since I do my reading offline. \u00a0  I like the fact that several people have found things that I have written to be helpful and encouraging and I know that is the case because I do check stats and see what people are reading. \u00a0  \u00a0 I can say definitively that comments and other blogs have helped shape my thinking on many things. \u00a0  By reading a few blogs by regular education teachers, I get a feel for what their days are like. \u00a0  I know I am not alone by reading blogs by other special ed teachers. \u00a0  I am also encouraged and inspired by reading blogs written by parents and by the people themselves who have disabilities or different abilities. \u00a0  In fact, reading blogs by people on the autistic spectrum has shifted my thinking mightily in the way I look at efforts to cure and treat autism. \u00a0  I\u2019ve found a fair number of these through comments , either here or on other sites. \u00a0  Even nasty critical comments give me cause for pause, and get me to think about where I am at, mentally just before I delete them. \u00a0  \u00a0 The biggest key to getting comments is to leave some. \u00a0  I think almost every blogger will follow a commenter back to their place if they have one and leave the link. \u00a0  Another step is to answer back and respond to comments. \u00a0  I try to do this, but I am not always so good about it. \u00a0  Sometimes I get to it and sometimes I don\u2019t. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u201cComment Whore\u201d is a pretty tough label. When it comes write down to it, all of us who blog are \u201cAttention Whores\u201d of one sort or another. \u00a0  \u00a0 Why else would we post stuff out on the internet for all to see? \u00a0 Dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lizditz.typepad.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/10/09/a-few-comments-on-comments/", "title": "A Few Comments on\u00a0Comments"},
{"date": "2006/10/19", "body": "Mine is not a political blog, and I have eschewed taking political sides all \u2018round. \u00a0  I will take aim at specific policies, such as NCLB and the alternate assessment or the highly qualified requirements and the testing and other crap that goes with it. \u00a0  As far as I\u2019m concerned, neither political party has done any favors towards education and specifically kids with disabilities. \u00a0  At the time the Education for All Handicapped Children Act was first passed, the bill was passed by a democratic congress and signed by a republican president. \u00a0  Since then, we have seen presidents and congressional delegations from both parties come and go. \u00a0  Jimmy Carter was a democrat whose own party was in congress, as was G.W. Bush a nd then presidents who the opposite was true. \u00a0  There is no configuration of the political branches that has or will come along and do much more for my kids (as a father and teacher) than has already been done. \u00a0  At NO TIME has the federal government ever fulfilled more than a fraction of the financial obligation they promised (and keep promising) under IDEA. \u00a0  EVER. \u00a0  NCLB was a  bipartisan  bill, and was actually crafted in 1997 by both parties, long before we had the present administration. \u00a0  G.W. Bush can take the blame, since he was dumb enough to want to take all the credit when it passed. \u00a0  You will not see that one fully funded in your lifetime either. \u00a0  Congress has never seen a pledge or a promise that wasn\u2019t worth breaking. \u00a0  \u00a0 Right now the republicans have both houses of congress and the White House, and they still can not get anything done. \u00a0  For the record, I am pretty conservative. \u00a0  While I have voted Republican many times, I have also switched my vote up between parties before, including third party candidates. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019ve even sent money a time or two to a political candidate I liked. \u00a0  Only do this if you enjoy getting lots of junk mail from every two-bit politico in need of funds. \u00a0  I\u2019ve moved 3 times since my last donation and the buggers STILL find me! \u00a0 This election, I am really thinking of staying home. \u00a0  The school board race was actually decided in the primary. \u00a0  The other local races are more or less in the bag. \u00a0  There are no real controversial referendums on the ballot. \u00a0  In the governor\u2019s race, I like both candidates equally as much which is to say I loathe each one equally. \u00a0  The congressional race is apparently a hot one in my district, as the attack mailings and ads have been pretty pointed. \u00a0  I have gotten mailings from some republican operatives from some other state, raging on this guy which the democrat rails back. \u00a0  This annoys me. \u00a0  I might favor some traditionally republican issues, but I do not favor any extremism or shrillness from either party. \u00a0  I like a reasoned, moderate voice. \u00a0  Am I the only one who gets annoyed at the sniping, nagging, harping, niggling, smacking going on? \u00a0  I\u2019m not going to pick on the democratic party, because frankly it wouldn\u2019t be as interesting as reading a real democrat criticize their own party. \u00a0  I would really like to see a liberal critique his/her own party on a few things. \u00a0 So I\u2019ll be a conservative and criticize the traditionally conservative party for a bit, while keeping an eye on the whole bunch. \u00a0  IOW, any loathing I feel towards republicans can be multiplied by some random integer greater than 1 and applied towards the opposition. \u00a0  \u00a0 The main tipping point that spawns this screed is the failure of S. 843 or house version HR 2421 to be moved out of the house committee for a vote. \u00a0  I understand that the  Combating Autism Act  might be somewhat controversial, but it perfectly illustrates the idiocy of the republican party. \u00a0  This has passed the senate and has been supported or co-sponsored by some 227 representatives; this bill is a sure winner. \u00a0  However, there is a republican congressman from Texas who refuses to bring it up for a vote unless HIS legislation on NIH reform is brought up to a vote. \u00a0  The speaker of the house and majority leader of the house have refused to intervene. \u00a0 This is the way business is conducted in Washington. \u00a0  And don\u2019t say it would be any different if the opposition were in control, because I\u2019m not that na\u00efve. \u00a0  This is the way people get, no matter who they are, when they get too much power. \u00a0  \u201cTo hell with what the people want, you are going to do what *I* want!\u201d \u00a0  Like the democrats in \u201992, the republicans in \u201906 are too fat and bloated for their own good. \u00a0  \u00a0 The whole country needs an enema, and the democrats might just be the people to deliver it. \u00a0  The republicans have not given me a good reason to get out and pull their lever. \u00a0  OTOH, the democrats have all but promised to take more of my meager salary by repealing the tax cuts if they get control. \u00a0  On one hand, if I vote for the opposition, this comes off as looking like an endorsement of their agenda which looks to me like \u201cimpeach Bush and it will all be better.\u201d \u00a0  OTOH, a vote for republicans tells them that they must be doing things right, and to keep doing what they are doing, which is spend $2 for every $1 they get from me. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019m not willing to do either. \u00a0  I\u2019m not impressed by the latest scandals nor the reactions to them. \u00a0  Washington is full of slick crooks and this time around they can do it without my vote. \u00a0 In fact, why don\u2019t they include \u201cNone of the above\u201d as an option for each election and each race?

{"date": "2006/10/26", "body": "This GAA stuff just gets better and better. \u00a0  I thought I would be managing Taz\u2019s assessment and could devote all my time and energy towards him. \u00a0  But it\u2019s never that simple, is it? \u00a0  I\u2019ve actually been assigned another student to head up, as well as being assigned as a consultant on 3 other student committees; Mr. Pyle\u2019s students. \u00a0  This means I\u2019ll probably have to do them. \u00a0  Actually, each student has a committee of around 6 people assigned. \u00a0  The committee has a caseload manager, a facilitator, and a regular education teacher from science, social studies, ELA and math. \u00a0  The assigned regular ed. teachers are all very, very young and I\u2019m not sure they have any idea what they are in for. \u00a0  But if they know their  Georgia  Performance Standards  (GPS) that\u2019s all that is important for me at the moment.\u00a0 Also have a look at their section devoted to  severe kids .\u00a0 If you look very carefully, you\u2019ll notice something: there\u2019s precious little there, aside from the bloody forms and worksheets we have to turn in.\u00a0 I looked at the samples for high school ELA which are very very few\u202610th grade.\u00a0 10th grade?\u00a0 Who gives a  shit  about TENTH grade?\u00a0 We need ELEVENTH GRADE, you stupid ignorant knobs!\u00a0 11th grade is the grade in which we have to turn in all of those stupid forms!  \u00a0 I had this wild idea that it might be useful to have some collaborative space on the internet for all of us to kick ideas around and perhaps even solicit more input from other teachers around the county and even around the state. \u00a0  I\u2019m not at liberty to use my blog space, and it wasn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind. \u00a0  But I knew someone on my blogroll had been into this sort of thing. \u00a0  Sure enough,  Reflective Teacher  is forever using collaborative tools and technology. \u00a0  I thought  PBwiki  would fit the bill, and looked at  his. \u00a0  I got all registered and began editing my first page when the f#$&!&*@ sonic wall slammed shut, blocking access. \u00a0  So, I\u2019ll be bugging the  county   IT  people about getting us into the 21st century. \u00a0 We are on a pretty hard lockdown, out here in the sticks. \n \u00a0 Anyone out there using  Tiddlywiki? \u00a0  I discovered this little gem while on my search for a tool, and see a lot of potential in it. \u00a0  What I don\u2019t see is a way to add a discussion forum or comment section to it. \u00a0  Otherwise, it could be just the thing. \u00a0  We do have a network folder just for all the teachers in the school. \u00a0  I might throw it out there and see if any of these younger teachers can bring it to heel in serving our purposes. \u00a0 \u00a0 And the GAA drama will continue. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.georgiastandards.org/", "http://www.georgiastandards.org/", "http://www.georgiastandards.org/impairment.aspx", "http://thereflectiveteacher.wordpress.com/", "http://thereflectiveteacher.pbwiki.com/", "http://www.tiddlywiki.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/10/26/supplying-a-laugh-track/", "title": "Supplying a Laugh\u00a0Track"},
{"date": "2006/10/16", "body": "\u00a0 Let\u2019s face some facts, here. \u00a0  I.Q. does matter when teaching kids, no matter how we would like to pretend otherwise. \u00a0  True, flaws abound in such testing but there gets to be a point where such testing is barely even necessary. \u00a0  And all of the students I teach fall into this category. \u00a0  They fall right on through the floor on most standardized testing instruments. \u00a0  Those tests do not have standardized scores low enough for my kids, because they are in the bottom 1% of the population. \u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019ve been asked by a few teachers about the Georgia Alternate Assessment (GAA), and I am going to discuss my dealings with that specifically as we progress through the process. \u00a0  Our district is behind. \u00a0 But I wanted to talk about alternate assessments in general and specifically how they interface with NCLB. \u00a0  \u00a0 NCLB has the stated goal of 100% of all children performing on grade level by 20013. \u00a0  The idea is that by 20013, all of the students who started at the time the law was passed will be graduating, and from then on, every child in school with be under those same rigorous standards. \u00a0  There are a host of problems with this, relating to genetics, the bell curve and standards. \u00a0  However nowhere is this exposed as the joke it truly is, as much as with kids like the ones I teach. \u00a0  I teach the rock bottom. \u00a0  These are kids who can not talk, can not feed themselves and some can not even swallow. \u00a0  They are nearly all in diapers. \u00a0  \u00a0 It reminds me of the  episode of the  Partridge Family   when Danny was drafted into the Army. \u00a0  Everyone knew this was a joke, except the military who insisted it was not a mistake. \u00a0  The gag was that this large, bureaucratic dinosaur of an organization could not recognize reality in spite of itself. \u00a0  Danny went in and got his physical and went through the whole thing, even though he was obviously just a child. \u00a0  \u00a0 We hear stories about this all the time, as small children, family pets and even dead people are given credit card applications. \u00a0  When it comes to large organization run by red tape, common sense is not so common. \u00a0  That\u2019s what makes them a good target for jokes and sitcoms. \u00a0 The problem is this: \u00a0  The DOE is every bit as humorless and bereft of common sense as the DOD. \u00a0  Fact is, is they are totally and absolutely sober and serious about their intentions that my students will be able to demonstrate some level of proficiency in 11th grade high school subjects. \u00a0  They are neither joking nor laughing and will hold the entire school hostage to that belief under the guise of making AYP. \u00a0 Now I am not saying that my students can not learn. \u00a0  They can and they do! \u00a0  However, due to a variety of neurological factors, it takes upwards of 500+ trials over a hundred or so sessions for them to learn a new skill that they are only halfway interested in learning. \u00a0  The average high school student is expected to learn it in less than 30 trials over maybe 5 sessions before they are tested for mastery. \u00a0  Over the course of a decade of instruction, hopefully they get many more trials and sessions to become proficient in reading, writing and basic mathematics. \u00a0  But my students have not had that instruction. \u00a0  We\u2019ve been working on getting them to feed themselves, speak, walk, use the bathroom, and wipe their own butts. \u00a0  We do work on counting money and identifying coins where possible. \u00a0  But Algebra has not been a high priority. \u00a0 The alternate assessment has historically aligned with the functional nature of our curriculum. \u00a0 We take IEP goals and measure mastery from there.  However, this year, presumably with IDEA 2004 and NCLB supposedly in alignment, IEP goals are either thrown out or must align to the grade-level curriculum. \u00a0  \u00a0 Let me reiterate that for parents: all the work you do trying to fight for the school to provide certain services is actually being undermined by NCLB. \u00a0  Because if you have certain goals you want worked on, and the school is under the gun to make AYP, which one of these is getting the resources and attention? \u00a0  Which one of these do you think the principal is going to put pressure on the teacher to do? \u00a0  You might want your child to learn a vocational or daily living skill that may help them live more independently. \u00a0  The school does not care because your child needs to demonstrate some level of proficiency in algebra, geometry, reading comprehension and writing. \u00a0  And these are not bad things to know, except that it takes these kids so long to learn something that the time might be better spent directly on a given skill, like dressing themselves. \u00a0  This is why we have IEPs in the first place. \u00a0  But the push and rush for AYP makes kids in special education ripe for discrimination that IDEA was supposed to remedy. \u00a0 My kids used to not even register on administration radar because the alternate assessment was based on IEP goals I picked. \u00a0  And I always picked goals the kid tcould handle for AYP purposes. \u00a0  But now they have to come from the regular 11th grade curriculum, NOT the IEP. \u00a0  \u00a0 I have a question for you all: How many of you would feel good about an 11th grade curriculum that my kids could pass? \u00a0  Think about it. \u00a0  You do not have to be able to read, write, or count. \u00a0  Is THIS the standard you want to set? \u00a0  Are THESE the standards that NCLB is striving to set in order that our nation can compete in a global economy? \u00a0  Trying to make my kids fit regular curriculum standards is going back to the days of discrimination. \u00a0  Trying to fit everyone else\u2019s curriculum to my kids does a disservice to ANY standards. \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 There\u2019s a very good reason why they don\u2019t make saddles for pigs or milking machines for chickens. \u00a0  They just don\u2019t work so well. \u00a0  Not everyone is equipped to do the same things. \u00a0  My kids are not going to college. \u00a0  Why would I want to subject them to more frustration and indignity than they have already had to endure at the hands of a public that misunderstands them, at best, and abuses them at worst? \u00a0  And yet, the DOE is hell bent on doing it. \u00a0  They insist on taking a kid, for whom just taking a shit is a challenge, and subjecting them to tests of reading comprehension, writing, algebra, geometry, world history and physical science. \u00a0 I can think of no greater evidence that NCLB is a total loser than this farce that is being made with MY students. \u00a0  My students have a whole lot more to offer the world than the sorry slobs in  Washington  or  Atlanta  who think they are going to save this country with their \u201cmore rigorous\u201d standards. \u00a0  I may be accused of throwing out the baby with the bathwater on this, but NCLB is a study of self-corruption and idiocy. \u00a0  It will fail and implode because of the immoral abuse that is being inflicted upon students who are the least threatening to anyone. \u00a0  That 1% of students who can not, even with the most major of modifications and adaptations take a standardized test. \u00a0  Imposing standards that try to even look remotely similar is an insult to both my kids, and the regular education population who has to really work to pass that test. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 What this new alternate assessment is going to boil down to, is how we as a collective group can best lie, cheat and otherwise hoodwink our way through so that it isn\u2019t us who is responsible for our school not making AYP.\u00a0 My kids do not deserve this level of scrutiny.\u00a0 I\u2019ll gladly make video tapes of me teaching them relevant goals according to the curriculum set forth together with parents.\u00a0 I\u2019ll do that everyday, all day long.\u00a0 But this business of holding us to grade level is ludicrous beyond words, and is in serious need of a laugh track.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 Stay tuned for more. \u00a0dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cmongethappy.com/eguide/ep04.htm"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/10/16/taking-shots-nclb-and-alternate-assessments/", "title": "Taking Shots: NCLB and Alternate\u00a0Assessments"},
{"date": "2006/10/23", "body": "Pretend that I posted this a week ago! \u00a0 Today was the training for Georgia Alternate Assessment (GAA) for a bunch of us in the high schools. \u00a0  A bunch of administrators were also there, thus reinforcing the seriousness of all of this. \u00a0  At stake is AYP. \u00a0  It took Magnolia High School all of 2 years to get off the needs improvement list and no one wants to go back on it. \u00a0  No teacher, including me, wants to be responsible for the entire school not making AYP. \u00a0  The special ed administrator and the testing administrator were both there as well as administrators and the severe teachers from other high schools. \u00a0 The Big Boss, our county special ed coordinator was the main trainer although other county education administrators were in on it. \u00a0  This was not the first training, as middle and elementary school teachers and administrators have gone through this earlier. \u00a0  However the anxiety level amongst participants had to be noticibly higher, as evidenced by the frustration of the presenters. \u00a0  And this is justifiably so, because of the gap between performance of some students and the grade. \u00a0  For instance, the presenter wanted to use 3rd grade examples because that is what the knobs at the state department used. \u00a0  The difference between a student functioning at an 11 month old and an 8 year-old is very significant. \u00a0  However it is nothing compared to the gap that exists between a student functioning at an 11 month-old level and a 17 year-old. \u00a0\u00a0  This is the distance many of us high school teachers have to jump. \u00a0  Elementary and middle school teachers are not necessarily getting a bargain here, but we are talking about getting someone functioning no higher than preschool meeting the same standards as the high school graduation test. \u00a0  Granted it is the GEORGIA high school graduation test, which can only be so rigorous. \u00a0  But there are still some pretty high standards compared to what most profound kids are used to meeting. \u00a0 I had a chance, during a break, to talk to the secondary special ed coordinator who used to be at the state DOE when they were rolling this out. \u00a0  She just came out and said that the folks in Atlanta really had no thought of the severe and profound kids when they were developing this thing. \u00a0  They were thinking more about kids who were reading on a 2nd or 3rd grade level; kid who were simply way behind, not kids who were lower than a preK level. \u00a0  The thought just never occurred to them. \u00a0 The morning consisted of loads and loads of discussion about the procedures, all of which were outlined in something called a \u201cProcedures Manual.\u201d \u00a0  The procedures consisted of what order to put the paperrs in, when they were to be submitted, which forms we were to make copies of and which ones we were forbidden to make copies of. \u00a0  Each subject was to have its own folder and its own cover sheet. \u00a0  Each had to be clearly labeled. \u00a0  They went over what the evidence was we were to use, primary and secondary. \u00a0 I was sitting between the two other high school severe teachers in the county. \u00a0  The Southside teacher, who is new this year, was remarkably creative and seemed to adapt quite nicely. \u00a0  This was the first time I had a chance to spend a lot of time with her, and she is pretty sharp. \u00a0  The Northside teacher, OTOH, was having teething problems with this entire process. \u00a0  I know the kids he has to do this for, and he has a tough job ahead of him. \u00a0 In the afternoon, we broke into groups and the 3 of us worked together to work out plans. \u00a0  And there were some good suggestions that came out of that, and I have a good outline of a plan. \u00a0  Fortunately, much of it includes things I am already doing or things that can be done fairly easily. \u00a0  My biggest challenge is the area of reading comprehension. \u00a0  How do you demonstrate reading comprehension to someone with the reading comprehension skills of a 2 year-old with 11th grade materials? \u00a0 I\u2019ll share more details of what I\u2019m doing as I go along. \u00a0  Anyone else out there following along? \u00a0  I\u2019ll take any suggestions for 11th grade ELA teachers. \u00a0  In the meantime, I\u2019ll be consulting some from my own school about the materials and standards that are being used. \u00a0  Maybe I WILL turn Taz loose in one of these classrooms!LOL! \u00a0  No, we are averaging one teacher who quits per week at this school as it is. \u00a0  No sense in further increasing the attrition rate. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/10/23/training-for-gaa/", "title": "Training for GAA"},

{"date": "2006/03/06", "body": "School bus drivers are among the most little recognized personnel on the school payroll.  They are the first to see the kids in the morning and the last to see them in the evening.  A regular school bus driver can haul in excess of 70 students in a single load.  Many drivers run more than one load at a shift.  They\u2019ll pick up the earliest starters, drop them, and then pick up a later starting school.  Then they\u2019ll run the same route in the afternoon. Most buses are not air-conditioned, which is a genuine hardship here in Georgia.  The hottest place in the state is behind the wheel of a school bus.  In the winter, drivers have to get up extra early in order to start and defrost their buses.  Often, buses break down or there are traffic accidents that cause delays.  The result is the bus drivers are frequent targets of abuse by parents, students and teachers.  Other motorists don\u2019t particularly respect the power and strength of a bus and often are trying to pass them by, cursing them for doing what they do, which is stop at railroad tracks and to pick up children. School bus drivers are some of the best, most caring and compassionate folks you will ever want to meet.  They really and truly care about the children they carry, and take their responsibility very seriously.  They are the real unsung heroes of any school system. Having said that, bus drivers are also not always the most educated especially in the behavioral sciences.  These caring folks can often get caught up in behaviors and they often take personal offense when students say hurtful things to them.  So they end up arguing with a kid bereft of any logic in the first place. The folks driving the short buses are just as, if not more than, caring.  In our county, special ed. buses have a driver and a monitor.  This is because it is all but impossible for a single person to operate the lift and unload a wheelchair.  Often, if a child is having problems, the bus drivers and monitors are our first point of contact.  Since they talk directly with the parents, they usually know things we do not, not the least of which is where the kid lives.  Some of these kids live in some very rough neighborhoods.  Raising a special needs child is often expensive and it can be difficult holding down a full time job with all of the medical issues involved. Today I was informed that They wanted to kick Charlie off the bus because he spits.  Charlie isn\u2019t trying to be mean; in fact he blows these over-sized raspberries when he is in a good mood.  But the other students, the bus drivers and monitors don\u2019t appreciate this about him.  So they filed a complaint with the county office about his spitting.  The folks at the bus shop don\u2019t know who Charlie is, so they assume he is being mean and malicious.  Charlie doesn\u2019t care who is around when he spits.  Put him in a corner and he will spit all day if he\u2019s in the mood. The intervention for Charlie\u2019s spitting basically involves holding one of those dust/allergy masks over his mouth and nose.  He usually stops spitting immediately.  Whether this lasts or not, depends.  If he\u2019s happy, he\u2019ll start again.  If his hands are free he will pull the mask off.  So I usually hold his hands which makes him less happy.  So stopping Charlie\u2019s spitting involves making him a bit less happy.  I can also redirect him by clapping and getting him happier to where he is laughing.  He can\u2019t laugh and spit at the same time.  Since the people on the bus are not happy about his spitting they generally opt for the unhappy intervention. But the fact is, it is part of Charlie\u2019s disability.  Since he can\u2019t talk to himself, he spits.  Ever meet someone who enjoys listening to themselves talk?  This is what spitting is for Charlie.  Sometimes I ignore it and sometimes I intervene.  When I do intervene, Charlie knows I\u2019m not playing and he generally stops.  It\u2019s gotten to where all I have to do is show him the mask, and he\u2019ll stop.  But I\u2019m going to have to talk to the bus people to get them to properly handle it.  They bring up all sorts of safety concerns about bodily fluids and such but and they have a point.  But a body has to work with them before kicking them out.  This goes for teachers and bus drivers.  Hopefully, I can train them a bit and we can arrive at an understanding. dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/03/06/buses/", "title": "Buses"},
{"date": "2006/03/15", "body": "I was just reading an excerpt from  Dana Buchman\u2019s book ,  A Special Education . This is about her journey as she discovers her daughter has dyslexia, attention deficit disorder and other learning problems. As I was reading this, I kept wondering when I would read something new and intriguing. The excerpt basically tells about her starting off on a successful career and then how she had a rough transition into motherhood. Hello?!? There really is no story there. I don\u2019t know of any mothers who ever really and truly were prepared for their transition into being a parent. Exceptional or not, having a baby around changes a person\u2019s life dramatically. Coach and his young wife are expecting their first child, and everyone tells him his life is going to completely change. He says everyone keeps telling him that, and he has gotten a bit tired of hearing it. But it is true that life does change and it is also true that no matter how much other people tell you, you never really truly get it until it happens to you. Nothing in Buchman\u2019s except compels me to buy and read her book. Maybe if I see it at my local library I\u2019ll check it out. Learning disabilities and ADD are relatively mild along the disability spectrum, and are relatively common. I\u2019m sure every parent has a compelling story to tell when it comes to raising their children, and those raising children with exceptionalities especially so. From where I\u2019m sitting, Buchman came into the world of disabilities relatively late. The day Thomas was born, I spent it in the NICU with him, and even he was luckier than the preemies who were living there. Eight months later, we were in the hospital again as he had suffered multiple seizures. By the time Buchman discovered something was wrong when her daughter was around 3, we were already well into the world of disabilities. By the time Thomas was 3, we were well initiated into the brave new world of Autism. But of course, I\u2019m not a famous clothing designer with my own label. But anything that gives more airplay to those with exceptionalities is a good thing. Maybe the more people know and understand about it, the better they will act around them. We can all stand to learn a bit more compassion. Just to highlight a bit more, my son Thomas has a small cavity. It\u2019s not hurting him, but Jane still wants to get it worked on. Leave it to her, as the daughter of a dentist, to find it. In any case, if Thomas needs to have it worked on, he will probably require general anesthesia and have it done in a hospital. There\u2019s just no way to work inside the mouth of kids with such severe sensory issues with any degree of safety. Just the sound of the drill would be enough to turn him into a wild person. It takes two people to hiold him down just to give him a haircut, and the boy weighs about 65 pounds! It is allergy season here in Georgia, and metro Atlanta is Allergy Central. A pollen count of 100 is considered high, and we often have readings in the thousands! It is around 200 last I heard and rising. Most individuals with allergies to pollen manifest it with eye, nose and throat irritation, they can get sinus headaches and may have trouble sleeping. Presently, my symptoms (if I have any) are very mild. There\u2019s irritation, but I do just fine without medication. Jane, on the other hand, is miserable despite being constantly medicated. Both of my sons also have allergies, and are also on antibiotics for strep throat. My students have various ways of manifesting their allergies. A few might have watery eyes and a runny nose. But some also manifest their allergies with an escalation in various behaviors. For instance, Spaz doesn\u2019t eat and drools more than usual. He also will act out more aggressively with a lot more hitting than usual. Taz gets a runny nose, but gets more hyperactive and defiant. Charlie just acts totally spaced out and will probably have several breakthrough seizures before the season is finished. But we are still relatively drama free for the moment. I can handle sickness, drooling and even just a little aggression; at least from the kids. It\u2019s mostly the adults that tangle me up! D.

{"date": "2006/03/19", "body": "In a  prior post , I did a small review of an excerpt of a book  A Special Education by Dana Buchman . A couple of things have developed out of those few lines. One is that I happened to hear an interview with Ms. Buchman on the radio program  The Satellite Sisters . As a parent, I could identify with much of what she has gone through in raising a child with learning disabilities. Ms. Buchman\u2019s story, as she says, is a narrative of the emotions behind the journey. The other thing that fell out of my little review was a comment from Ms. Buchman\u2019s publicist offering me a free copy of the book as well as a copy of a book on autism by Stanley Greenspan. As much as I\u2019d love to accept, I\u2019ll have to decline those generous offers. If being anonymous wasn\u2019t such a big deal for my blog, I\u2019d be more tempted. I also still haven\u2019t started reading my signed copy of  Robert and Lynn Koegel\u2019s book on pivotal response training! Dr. Stanley Greenspan will get a post of his own in the future, especially if he gets some sort of buzz going. \nFrom what I\u2019ve gleaned from Ms. Buchman\u2019s excerpt and interview (Nice publicity work, Ms. Warren!) her book will interest parents of young children with disabilities, and may even become a source of inspiration and courage for them. However, it\u2019s important to note that Buchman was (and still is) a woman of considerable means when going through her experience. She could afford a private school, private therapies and interventions. The emotional journey she went through will be recognizable but other experiences may be less universal. And then I did notice that  Liz at I Speak of Dreams  linked over and  gave it some treatment . Or at least her commenters have. Go on over there and see what she and her readers think. That, as much as anything, prompted me to give a more thorough look at the topic. After doing still more reading on the topic than I ever intended to do, I have decided that Ms. Buchman isn\u2019t quite the publicity hound I might have originally thought. In fact, proceeds from her book are being donated to the  National Center for Learning Disabilities . You can read an interview NCLD did with her  here . Okay, so I feel like a bit of a flake for snapping to such a quick judgment of a book I haven\u2019t even read. Maybe that first chapter wasn\u2019t the best one to feature, or maybe I have entirely too many personal biases to give her a fair and impartial treatment. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ldorg-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0738210331%2Fqid%3D1138806610%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155", "http://www.satellitesisters.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557668191/sr=8-1/qid=1142814771/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0186180-0956738?%5Fencoding=UTF8", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2006/03/the_life_that_c.html", "http://www.ncld.org/", "http://www.ncld.org/content/view/855/480/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/03/19/re-doing-a-special-education/", "title": "Re-Doing \u201cA Special Education\u201d"},

Teacher who was representing language arts, myself (acting as GAA caseload manager) and the facilitator, who is in serious need of a name. \u00a0  I\u2019ll call her Ms. Van, since it\u2019s nice and short. \u00a0 My God. \u00a0  \u00a0 I got a bit of background from Ms. Van, who is acting facilitator for all 15 GAA students, meaning that she is attending all 15 meetings. \u00a0  She did not volunteer for this, she was drafted like the rest of us were drafted. \u00a0  But her job is compounded by the fact that committee members were asking questions for which she had no answers. \u00a0  Who is going to be teaching the student? \u00a0  What happens next Semester when this student won\u2019t have the same classes? \u00a0 As case manager, I did try to give as much direction as I knew how to do. \u00a0  GAA has been my life for over a week now, and is quickly claiming the lives of many others. \u00a0  It is a growing cancer that is infecting more and more people. \u00a0  It\u2019s somewhat comforting to know that the chaotic madness is nationwide and not  strictly confined to Georgia. \u00a0  But this particular student, unlike Taz, has some academic abilities and can actually read above the 3 rd  grade level. \u00a0  He simply lacks motivation. \u00a0  When we get to collection period 2, we\u2019ll have a bit of a motivation session. \u00a0 So we basically did for this kid what we should have done last week for him; pick out the standards, the strands, the elements and the tasks. \u00a0  This meeting was supposed to last an hour and there some very, very impatient people wanting to get out of there. \u00a0  Sadly to say, they were special educators. \u00a0  \u00a0 I wish I could say I walked out of there feeling good about what was accomplished. \u00a0  Frankly I\u2019m not sure we accomplished much of anything. \u00a0  One big hurdle was assigning the assessment and teaching tasks. \u00a0  Another was that very few of the standards were aligned with the IEP goals and objectives although I was surprised to see that the ELA standards were fairly closely aligned. \u00a0 There is a lot of work to be done and we only have about 6 more weeks to do it. \u00a0  \u00a0 NCLB really sucks. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://virginiasol.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/10/30/its-going-to-be-a-long-year/", "title": "it\u2019s Going to Be a Long\u00a0Year"},
{"date": "2006/05/01", "body": "\u00a0 Most of those of you that have IEPs (either students, parents or teachers) have probably already had them as May is late in the year to conduct these things.\u00a0 But due to the way or department is organized, I have the majority of mine late next week and LEA Mr. Pyle's and some others the week after that. \u00a0 Preparation for an IEP begins long before the meeting, and indeed, long before an invitation is sent or before a date is set.\u00a0 There are several different triggers that result in an IEP taking place: \u00a0 1. An annual review \u2013 this is the most common, as the law states that IEPs must be reviewed annually.\u00a0 For the majority of students in sp. ed, this is the most common reason to have an IEP and it is the only one they will have during the year. \u00a0 2. New eligibility: In a growing county like ours, whenever a new student comes in, they go through an eligibility process.\u00a0 Most of the time it is a review of previous records and they determine eligibility from that.\u00a0 Then we have an IEP to determine placement and ratify the eligibility.\u00a0  \u00a0 3. New referral \u2013 There are two ways a student gets referred in.\u00a0 One is from the early intervention program at the age of 3.\u00a0 The other is through the school's own student support team (SST) process.\u00a0 The IEP represents the end of the SST process which is long and comprehensive.\u00a0  \u00a0 4. Parent request \u2013 According to IDEA, a parent can request an IEP at any time for pretty much any reason.\u00a0 If the parent wants a meeting, the school has to conduct one. \u00a0 5. Change in placement \u2013 If the student is going to a more restrictive environment, especially because of behavioral problems, an IEP must be conducted.\u00a0 Major changes in services can also trigger an IEP. \u00a0 There is also something called an IEP Addendum, which is only slightly less involved than a full-blown IEP.\u00a0 It is usually used to make changes to an existing IEP and carries the full weight of an IEP. \u00a0 An IEP is essentially a piece of mini-legislation that governs the child's education program. It sets up the who, what, how and where of a child's education.\u00a0 Any disputes will turn, hinge and depend on this one document.\u00a0 Services written into the IEP MUST be provided.\u00a0 I've written a bit on this in the past, which you can read about in the archives in the  IEP category .\u00a0 I'm going to talk primarily about annual reviews as the procedures are pretty much the same for all of them. \u00a0 I'm preparing for the annual review all year long, taking data and collecting work samples (if any) and assessing progress based on previous IEP goals and objectives.\u00a0 I fill out progress reports every 9 weeks, and check which goals have been mastered.\u00a0 As the annual review approaches, I'll do some sort of standardized assessment.\u00a0 Most of the time, this is an individual achievement test but I do an adaptive behavior assessment since my kids are too severe to score above the floor of achievement tests.\u00a0  \u00a0 Finally it's time to set a date and prepare invitations.\u00a0 I usually do this several weeks in advance.\u00a0 I have a lot of contact with parents so I'll usually ask them for a preferred date and time.\u00a0\u00a0 Then I prepare a list of invitees to the IEP.\u00a0 It's at this point  Ms. B  got in trouble.\u00a0 If she had a list and had invited everyone who needed to be there, at least she would have had some reports to share.\u00a0 These need to be sent out to participants as soon as possible so they can prepare ahead of time. \u00a0 My objective is to have the thing finished 2 days before the meeting so the parent can look at the draft.\u00a0 A parent can then make correction and additions.\u00a0 The point of this is to help the parents arrive prepared, as well as shorten certain portions of the\u00a0 meeting so parents and other professionals can spend their time on what is most important. \u00a0 Then it is time to actually sit down and write the thing.\u00a0 I'll talk about each section in turn, but this is an overview: \u00a0 1. Student information (name, Address, telephone etc.) \u00a0 2. Present level of performance (PLOP) \u00a0 3. Present level \u2013 special considerations \u00a0 4. Behavior Intervention Plan \u00a0 5. Modifications and Accommodations. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  6. Goals and objectives \u00a0 7. Transition Plan \u00a0 8. Service options and placement \u00a0 9. Transportation. \u00a0 10. Individual Healthcare Plan (IHP) \u00a0 11. Extended school year (ESY) \u00a0 Basically, the IEP is driven thus: Currrent functioning \u2013> Goals and objectives\u2013> Service options and placement.\u00a0 Most folks are anxious to jump to placement, but it doesn't work that way.\u00a0 Placement is driven by goals and objectives which are driven by current functioning. \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/05/01/the-iep-process-preparation/", "title": "The IEP Process:\u00a0Preparation"},

{"date": "2006/05/04", "body": "After going over the present level of performance, we have a form that asks several questions.  Does the student have vision impairments?  Does the student have a hearing impairment?  Does the student require assistive technology?  All of theses are addressed in a separate section which is an add-on to the  PLOAP .  The other question is; does the student have behaviors which interfere with his/her learning or the learning of others?  Answering \u201cYes\u201d to this question means that there must be a behavior intervention plan (BIP).   Of all of the sections of the IEP, this one gets abused and misused more than any other.  Since IDEA 1997, Functional Behavior Assessments (FBA) are required for students with behavior issues.  In Magnolia County, they have interpreted that as meaning only those students going through or likely to go through a manifestation hearing.  This means that the vast majority of BIPs have no FBAs associated with them.  This is a serious problem.   My son, Thomas, has a BIP that I wrote for behaviors globally known as \u201coff task behaviors.\u201d  Mostly getting up out of his seat, talking to his neighbor, making noises and wandering around the room.  Teachers often put a shopping list of interventions in the BIP including redirection, reprimands, time out, keeping him in from recess and those who are more sophisticated may include rewards for being on-task or a token system.  But unless the function of the behavior is known, interventions are hit or miss, and have a big chance of failure.   Basically, behaviors are driven by either access or escape.  Access to attention (either peer or adult) access to preferred items or access to sensory stimulation.  Escape from demands is the most common escape function, although escaping from peers, adults or sensory overload is also likely.   An intervention designed for access behaviors which are used by the student for escape are going to make behaviors worse.  For instance one student used to beat the crap out of us during lunch.  Hitting, kicking and scratching are efficient behaviors for both access and escape.  In another setting, he would use aggression to get adult attention.  In the lunchroom, he was aggressive in order to escape the noise and over stimulation.  The interventions used for his aggression were different according to the function.  We put the escape aggression on extinction and gradually shaped him into staying in the cafeteria for longer and longer periods. He likes the lunchroom today because we made the environment more reinforcing by getting him some friends that he didn\u2019t have access to anywhere else.  Once his desire for peer attention kicked in, we saw aggression drop to nearly zero, because aggression is usually incompatible with having friends.   For Thomas, the \u201coff task\u201d behaviors are also multiply controlled by both access and escape.  By making access contingent on completion of work this helped\u2026sometimes.  But impulse control is often a problem in children, so such contingencies don\u2019t always hold.  Other cues and signals as well as a richer schedule of reinforcement can provide additional support.  And we\u2019re trying the Concerta, but the BIP is independent of that.  Unless the school has a doctor on staff and/or is willing to pay for it, they can only keep data that reflects his performance on or off the drug.   Behavior Intervention Plans should be specifically tailored to the behaviors of the student and the functions of that behavior.  As such, ALL BIPs should be supported by an FBA.  BIPs should be reviewed each year to evaluate effectiveness.  In the case of Spaz, the aggression has nearly disappeared but now we see more self-injurious behaviors.  So, his FBA and BIP are going to have to be entirely overhauled this year.    Fun times\u2026NOT!  It\u2019s a lot of work putting an FBA together because it involves amassing a lot of data.  But it will be worth it in the long run.  An FBA can remain in effect as long as the functions and behaviors exist.  Spaz has had the same FBA for 4 years.  Now that we\u2019ve effectively treated the behaviors, it\u2019s time for a new one targeted other ones that are troublesome.   When Thomas\u2019s teachers started complaining about his behaviors earlier this year, Jane started getting worried and concerned.  So I told her to ask them one question: \u201cAre you following his BIP?\u201d  The complaints stopped.  The entire IEP needs to be a ready reference and resource for teachers and parents.  A properly written BIP will state the functions of the behavior, definitions of behaviors, include positive supports, contingencies and consequences.    Parents should pay close attention to this plan and have extensive input into that as well as the FBA.  If there are disputes about your child\u2019s behavior, the first questions are going to center around whether the BIP is being followed.  If it is not, this is the quickest route to problems with the school.  If the student is threatened with suspension or expulsion, the BIP becomes a major factor.  Failure to adhere to the BIP can increase a school\u2019s liability.  Remember, the IEP is like a piece of legislation.    Could parents write a BIP?  Without knowledge of school policies and regulations, it would be difficult.  Plus it is helpful to have an understanding of applied behavior analysis and positive behavioral support.  I\u2019m not talking about the Lovaas stuff, I\u2019m talking about systematic observation and application and using data to design interventions that improve outcomes for students.  However, there are a fair number of special ed. teachers writing these things with not much more background knowledge than many parents.  If a parent thinks he/she can do a better job, I say give it a shot.  The committee may be able to work with it and improve on it.  Parent input is crucial regardless of who actually writes the BIP.  A good plan that is put in place can save problems later on, as it should contain steps for teachers to follow if problem behaviors continue or worsen.   dick Back to the index ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/05/04/iep-process-behavior-intervention-plan/", "title": "IEP Process: Behavior Intervention\u00a0Plan"},
{"date": "2006/05/03", "body": "  Before deciding on where a student should be going in the coming year, it\u2019s important to know where they are starting.  The Present Level Of Performance (PLOP) is the section of the IEP where the nature of the disability is described and how it effects the student\u2019s educational performance.  In the written narrative it is important to give a picture of the student\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.  Even though I\u2019m going to have most of these students next year, the possibility remains that they could move, I could move or they somehow end up with a new teacher.  Being thorough in this section can save a future teacher a lot of time trying to figure the student out.  Other agencies, such as social security, Medicaid, doctors and any courts involved in guardianship proceedings will also find this information useful.  Included are recent test scores, grades, number of objectives from the previous year mastered, medications taken, medical conditions and diagnoses.  This is why having private therapist and medical reports in hand can make this part go easier.   OT, PT, SLP and hearing & vision services should also have input into this.  For my students, there are also other concerns.  Can the student feed themselves?  Can they talk?  Do they wear diapers?  Are they susceptible to infections or other health problems?      This is where we put parent concerns, and there should be something written there to at least indicate it was addressed, even if the parent has no concerns.  If the parent indicates on the invitation that they will not be attending, the case manager should make some attempt to ask them for some sort of input.        As a parent, I frequently write my own version of this, and indicate that it should be included with the IEP.  Remember, this is what will eventually drive services and placement.  If you want the student to get OT and speech services, make sure to include something that indicates that the student has needs in this area.  Private assessments can be helpful, and the school must take those under consideration.  Placement is also driven by the student\u2019s needs and present level of performance.     A good example of this is my oldest, Thomas, and his need for typical role models to reinforce social skills.  He functions academically 2-3 grade levels above his peers.  But there are a lot of behavioral and maturity issues that will hold him back.  So early on, we pushed for full inclusion, noting in his PLOP that he imitates peer behaviors.  Putting him in a class of those with severe behavior problems would be disastrous for him.  So, as a parent, make your case for the services and placement you want here, instead of waiting until that section of the IEP meeting comes along.  By that time, it is too late.  Lay the groundwork early on for what you want.   There is one other bit a parent can add in this section, since it is the most free form of all the IEP sections.  If you have concerns or dissatisfactions to register about the current placement, services or situation, register that here.  Put it in writing and make sure that it is included in the IEP.  If there are good things happening, put those in as well.  You can reward the good things and punish the bad right here.  But it is important to put it in writing ahead of time.  Parental input in this section, at the beginning, can turn the tide and change the mood of the entire meeting.  As a parent, set your tone and agenda here and now.  I\u2019ve done it a couple of times in the past, and it has probably set Thomas up for a few years as the staff all know I\u2019m serious and those notes are still in his files.        The PLOP is the foundation of the rest of the IEP, and it is the first and best place for parents to make their stand for their children.  And parents, after all, are the best source of information about their children.   For that reason, it is in a teacher\u2019s best interest to have as much parental input as possible.  And having parents actually write some of their own portions make the IEP a much more valid and collaborative document; the way it was meant to be.  Inviting parents to write tbeir own PLOP narrative can be tremendously positive and empowering for them, but it might also be intimidating.  So, to at least give parents a fair shot, the PLOP is a prominent part of the draft parents are getting in advance from me.  I have only had a couple of parents correct what I wrote in the PLOP.  I\u2019ve had none who wrote their own.   One other aspect of this is worth noting, that I have not covered previously:  I have assumed involvement by both teacher and parent.  However, at the age of 18, all rights transfer to the student.  And for higher functioning students, having them write their own PLOP contribution might be tremendously instructive and enlightening to everyone.  There is a movement afoot to let students take the lead on their own IEPs.  Getting them to take greater ownership of their own IEP might produce better outcomes. \u00a0 [Update:  Here is a wonderful example of a parent/attorney adding his own documents for inclusion in the IEP  by Charles Fox.\u00a0 Go download his examples and it should give parents a LOT of direction on what to include.]    dick Back to the Index ", "outgoing_links": ["http://specialedlaw.blogs.com/home/2007/03/a_memorable_app.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/05/03/iep-process-present-level-of-performance/", "title": "IEP Process: Present Level Of\u00a0Performance"},
{"date": "2006/04/04", "body": "\u00a0 If you really and truly want to know whether or not autism is an epidemic, don't read  this article .   But if you want to read it, go ahead.  But don't blame me if you come away confused and angry. \u00a0 Basically, a researcher says that he found that an increased classification of autism was matched by a decreased number of students classified as mentally retarded and learning disabled.  This was true for every state except California, where there was an apparent rise independent of the other classifications. \u00a0 But he also says that prevalence might actually be higher than what is indicated by special ed. statistics. \u00a0 Actually, the Shattuck study does support one thing that I've known for quite some time.  Basically that special education statistics are not a good indicator of anything.  As pointed out in the Seattle Times article, autism wasn't even counted as a disability at the federal level prior to the 1992 IDEA reauthorization.  Not all states use the same diagnostic guidelines and even within districts it can vary. \u00a0 Case in point:  In the state of Georgia, students with any developmental delay has a diagnosis of SDD until they are 7.  SDD = Significant Developmental Delay.  In Magnolia  County, there were precious few students who came through the eligibility process with the \"Autism\" eligibility.  A medical diagnosis and an educational eligibility are entirely different and one is not necessarily related to the other.  Just because the child's neurologist diagnoses your child on the autistic spectrum does not mean the school automatically makes \"autism\" their eligibility. \u00a0 When our oldest, Thomas, went through last year, he did end up with the autism eligibility by virtue of not fitting anywhere else.  But the neurology report was never a real deciding factor.  He wasn't behind academically.  In fact he was ahead.  It was the behavioral/social issues that got him there. \u00a0 Read the  CDC website  to learn how they get their prevalence data, which apparently is from more than one source. It is this data that is going to drive public policy decisions. There are a couple of other recent studies done on this topic, accessed by Pub Med, which you can read the abstracts of  here  and  here . \u00a0 I remember my own doctor asking me about this supposed epidemic.  \"Do you really think it is growing like some people say, or is it a matter of better detection or is MR and LD now being called something else?\" \u00a0 I think it is all of the above.  I do know of several high school students diagnosed MR who probably would be more accurately diagnosed on the autistic spectrum.  I have seen a number of adults get diagnosed with aspergers as adults.  But I've also seen autism hit families like ours at an increased rate.  While we may all be on the spectrum somewhere, the prevalence of kids with developmental delays has been on the rise.  No one even knew what autism was 10 or 15 years ago.  I didn't.  I had classmates who were in special education.  But autism was seen as very, very rare.  But look around.  Everyone knows  someone  who has autism.     It simply is not the rarity and oddity it once was. \u00a0 Parents will not be very receptive to this article/study, and with good reason.  It seems like no matter what parents do or say, someone out there is going to come 'round and tell us all that we're crazy.

{"date": "2006/05/05", "body": "  The behavior intervention plan will likely contain some accommodations and modifications related to the students behaviors.  However, the accommodation and modification summary is geared specifically to teaching and learning.   Accommodations and modifications are not the same.  Accommodations are designed to enable the student to access grade level content and stay on the same track as peers.  Modifications basically alter the expectations, lowering content standards.  My students with severe disabilities are on an alternate and functional curriculum, which is a major modification from the regular state curriculum of Georgia Performance Standards everyone else has to follow.  The state is in the process of aligning its alternate assessments with these standards, so that even our kids are supposed to be working on some grade level things.   Crazy, I know.   But for students who are not as severely disabled or involved, accommodations rule the day.  I\u2019m including a link to some good material covering  accommodations  that reflects  current policy and practice  and is aligned to both NCLB and the latest IDEA.   I\u2019m keeping this section short for a couple of reasons.  One, is that it is not one that I have to deal with regularly.  Others can speak on it with more authority than I can.  Also I want to spend more time and energy on the goals section.    This is not to say accommodations and modifications are unimportant.  In fact, this section of the IEP often results in more contention and litigation than any other.  This is the section of the IEP that often impacts regular ed. teachers the most.  Accommodations are NOT optional for teachers.  I have heard of them being somewhat optional for students, in that they often choose not to take the extra time or take advantage of extra support in their accommodations.  But it is up to the case manager to make sure a student\u2019s teachers know what the accommodations are.   A while back, there was some discussion as to how to word these things.   Coach Brown  advised  making the language as vague as possible.  As a behaviorist, that really goes against my grain.  The problem with ambiguity is that no one will know what the expectation is.  If the teacher interprets wording of the accommodation one way and the parent another, you are basically asking for a judge\u2019s intervention in the matter.  For instance, \u201cextra time\u201d; does this mean days, hours or minutes?     Being vague on this score is asking for trouble from a contentious parent/student.  Specifics protect everyone involved from abuse of the system by teachers, students and parents.  Once it is written and signed, this is what you all have to live with.  When I LEA an IEP for students with mild disabilities, I make sure to question the regular education teacher regarding the accommodations in order to determine how reasonable they are and if they are adequate and effective.  As special educators, we often don\u2019t have a very good sense of what works for regular ed. teachers.  Having some detail might help give more novice regular ed. teachers (who seem to often end up with the most involved kids) some direction and guidance as to what to do with these students.  Therefore, if you are a regular ed. teacher serving students with IEPs, the accommodations section of the IEP is your most crucial component.  Special educators need to make sure to solicit input from regular ed. teachers who are attending the meeting here, if no where else, since regular educators often are a bit dazed and confused when it comes to IEP meetings.   And who can blame them?  I\u2019M often dazed and confused with the whole process!   \u00a0  dick Back to the index         ", "outgoing_links": ["http://edtech.kennesaw.edu/intech/accommodations.htm", "http://education.umn.edu/NCEO/OnlinePubs/NCLD/Accommodations.pdf", "http://ukiahcoachbrown.blogspot.com/2006/02/special-education-free-lunch.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/05/05/iep-process-accommodations-and-modifications/", "title": "IEP Process: Accommodations and\u00a0Modifications"},
{"date": "2006/04/04", "body": "April is Autism Awareness Month, and this Saturday there will be an autism walk sponsored by our local autism support group.  Last year's walk, which was the first ever, was postponed because of rain, and yet was still a success.  This year, the school system has joined in the effort to sponsor and support it by getting the word out to more people.  The stated purpose of the walk, besides raising awareness, is to help raise money for the training of teachers and staff in the Magnolia  County school system. \u00a0 I'm always leery of teacher training on autism.  First, most of these workshops spend the majority of their time sharing characteristics of individuals with autism.  This is fine, for the first few times of going to a workshop.  But I've been to several, and this is a major part of each and every one.  At some point, we need to move on to what to do with these individuals. \u00a0 Second, 99% of the participants are teachers.  Again, this is fine but in the majority of cases, the first line of adult instruction is not the teacher, it is the paras.  Para educators are responsible for more and more of the instruction for individuals with autism, for either good, or ill.  Micheal Giangreco did a series of qualitative studies looking at para training and behaviors and discovered that the paras were in sore need of training in regards to the specific disabilities for which they were delivering services.  There's where some training in characteristics could come in handy, as paras frequently identify behaviors as being belligerent and oppositional rather than being a legitimate part of the disability.  Students who are included often receive para support, and more often than not, those students with paras become more ignored by the classroom teacher. \u00a0 For those paying attention, you'll notice that I'm a bit crazy about para support and training. \u00a0 Once we get beyond characteristics, we get into the nuts and bolts of instructional strategies.  And this area is fraught with a  myriad of pitfalls .  What strategies should be taught?  It should be obvious that they should be strategies supported by peer reviewed research.  Which is mostly going to be behavioral strategies.  If I only had one day to do training on interventions, I would teach nothing but behavioral training with graduated (least-to-most) prompting along with data collection.  It is possible to teach this in a single day, or even in just a few hours if I'm teaching a small enough group.  It's versatile enough to work with communication, daily living and academic skills. \u00a0 Only if I have time to burn will I teach something more relationship-based, like floortime or social stories.  Social stories have the virtue of having a broader research base, while floortime doesn't require a very high skill level.  I have successfully gotten high school students to do floortime type activities with our lower functioning students.  While I'm not sold on it as an efficacious intervention, it doesn't hurt anything and keeps student volunteers engaged instead of just sitting around.  The same is true of paras, altho I generally expect them to do more sophisticated interventions. As I've posted before, everyone has some sort of pet intervention.  The first few years teaching, it was all I could do not to throw the OTs out of the room when they started going on about sensory integration therapy, with the brushing, the weighted vests, swings and joint compressions.  Again, I'll do them if I have time to burn, which is rare.  I'll let the OT train a para in this if they want, but I've never gigged a para for NOT doing it.  We'll do everything else on the IEP before resorting to this pseudo scientific intervention of dubious worth. \u00a0 Another neglected area of training involves dealing with parents of students on the autistic spectrum.  I know of no single disability category with more energetically charged parents than this group.  They can be hell on wheels, if not given proper respect.  They are getting their information from the internet, each other and newsgroups or listserves.  So job #1 is directing parents towards better sources of information.  The Autism Society of America is sometimes good and sometimes bad as a clearing house of information. \u00a0 At last year's autism conference, a parent asked a speaker where she could read current research on individuals with autism.  He suggested the  Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis  (JABA) .  Small wonder, since he was the editor of that journal at the time!  While JABA has good research (second to none in ABA) and often covers the subject of autism, that isn't the best place to go for parents.  It's gotten increasingly technical over the years, and the focus is exclusively ABA in orientation. \u00a0 A better choice for good, readible research in autism is  Focus on Autism and other Developmental Disabilities  (FOADD) .  While still having space for behavioral studies, they have published different designs and even qualitative studies on parents perceptions on services, video modeling, social stories, potty training and GFCF diets just to name a few.  It's very well-rounded in its approach and is peer reviewed.  Jane, who is not educated in the field per se, would often snatch it out of the mailbox when it came and I'd have to hunt it down. \u00a0 The Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions  (JPBI)  is another research journal I would recommend ahead of JABA.  Topics covered here seem to cover a much more practical orientation that those covered by JABA.  While not specifically geared towards autism, it is covered at least as much as in JABA.  It still contains many behavioral components, but is not as heavy or technical as studies submitted to JABA. \u00a0 Teachers of individuals with autism should be aware of the interventions that parents are considering, such as the special diets, chelation therapy, sensory integration therapy and others.  Chances are good that some teacher, some where, is confronted with a parent who has heard of and is sold on the  LindaMood Bell  system.  Some orientation to these other interventions could be beneficial for teachers, as a shrug of the shoulders hardly engenders credibility. \u00a0 Training educators on autism and all of its facets is an ambitious and daunting task.  It is more than just making them aware of what autism is and its effects. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba/", "http://www.proedinc.com/focus.html", "http://www.proedinc.com/jpbi.html", "http://www.proedinc.com/jpbi.html", "http://www.lblp.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/04/04/69/", "title": "Autism Awareness and Training\u00a0Educators"},
{"date": "2006/05/06", "body": "I suppose a lot of readers are getting rather bored and fatigued by this IEP series. Guess what? Writing these things is no picnic, either! Is it any wonder that case managers look for shortcuts while doing these things? Goals and objectives are what are going to drive the students\u2019 placement and services during this coming year. While a BIP is the most abused part of the IEP, the goals and objectives are among the most neglected. My youngest, Percy, just had his IEP and while the objectives are different, the criteria for mastery and method of evaluation are all exactly the same; 3/4 opportunities and teacher observation. All the way down. Most teachers simply mark in 75-80% all the way down for criteria. This pretty much renders the objectives as written in the IEP as useless. Because when progress reports come out, teachers are going to eyeball the objective\u2019s progress and make it up as they go out of the air. Let\u2019s take a sample goal of increasing academic skills and the supporting objective of reading sight words. \u201cThomas will read 10 sight words.\u201d The criterion is at 80% and method of evaluation is teacher observation/data collection. What direction does this give Thomas\u2019 teacher next year? All it says is that he will read 10 words with 80% accuracy. So does he master the objective the first time he reads 8 out of 10? And how is the teacher tracking this? Let\u2019s turn this ugly duckling around. Thomas is still going to read 10 words, but now the criteria for mastery is to read 8 of 10 words over 5 consecutive sessions. Now I have a much better idea of what mastery really looks like. And I\u2019m going to evaluate progress using discrete trial data. Now when it comes times to teach this, I know discrete trial is the format of choice. My objective now has the components of a lesson plan. How about a different goal: Thomas will remain on task for 20 minutes. His caseload manager will put in 80% and have \u201cdata collection/teacher observation\u201d as the way to evaluate progress. That objective is all but useless. I have absolutely no way to tell whether he has mastered this or made progress or gotten worse. And there\u2019s no hint of how to teach him to stay on task. The teacher is simply going to pull something out of their posterior in order to say he has mastered this by the end of the year. It is a joke. If you are a parent, look at your child\u2019s goals and objectives in their IEP. If they all have the same criteria and have the same method of evaluation, you are being sold a worthless bill of goods. If they all have a mastery criteria of 80% and nothing else, the goals are rubbish. \u201cTeacher Observation\u201d is shorthand for \u201cpulling results out of my posterior.\u201d \u201cData collection\u201d is shorthand for \u201cpulling a pencil out of my posterior and using it as a magic wand to make results appear by magic.\u201d If you are a special education teacher and trying to skate by on this, you are wasting your time. It may seem easier to do this, but in the long run you are going to pay dearly. You can not teach from this, much less evaluate how your teaching is working. It\u2019s better to have a few well-thought out objectives than a dozen haphazard ones. So how can we redeem this objective? Certainly, staying on task and attending are worthy goals if a student has difficulty with this. Think. How long are they attending now? Chances are, you don\u2019t really know. It varies, depending on the task. A student may attend for hours on the computer or video game, but not be able to remain on-task for 5 minutes for written seat work. So let\u2019s concentrate on seat work. Okay, you\u2019ve already improved your goal! \u201cThomas will remain on-task during independent written seat work.\u201d Now you know when to observe. Not during circle time or recess, but during those times he has to be sitting down and writing something. Now think some more. Is 20 minutes too long? For younger students, it might be. If he is having serious problems, 5 minutes might be more realistic. But we\u2019re going to find out. How are you going to figure out how well he is doing now? You are are probably going to want to time him. Think again. Take a 5 minute session and divide it into 30 second intervals. During each 30 second interval, he is either sitting and writing or he is off-task. Track how many intervals he is on-task versus off-task. Let\u2019s say he is off task for half of those intervals. You now have a good idea of how to write this goal. We can still use 80%, but we need to be more precise. Think about how you will get him from 50% to 80%. \u201cThomas will remain on-task for 5 minutes with nonverbal prompts and cues.\u201d The criteria will be 80% of intervals over 5 sessions and the evaluation method will be using interval data. Now when you revisit that IEP 3 or 4 months from now you not only know what to teach but have some idea of how you teach and measure it. Making mastery over several sessions gives a better indication of true mastery rather than a whim. If he does master this you can either extend the length of time or up the criteria from 80% to 90%. Teaching special education involves a high level of sophistication and expertise. Some knowledge of data collection and precise teaching methods is crucial to writing meaningful goals and objectives. Parents, much of this may seem like Greek to you. But if I present you with an Excel graph of your child\u2019s progress, you will be able to see how your child is doing and anyone can see how quickly or slowly your child is getting it. Success is everyone\u2019s goal, but monitoring and measuring it is the job of the teacher. That\u2019s why the good folks in the county pay us what they do. You also see why I don\u2019t like vagueness. This is why we end up with these stupid tests and calls for accountability from the Feds, because of sloppiness that serves no one. The problem with these tests is that they do not measure ongoing progress. If they fail a test in 3rd grade, they will be tested next in 5th grade after 2 years and after being handed off to 2 different teachers. But at least the tests give some degree of accuracy at a given point in time. In special education, the process needs to be continuous with some degree accuracy. And those folks being pulled off the street with no training have no idea of how to do it. Unfortunately, most parents do not have the level of expertise necessary to correct sloppy objectives, much less write good ones of their own. But what they can do is demand accountability. When mastery of previous goals is discussed, ask to see supporting data, such as data sheets and/or a graph. Better still, you might consider asking for these during progress report time. A teacher making stuff up will be forced to either fly right or they will have to make even more stuff up. And making up data is not as easy as it sounds. You will probably be classified as a \u201cproblem parent\u201d and might not get a Christmas card from your child\u2019s case manager. But you will end up with a better IEP. As a teacher (or teacher wannabe) putting this extra thought and effort in the IEP today will help you teach better in the fall. You reap what you sow, and sowing garbage in the spring will yield more garbage in the fall. One other reason to put this level of work into your objectives is that all of them will comply with alternate assessment criteria. They are supposed to be well-defined and  measurable . ALL of them need to be measurable and thinking about how to measure them will help write a better goal. Writing IEPs is a difficult process. I\u2019m not trying to make them more difficult as much as making them more meaningful. Right now, the way most objectives are written, they are rubbish and an absolute waste of time. D.

Damned if I know. But the fact of the matter is we might never know for sure what some mentally and developmentally disabled people comprehend and what they do not. HELLO?!? \u00a0 This is the problem with bringing in busloads of people who are looking to park for awhile without having made any substantial investment in the field.\u00a0 First off, they are not sure what a good intervention and a bad intervention look like.\u00a0 And then, even if they see one that looks promising (like the use of edible reinforcers) they have little idea of how to properly implement it, monitor the progress or to adjust it.\u00a0 Janet was doing what she was told, which is what you do when you don\u2019t really know what to do.\u00a0 You rely on others who apparently do know what they are doing to tell you.\u00a0 And then you keep on doing it until someone tells you to stop doing it, change it or do something else.\u00a0 At least Janet kept doing the edible thing.\u00a0 Most would have quit and gone back to not doing anything.\u00a0 Finally, they never really get to know their kids and what they can do or not do because they leave and pursue their \u201creal\u201d interests after 1-2 years, leaving the kids to the next noob who comes in and needs a place to park their bus until something better comes along.\u00a0  \u00a0 So we have a couple of choices.\u00a0 One, is my co-teacher, Mr. Pyle, who can\u2019t really do anything else and is just trying to make it to retirement or we have these other folks who come through on their way somewhere else.\u00a0 And this is exactly the sort of place education, as a whole, is headed if we continue towards so-called reform which is really a sort of de-professionalization of the field.\u00a0 Part of the idea of any preparation program is to weed out the nonhackers and the unmotivated.\u00a0 Do you really want a doctor operating on you who hasn\u2019t been through some degree of rigor, or is just there until something more lucrative comes along?\u00a0 No, you want a professional who is dedicated to that profession.\u00a0 You need a divorce lawyer who is dedicated to winning divorce suits, or an accountant who is dedicated to properly filling out tax forms.\u00a0 You want someone there who has dedicated themselves to what it is they are doing.\u00a0 The greater their investment in the form of blood, sweat and tears, the more likely they are to stick to a job, even if it is difficult.\u00a0 If I am sending a behaviorally challenged child of mine to school, I want teachers who are willing to stick with him.\u00a0 I want experience and dedication.\u00a0 I want someone who can inspire confidence. \u00a0 And that is not someone who is just hanging out until they either find something better or until retirement.\u00a0 As a parent I\u2019m somewhat passionate about this, and as a teacher I\u2019m even more about it.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019m getting grouchy in my old age, but while I like helping new, young teachers, I get a bit weary of spending time on someone who bails out after just a year or two.\u00a0  Maybe if they spent some time actually preparing to teach, they would have some idea of whether or not this is something they want to do before actually taking over a classroom. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theartofgettingby.com/2006/04/shock-to-system.html", "http://themagicschoolbus.blogspot.com/2006/04/carnival-of-education_12.html", "http://themagicschoolbus.blogspot.com/2006/04/carnival-of-education_12.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/04/12/parking-it-in-special-ed/", "title": "Parking it in Special\u00a0Ed."},

She spends her days in a Provo High classroom with 10 teenagers who have multiple, severe disabilities, and she said the No. 1 quality required for the job is simply the will to do the work.  \"It definitely does take some patience, but probably the biggest thing is just the want to be there, the desire to be there,\"  \n Davis  said.  She teaches a similar constellation of students that I do, at least by the sound of it.\u00a0 And passion and desire are very necessary components of the job.\u00a0 Hopefully that inner fire will result in learning to become proficient.\u00a0 Desire and passion are certainly necessary, but not sufficient.\u00a0 As the article goes on to state: \u00a0 Ted Kelly, director of special education for the Provo City School District, called  \n Davis  \"a guardian angel.\" But teachers like  \n Davis  are getting harder for districts to come by. \"We have seen over the years that our veteran teachers are retiring, and as our new teachers come in, they just don't stay in the profession very long,\" Kelly said. He said he usually needs to fill four or five special education positions every year, but next year he projects he'll have 10 spots to fill.  Paperwork, federal requirements and stress can make the job frustrating, Kelly said. It requires \"an internal quality that I think people have that are tolerant and caring and that kind of thing \u2014 balancing that between the education and the skills to really individualize for students' needs, along with handling a great  deal of stress.\"  Good article, relatively short and worth a read. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theartofgettingby.com/", "http://www.theartofgettingby.com/2006/04/its-hard-out-here-for-pimp-teacher.html", "http://www.theartofgettingby.com/2006/04/shock-to-system.html", "http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/174421/", "http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/174421/", "http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/174421/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/04/17/before-moving-on/", "title": "Before Moving On\u2026"},

My 3.5 year old will be entering kindergarten in the fall of 2008. He has high functioning autism, possibly asperger\u2019s. I\u2019m convinced I would have been diagnosed as a child based on the DSM today, but of course I never received a label. Do you think my son would be better off starting school without the label. He doesn\u2019t need speech help, perhaps some intensive OT, but I am concerned that the label may in someway be used against him by teachers unable to handle an active boy. What are your thoughts? I bring this up because you wrote that the schools are now actually rewarded with funding for inclusion so maybe I don\u2019t have anything to be concerned about. \u00a0 This sounds a lot like my youngest son, Percy. \u00a0  He was evaluated at the age of 3, and was found eligible for some services at that time under the significant delay label, including O.T. \u00a0  In fact, OT was the main service although he did go to a special preschool 2 days a week for half days but stayed in his regular church preschool the other days. \u00a0  The fact is, is that your son could be eligible for services NOW, and if all he gets is OT, now is a good time to start. \u00a0  \u00a0 And this is what I think most professionals and other parents will tell you. \u00a0  Go to the school board office, ask to see a coordinator for special needs preschool and see if they can do an evaluation. \u00a0  They\u2019ll tell you if your son is eligible and for what services he is eligible. \u00a0  Medical diagnoses will be considered, but the education system will want to do their own thing. \u00a0  If he is found to be eligible, the Special Needs Preschool (SNP) coordinator will explain the process for getting him services. \u00a0  These do not have to be full-time. \u00a0 Here\u2019s the deal: you really do not want to wait until kindergarten to go through this. \u00a0  If your son has delays, you need to know NOW. \u00a0  If he is significantly behind now, he will continue to get more and more behind over time. \u00a0  The problem is this accelerated curriculum that is going on around the country. \u00a0  I harp and grouse about NCLB, but this has been going on for 15 years where the curriculum is drifted into lower and lower grades. \u00a0  Kindergartners are expected to enter in knowing colors, shapes, numbers and letters. \u00a0  They will begin simple reading and simple math and will begin writing. \u00a0  It truly is much more intense than it was when you and I were going through school. \u00a0 Also there is the whole social skills business. \u00a0  Fortunately my youngest has really picked up quickly from being around more typical peers (instead of his brother who is definitely high functioning autism) and might not even need anything but OT next year. \u00a0  But students are expected to sit still, do lots of work and to generally behave coming right in. Most children will since they were in preschool or daycare prior to kindergarten. \u00a0  Jane and I (mostly Jane) has worked very hard to make sure both our boys get as much social skills exposure as they possibly could and as early on as we could stand it. \u00a0  \u00a0 I usually advise getting the services as soon as possible. \u00a0  It is far and away easier to be discharged from a service than to try to get in later on. \u00a0  Percy\u2019s OT evaluation took several months, and he did eventually get qualified but did not qualify for speech which we were sort of really hoping for. \u00a0  Today, it is obvious he doesn\u2019t really need it. \u00a0  Thomas qualified for speech, OT and PT at the beginning but we were eventually able to discharge him from PT. \u00a0  But I kept him on PT consult for an extra year, just because I knew that getting back in would be very difficult. \u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t worry about the label being used by teachers to exclude your son. \u00a0  What it might do is help obtain some help and eliminate some grief. \u00a0  Teachers are becoming increasingly educated about autism thanks to the parents who blazed the trail ahead of you. \u00a0  The label might help them access some knowledge and adaptations for him where they might otherwise be prone to labeling him with a behavior disorder or even bad parenting. \u00a0  Yeah, some teachers still like to lay it all at the feet of parents. \u00a0  Sometimes it belongs there and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. \u00a0  \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://morethanalabel.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/11/14/a-reader-question-to-label-or-not-to-label/", "title": "A Reader Question: to Label or Not to\u00a0Label?"},
{"date": "2006/11/13", "body": "The battle rages on. \u00a0 Last week, I was able to get a few things on video for GAA collection purposes.    Taz is such a spastic, the baseline data is going to be relatively easy to do.    Getting him to actually demonstrate learning; well that\u2019s another story entirely.    Sometimes he can and sometimes he can\u2019t.    Fortunately I have a few more months to worry about that. \u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if anyone else has collected anything or not.    Mr. Pyle is managing 3 students and he teaches none of them.     So he\u2019s going to have to be getting up on other teachers to collect the data.    This is also what I\u2019m going to have to do with a student who I was assigned to who I have never laid eyes on.    In event that we get crunched for time, I can adapt UP tasks that I\u2019m using for Taz.    It seems easier to take something simple and make it more sophisticated than the other way around.    But maybe that is just me. \u00a0 I am afraid that my students will master very few of their IEP goals this year, because of this state mandated circus.    I can and will involve other students in the GAA activities but remember that the Georgia standards bear no resemblance to actual IEP goals and objectives.    At least not for my students who are on a purely functional curriculum.    I have 18 months to get Spaz potty trained.    18 months to get a 21 year-old autistic kid to successfully use the toilet in hopes that he MIGHT have a shot at group home living down the road, but my time is being soaked up by this other crap.    But then, there seems to always be something demanding more time and more urgency. \u00a0 And right at the moment, it happens to be the December FTE count.    FTE = Full Time Equivalency which is basically the way services are funded in special education.    While many will argue that this count does not affect funding, don\u2019t be fooled.    FTE always affects funding and it always will.    It is the process of counting the number of students in Special Education and the number of hours of services each student receives.    It is sorted out by exceptionality, grade, age and number of hours in regular vs special education.    Actually ALL students are counted in a FTE count, but regular education students are pretty much grouped by age and grade.    It is the special education kids that create counting nightmares.    For instance, Ravi gets half an hour of speech, 2 hours of adaptive PE and the rest of the time is allotted to Profound intellectual disability (PID) services during a typical week.    Simple, right?    Well, he also gets consultative VI and PT services.    He also requires in a bus with a wheelchair lift.    Plus he goes into the community for about 4 hours per week.    All of these factors are also counted in the FTE.    \u00a0 Some students spend only part of their day in special education, so their FTE is going to be less than my students who are in special education the whole day.    Unless they are in the community, and then they get credit for being in a \u201cregular\u201d environment.    There has been some studies done in Georgia regarding funding and some reforms have been made in order to encourage more inclusion.    Funding clearly drives many, many decisions in education and special education in particular.    For instance, in Georgia the funding formula is weighted based on disability.    It is assumed that some students (like mine) will involve more time and money to be educated than someone with a very mild disability, like a speech impediment requiring a couple of hours of speech per week.    In other states, the funding is the same no matter what the disability is.    LD students are funded the same as PID students.    In Georgia, OHI students get funded more than EBD students and Autism is not even funded separately but under the OHI service code.    What this means, in Georgia, is that when a child\u2019s eligibility is considered, it makes much more sense to label and serve a student under OHI or Autism than it does for EBD because of the way they are funded.    In the past, mainstreaming and co-teaching were practices that were actually punished through the funding formula.    My understanding is that this problem has been addressed so that less restrictive environments are actually rewarded with more funding. \u00a0 I\u2019m not saying I understand all the nuances of the FTE funding process.    I\u2019ve seen a few presentations on the subject and it is drilled into our heads that this is massively serious business.    This is why we fill out the count 3 weeks before the count is actually due to the state department.    Yeah, I just love it when the Powers That Be take a deadline and then move it up days and weeks ahead of time until there is virtually no time to actually do the thing that is required. NOT! \u00a0 The final deadline for the GAA is sometime at the end of March, but our county is making everyone be finished by March 1 st .    Again, the fixation is on administrative compliance. \u00a0 dick A  site that better explains issues surrounding special Education Funding Oh, and  most  many of my acronyms can be found  here  or  here .\u00a0 Actually, that last link is a MUST read.\u00a0 I especially like the acronym GASTD:\u00a0 Go Ahead and Sue The District!

{"date": "2006/11/29", "body": "\u00a0 Okay, I said I was going to write about something else, and you wouldn\u2019t believe how hard it was!    But I\u2019m sticking to it.  Sort of.   It forced me to go out looking at other people\u2019s blogs and see what they are talking about.    But still, nothing seemed to touch off my imagination. \u00a0 I did read a very interesting  paper on the No Child Left Behind Act from the Hoover Institute.    I think this should be required reading for anyone who wants to discuss anything about NCLB, its reauthorization, its politics or provisions.    Basically it tells about where it came from and how the thing got passed.    The parties involved were so desperate to get some sort of education bill passed that they left a lot of ambiguities that needed to be worked out later.    And these chickens are returning to roost, today, with all of the problems we see. \u00a0 I predict that NCLB is either going to remain substantially the same or it is going to be left to rot on the vine.    There are entirely too many competing interests in this thing for it to survive the sort of horse trading that took place in order for it to be passed the first time.    What congress voted and cobbled together back then was something that no one was terribly happy with.    No one, except George Bush.    \u00a0 NCLB is up for reauthorization in 2007, but I predict that it will not be reauthorized in 2007 but the stake holders will hold off until after the presidential election of 2008 just like they did in 1999.    However, unlike the original NCLB bill, the reauthorization will come under serious fire from special interest groups and it will be ripped limb-from-limb.    Both houses of congress are more divisive now than they were then.    Each party has sought to kick their party moderates out in favor of more extremism on either side.    \u00a0 Those thinking this thing will just go away need to think again.    Since each side of the debate is so polarized, I see things remaining frozen the way they are.    Since everyone is equally unhappy, it\u2019s safer to leave things the way they are rather than run the risk of making the level of unhappiness unequal and having some people more happy than others.    Having some people happy, while leaving others more unhappy violates the spirit of NCLB which is to make sure that if no one is made happy than no one can be made more unhappy than someone else. \u00a0 Okay, I\u2019m still into policy with this post and need to post something that might be actually  useful.     How about semi humorous? \u00a0 No Child Left Behind: \nThe Football Version Author Unknown l. All teams must make the state playoffs, and all will win the championship. If a team does not win the championship, they will be on probation until they are the champions, and coaches will be held accountable. 2. All kids will be expected to have the same football skills at the same time and in the same conditions. No exceptions will be made for interest in football, a desire to perform athletically, or genetic abilities or disabilities. ALL KIDS WILL PLAY FOOTBALL AT A PROFICIENT LEVEL 3. Talented players will be asked to work out on their own without instruction. This is because the coaches will be using all their instructional time with the athletes who aren\u2019t interested in football, have limited athletic ability, or whose parents don\u2019t like football. 4. Games will be played year round, but statistics will only be kept in the 4th, 8th, and 11th games. 5. This will create a New Age of sports where every school is expected to have the same level of talent and all teams will reach the same minimal goals. If no child gets ahead, then no child will be left behind.

{"date": "2006/11/30", "body": "Okay, hope you enjoyed the break from GAA, short as it was. \u00a0  But there\u2019s too much good stuff to share to hold back. \u00a0  Really. \u00a0 First off, let\u2019s talk just a minute about scoring. \u00a0  Most assessments that are performed un NCLB are scored by a computer or machine, unless there is an essay portion. \u00a0  In Georgia, the Georgia High School Graduation Test does have an essay portion to it. \u00a0  This is being done more and more on standardized tests, in general. \u00a0  The last time I took the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) I had to write an essay, maxed that part out which is good because the rest needed a bit of help! \u00a0 The portfolios that we are turning in for the GAA are even more challenging than an essay. \u00a0  Very few tasks will be the same, the abilities of the students vary greatly and the methods of taking and recording the data vary. \u00a0  For instance, just for TAZ, I have several pictures with captions, some data that include least-to-most prompting, and then some pictures of some exercises he does on a flannel board. \u00a0  Other teachers will use observations, interviews, video and all manner of student samples of work. \u00a0  Now imagine scoring about 5000 of these things and trying to have some semblance of reliability and validity. \u00a0  It\u2019s kind of a joke but no one in D. C. or Atlanta is laughing. \u00a0  Or maybe they are, except behind closed doors. \u00a0 Well, the answer to all of this is  Questar . \u00a0  There are a lot of companies called Questar but this is the only one doing educational scoring. \u00a0  Questar is doing pretty well, judging by a  recent merger announcement. \u00a0  This testing stuff is big, huge business. \u00a0  Remember these guys can better afford to bribe congress than you and me. \u00a0  And we\u2019re still paying for through our tax dollars. \u00a0  So yeah, this sounds like a great way to piss away a few hundred million dollars. \u00a0 I and other Georgia teachers have been complaining ever more loudly about how this process was seemingly thrown together at the last minute. \u00a0  Make no mistake\u2013 it was. \u00a0  To understand the scramble, we first have to trace the history of all of this. \u00a0  In my  last post , I gave you a link to  some NCLB history. \u00a0  While congress was grousing and horse trading in the reauthorization of the Elementary Secondary Education Act (ESEA), another reauthorization bill was looming off in the distance: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or IDEA. \u00a0  NCLB was signed in January 2002 after almost 3 years of political horse trading. \u00a0  2002 was the year that IDEA was supposed to be reauthorized. \u00a0  In all the fuss and rush to get NCLB out the door, no one gave a lot of thought as to the effect those provisions would have on IDEA. \u00a0  Now they had some serious problems. \u00a0  Some of the 2,000+ odd provisions and details that were not worked out in the NCLB act that just passed were in direct conflict with IDEA. \u00a0  And they still are. \u00a0  But we\u2019re concerned with the timeline, here. \u00a0  \u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until December of 2004 that this thing finally passed and lawmakers worked diligently to make sure that this law was subservient to the NCLB act. \u00a0  It was only in august of 2006 that the final regulations were released. \u00a0  However, regarding NCLB compliance, there was no such lag allowed. \u00a0  The first thing that hit us in the face the the \u201cHighly Qualified\u201d provision of NCLB. \u00a0  You can read all about that in  an earlier entry . \u00a0  We had only a matter of  months  to comply with provisions that congress spent  years  trying to work out. \u00a0  \u00a0 NCLB\u2019s biggest issue is that of accountability, or at least this is the great big flag GW Bush used to rally his Republican troops behind as they were none too pleased about expanding the Dept. of Education\u2019s influence and budget. \u00a0  Remember many of these same congress people want to  abolish  the DOE! \u00a0  So GW pounded the airwaves and the pavement and pressed the flesh and kept going on and on about accountability. \u00a0  You can\u2019t know how you are doing if you don\u2019t keep score and all of that. \u00a0  So now we have high stakes testing. \u00a0  The other provision GW made to his Republican friends was the fact that states could choose their own standards and tests as long as the tests measured performance on those standards. \u00a0 Still with me? \u00a0 The state of Georgia then revamped  their standards  which did make things a bit easier. \u00a0  Instead of the older standards which were a series of very stringent and objective criteria, the new standards are much more  subjective  in nature. \u00a0  As opposed to having to know a very specific set of facts and skills, student must be able to analyze, synthesize and otherwise use higher order thinking skills. \u00a0  It looks a lot better on paper than the old standards. \u00a0 IDEA 1997 required students with disabilities to participate in state testing. \u00a0  You see, IDEA 1997 was actually aligning with the prior reauthorization of the ESEA which in fact had almost the same identical provisions that NCLB had. \u00a0  Yes, you read right. \u00a0  After all of that wrangling, they didn\u2019t make a lot of substantial changes from the old ESEA to NCLB except one which was tying performance and compliance to funding. \u00a0  That made all the difference in the world. \u00a0  However, IDEA \u201997 made a provision for students who could not participate in state wide testing because of their severe disabilities. \u00a0  It was designed for students who were so severe that no level of accommodation would allow them to even approach being competitive on a state test. \u00a0  This was called the alternate assessment. \u00a0  Again, each state could devise its own alternate assessment. \u00a0  In Georgia, they did not align their alternate assessment with the state curriculum instead they aligned it with the goals and objectives from the IEP. \u00a0  Which make sense to me, since the IEP is what determines what the curriculum is, especially for students with the most severe disabilities. \u00a0 However, with NCLB, this was no longer good enough. \u00a0  Instead of the primacy of the IEP which was pretty firmly established in IDEA \u201997, the IEP became  subservient  to NCLB in 2004. \u00a0  Congress calls this  alignment. \u00a0  I call it ridiculous and discriminatory. \u00a0 In 2005, the scramble was  on  to comply with this new \u201calignment,\u201d  \u00a0 specifically the highly qualified provisions. \u00a0  The alternate assessment, however, was still in place as it was. \u00a0  However, since it was not aligned to state standards, guess what? \u00a0  It did not meet the federal requirements. \u00a0 So now we get to  this letter  dated June 30 th  sent to our state school superintendent. \u00a0  It reiterates the fact that the Geogia Alternate Assessment (GAA) does not meet federal requirements and, more serious, puts limitations on the grant awards from the federal government. \u00a0  \u201c Mandatory Oversight\u201d  is the term they used. \u00a0  The smell of the hot asphalt we smelled in downtown Atlanta in June was actually the smell of skid marks left by a very motivated Education Department as they knew they had to get on the stick with this. \u00a0 To be fair, the Georgia Dept. of Ed. was in front of this by a fair bit. \u00a0  They had already sent a couple of teachers out and about around the state to talk about  aligning IEP objectives to state standards. \u00a0  Notice that word \u201calignment\u201d again. \u00a0  They knew this was an issue and were working towards addressing it. \u00a0  However the brave pair of teachers who went out giving these workshops did not know what the GAA was going to look like, as of last spring. \u00a0  Their understanding seemed to be that there might be a phase-in or that there would be a mixture of aligned objectives and daily living skills objectives. \u00a0  But this was not the case at all. \u00a0  I\u2019m sure they were as mortified as the rest of us when they saw that the IEP didn\u2019t enter into the GAA  at all ! \u00a0 This is why the state website has all sorts of ideas for students with severe disabilities, but at the high school level you\u2019ll notice that they don\u2019t focus on the 11 th  grade standards which is THE grade that determines AYP. \u00a0 In fact, I think there might be ONE example.\u00a0  That\u2019s because they thought they would have more time to implement this process. \u00a0  When that letter came in June, time had run out. \u00a0  With several schools starting at the end of July, there was no time to spend doing a lot of discussion, debating or collaborating. \u00a0  They needed to get manuals printed, training materials together and get this show literally on the road ASAP. \u00a0  As it is, we only went through our training a little over a month ago. \u00a0 So this is a RUSH job, folks.\u00a0 Make no mistake. \n \u00a0 Okay, now that I got that out, I feel better. \u00a0  To be fair, I am connecting a fair number of dots, here, between various sources. \u00a0  There may be some mistakes and I\u2019ll gladly correct them if they are pointed out. \u00a0 \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.questared.com/products/research.html", "http://www.tasa.com/tasa/pages/tasanews/questar_acquisition_060106.pdf", "http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/3346601.html", "http://www.georgiastandards.org/", "http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/nclbfinalassess/ga.html", "http://www.georgiastandards.org/impairment.aspx"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/11/30/gaa-backstory/", "title": "GAA Backstory"},
{"date": "2006/02/27", "body": "\u00a0 I\u2019ve been reading  some   of the pieces  by John Stossel.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t see his special, but have read a number of reviews of it by teachers.\u00a0 His columns seem to be pretty consistent with how others have summarized his T.V. special. \u00a0 I think it was stupid of him to call his special \u201cStupid in America.\u201d\u00a0 I think it was also stupid of him to get all political and go on a tear against teacher unions.\u00a0 I\u2019d catch some flack for my take on this if I were more widely read. \u00a0 I think we need to find something we can all agree on.\u00a0 Can we all agree that some schools are better than others?\u00a0 Can we all agree that some schools are not as good as others?\u00a0 I\u2019m not assigning blame, here.\u00a0 I routinely read several blogs by teachers teaching in the Bronx, and I\u2019m convinced that these are hard working people who are dedicated toward the education of the students they teach.\u00a0 Are schools in the Bronx worse than others?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019d be curious as to how many of the teachers would send their own kids there.\u00a0 I\u2019m just saying. \u00a0 Magnolia County is a fast growing suburban area not far from Atlanta.\u00a0 There are 2 high schools and one opening up next year.\u00a0 There are maybe a half dozen middle schools and a score of elementary schools.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t bothered to count.\u00a0 But school choice is definitely a topic of discussion in the Dalton household.\u00a0 As a public school teacher, I do have a choice as to where my kids go to school.\u00a0 With the youngest getting ready to go into pre-K, and my oldest already attending an out-of-zone school, we have choices to make.\u00a0 Do we want both to go to the same out-of-zone school, or do we switch the oldest so he\u2019s attending in-zone with his younger brother?\u00a0 It\u2019s a choice most parents do not have.\u00a0 It\u2019s such a vexing thing; sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t have it! \u00a0 I have teacher friends at almost every school in the county.\u00a0 I know some schools are better than others.\u00a0 I interact with PT, OT and APE teachers who travel from school-to-school and they tell me how some are better than others.\u00a0 But we also agree that the culture and character of a school can and does change over time.\u00a0 Teachers are leaving, transferring and staying every year.\u00a0 Neighborhoods transition, decline and are revitalized.\u00a0 Who\u2019s to say the school we enroll the boys in next year will be the same in 2 years? \u00a0 I really am in favor of school choice.\u00a0 I think all parents should have the same choice us teachers have, and the money should follow the student.\u00a0 This includes private schools and homeschoolers.\u00a0 This where things get enormously unpopular, but as a consumer of education, I like as many choices as possible.\u00a0 My sister is home schooling her 4 children, and I\u2019m amazed at her stamina and determination in doing this.\u00a0 Home schooling is not taking the easy way out by any means. \u00a0 I also think public schools need to diversify.\u00a0 Ironically, I think it is the college track curriculum that is killing education in America.\u00a0 Almost every single thing public schools do from kindergarten on up is geared towards the singular outcome of attending a 4 year university.\u00a0 This stresses students, parents, teachers and administrators.\u00a0 Can we all agree that every student is not going to go to a 4 year college?\u00a0 Can we also agree that not every student who goes will graduate?\u00a0 Can we also agree that students and their parents shouldn\u2019t feel guilty if they decide they don\u2019t want to go to college?\u00a0 Technical schools, junior colleges and the military provide worthwhile career training experiences.\u00a0 High schools could also offer some of these same types of experiences, especially in trades and journeyman-type experiences.\u00a0 Think about it next time you need to pay a plumber. \u00a0 If middle and high schools were more geared towards a more diverse type of learner with different skill sets, it might make things easier on every one.\u00a0 In my EBD teaching days, I had several students interested in art, music, carpentry and mechanics.\u00a0 But we forced them to sit through hours of world geography, British literature and algebra when they\u2019d rather be drawing, fixing things, building things, growing things or otherwise being productive.\u00a0 But they were forced to sit quietly for hours and hours and endure subjects with no relevance to their lives or their personal goals.\u00a0 Is it any wonder they had behavior problems? \u00a0 As a regular ed. teacher, consider what life might be like if you weren\u2019t compelled to try to engage and entertain these students who have no interest in your subject?\u00a0 Would that make a difference in how you taught, having to spend less time on behavior problems caused by apathy and boredom?\u00a0  \u00a0 The fear that teachers would be laid off en mass or suffer economically if there were more choices is irrational.\u00a0 As it is, schools are struggling to deal with overcrowding and teacher shortages.\u00a0 I\u2019d think that lessening the load would give everyone a break from adverse conditions.\u00a0 If private schools can do a better job with uncertified staff, let them have at it. \u00a0 I\u2019m not afraid of competition from home schools, private schools, foreign schools or wherever.\u00a0 No school is going to be able to meet the needs of every student.\u00a0 Some teachers may be better suited to a different type of school.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t mind teaching in a special ed. school, with a cadre of specialists all working towards a similar outcome with similar students committed to a common goal. And, as a teacher, I\u2019d rather work with colleagues that were dedicated and competent than those just marking time until retirement. \u00a0 It so happens, that in Magnolia County, the elementary school with the best trained teachers as far as special education and inclusion go, is the city school where some of the poorest students go.\u00a0 We live outside of that zone, but have been able to keep our oldest there as it was the only school with a special program for autism when he was in preschool.\u00a0 Having a well-trained cadre of dedicated teachers makes a lot of difference. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-1_18_06_JS.html", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-1_11_06_JS.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/27/school-choice/", "title": "School Choice"},
{"date": "2006/02/25", "body": "02/25/2006 I\u2019ve put up a couple of posts that cover a bit of why I\u2019m here and what I\u2019m looking to do, below.  Skim over them.  They may or may not interest you. I\u2019m just wrapping up a week off for \u201cwinter break.\u201d  I noticed that quite a lot of other teachers are off as well.   Ms. Frizzle  has been wandering around Holland somewhere and has posted a few pictures. This break is not part of the regular, traditional schedule.  Our school district went on a \u201cBalanced Calendar\u201d two years ago.  This basically means that school starts in July, then we get a week-long break in October, another in November and then two weeks for the holidays.  We had this past week, and then next month we have spring break before we get out at the end of May.  I generally like it better, especially that October break.  The stretch between the start of school and Thanksgiving used to be waaaay long!  But to be honest, this past week I could have done without in exchange for getting out a week earlier. Breaks for my kids are tough.  Actually, they pose challenges for most parents, but students with special needs really get out of whack.  Students who lack the ability to self-regulate do poorly without structure and routine.  Home time in our house typically lacks both during breaks from school.  Both of my own children will be glad to get back to their routine.  My students will also be glad, but they will also punish us for not having school.  I think they blame us teachers for shutting the doors and not being there. But that\u2019s what the good folks of Magnolia County pay us for.  To keep their kids off the street and out of everyone else\u2019s hair. I\u2019ve been up for jury duty this past week, and have one more week to go.  I did go in last week, but they didn\u2019t wind up needing me.  I wouldn\u2019t have minded going in last week, as it would have been an educational way to get a few extra dollars.  However, next week will be bad if I have to go in.  I call everyday after 5:00 and type in my number and they let me know if I have to report.  I\u2019m good through Monday. A substitute isn\u2019t worth a lot in our room.  We are a hands-on outfit.  A body needs to be able to lift, change diapers and know something about seizures and other medical conditions in order to be very useful.  Otherwise, they sort of sit around while everyone else does the work.  They can\u2019t do discrete trial and they can\u2019t take data.  So there isn\u2019t much they can do outside of pushing a wheelchair to lunch or during a fire drill.

{"date": "2006/02/25", "body": "\u00a0 Before throwing my virtual hat into the Edublogging ring, I did read several educational blogs.\u00a0 In fact, I read all of the ones that were nominated for the Best of Blog (BoB) awards.\u00a0 And then I read several from their considerable links. \u00a0 I do have another blog out there which enjoys a fair amount of success, meaning several hundred hit it every day and I can pull down a dozen or more comments on a daily basis.\u00a0 To me, that is success.\u00a0 Much more than that, and I\u2019d get nervous. \u00a0 After looking at the BoB nominations, education looked like a particularly weak category.\u00a0 One reason is that education bloggers are still a very loosely associated group.\u00a0 While we all may link to each other, we don\u2019t talk to each other very much or very well.\u00a0 We do parallel posts on a subject but we don\u2019t deepen or extend each other very well.\u00a0 Someone comes up with an idea or suggestion and it dangles out there for awhile and then it just sort of disappears.\u00a0 Next post. \u00a0 So what I\u2019ve tried to do is extend and deepen ideas of others who inspire me while also keeping my own storyline going.\u00a0 If you read  Education Wonk\u2019s  Carnival Midway, you get a real good feel for what folks are talking about in various education blogs.\u00a0 I will occasionally grab an idea from there, like I did with  Coach Brown\u2019s  post.\u00a0 Sometimes only a part of a post will lead me in a new direction, like  Ms. Cornelius  did recently.\u00a0  \u00a0 The power of blogging lies in this interactive hybrid vigor.\u00a0 We all collectively contribute and extend each other.\u00a0 This is something that does not happen in any other type of publishing medium.\u00a0  \u00a0 So what would I view as a good education blog? \u00a0 \u2013 A good, basic story line.\u00a0  Reflective Teacher  and  Mad Tedious  are two of my current favs.\u00a0  Kacie  has possibilities if she can switch from the abominable MSN and keep updating.\u00a0 We get some characters, and there is an episodic quality to it.\u00a0 This is the stuff that keeps me reading as I learn to care about the characters. \u00a0 \u2013 Informative and original.\u00a0 John L. at  Teach Effectively  regularly has some good solid scoops that no one else seems to cover.\u00a0 Weaving information into a storyline is challenging but not impossible.\u00a0 By their nature, education blogs lend themselves to both plot and information.  \u00a0 \u2013 Theme-based.\u00a0 Education is a very broad area, and if a blog has a focus, it should be stronger for it.\u00a0 For instance, John and Michele at  NCLBlog  focus primarily on NCLB.\u00a0 The law is broad and sweeping enough, there should be ample material for the authors to stay on topic.\u00a0 Deviations are allowed, but being scatter-brained is not a desired quality I look for.\u00a0 My niche, if you haven\u2019t guessed it, is special education. \u00a0 There are things that leave me less than enthused about many educational blogs: \u00a0 \u2013 Too political.\u00a0 Okay, education involves a lot of politics and there are a slew of blogs that cover the political spectrum.\u00a0 But I get real weary of Bush bashing and union bashing.\u00a0 I do have a strong political bias, but education has not been served well by either the liberals or conservatives. If you do have a bias, try to be fair and open minded about it.\u00a0 Give and take and diplomacy will earn more respect than cramming your particular view in everyone else\u2019s face.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0  \u2013 No story.\u00a0 This is a strong personal bias of mine.\u00a0 Each person has a story to tell, and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re probably not living right!\u00a0 Simply reacting to media reports is not a story.\u00a0 But if you can relate to the story on a personal basis, it does add some realism and substance.\u00a0 I\u2019m interested in who you all are.\u00a0 I really want to like you!  \u00a0 \u2013 Not enough cross talk.\u00a0 We are not doing a good job of extending on what each other writes.\u00a0 Not every post by every person is worthy of extension, but we can do better.\u00a0 By the same token, we might consider fostering this sort of cross talk in our own posts by inviting discussion.\u00a0 For instance, I\u2019d kind of like to know what you all look for in a good blog.\u00a0 What keeps you coming back?\u00a0 How do you decide who to link to on your blogroll?\u00a0  \u00a0 Right now, I have yet to discover a blog that hits all my criteria.\u00a0 Some come closer than others.\u00a0 So, the creation of my blog is an attempt at becoming something that might actually fit my own criteria.\u00a0 Whether or not it has broad appeal, I won\u2019t know until it gets presented before a broader audience. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://educationwonk.blogspot.com/", "http://ukiahcoachbrown.blogspot.com/", "http://shrewdnessofapes.blogspot.com/", "http://thereflectiveteacher.wordpress.com/", "http://madtedious.blogspot.com/", "http://spaces.msn.com/kpointer/blog/", "http://johnl.edschool.virginia.edu/blogs/TeachEffectively/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/25/edublogging-my-preferences/", "title": "Edublogging: My Preferences"},
{"date": "2015/05/14", "body": "As my oldest gets ready to complete his first year of high school, transitioning is a topic that weighs heavily on my mind. \u00a0It\u2019s made more acute by the fact that in my business of being a special education teacher, I\u2019m busy writing something called a \u201cSummary of Performance\u201d for all of my graduating seniors. \u00a0This is a document that is meant to capture all of what the student did in his/her high school years and then outline what resources might be available for those students when they transition into post-school life. Here\u2019s a newsflash for other parents of students with autism: there are precious few resources out there and almost all of those that exist are grossly underfunded, many with waiting lists that are measured in  years . \u00a0Once a student leaves the world of k-12 education they are no longer serviced or protected by the law known as IDEA. \u00a0An IEP means nothing once they get out school. \u00a0There is the  ADA  and  section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 . \u00a0But these are no guarantees of services, only guarantees of non-discrimination. So my Summary of Performance will list myself, my lead, the transition coordinator and if I know where they might go to school or college, the contact information for the student support services. \u00a0And that\u2019s about it. \u00a0Those with more involved or severe disabilities might have access to vocational rehabilitation services, but in Georgia those services are limited. \u00a0And underfunded. I\u2019ve written about the  Summary of Performance before, in my IEP series . \u00a0That whole series is in need of an update, since I\u2019m working with an entirely different population now, and some things have changed in the last 7 years since I wrote that out. \u00a0But Spaz, the object of that post, is a case in point for those with more severe disabilities. \u00a0When I saw him and his parent  3 year s after he graduated, he was  still  on a waiting list for supported employment. \u00a0And this was actually a parent who had done some pre-planning. \u00a0Taz graduated a year later and I saw his mother in the store less than a year ago and he is still on the same waiting list\u2013  six years after graduation!! This is why parents don\u2019t like thinking about post-school transition planning because it is that depressing. \u00a0My oldest was only 9 when Spaz graduated, but it was still in the back of my mind. \u00a0Far in the back. \u00a0 But time marches on. Since that time, he is still mostly interested in trains. \u00a0Everything he does intentionally has some focus on acquiring some more model trains. \u00a0This is autism at its most classic. So I\u2019ve been working at finding the boy some sort of marketable skills. \u00a0The fact is, he can be a dependable and hard hard worker, albeit rather slow. \u00a0He really doesn\u2019t complain at all about mowing my large-ish lawn with the push mower, no matter how hot it is because he knows he\u2019s going to get paid. \u00a0And the whole time he\u2019s mowing, he\u2019s thinking about the new train set he\u2019s going to buy when he saves enough money. \u00a0And since he\u2019s looking at getting a  Lionel train set,  that\u2019s a lot of lawn mowing because they aren\u2019t cheap! And this is the part where  my other blog  intersects with this one, as I recently got a bee hive. \u00a0Actually I bought the hive for him at Christmas and we just got the bees. \u00a0Just like the lawn mowing, his interest is making money to buy trains. \u00a0But he IS interested, and so there\u2019s an opening there for expanding his interest into something somewhat marketable. It doesn\u2019t hurt that this is also an interest of  mine. In a more rural environment, a lot of autistic behaviors might have been written off as being odd. \u00a0Farm life generally moves at a slower pace, in tune with the more natural rhythm of nature. \u00a0The transitions involved in agricultural are more gradual as opposed to a more urbanized life that seems to involve a faster pace filled with more stress as things seem to be more time-sensitive. \u00a0Factory life historically meant doing the same thing over and over and over again and the transitions were extremely predictable. \u00a0Basically the workplace in earlier times was not nearly as hostile to someone on the autism spectrum as it is today, with a more service-oriented and socially driven economy. \u00a0It\u2019s easier dealing with plants, animals and things than it is dealing with people. Fortunately, the bees don\u2019t require much space at the present time, unlike a herd of cattle. \u00a0I used to joke about having to get some cows when my boys got older so they would have some chores to do. \u00a0I didn\u2019t realize it while growing up, and in fact resented it, but those farm chores I had growing up did help instill a work ethic that still serves well today. \u00a0And that background might be an entry into something meaningful and productive for the next generation.

{"date": "2008/05/22", "body": "We are on the downhill slide of the year.   One more day.   And I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to be doing next year!   My evaluator hasn\u2019t darkened my door in over a month (and that wasn\u2019t for an evaluation but a discipline problem) but I did make evaluating me easier than gravity.   I gave her a CD of some  video I shot doing some teaching  and included my data sheet/lesson plan with it.   I knew we were going to be crushed at the end and thought she could use that in a pinch.   So we\u2019ll see.   What I do know, is that 1/4 of our faculty is departing this year, and one third of those will be from the special education department.   It is going to be hideously hard to fill those vacancies, with mine being the absolute hardest to fill.   Let\u2019s face it; people are not beating my door down trying to get in.   They might try to keep me in this room for another year, which would be stressful but I would do it with the understanding that this would be my last year at this high school.   I won\u2019t be screwed over twice.   This state of limbo makes it hard to prepare for summer inservice classes as they are offering several co-teaching classes but they want the co-teachers to take the class together.   That\u2019s a bit difficult when a large number of those who will be doing the co-teaching are not even hired yet! So why the big turn-over?   For one thing, our principal is leaving.   The new principal will be principal #4 for me.   Administrators come and go.   If you don\u2019t like the one you got, wait a few years and you\u2019ll get a new one.   If you like the one you have, enjoy it because the wind will shift directions pretty soon.   Fightin\u2019 Joe was an assistant for a few years before taking the head job, and while he was an AP we saw quite a bit of him in my room and with my kids.   He even played the role of Santa Clause during a Christmas party we had one year.   I know \u2013  totally not  age appropriate!   Once he became the head guy, we rarely ever saw him.   And really, that is absolutely fine with me.   I know he had bigger fish to fry with AYP (which we made most years he was principal) and while I appreciate any time an administrator spends with us, no news is mostly good news.   Administrators traditionally have to spend most of their time putting out fires and the fact that we\u2019ve had relatively few has been a relief to us all. Another reason we might be seeing higher turnover might have something to do with this  Washington Post  article.   My  previous article  touched on that theme a bit, and I agree with Steven Rothman that somehow parents are micromanaging their schools to death.   My take on it is that parents want to hold the schools responsible for raising their children, and when teachers and schools fail to raise the children (as they most certainly will) parents get upset.   They are less concerned about the education their children receive as much as they are about making excuses for their child\u2019s behavior or lack of progress.   We live in an age where people can take charge of their own education and learning and yet precious few are actually doing that.   They want others to hold their hands and babysit and nag them.   The answer to this is not going to come from us as educators.   It has to come from us as  parents.   I am totally in favor of parents banding together, sharing resources, ideas or even complaining about us as teachers.   But too often, these groups become gripe festivals that incite parents to go after the schools in order to demand more and more while offering very little.   The autism groups are probably the most notorious    offenders of all.   I can tell when I have a parent that is being coached by a real life or online group.   The adversarial relationship is there from the start, and parents are braced for battle.   It\u2019s one thing if the school or teacher has earned it by failing to educate as they are supposed to.   But parents will too often wait until the IEP to air every complaint, and instead of an hour-long meeting, we end up there all day.   Working things out ahead of time, instead of springing all the demands at once can salvage a lot of good will.   Teachers should do this as well, sharing information on a regular basis.   As educators, we can minimize a lot of the micromanagement by practicing a certain degree of transparency in what we are doing. But in the end, it is up to parents to establish the prevailing culture of their neighborhoods and communities.   I\u2019m sure many of you know of children in your neighborhood running wild, making a nuisance of themselves, staying out entirely too late on school nights and basically not behaving in a responsible manner.   And the parents let them.   But I know that the neighbors can have more influence in the form of peer pressure.   Peer pressure doesn\u2019t end with high school.   In the case of kids with disabilities, you might know of parents who seem to cultivate dependence by doing everything for the child except chew his food for him.   Most kids can put on their own coats, use the toilet and eat with a spoon before they go to kindergarten.   And yet there\u2019s a group of parents who expect the schools to train the special needs kids to do these things.   How do other kids learn this stuff without schools and teachers?   This is why the school and parents need to be part of a cooperative  partnership .   I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve spouted on long enough on this theme.   Later this summer, my family and I will be going on a real vacation and seeing and learning about different areas of the country.   It\u2019s going to be better than whatever the school system can offer, but I don\u2019t feel the need to force the public system to provide those kinds of educational experiences and opportunities.   We\u2019re doing it as parents, and that\u2019s as it should be. D.

{"date": "2008/05/06", "body": "Yes, I will  SO  be blogging you! Yes, this Thursday is my refresher session for what our county calls eLearn, which is actually  Moodle .   Moodle is actually the centerpiece of the course that I\u2019m developing for paras and teachers of students with severe and profound disabilities.   The videos ,  the podcasts  and this blog are all resources that I\u2019ll be using and Moodle will help provide the instructional format, content organization and assessments in order to actually put it together like a real course. At least that\u2019s the idea. Last summer, I attended an eLearn class and was sort of excited about it.   Trouble is, I had no idea of how to use it, because my kids can\u2019t read, write and most can\u2019t manipulate a mouse well enough to navigate around even with  Moodle\u2019s efforts with accessibility  standards because most are reliant on single switch access and do not attend or track with that level of detail.   It was a bit depressing for me, because I saw all sorts of possibilities with this great tool, but I wouldn\u2019t have much of a chance to develop it or to use it.   This lack of application and interface with the  web 2.0  technology that I know and love has been a big driver in pushing me out of the SID/PID setting and driving me toward a higher functioning population.   I want to create content and be out there, which I\u2019ve sort of been doing the past couple of years with my blog.   But I want to leverage the internet as a platform to provide students with the opportunity to access content easily and repeatedly at their own pace. My audience in this course is not kids, as much as it is other adults which hopefully will have some sort of multiplier effect in helping many more students with severe disabilities learn.   In a sense, it\u2019s just me, self-marketing myself.   Otherwise known as pimping myself out\u2026 for the greater good.   I could see some parents tapping into this material, too.   And for anyone out there so inclined, you could also contribute to the cause by posting some content that might be useful.   You can read  this post  to see my wish list!\u00a0 So maybe some folks will tune in from the workshop and get turned on to blogging and maybe some of my other readers will find some of this interesting. \n I\u2019m looking forward to getting out of class for a day, and it will be a nice break from the hectic schedule and noise and chaos that seems to go along with this time of year.   I was here until 8:00 in the evening doing a bunch of IEPs last night.   I think one more big push and I\u2019ll have them done for the year.   I look forward to the day when I have time to read more posts by the good folks in my blog roll! D.

I had a chance to see what others were doing from around the county on their eLearn sites.\u00a0 We had elementary and middle school teachers represented with one other teacher representing another high school.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the time was spent actually working on our Moodles, with basically everyone getting theirs better ready for a fall roll out.\u00a0 Some of us have not been very active on our sites for a very long time.\u00a0 In fact, according to our illustrious instructor, Beth, that would be most teachers.\u00a0 I would be one of them, up until a couple of months or so ago when I decided to take on  this new project  where eLearn would play a prominent role.\u00a0 Even then, it was a bit of time before I tackled putting together modules since I have to generate all of the content by myself. Other teachers can use Google,  PBS ,  United Streaming  and various other sites to put their content together.\u00a0 Mine is mostly self-generated although I am starting to see things appear on  TeacherTube  that might be useful that I can use.\u00a0 If any readers are generating content and posting, let me know!\u00a0  My stuff  is available and out there for the taking/viewing/using and I have more stuff I\u2019m getting ready to put up. Back to eLearn/Moodle, I did manage to pick up most of the things I wanted out of the class so that I can [roceed to develop the site.\u00a0 One think I quickly learned is that my site was looking visually impoverished as everyone else had all sorts of nifty graphics and animations on their sites.\u00a0 I thought I was doing well on original content and even some interactivity, but still have a long way to go. I plan on taking the advanced course this summer, so perhaps I\u2019ll be blogging that, but no promises, especially since I have a backlog of posts that need to be rolled out.\u00a0 But it was nice to be around another techno-nerd in the school system, as we seem to be relatively few and far between.\u00a0 It would be neat to get self-identified propeller heads together for a one day convocation/conference/confab before school starts, sort of like a mini  SXSW  for teachers and teaching.\u00a0 It could be done in conjunction with new teacher orientation.\u00a0 Nothing too heavy, but just getting tips, tricks and contacts before school starts. Who knows?\u00a0 Maybe I could become a sort of  Scoble  for education. D.

Not having enough children pass the state assessment in each subgroup results in failure to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) and some sanctions for the school, not the least of which is the school considered to be a failing school.   Who wants to be a failure?   For students with significant cognitive disabilities, they do allow 1-2% of the population to have an alternate assessment.   In Georgia, this is a portfolio-based assessment known as the Georgia Alternate Assessment (GAA).   It involves some heavy documentation in addition to all the stuff we normally have to do.   This is the short version.   Go back and read my entries from a year ago for the more extensive and venomous version! \n I\u2019ve been just doing it and not going on and on and on about it because I overdid my quota last year.   But my loathing of NCLB and the alternate assessment and the stupidity behind it are unchanged.   Having done it before has been a big help.   But everyone else is going bonkers, especially the new teachers.   They look very worn and fatigued on it.   The thing is, most of them shouldn\u2019t even have to do it.   We have over 20 students doing the GAA here at Magnolia High, and we don\u2019t have more than 500 juniors taking the state assessment!   So we\u2019re way above the 1-2% mark.   It\u2019s shenanigans like this that made the provision in NCLB necessary in the first place, especially the subgroupings.   But somehow they get away with it, which is why they do it.   They can put more students on the alternate assessment which means less students fail the regular test which means the school can still make AYP.   I\u2019m less stressed this year, partly because I jumped out and got all over it early.   But the other part is that I\u2019m looking forward to not fiddling with it at some point in the future.   It\u2019s going to be because  I  move on, not because of any changes in NCLB.   I saw it coming long before the beltway analysts did, namely that NCLB is not going anywhere until after the election.   They did the same exact thing with the IDEA re-authorization and frankly, NCLB is a much bigger and a much hotter potato than IDEA.

{"date": "2008/04/09", "body": "We are on Spring Break right now, but I am up to my neck in work projects.  This blog is part of those projects, hence me having to \u201ccome out.\u201d  Yeah, the byline might still say Dick Dalton, but Dan Dage is the one doing all the work and has been all along!  So it\u2019s time I give myself credit and begin promoting and branding myself accordingly.  \u201cMagnolia County\u201d is Newton County, Georgia.  And that\u2019s enough info for the moment.  I\u2019ve been spending time in my archives, cleaning and editing stuff that might have proven to be more incendiary than I might like being mindful of offending my coworkers who I generally like and get along with.  I\u2019d like to keep it that way, if at all possible!  So if any of you see something that  might be offensive and damaging and tarnish my pristine image (HA!) go ahead and let me know.  Snarky comments from readers don\u2019t count.  You all are free to offend as much as you like. My two projects: Developing resources for new SID/PID teachers : We have several in our county by virtue of some leaving, moving on or getting arrested.  Yeah, it is a very ugly business.  Burnout is not a matter of  if  but  when , or so it seems.  A good special ed. teacher can make a decent run of it in 3 years before getting too frazzled.  As hideously short as that is, we\u2019re averaging less than that on the high school level, and that includes me clocking in 8 years.  So I\u2019d like to have resources out there for our new recruits, but also for anyone else around the country wondering what the devil to do with students whose development is measured in  months  instead of years, especially on the high school level where the developmental gap between the students and their peers is so astronomically wide.  This blog will serve as a central place to access those resources, or at least that\u2019s the idea. Welcome to my play space! Lesson Plans for my SID/PID students:  Let\u2019s suppose for a minute that I have some ideas as to what to do with my students.  Translating that into a formal lesson plan that somehow connects what I do with  grade level content standards  is a Herculean task that I\u2019ve yet to see anyone do well.  There\u2019s a couple of ladies at the state department who have done what I do (only better) but haven\u2019t done it since we got into standard-based mode.  I may require their help.  I\u2019m going to go ahead and start on my own, anyway. Which leads me to presenting the first step/resource in accomplishing these twin goals.  That is, accessing and becoming familiar with the state standards.  The special education teachers in Newton county have yet to be trained in the Georgia Performance Standards (GPS).  Ever.  We happen to have had our special education county meeting at the exact same time the various subject areas are having their GPS meetings every year there has been a roll-out.  We are all in the dark. But there is help, no matter what you teach in Georgia.  The  GPS website  looks a bit plain at first glance, and I was wondering how this thing was voted best of the web last year.  However one must drill down a bit to see what\u2019s there.  And you all can drill with me by going to the  GA DOE\u2019s Moodle site .  You can access the courses by logging in as a guest (it\u2019s a one-button process) and looking at the flash videos.  There, you will strike gold.  Units, sequences, lesson plans, activities, tasks and resources all nicely laid out by subject, by grade.  It\u2019s hard to get any easier than that.  That is, if you teach a regular subject.  For a SID/PID teacher, this is a more daunting task because we have to translate a high school standard into something a developmentally 11 month old in an 18 year-old body can do.  I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be done.  It can, and I\u2019ve done it a few times with a few tasks. But I need to have enough plans to go a few weeks  nonstop on this and that is the challenge.  I need to be able to plan for the developmental 11 month old as well as the developmental 3 and 4 year-old with adequate differentiation while providing access for all to 9-12th grade standards.  This is no small thing we\u2019re tasked with. So I just thought I\u2019d share, and I\u2019ll be getting back to googling, moodling and otherwise planning.  And now you can get your first look at  my nerdly self in action !

{"date": "2007/11/23", "body": "It\u2019s been awhile since I reached out and touched another blogger, despite a number of you good folks stopping in and commenting.\u00a0 One of those is named Leila, writer of  Special 2 Me , which is a good read for anybody who is in special education, has ever had anything to do with it or who might be considering the possibility of having something to do with special education. She has been teaching less than a month, and her blog really does capture a lot of the grit, determination and frustrations involved when someone is grabbed off the street, run through a bit of a boot camp and then plopped in the middle of a classroom filled with students who are not necessarily the most or best socialized.\u00a0\u00a0 In a recent post she wrote,  she opines about the lack of resources, material and support  compared to what she had been sold prior to taking the job.\u00a0 Special educators the world over will recognize that little song and dance.\u00a0 In many ways, school recruiters are a lot like military recruiters, especially when it comes to getting special education teachers.\u00a0 They offer up all sorts of things, trying to get a body to sign up.\u00a0 However, once you\u2019re in, it becomes totally different. Welcome to the \u2018Nam! When reading that post by Leila, I was reminded by a statement made by the main character in  Platoon  played by Charlie Sheen.\u00a0 He comments how the veterans don\u2019t even want to know a new guy\u2019s name because he\u2019s probably not going to make it.\u00a0 They also figure that if you\u2019re going to not make it, it\u2019s best to be picked off in the first few weeks so that you don\u2019t suffer as much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot like with new special education teachers sometimes.\u00a0 We don\u2019t do it on purpose, but there is a niggling suspicion the perhaps the newbie might not make it.\u00a0 Those of us who have been in awhile have seen it happen. One reason why I\u2019m not venturing out and helping the new folks as much as I ought is probably more to do with my own chaotic environment.\u00a0 I can look pretty competent, especially next to the new folks, but the truth is I am perpetually and woefully behind.\u00a0 I always have been.\u00a0 Even when it looks like I\u2019m way ahead of everyone else in my paperwork, I am still behind in other areas.\u00a0 I\u2019ve just learned when and where I can compromise and cut corners to make it look better. The primary bullets a special education teacher has to dodge consist of students who draw blood from other students (or themselves), angry parents, lawsuits, administrative paperwork deadlines, and most of all; the teacher\u2019s own emotional/mental baggage.\u00a0 If you have any sort of emotional or character weakness, the kids will find it and root it to the surface in a big hurry.\u00a0\u00a0 Might as well be honest with them and then move on. Someone asked me if I feel effective as an educator.\u00a0 Sometimes I do, sometimes I don\u2019t.\u00a0 I think we are most often our own worst critics, and I do fall into that category.\u00a0 I am getting to a point sometimes where I\u2019m wondering if what I\u2019m doing is making a significant difference.\u00a0 Does it matter?\u00a0 I\u2019m not to a point where I\u2019m content to just draw a paycheck and hold out for retirement.\u00a0 I want to be better than I am.\u00a0 I feel good about what I do, but many of the things that have been highlights have little to do with my job description!\u00a0 For instance, so much of what I was NOT prepared for or taught was dealing with the parents.\u00a0 Most teachers come off as judgmental pricks when it comes to dealing with parents.\u00a0 Sometimes I still do.\u00a0 But I have learned that when that happens, I really, really need to get in a lot closer to that parent, even if it means going to their house (with permission, of course).\u00a0 Many of my parents are dealing with issues beyond anything I\u2019ll ever see in the classroom with their own family disruptions.\u00a0 Much of what I\u2019ve been doing is putting the parent at ease about how they are doing as parents.\u00a0 They are doing the best they can with the hand they have been dealt.\u00a0 Even if a parent is seemingly unsupportive, I\u2019ll still do my best to keep the communication lines open without forcing myself on them. And no one ever told me about all the mucous and bodily fluids I would be dealing with.\u00a0 But that is the biggest part of my day!\u00a0 And I do it better than anyone else. My effectiveness right now is less about being an educator and more about being a compassionate and diligent human being. \u00a0 And that was taught to me more by the kids themselves than anyone else!\u00a0 I think much of the teething that we go through early on is simply finding our place and our own style.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had the pleasure of seeing some other teachers come into their own, and it was not without a considerable amount of pain and hardship. So I feel for all the new teachers, but especially those dropped in the middle of the year.\u00a0 No one can tell you what to expect because most of the ones doing the interviewing and hiring have no idea!\u00a0 But think if it like that reality show,  Survivor , where the object is to outplay, outwit and outlast. And if things  really  drag you down, look at my countdown category to see how long until Christmas break! dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://specialedandme.wordpress.com/", "http://specialedandme.wordpress.com/2007/11/21/i-will-survive-and-thrive/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/11/23/new-special-ed-teacher-blues/", "title": "New Special Ed.

Overall my students did very well\u2026actually that should be reworded to say that \u201cI did very well\u201d. With all of the hours and hours of work that I put into those portfolios and with all of the sweat and tears, I was devastated to find out that one of my students failed in the area of math and another one failed in the area of English/Language Arts. I almost cried when I got the news. It was reported to me that the one who failed the math portion did so by only one point. The student who failed the ELA portion did so because of some error on my part. I know this because it received an NA which means it was not scored. I had six third graders who were taught the same standards and did pretty much the same activities which were documented in the same way, but one of them was not scored because of some stupid typo! I have so many problems with the GAA but the problem I have now is \u201cnot knowing\u201d. I don\u2019t know why these two students failed in these areas. I will NEVER know! I won\u2019t get the portfolios back so I can\u2019t see what I did wrong. As their teacher, how can I learn from my mistakes if I don\u2019t even know what the mistakes are? I NEED CLOSURE! \n \u00a0 \n I\u2019m sorry my anonymous friend, but that is not going to happen for several reasons. \u00a0  First of all, we all know how subjective the process is.  \u00a0 There are many, many ways to fail the GAA and  NONE  of those failures have anything to do with student achievement. \u00a0  Not even one. \u00a0  How the hell do you assign any validity to a 3 rd  grade assessment when a student\u2019s functioning is measured in  months  and not years?!? \u00a0  \u00a0 Try giving a 3 rd  grade assessment to an 18 month-old and tell me such a score is valid! \u00a0  But this is the nature of NCLB beast. \u00a0 Secondly, the state is well aware that this entire process is an embarrassment. \u00a0  I\u2019ve told folks in Atlanta that myself. \u00a0  I continue to remind them of it. \u00a0  They certainly do not want teachers and administrators pouring over these things and analyzing the results because THERE IS NOTHING USEFUL TO LEARN FROM THEM! \u00a0  These things do  NOT  inform instruction like any other assessment should do. \u00a0  They are merely one more time-consuming project designed to meet the letter of the law. \u00a0  This only spotlights how stupid the law is in the first place. \u00a0  The only thing more stupid than the law is how it is being implemented. \u00a0  Assessment should inform instruction. \u00a0  If any of you clowns in Atlanta are reading this, please explain to me how the GAA can possibly contribute to improving instruction when specific results are unavailable to teachers? \u00a0  Or better; how can these results inform instruction even IF results are made available? Does the portfolio tell us where the student is presently functioning? \u00a0  Does it inform us as to the specific cognitive weaknesses? \u00a0  Where is any of this in the scoring rubric? \u00a0 Finally, you will not get closure because closure is not on the list of priorities according to NCLB.  \u00a0 No one cares how many teachers are left behind, just like they don\u2019t care how many of our kids get left behind in the process. \u00a0  This is a process that is all about the damned statistics. \u00a0  It is not about people, it is about politics. \u00a0  It is not about education, it is about appeasing some ill-informed constituency who is determined to destroy public education no matter what the body count is in the process. \u00a0  Teachers have always been at the bottom of the priority list in the education debate.  \u00a0 I\u2019m not against taking a test to prove my proficiency in a given content area, and I\u2019m going to do just that. But the alternate assessment circus is too much. \u00a0  \u00a0 This is why I\u2019m taking the science test in one month (I did get the subject changed over from biology to the subject of science for which I\u2019m better suited) because if I\u2019m going to play this silly game, I want to play on the real field with the real players where my scores will really count. \u00a0  The field of severe disabilities is important to the students, their teachers and their parents, but not to the greater education community, despite whatever they say to us in the hall ways.  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The real story of this will play out between teachers and their administrators. \u00a0  If your administrator is supportive, you\u2019ll know it. \u00a0  I know how much work so many of you put into this crap because I was doing it too. \u00a0  Only I was probably under less of a load than many, many of you. \u00a0  I just complained real loud! \u00a0  You deserve a pat on the back just for surviving the experience. \u00a0  Now you\u2019ll have to survive the fall-out because obviously a certain percentage of you will have failing marks on your portfolios. \u00a0  And due to the nature of NCLB, one failure sinks the whole boat. \u00a0  One typo and the whole portfolio goes to the s#!t heap. \u00a0  My fate was already predetermined with that  nice little letter in my file . \u00a0 This is why special education teachers everywhere have either cashed out of the severe business, or are preparing to make moves similar to mine. \u00a0  I hate to do it, but I have my own family to feed, you know? \u00a0  But I\u2019m going to fight it as much as possible on all levels as long as this thing keeps vexing all of us. \u00a0 \u00a0 dick \n \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vote-smart.org/index.htm", "http://www.vote-smart.org/index.htm"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/07/04/sickening/", "title": "Sickening"},
{"date": "2007/09/04", "body": "Here we go again with the Georgia Alternate Assessment (GAA).   \n I have no problems admitting that I am sometimes a condescending prima donna when it comes to all the requirements that we are subjected to.   I expect everyone else to toe the line while I sometimes play loose with the rules and have tested limits more than once.   Most of the time I\u2019m looking out for the students and sometimes my creative insubordination is in defense of other teachers who may not be able to stand the heat.   And I\u2019ve drawn a considerable amount of it during my tenure here.   I\u2019m going to try to grit my teeth and accept this bitter pill this year with the understanding that it is only temporary.   I\u2019ll be free of this burden soon enough. We had our GAA meeting at the county office this morning, with another group attending this afternoon.   Most of the folks attending this morning were people who had done it last year, which made things go fairly smoothly.   Very little has changed from last year.   We still have not seen any results from last year\u2019s test and I\u2019ll have to make an appointment with Harry to do so.   I think it would be instructive to look at the scores just to get an idea where my activities are as far as meeting or exceeding the standards.   I mean if something works, why change it all the way up?   There are lots of resources on the  Georgia DOE website  with more supposed to be added all the time. \n I figured out the reason why I\u2019m so rapidly going stale this year here, is because we are too short staffed to go into the community.   In the past 7 years, that really was what made the days go by so quickly and kept most of us from going stir crazy.   We used to be able to spend 2 hours or so doing jobs or shopping away from the school every morning.   Now, I am in the one room with all of these students pretty much all day long.   I\u2019m having flash backs of my days teaching children who had behavior disorders in a self-contained setting.   The worst behaved kids stuck in one place all day long away from everyone else held no appeal for me, which is precisely why I took this position instead of the EBD position across town.   But here I am!   And since self-contained EBD no longer truly exists, guess which position is now the hardest of the special ed. jobs to fill and keep filled?   Being isolated is a fairly substantial negative in this case.   When we were out and about, having our own schedule was a positive.   But now, thanks to NCLB, we are having to abide by the regular curriculum and schedule more and more which has actually made the isolation even more acute. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://public.doe.k12.ga.us/ci_testing.aspx?PageReq=CI_TESTING_GAA"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/09/04/hang-on-to-your-butts/", "title": "Hang on to your\u00a0Butts\u2026"},
{"date": "2007/06/06", "body": "Okay, I\u2019m going to have to talk about it, because no one else wants to do it.    Or perhaps I\u2019m abnormally obsessed with this.   I\u2019ve certainly been traumatized by the alternate assessment crap that is sweeping the nation. \n NCLB strikes again,  this time in Mississippi. \n Mississippi is apparently using some sort of end-of-course testing in order to satisfy the test requirements of NCLB.   We have EOCTs in Georgia, but it is the high school graduation test that determines whether or not a school makes adequate yearly progress.   In Mississippi, some school districts apparently decided not to give the test to students who had not taken the courses.   Why would you give a test over algebra to a student who had never taken the algebra course?   And truly, this makes sense to me, except it does not make sense to the federal DOE. \n At least one parent is quoted as liking the idea, and for students with milder disabilities, can understand that.    I sat in on several IEPs this past year where the student was going to go through the alternate assessment simply because they had not taken the course work.   His is one bad thing about using the graduation test, because now the student is in 11 th  grade which is long past where he/she should have taken those courses.   At least this way, a student who missed one year can take the course and the test the next year.    But the problem is that these students will often need much more support and time to acquire mastery over these core skills.   And this sucks time away from other things like actually learning some practical job or life skills.   Sure, the kid can now do U.S. history but they can\u2019t balance a checkbook or make change. \n I\u2019m going to say it again: what kind of rigorous standards are you setting when you expect someone with an I.Q. of 50 to master them?   \nYou dishonor the students who are really working hard to show mastery of high academic standards and do a disservice to the students with cognitive disabilities who needs multiple trials (about 500) just to master a new skill.   Is solving a quadratic equation so essential that the student must forfeit time that might be spent learning to count money, or fill out a job application? \n A U.S. spokewoman for the U.S. DOE (Jo Ann Webb says that only Mississippi and Maine are having issues with including special ed students.   And that is patently false.   Every  state has struggled with the special education subgroup, and every single one has had to struggle with making grade level standards available to those with severe disabilities.   Mississippi and Maine are simply the last ones to be thoroughly victimized and sodomized by NCLB\u2019s draconian and senseless insistence on bringing a regular high school curriculum to students who have I.Q.\u2019s in the single digits. \n Here\u2019s one other funny yet sad thing about this: thanks to this several schools will fail to make AYP.   When they fail to make AYP, extra help must be made available and students are allowed to transferred to other schools.   The problem is this: how does transferring to another school help our severely intellectually disabled kids?   How does extra tutoring in physics and geometry help them learn to use the bathroom independently?   Can extra tutoring in U.S. history or economics help them feed or dress themselves?   The fact is, parents see only that the school failed to make AYP, not that it was only the one subgroup that didn\u2019t make it.   All of the college bound kids may be doing exceptionally well with outstanding teachers and yet the entire school is sanctioned by that label. \n News flash: that\u2019s not accountability.   That\u2019s stupidity.   If you want to measure accountability, how about measuring the performance of those students who have actually been taught the courses and for whom written standardized tests are appropriate. \n I still can\u2019t believe anyone would still be supporting NCLB after is has fish-gutted education so badly.   No amount of extra funding can fix something that is so discriminatory and unjust. \n I\u2019ll quit now, before I blow a gasket.

{"date": "2007/06/29", "body": "\n \u00a0 I said I was going to do it and I really did. \u00a0  Unfortunately I might have made a mistake. \u00a0 I signed up for the  GACE  biology test. \u00a0  I should have looked at the review questions first. \u00a0  Out of 18 practice questions, I was only able to answer 7 of them correctly. \u00a0  This just won\u2019t do! \u00a0  I have a biological science background with the agriculture, botany, genetics and biochemistry, but it has been over 15 years since I did stuff with the Krebs cycle and photosynthesis. \u00a0  \u00a0 In contrast, I took the science practice test and scored 17 out of 20, which is a lot better than I thought I\u2019d do. \u00a0  The physical science stuff stuck with me better since that is what I spent the most time teaching way back in the day. \u00a0  The geology section is a bit rusty, and I don\u2019t have much of a background in that at all. \u00a0  But that\u2019s the test I should have taken. \u00a0  Oh well. \u00a0 So I\u2019m busily studying an old college biology hoping to bone up on the subject. \u00a0  I hate the thought of wasting $120 like that. \u00a0  I took the NTE version of this thing back in 1989 or so and passed, but that was then. \u00a0  \u00a0 The purpose of this testing is to open up some new teaching options for me. \u00a0  As much as the world of severe disabilities has chosen me, I feel like it is beginning to UNchoose me. \u00a0  There are many factors coming into play.  \u00a0 The alternate assessment is certainly significant, but it\u2019s not the only thing. \u00a0  Taz\u2019s mother is driving me batty as she works at the school. \u00a0  If it were just for 4 or 5 years, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal. \u00a0  But 7 or 8 years; it\u2019s almost like some sort of marriage or something! \u00a0  It\u2019s longer than most military enlistments! \u00a0  It\u2019s a long time to have the same kids everyday day after day. \u00a0 \u00a0  I\u2019ve had Spaz for 6 years and I\u2019m coming up on 7 years with him. \u00a0  Even though he walked for graduation, he can stay through his 22nd birthday. \u00a0  So he will be staying around another year. \u00a0  It just takes so long to finish out a student and progress is often at a glacial pace. \u00a0  \u00a0 The physical nature of the work is something I have to watch out for. \u00a0  In my mid 40\u2019s, I\u2019m no spring chicken. \u00a0  I do okay with the lifting but having to do all of it all the time will get old quickly since Coach will be gone. \u00a0  Larry and  Ravi  require constant lifting and moving and they continue to grow and get bigger! \u00a0  \u00a0 And with only 20 years to retirement, I need to find a quieter place to settle in and do the minimum amount of work necessary in order to draw a salary until my golden years. \u00a0 \u00a0 Just kidding! \u00a0 The pull and attraction of doing collaborative work involves marrying my science background with my Sp. Ed. experience plus possibly helping some other teachers with classes that are becoming more and more diverse. \u00a0  Inclusion is becoming more and more of a reality and I wouldn\u2019t mind getting in on that wave while it\u2019s still cresting. \u00a0 And since I\u2019m chained to the oars of the NCLB slave galley, like every other teacher, I\u2019d at least like to be on the productive side of things. \u00a0  This monkey-brained alternate assessment crap is for the birds. \u00a0  I can have an opportunity to work in the golden zone, and push a few over the line into a passing score. \u00a0 I feel like I\u2019m being pushed along plus enticed into something better. \u00a0  But I\u2019m going to do another year of this business and see how it goes. \u00a0 D. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.gace.nesinc.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/06/29/i-actually-did-it/", "title": "I actually did\u00a0it"},

{"date": "2007/06/28", "body": "\u00a0 I recently attended my 25 year class reunion.  This was the first reunion I was able to attend and it was a lot of fun.  I had a chance to catch up with a number of old friends.  My, how things and people change!  The guys particularly were a major challenge to identify as the women seemed to age better or change less dramatically.  There were several guys who I had no idea who they were, even before drinking anything at the bar. \u00a0 \u00a0 On Friday night, a bunch of us met at about the only bar around that still existed 25 years ago.  We had a discussion about how lousy most of us were in math and came to the conclusion that we had some very poor math teachers.  Indeed, starting in middle school, every math teacher we had, without exception, was a coach of of some sort.  And coaching seemed to be the major focus rather than the teaching of math as this was a small school and athletics were the center of school and small town life. \u00a0 \u00a0 However, it wasn\u2019t totally the fault of my mediocre math teachers.  The next night of our reunion were had a banquet honoring the alumni from several years, and I noticed the ones who were  not  at the bar the night before.  Pretty much the same smart folks who were not partying in high school were not in on the discussion we had in the pub over a few beers.  This made me think that perhaps there might have been as strong of a correlation between the lifestyles of the students and their grades and study habits as there was with our teacher/coaches. \u00a0 \u00a0 Outside of math, I think we had some good teachers in high school and we got a good basic education.  We were certainly all literate as I can\u2019t remember anyone who couldn\u2019t read in middle school.  I also don\u2019t remember the newspaper ever publishing the school\u2019s test scores or comparing them to neighboring districts.  Such was the culture of small town Iowa schools 25 years ago.  When I eventually moved to Georgia I was surprised to see scores in the paper and even more shocked at the low scores that schools actually  bragged about!   Any school a point or two above the state or national average claimed bragging rights.  I know in the testing game there will be winners and losers, but when did mediocrity come to be something we bragged about and published in the paper?!? \u00a0 \u00a0 Other than the Atlanta Hawks or Falcons, of course. \u00a0 \u00a0 I\u2019m happy to say that the math instructional deficit has been lessened at my old school.  The class of \u201982\u2019s valedictorian went on to major in math education and returned to the hometown and is presently teaching math at the old high school.  And she\u2019s not coaching any varsity sports, as far as I know.  Now if her students can refrain from partying long enough maybe they can learn a thing or two! \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/25-years-ago/", "title": "25 Years Ago"},
{"date": "2007/05/02", "body": "\n This is it; IEP day for Thomas.   I have a parent input statement along the lines of the  one done by Charles Fox , along with specific recommendations for goals and services.   And because I do have access to the online file, I went ahead and updated the behavior intervention plan (BIP).   This plan was in place when he was in kindergarten, but for some reason last year it was dropped.   So his teachers hadn\u2019t anything to look at as far as interventions which I\u2019ll make sure that he does this next year. \n Things aligned just right yesterday where I had a chance to observe Thomas in his class for about 30 minutes and talk to his teacher for just a bit.   I picked a good time, because they were doing some \u201cbuddy reading\u201d which basically involved Thomas reading to a para.   Then they had some teacher-led discussion which he actually participated in.   He raised his hand, waited for the teacher to call his name and then contributed to the discussion without talking about trains!   She asked him some follow-up questions and he answered them all appropriately.   Then it was time to right about the story in his journal, and of course this is where the trouble  really  started.   Thomas  hates  written seat work because his fine motor skills are so low.   He basically inherited this disability from his dad who had the same sort of problems when he was little.   But getting Thomas to just get started by writing the date was a major chore.   I was set to take interval data on on-task vs off-task but there wasn\u2019t much comparison to do because he was off-task almost the entire time.   \n I have 2 10\u00d710 grids on a sheet of paper, and mark O\u2019s for on-task and X\u2019s for off-task behaviors.   I also write definitions of each on the paper, based on the activity.   One grid is for Thomas and the other is for some other random student in the room as a basis of comparison.   While I didn\u2019t have a timer or stopwatch, I was able to very roughly look at Thomas, record the data, look at the other student, record the data and go back and forth.   I was roughly looking for 6 second intervals, which translates into marking one row per minute. \n As I said, Thomas was off task on 90% of the intervals while the student I picked for comparison was on-task almost 100% of the time.   Not a good comparison, as there were other students who were off-task a lot more.   I watched the para keep trying to get him to do his work by cajoling him, talking and generally trying to persuade him,   \u201cYour daddy wants to see how you can do good work!\u201d   While persuasion is good, there wasn\u2019t much firmness in her voice at all.   So after 2 minutes, I quit the data collection and went over and worked on him myself.   He was trying everything he could to escape the task, including saying that he was sick and didn\u2019t feel good.   Evidently this tactic works sometimes, because it does elicit sympathy from the para.   In fact, the reason I observed was because Jane called me saying they had called her.   They seemed to want her to come and get Thomas, which was just par for the course as far as his behavior. The school nurse said he didn\u2019t need to go home but the teacher or para kept pestering Jane.   It just so happened I was between IEPs at the middle school, so I was able to go over for a quick visit. \n Jane and I are a bit frustrated with the apparent helplessness of the teachers, but now that I see they had  no  behavior intervention plan to work from their difficulties make more sense.   This is why we\u2019re having more written input this year because we want to make sure future teachers and paras have some accurate information from which to work. \n I\u2019ll post more after the meeting and hopefully there won\u2019t be much to write about.   Even though y\u2019all might find the drama entertaining, I\u2019d rather keep that to a minimum if it\u2019s all the same to you!

{"date": "2007/03/01", "body": "Part of the deal with  Reflective Teacher\u2019s nomination  and\u00a0  Alsoomse  I just found out!) was that I had to name 5 other bloggers that make me think.  That\u2019s easy enough.  The hardest is limiting it to 5 because there are so many who make me think.  So here are my nominations for the Thinking Blogger Awards: 1.  Kristina Chew  is just an outstanding writer, educator and parent.  A body can not help but read her without learning something.  A parent asked me awhile back about other parent blogs and if I had to recommend just one this would be the one for autism. 2.   Liz from  I Speak of Dreams  has been invaluable to the development of this place through her own blog.  She keeps up on all the latest mostly on Learning Disabilities but also disability news in general.  For anyone who is looking for the latest in the world of LD, she\u2019s the one to go to. 3.  Nickie : You think  you\u2019ve  got drama?  There is no possibility of  NOT  being inspired by this blogger\u2019s story.  Articulate and well-written.  Just go and visit. 4.  Autism Diva : This was probably the blog that started changing my view of autism the most.  She moved my thinking from the whole \u201cvictim\u201d mentality towards being more willing to embrace the \u201cdifferentness\u201d of autism as well as  my own  autistic-like issues.  It\u2019s not all about suffering. \n5.  John wills Lloyd who I mostly read at  Teach Effectively  (although you\u2019ll see other blogs of his in the blogroll).  The good professor keeps his finger on the pulse of effective teaching practice in special education.  He\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s effective as well as point out the junk that is popular but NOT effective.  Visual, auditory, kinesthetic/tactile learning anyone?

{"date": "2007/03/12", "body": "It\u2019s that time of year, again.\u00a0 A time special education teachers find themselves stressed: IEP Annual Reviews.\u00a0 And I\u2019m going to talk about those annual reviews but I want to spend a minute on a special IEP process that is dreaded by all parties even more than an IEP.\u00a0 That would be the manifestation meeting.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to speak primarily to/about case managers here, but parents would do well to pay attention in order to better understand the process. My kids will never see a manifestation because virtually every strange behavior can be attributed to having a severe or profound cognitive disability.\u00a0 Also, my kids are supervised 24/7 and if there was a manifestation someone would probably be fired in the process. A manifestation determination meeting is triggered by some disciplinary action that will effectively change a student\u2019s placement.\u00a0 For instance, if a student is suspended for more than 10 days or expelled or if they are going to an alternative school or boot camp or to a more restrictive setting. The purpose of the manifestation hearing is to answer 2 basic questions: \u2013 Are whatever charges against a student a manifestation of their disability? \nand \n\u2013 Are whatever charges brought against a student a direct result of the school\u2019s failure to provide services to the student as outlined in the IEP? If the answer to both of these questions is \u201cNo\u201d then it\u2019s pretty much a slam dunk that the student\u2019s actions were not a manifestation of the disability.\u00a0 That does not mean the student is automatically guilty or not guilty, it simply means that the local education agency can now go through the more typical disciplinary process. I was at one such meeting last week and it was interesting.\u00a0 The parent was there and I believe that she is not the first parent to arrive at a manifestation thinking that this meeting was going to determine her son\u2019s fate.\u00a0 So let us suppose as just an example that the charge was larceny (stealing) in which he might have accepted money that he knew was stolen.\u00a0 Charges are filed and a manifestation was triggered because the pending penalty for this was 10 or more days suspension. The meeting is run almost exactly like an IEP.\u00a0 There are more administrators and teachers there, but we went through the steps.\u00a0 We signed in, made introductions and gave the parent a copy of her rights.\u00a0 The specific charges were presented and then a present level of performance was given. If you\u2019ve read my article on that, you know that a parent can present their own and introduce other people like private service providers to present a current picture of performance.\u00a0 Like a regular IEP, this will lay groundwork for future actions and decisions.\u00a0 This particular student was being served for a specific learning disability in the area of written expression.\u00a0 What the heck does written expression have to do with stealing money from someone\u2019s purse?\u00a0 To most, it looks like a slam dunk for the district.\u00a0 But teachers did present little things that a savvy parent could have picked up on.\u00a0 For instance, one teacher did notice that the student seemed to lack focus.\u00a0 He seemed to be somewhat impulsive.\u00a0 He had difficulty staying on task.\u00a0 He was not turning in assignments.\u00a0 Otherwise he was not a disciplinary problem and seemed to try hard in some of his classes. Can you spot the opening?\u00a0 Poor impulse control and poor reasoning are things that might lead one to steal or succumb to peer pressure to accept stolen goods.\u00a0 As a parent, you may have to pry a bit to make a small crack into a bigger opening in order to get help for your student. This student did not have a behavior intervention plan as part of their IEP and no functional behavior assessment (FBA) was done.\u00a0 I can say that an FBA specific to stealing for this kid would not be worth much.\u00a0 But impulse control and better judgment might be worthy goals to consider.\u00a0 Attempting to identify the function of his thievery might be a worthwhile at least informally.\u00a0 Was it peer pressure?\u00a0 Was it maliciousness? As a teacher, being notified of having to do a manifestation can send your blood pressure soaring.\u00a0 You\u2019re pretty much guaranteed that at least one administrator and parent will be there along with a host of other colleagues.\u00a0 And you\u2019re guaranteed that emotions will be running a bit high.\u00a0 You\u2019re truly in the middle between parent and administration.\u00a0 You don\u2019t get much notice and have a hard deadline to meet for having it all ready. So if you\u2019re a new teacher, how do you prepare for a manifestation?\u00a0 What are your responsibilities as a caseload manager? Each district might be slightly different, but there are a couple of areas that will always be the same.\u00a0 First off, look at the most current IEP.\u00a0 Is it, indeed, current? \u00a0Is the eligibility up to date?\u00a0 Is the student currently getting all the services in the IEP?\u00a0 Does the student have a behavior intervention plan (BIP)?\u00a0 Is it based on a functional behavior assessment (FBA)?\u00a0 If there is no FBA, you\u2019re going to have to do a very quick and very dirty one.\u00a0 This is why I continue to advocate every student with a BIP also have an FBA.\u00a0 It\u2019s much better to have a proper one done in advance than a poor one hastily cobbled together when you\u2019re desperate and stressed. The present level of the IEP will have to be updated for the manifestation to reflect the most current status as far as attendance, grades, and disciplinary records.\u00a0 A counselor and psychologist can be helpful members of the manifestation committee. The caseload manager is primarily responsible for all things having to do with an IEP because the manifestation hinges on the implementation of that document.\u00a0 More than one due process hearing has started in a manifestation.\u00a0\u00a0 On occasion, the manifestation meeting will transform into an IEP committee meeting, especially if it is determined that the incident in question is a manifestation of the child\u2019s disability.\u00a0 Then it is a matter of assembling supports and services that can better serve the student. Beyond the mechanics of the manifestation, there are some other considerations that a caseload teacher needs to assess.\u00a0 These probably won\u2019t be mentioned in any text but it has to do with the agenda of the system vs the student.\u00a0 The administrator in charge of the manifestation is definitely voicing the views of the district.\u00a0 The parent is advocating for their child.\u00a0 Whose side are you on?\u00a0 This is going to be evident in how you assemble your part of the hearing.\u00a0 There is considerable pressure to always go along with the district.\u00a0 Remember the question about implementing the IEP?\u00a0 That usually falls heavily on the case manager.\u00a0 However there are ethical considerations that when violated may haunt you for a long time.\u00a0 Sometimes the district is just trying to get rid of a kid they would rather not serve at all.\u00a0 In almost every instance, the district does NOT want an incident to be a manifestation of the student\u2019s disability.\u00a0\u00a0 Being determined as a manifestation of a student\u2019s disability represents some failure on the part of the district to provide sufficient support.\u00a0 They are interested in getting to the tribunal or other regular disciplinary process. All I\u2019m saying is, be prepared to be pressured but do not automatically assume the district is correct or right in their assertions.\u00a0 Having said that, I would strongly recommend getting as many facts as possible and investigate as much as possible.\u00a0 If you, as a case manager, see the possibility that this might be either a manifestation of a student\u2019s disability or a manifestation of the school\u2019s failure to provide services, you really need to talk to the administrator before hand.\u00a0 They may not appreciate it at first, but they have to appreciate your knowledge and expertise in the field.\u00a0 They may respect it even more if the parent brings an advocate.\u00a0 Surprises at this point are not going to be appreciated, so do not wait until the manifestation to spring your view that the district has no case. I\u2019m going to split this topic in two, because I think I need to speak directly to parents about this issue.\u00a0 If you are a case manager, it would do well to read that part as well.\u00a0 You need to know all the angles here.\u00a0 One other helpful resource is  found here . Part 2 can be  found here . d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.behavioradvisor.com/ManifestDetermination.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/03/12/iep-process-manifestation-determination-part-1/", "title": "IEP Process: Manifestation Determination Part\u00a01"},
{"date": "2007/05/03", "body": "That\u2019s what Thomas\u2019 teacher said yesterday after our IEP meeting.   There wasn\u2019t a whole lot of drama, but there were issues that we managed to work through. \n One was the issue of PE.   The regular PE teacher described the atmosphere of PE as about 60-70 kids in the gym, doing all sorts of different activities (several groups running at the same time) with different equipment all going at the same time.   It was described as organized chaos and extremely loud.   Basically I was wondering how  anyone  could function in an environment like that!   The adaptive PE teacher is someone I know very well, and she was there and offered to try to help with modifications.   So we postponed an APE referral because he probably wouldn\u2019t qualify anyway. \n The input statement went over really well.   His case manager really doesn\u2019t work with him at all, so she was really searching for some input for his current level of functioning.   This turned out to be a gold mine for her, which wasn\u2019t exactly the intention, but it still served a very important purpose and it will again in the fall. \n They had community goals written and I told the case manager that we could just skip those and delete them all.   There was nothing in the present level to indicate the need for CBI services.   It was just something the 1 st  grade teacher recommended that she thought would be nice.   The CBI teacher was there, and I know her fairly well.   I think she got a bit defensive about the fact that I didn\u2019t want him in CBI, but I did smooth it over later when we went ahead and okay\u2019ed resource services for him with her as his resource teacher and case manager.   She was basically really wanting and needing some sort of affirmation of her abilities. \n I\u2019ve encountered this several times during Thomas\u2019 IEP meetings where the service providers all want to hear something that affirms that they are doing the right thing.   I don\u2019t always deliver, and it\u2019s not intentional.   I\u2019m not trying to make people feel bad or incompetent; I just deliver the reinforcement to those most deserving at the time.   I never thought of the lack of positive feedback as a big negative, but they sometimes take it that way. \n Anyway, he will still be getting speech and OT plus an hour/day for resource.   This future-resource teacher has been to most of Thomas\u2019 meetings and it wasn\u2019t till the end that I discovered that she really wanted to be his case manager all along.   Who knew?   I would describe her as experienced and competent, and feel okay with her helping him and the teachers and paras he will be dealing with.   She\u2019s had some of the same training that I have in the area of autism and is one of the few in the building that knows anything about it.   So I\u2019m hopeful that he can continue to make progress in all areas. \n I saw his achievement test results and was like, \u201cYOWZA!\u201d   Given the WJ mini-Battery, his reading was in the  5 th  grade  range and his writing was in  4 th  grade  range!   His math and factual knowledge was pretty much right on at grade 1.6.    So academically, there\u2019s not much reason for the extra support, it\u2019s all the behavioral stuff which I think is common for many individuals with autism.   It was certainly the issue for me when I was his age.   I didn\u2019t like all the busy work that teachers gave and to me it seemed pointless to keep doing the same exercises over and over.   This is why I\u2019m not very good at helping him with his homework because it gets to a point where I sort of see his point: I know he can do this.   He knows he can do it.   His teachers know he can do it.   So what\u2019s the purpose of wasting the time in proving mastery over and over?   Let\u2019s just get it over with so we can watch Sponge Bob! \n The meeting went well, all things considered, and we actually finished in about 2 hours which is a record for us.

{"date": "2007/05/09", "body": "I\u2019m dead in the middle of IEP writing (and LEAing) but I need to say a word or two about End Of Course Testing or EOCT\u2019s. \u00a0  The EOCT\u2019s are the brainchildren of our own Georgia state legislature, who decided that they would develop and pass their own version of NCLB and require these tests for certain subject areas. \u00a0  Fortunately, my kids are all exempt and so the impact upon my little universe is minimal. \u00a0  However, for the 95% of the rest of the school, it is significant. \u00a0  I mean  really significant. \u00a0 This entire week, Mon-Thursday, the schedule is modified and we are effectively on a block schedule. \u00a0  Since we\u2019re not used to this, it really causes problems with students who have to sit in their classes for about 2 hours, whether they are taking a test or not. \u00a0  The result is that students (and teachers) are incredibly bored by the second hour. \u00a0  Tons of students are getting restroom passes and wondering the halls. \u00a0 For those who are taking the tests, the pressure is really on. \u00a0  The state  mandates  that the EOCT count as 15% of the final course grade. \u00a0  So failing these tests can have dire consequences, especially since we are less than 3 weeks from graduation. What makes these tests sort of stupid and redundant is that the subjects currently being tested are exactly the same areas that are measured by the Georgia High School Graduation Test (GHSGT). \u00a0  I recognize these because they are the same areas that I had to look at for the dreaded GAA! \u00a0  \u00a0 So basically, an entire week of instruction is piddled away for more testing. \u00a0  I suppose one could argue that the EOCT is a good warm-up for the GHSGT. \u00a0  The GHSGT counts towards a school\u2019s AYP, but the EOCT does not. \u00a0  The EOCT counts towards a student\u2019s grade, but the GHSGT is basically pass-fail. \u00a0  A student can theoretically fail an EOCT and still pass a course, but if they fail the GHSGT they will have to retake the portion that they fail. \u00a0 Clear as mud? \u00a0 EOCT\u2019s can be taken as either paper-pencil tests or they can be taken on the computer online. \u00a0  Last year, 880,000 students took an EOCT and about 80,000 were administered online. Schools have the option of doing either or both. \u00a0  Here in Magnolia County, we do pencil-paper tests and then make-up tests are done online. \u00a0  \u00a0 The reason I know all of these fascinating facts is because our beloved superintendent, Kathy Cox, sent us all some pamphlets explaining all about Georgia\u2019s testing program. \u00a0  You can read it for yourself if you have any questions . \u00a0 Education is pretty much test-focused all around now. \u00a0  Actual learning, acquiring a skill, successful work habits and anything promoting good character has really been taken over by The Test, whatever the test happens to be for your state and grade level.  \u00a0 The rationale happens to be that testing informs instruction, but if that were true it would be done at the  beginning  of the school year, not at the end. Here we are, taking tests a couple of weeks before graduation.\u00a0 What good does that do  anyone? \u00a0  By the time school starts again (which will be in about 9 weeks from now for us) these tests will be forgotten. \u00a0  A new group of teachers will come into our school who have never seen these tests and will have to start all over again. \u00a0  It might have some value for returning teachers, but this is buffered by the fact that it will be a whole new crop of students taking their courses. \u00a0 One other reason the DOE gives for these tests is so they can ensure all students have access to a quality curriculum. \u00a0  It\u2019s the same rubbish they gave us about the GAA. \u00a0  A test does  not  ensure access to a quality curriculum, it only mandates minimum standards. \u00a0  It simply ensures all students have access to a  test! \u00a0  Assessments are good and necessary, but they should be ongoing, done within the regular routine of instruction, provide near instant feedback and not disrupt the entire school system. \u00a0  Tests are only a tool, but they have turned into the sole engine for education today. \u00a0  It\u2019s like throwing a hammer into a boat and expecting it to sail around the world. \u00a0  A hammer is a perfectly good tool, but it takes a lot more than that to get a ship to sail. \u00a0  \u00a0 Good luck to those of you taking EOCT\u2019s or giving EOCT\u2019s or having to fiddle with whatever testing is mandated for students in your state and grade level. \u00a0  Summer will be here before you know it! \u00a0 Now I\u2019ve got to get back to my own paperwork nightmare. \u00a0  If nothing else, the GAA made IEPs look pretty simple by comparison. \u00a0 Dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://public.doe.k12.ga.us/DMGetDocument.aspx/Testing%20Newsletter%20FINAL.pdf?p=6CC6799F8C1371F684B90AD0BF50E2823D1430BC7D1DBC33ACE614F238EF2455&Type=D"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/05/09/eoct/", "title": "EOCT"},

{"date": "2006/03/27", "body": "\u00a0 It's interesting reading how \nteachers react to certain kinds of students.\u00a0 \nThey are most often indignant with students not doing homework and not \ncompleting assignments.\u00a0 A good student \nis someone who turns in all their work, has it done neatly and completely and \non time.\u00a0 Even if they aren't the highest \nachievers, if they can do those things, they will usually be seen as good \nstudents. These good students are striving for A's all the time, with an \noccasional B. Apparently, most teacher bloggers seem to be from that fine \n\"good student\" tradition, and they can not understand why any of \ntheir students wouldn't do likewise.\u00a0  \u00a0 I am not from that \"good \nstudent\" tradition.\u00a0 I hated \nhomework and never did a lick of it in high school.\u00a0 If I couldn't get it done in class, I \nprobably wouldn't do it at all.\u00a0 And \nthose assignments that I did turn in were rarely complete, almost always sloppy \nand often turned in late.\u00a0 If at \nall.\u00a0 I wasn't disruptive in class, and \ndidn't back-talk my teachers.\u00a0 In fact, I \ndid listen and participate in class.\u00a0 But \nwritten work was painful for me, who has terrible handwriting.\u00a0 I was always gigged on neatness. \u00a0 Also, getting an 'A' was not a \ngoal of mine.\u00a0 I was keen to learn, but I \nhardly saw how doing half-a-dozen worksheets demonstrated how smart I was.\u00a0 I did, however, do well on tests.\u00a0 Especially standardized tests.\u00a0 So year after year, my mother would talk to \nmy teachers who would tell her, \"He has all kinds of potential, but he \njust won't do the work!\"\u00a0 Most of \nthe homework given by teachers is crap.\u00a0 \nSorry for being so blunt, but I've yet to see much in the way of \nhomework that is worth doing.\u00a0 So you \nsee, I'm still belligerent.\u00a0 College is \nmore self-directed, and I do see more value in what goes on there.\u00a0  \u00a0 I recognized early on that \ngetting a 'C' was not the end of the world.\u00a0 \nNeither was a 'D'.\u00a0 I even got an \n'F' or two.\u00a0 I might have gotten 2 or 3 \n'A's in high school and a handful of B's.\u00a0 \nMy high school GPA was a 2.06.\u00a0 \nBut my attendance was near perfect.\u00a0 \nAnd sure enough, I haven't been asked for my H.S. GPA in over 2 decades. \u00a0 My son is now bringing homework \nhome and he seems to have inherited my attitude as well as my poor fine motor \nskills.\u00a0 So much of what is sent home for \nhim to work on is \"busywork\" that requires his mother (and on rare \noccasions, his father) to stand over him.\u00a0 \nThe boy is in kindergarten but reads on the 3rd or 4th grade reading \nlevel, making him smarter than I was at his age.\u00a0 He is in the accelerated reader program and \nhas gotten perfect scores on nearly every test he's taken.\u00a0 But he drives his teachers batty by not doing \nhis work.\u00a0 His mother was a good student, \nso she shares your collective exasperation at my lackadaisical attitude. \u00a0 I did get a 2 point something \nfor an undergraduate GPA.\u00a0 College was \nharder and it did take awhile to become more self-directed.\u00a0 But, again, no one has asked about my college \nGPA.\u00a0 Or my GRE scores.\u00a0 You don't care about mine and I could care \nless about yours.\u00a0  \u00a0 In my Master's program and all \nclasses since, I've gotten A's all the way.\u00a0 \nI finally, after 30 years, decided to apply myself in my studies. But it \nwas never about the 'A', it was about increasing my knowledge and skills.\u00a0 In my graduate studies I too frequently \nencountered an attitude of \"Just give me the 'A' and the degree so I can \nget out of here!\"\u00a0 Fact is, without \nimbibing some knowledge, the grade is meaningless, and the work done to get it \neven more so.\u00a0  \u00a0 In primary and secondary school, \nI frustrated my teachers.\u00a0 When one of my \nex-teachers heard I was going to be teaching EBD, she said, \"Nice to know \nsomeone is getting into the business that knows something about it!\"\u00a0 I was, in fact, referred for testing for \nspecial education in the 7th grade by a teacher who I frustrated with my \nlaziness.\u00a0 Mom was hoping they'd find \nsomething, but she was disappointed to learn that I just had a lack of \nmotivation as opposed to some sort of legitimate disability..  \u00a0 To those of you presently \nfrustrated by students who are apparently lazy, like I was, I want to say that \nit isn't personal.\u00a0 Chances are, a kid \nwho finds your work not worth doing probably finds the work most other teachers \nassign isn't worth doing.\u00a0 I generally \nliked all my teachers.\u00a0 I didn't take the \n'F's and zeros personally.\u00a0 Just because \nI didn't care about my grades didn't mean that I didn't like learning.\u00a0  \u00a0 To this day, I still abhor \nredundancy and busy work, which causes a few problems in my work as a special \neducation teacher.\u00a0 We live and die by \nthe paperwork we have to produce.\u00a0 I have \nbeen known to procrastinate, cut a corner or two on the forms and generally \nannoy my supervisors just a bit regarding forms that are due.\u00a0 I'm focused on my students and their parents, \nnot the pencil pushers at the county office.\u00a0 \nThanks to the computer, I am a writer and my stuff is evaluated more on \ncontent rather than my scrawly handwriting. \u00a0 I'd like to hear about other \npoor-ish students who made good later in life.\u00a0 \nAny other teachers who ascended from the ranks of academic mediocrity? \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/03/27/what-kind-of-student-were-you/", "title": "What Kind of Student Were\u00a0You?"},
{"date": "2006/03/23", "body": "Imagine you could teach in a comfortable environment working with students 1:1.\u00a0 There is no lunch duty, no bus duty, a fraction of the paperwork that you normally would have to do.\u00a0 While you do assessments and write progress reports, you don\u2019t have to worry about grades.\u00a0 While accountable to your professional organization and perhaps one supervisor, you are not pressured by NCLB, high stakes testing, IDEA or other regulations.\u00a0 You have greater access to needed resources. You also stand to make more money.\u00a0 The downside is that you might not get the vacation breaks, and the medical benefits might not be as good. \u00a0You also might be working later in some afternoons and some on weekends. If you had the opportunity to do it, would you? This is the sort of choice several of my colleagues face every year.\u00a0 Namely those who are occupational, physical and speech therapists.\u00a0 At the present time, the 2 PTs that serve students in Magnolia county have a leg in both, as they do 2 days per week in the school system and the rest of the time they see students/clients privately.\u00a0 We have 6 or 7 OT\u2019s, with a couple of those working part time.\u00a0 The one that serves my students is mostly working for the benefits, since her husband is self-employed.\u00a0 The SLP that serves Magnolia County High School does it for the love of the job, although she also likes the medical benefits.\u00a0 Each therapist has a caseload of at least 60-75 students, in addition to any new referrals that happen to come in.\u00a0 Which means they are writing goals and reports and attending IEP meetings for all of those students.\u00a0 The facilities they work in consist of closets, storage rooms or an empty classroom, if they are lucky.\u00a0 The therapists get paid on the same scale as all of the other teachers, so there isn\u2019t any extra money to be had for treating more students.\u00a0 The difference between working in a private clinic and in a school setting can often be dramatic.\u00a0  These therapists, in addition to being in demand treating students with disabilities, are also in demand at hospitals and nursing homes around the country.\u00a0 The training required to become an OT, PT or SLP is extensive and rigorous.\u00a0 There are not many places that offer the necessary training to become one of these therapists, and getting admitted into a \u00a0program is competitive. Basically, I\u2019m highlighting some reasons why there is a shortage of all of these professionals in school systems across the country.\u00a0 The largest shortage is experienced most keenly in the area of speech language pathology, which requires the most training of the three therapy areas I\u2019ve mentioned.\u00a0 In Magnolia County, we are short about 3 therapists due to one being on maternity leave, one who is on medical leave, and one who left the county.\u00a0 We are on the lookout for SLPs as is just about every other district around the country.\u00a0 Because of this shortage, the SLPs that we have working have to pull an extra heavy load.\u00a0 Most of the SLPs we have in the county have been around for years.\u00a0 Our SLP, Miss Cleotis, has been in the system over 25 years, and each year I hear her talk about how she is thinking about retiring.\u00a0 In fact, there was a rumor that she had retired last year, which surprised me.\u00a0 But she was back on the first day of school and I was glad of it.\u00a0 She has been a close colleague and friend over the years, and we have both been through a lot with these students.\u00a0 She has always been supportive of me, although I can\u2019t say that I have always supported her in everything.\u00a0 In fact, it has taken me a few years to learn how to work with all of these therapists who come in to my room and give me more work to do.\u00a0 But I have learned to appreciate all of them, and they have helped me grow in my knowledge and skill in teaching the students I work with.\u00a0 They have all also been very supportive in helping out with my own children, where my oldest (Thomas) was getting PT, OT and speech when he first started.\u00a0 While he no longer gets PT, the therapist is always willing to give advice if I bring up an issue.\u00a0 My youngest (Percy) is being evaluated for OT by the same therapist who works at the high school, so it is nice being able to consult with her on a regular basis. With baby boomers aging, there will be increasing pressure on the limited number of these therapists as the demand increases.\u00a0 You can read teacher Sol\u2019s treatment of the subject  here . \u00a0 You can also read about the trouble the Baltimore schools are having in delivering services  here ,  where the controversy about students not getting services is a direct result of the shortage of service providers.\u00a0 What do you do when the law mandates that certain services  must  be provided, but there is no one around who is qualified to provide it? dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://teachersol.blogspot.com/2006/03/schools-lack-speech-pathologists.html", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/education/bal-te.md.special15mar15,0,7920916.story?coll=bal-education-top"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/03/23/would-go-into-private-practice-if-you-could/", "title": "Would you go into private practice, if you\u00a0could?"},
{"date": "2006/03/21", "body": "I do have some history with working with individuals with learning disabilities and even originally was going to get my master\u2019s in teaching LD before ending up with my degree teaching EBD.\u00a0  \u00a0 The journey actually begins way back in high school with one of my best friends, Sean, who was classified LD.\u00a0 I knew he might have been a little slow, but didn\u2019t treat him as anything less than what he was; a good friend.\u00a0 He and I both grew up milking cows and it would be fair to say he knew more about dairy cows than I did.\u00a0 After high school he was engaged to be married, and when that fell through he moved to Georgia.\u00a0 A few years later, I followed him down. Sean started out trying construction jobs but found he could do fast food work, with the help of an understanding store manager.\u00a0 While he wasn\u2019t too good on the register, he worked the back making sandwiches.\u00a0 He eventually started his own business with pet and house sitting, making a good living at it.\u00a0 He was best man at my wedding and now is married and in the pet sitting business with his new bride.\u00a0 What Sean lacked in raw intellect he made up for with dependability, honesty and determination.\u00a0  \u00a0 I worked with him in fast food for a year or so, before landing a job at a private school that specialized in teaching kids with LD, ADD and dyslexia. It was a boarding school that also had day students.\u00a0 It was a good place to get started as a young teacher, living and working at the same place.\u00a0 None of the faculty were certified, most were pretty young and single.\u00a0 It was a very expensive school that offered tutorial, co-tutorial and small group classes, along with very structured schedules.\u00a0 Boarders had 2 hours of evening study halls before getting some free time.\u00a0 It was rigorous, structured and individualized.\u00a0  \u00a0 The students were from pretty wealthy families, some from other countries.\u00a0 Those who teach LD students know that they often have a repertoire of behaviors that are incompatible with academic success.\u00a0 These kids were, in the words of one administrator, from the \u201cgolden ghettos.\u201d\u00a0 Their parents often spent little time with their kids, preferring to indulge them with material things rather than invest in meaningful discipline and interaction. \u00a0So in addition to being self-indulgent, the students also often had some emotional problems. \u00a0 This was the early 1990\u2019s, and the drug of choice was Ritalin.\u00a0 Most of the boys were on it, and even a few of the girls.\u00a0 The teaching we did was structured, but there was still enough room to be creative.\u00a0 I taught physical science, chemistry and biology.\u00a0 I quickly discovered that I was doing my best work with the slowest kids.\u00a0 I really enjoyed working with them, and teaching these kids required a lot of patience, precision and self-discipline on my part.\u00a0 But the hands-on creativity I employed paid dividends and my students consistently did well on their departmental exams.\u00a0  \u00a0 Despite the fact that each student paid $5000 for each hour of instruction each semester, teachers were not paid very well.\u00a0 Of course, I did get a place to live and free meals, but I was still making less than many paraprofessionals.\u00a0 I began to outgrow the place and yearned for more freedom.\u00a0 In addition to teaching all day, I also did duties 2x per week at night and then one weekend per month.\u00a0 During a typical week, I might put in 60 hours and up to 80 hours if I had weekend duty.\u00a0 It was a good thing I was relatively young because it was a challenging pace to maintain for 3 years.\u00a0 By the end of my 2nd year, I started thinking about getting my Master\u2019s degree in special education.\u00a0  \u00a0 This is my way of introducing you to how I experience the world of LD.\u00a0 As I said, LD students can be among the most fun and entertaining students to work with.\u00a0 They are generally bright, but need help with organization, accountability and perseverence.\u00a0 Many like to give up before they even start a challenging task.\u00a0 My work involved simplifying the process and breaking tasks down into discrete steps that were easier to manage, and then gradually expand the tasks and expectation.\u00a0 I managed to guide some fairly low kids through stoichiometry, balancing chemical equations, learning element names and symbols, learning the parts of the digestive tract, calculating work, force and energy.\u00a0 And we had fun.\u00a0  \u00a0 So I naturally chose this population when starting on my master\u2019s degree.\u00a0 It was a professor who talked me into changing tracks to get into EBD. \u00a0 Students are classified as having learning disabilities on the discrepancy model, meaning there is a discrepancy between aptitude and achievement of 2 standard deviations.\u00a0 So with a mean of 100 and a SD of 15, a student scoring 100 on an I.Q. test and scoring 70 on a reading achievement test would have a reading disability.\u00a0 Officially speaking, the discrepancy can not be accounted for on the basis of a sensory disability, such as being blind or deaf which is why hearing and vision screenings are part of the eligibility process.\u00a0 This is all the official party line.\u00a0 However, there are politics involved with the LD classification that exist no where else. \u00a0 There are 3 mild disability classifications and eligibilities that make up 90% of all students enrolled in special education.\u00a0 One is Emotional Behaviors (EBD).\u00a0 The criteria for EBD also involves falling below the mean by 2 standard deviations along with other behavioral criteria.\u00a0 However, no parent who is half-way savvy wants their child classified as EBD.\u00a0 And if the parent fights hard enough, they can get it changed to something more socially acceptable.\u00a0 Changed to what? \u00a0 One possibility is Mildy Intellectually Disabled (MID) otherwise known as mildly retarded.\u00a0 This, again, involves scoring 2 standard deviations below the mean on various assessments, including adaptive behavior.\u00a0 But, again, not many savvy parents are keen to having their child labeled as being retarded, no matter how we try to disguise it as MID. \u00a0 Which leaves LD as the single most popular of the milder eligibilities.\u00a0 Being learning disabled is a lot less threatening than being emotionally disturbed, and not nearly as socially unacceptable as being retarded.\u00a0 Plus, it works better with person-first language.\u00a0 Most people are fairly understanding of someone with a learning disability.\u00a0 They have less comfort with having a mild intellectual disability and certainly less than having an emotional or behavioral disturbance! \u00a0 In my experience, there is a broad overlap between the mild disability eligibility areas.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t until you get a couple of self-contained classes side-by-side that the contrast comes more sharply into focus. \u00a0 I was a long-term sub in a middle school EBD classroom who happened to have P.E. at the same time as the neighboring LD class.\u00a0 I\u2019ll never forget the kickball game where the EBD kids took on the LD kids.\u00a0 Since I had kids who were skipping or in ISS, I only had 3 kids in the class who took on 10-12 kids in the LD class in a game of kickball.\u00a0 I had misgivings, thinking it was hardly fair for the EBD kids who were outnumbered 4:1.\u00a0 And I was partially right.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t fair. It was a massacre.\u00a0  \u00a0 The LD kids had many more difficulties with their fine and gross motor functioning, motor planning and were just generally more timid.\u00a0 The EBD kids had no such physical limitations and were fearless in their aggressiveness.\u00a0 That was the first time I had seen such a stark contrast between these two groups.\u00a0 After 3 kids with LD kicked the ball and it was either caught or they were thrown out, the EBD kids went on to score 15 or so runs before us teachers said they had to give the other team a chance.\u00a0 The kids with LD were up\u20263 up and 3 down.\u00a0 We had to mangle some rules so they could give everyone a chance to kick the ball.\u00a0 About 2 of the kids with LD made it to first base and none ever scored.\u00a0 It was apparent to me that day that there was a lot more to the LD label than intellectual functioning.\u00a0 There were sensory perception issues that went beyond simple reading comprehension or math calculation.\u00a0 These were bright students who were not seeing the world the same way as most other people, or at least in a way that lent itself to winning a game of kickball against a team they outnumbered. Keep in mind, these were self-contained students who represented the most \u201cdisabled\u201d in their respective categories.\u00a0 It is much more difficult to spot who is who among a group of resourced/mainstreamed students.\u00a0 In fact, if you read the two articles cited below, there is some argument as to whether or not LD is a legitimate category of disability at all. \u00a0 Over at  Education Gadfly  you can read another a rticle on the LD classification in special education .\u00a0 Hat tip to  Liz  who gives her own take  here . \u00a0 \u00a0Once I entered the world the severe and profound, such ambiguities and politics ceased to be factors.\u00a0 Anyone can just look at my kids, and there is no question at all as to whether or not they are exceptional.\u00a0 And I\u2019m okay with that lack of ambiguity. \u00a0 dick \u00a0  \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.edexcellence.net/foundation/gadfly/", "http://www.edexcellence.net/foundation/gadfly/issue.cfm?id=233#2728", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2006/03/the_myth_of_lea.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/03/21/a-few-thoughts-on-learning-disabilities/", "title": "A Few Thoughts on Learning\u00a0Disabilities"},
{"date": "2006/03/20", "body": "    What I am going to discuss is the skepticism that exists within the autism community toward whatever the latest treatment/miracle cure is out there.  I am from a decidedly behaviorist background, and was before becoming a parent.  But my wife Jane was not.  Jane, joining the growing legions of parents in search of cures, treatments and whatever else could help tried all sorts of different things.   First, there was the  Cranial Sacral therapy .  Next was the  GFCF diet .  Then there were the special tonics, herbs, essential oils roots and shoots from various  alternative medicine doctors .  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.  There is  auditory integration therapy ,  aquatic therapy ,  hippotherapy ,  healing crystals ,  megavitamins ,  facilitated communication ,  holding therapy ,  floortime ,  ABA ,  TEACCH ,  video modeling ,  social stories,   light therapy ,  acupuncture ,  chelation therapy   Sensory integration therapy , and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving some out.  A few years ago, someone said their son was cured of his autism by  taking secretin , more traditionally used to treat digestive disorders.  Not long after, doctors were besieged by requests for secretin and a black market developed for it.   You want to know how many research validated treatments there are for autism?  Do you want to know how many treatments are considered well established empirically validated?   I\u2019ll tell you how many: NONE.  How about \u201cProbably efficacious?\u201d NONE.   No single treatment or treatment approach has passed muster to be considered empirically validated according to  Division 12 of the American Psychological Association .  In order to be considered empirically validated, the approach must:   -Have a manual documenting how to do it \u2013 Have been validated through results showing clinical and statistical significance by at least 2 separate studies done by 2 unrelated researchers/teams OR have 5 or more single subject design studies done by separate and independent researchers. \u2013 These studies must all be published in peer reviewed journals -The results must show significant gains or advantages over placebo or other well-established treatments   I might be missing one criterion, but this is the gist of it.  So far, none of my listed interventions for autism have passed muster.  I\u2019m guessing that social stories might be getting close to being \u201cprobably efficacious\u201d which has fewer requirements as far as the number of studies published than that to be considered \u201cempirically validated.\u201d   There is a never-ending supply of charlatans and snake oil salespeople hawking their potions and notions, and none of these are cheap.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, Jane bought $12,000 worth of various extracts, mineral waters and such, plus ordered a myriad of tests.  We didn\u2019t have the money then and are still trying to pay off that credit card bill, 2 years later.  In addition, she took money out of her retirement fund in order to pay for some of this stuff.  By the time I found out, we were on the brink of bankruptcy.   These frauds sell crap, preying on the concern of parents for their children.  They guilt us by saying, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you do  anything  to help your child?\u201d  When it doesn\u2019t work, we are told we didn\u2019t do it right which is shorthand for \u201cwe didn\u2019t spend enough money.\u201d  I\u2019ve seen the shit come and go.  And everyone has something to offer\u2026for a price.  No one is giving this stuff away.  They are impoverishing an entire class of people.   I am pissed at people who prey upon the fears of parents.  No other single disability has been ravaged more by broken promises, and outright lies and deception than parents of people with autism.  I am skeptical of every single treatment option, without exception.  Behaviorist interventions can help with some behaviors, but it is not the final answer.  Anyone who walks into my door, promising to SELL me a cure for my son runs the risk of bodily harm administered by a 2\u00d74.  Our family has been personally held up and robbed by people who are living very well at our expense.  Impoverishing our entire family will not do anything to improve my son\u2019s future.     When someone says they have a cure, a research validated treatment or a promise of recovery from autism, they are telling a LIE.  They are no better than the merchants of terror who institutionalized (and molested) autistic children because of \u201crefrigerator mothers.\u201d   Look out for these lies:   -Anything that claims to be a cure.  There is no cure for autism. \u2013 \u201cWe treat the cause of autism, not the symptoms.\u201d  No one knows what causes autism.  The one who finds it will win the Nobel Prize. \u2013 \u201cScientifically validated.\u201d  There are no empirically validated treatments.  Some have greater scientific support than others. \u2013 \u201cScientifically proven effective.\u201d See above. \u2013 Testimonials by individuals claiming to have been cured.  I have an article where a guy claimed to be cured of autism by smoking crack.  No lie.   Here\u2019s one on Marijuana . Anything claiming to be a cure or treatment is suspect until proven otherwise.  Don\u2019t be fooled by the hype.  Don\u2019t be taken in by false promises.     Go sell crazy somewhere else.  We\u2019re all stocked up here.   dick    ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.reachingyourpotential.com/cranial.htm", "http://www.gfcfdiet.com/", "http://www.pathwaysmed.com/", "http://www.vision3d.com/adhd/#AIT", "http://www.recreationtherapy.com/articles/autismandquatictherapy.htm", "http://www.americanequestrian.com/hippotherapy.htm", "http://www.sobrietystones.com/resources/spiritual_healing_a.htm", "http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ortho.html", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=297&a=3285", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=364&a=2179", "http://www.floortime.org/", "http://www.behavior.org/autism/", "http://www.autism-resources.com/papers/TEACCHN.htm", "http://ideasaboutautism.com/video.html", "http://www.thegraycenter.org/", "http://www.light-and-sound.co.uk/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sci_tech/highlights/010625_tongue.shtml", "http://www.autisminfo.com/chelation.htm", "http://www.arif.bham.ac.uk/Requests/s/sensoryintegrationtherapy-autism.htm", "http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/sped/projects/ose/information/secretin.html", "http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/journals.html", "http://www.autism.org/marijuana.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/03/20/the-fleecing-of-the-autism-community/", "title": "The Fleecing of the Autism\u00a0Community"},
{"date": "2006/03/29", "body": "\u00a0 True to my last post, I\u2019m procrastinating.\u00a0 I\u2019m putting off what I could do today for tomorrow.\u00a0 Specifically, writing up a GAA portfolio. GAA = Georgia Alternate Assessment. \u00a0 NCLB says that all students must be assessed at varying times, in order to determine whether or not the school has made AYP.\u00a0 99% of all students take some sort of standardized test.\u00a0 In Magnolia \nCounty \nHigh School, that would be the high school graduation test.\u00a0 But what about the other 1%? \u00a0 This is where the science of teaching intersects with the art.\u00a0 Students with intellectual disabilities who are in an alternate and functional curriculum can undergo some sort of alternative assessment, which we in \nGeorgia call the GAA.\u00a0 But only 1% of all students may be in the GAA.\u00a0 Every student in the GAA over the 1% mark counts as a failure towards AYP.\u00a0 Otherwise, schools would be herding all of their special education students into alternate assessments. \u00a0 So what, exactly is an alternate assessment?\u00a0 Obviously, my students can not take a pencil and paper test, filling in little bubbles.\u00a0 They would eat the tests, the pencils and possibly the proctors.\u00a0 No amount of accommodation or support is going to get them through such a test.\u00a0 But we still have to measure their progress, somehow.\u00a0 We still have to be held to some sort of rigorous standard of accountability, right George?\u00a0 So how do we get these kids to participate? I\u2019m almost embarrassed to tell you. \u00a0 The year before the student enters the 11 th  grade (when they would be taking the high school graduation test) we sit down at the IEP and decide which goals should be included in the GAA.\u00a0 Actually, I decide because no one else on the committee really cares.\u00a0 I pick out 5 goals, with one of them having to be a communication goal.\u00a0 Making sure to write out the goals as explicitly as possible and making sure it is measurable, I pluck these 5 goals from the IEP, one each from several domains.\u00a0 There are 8 possible domains: Communication (required), Social/emotional, Recreation/leisure, Motor, Community, Vocational, Cognitive/functional academics, Daily living/personal management.\u00a0 So the GAA I\u2019m procrastination on has one objective from the daily living skill domain, specifically to make simple meals such as making a sandwich, with 80% of the steps being done independently over 3 consecutive sessions.\u00a0 Throughout the year, I keep track of him making sandwiches during our daily living skill time and observe how independent he is.\u00a0 Which it turns out, he is almost 100% independent in this.\u00a0 Great!\u00a0  \u00a0 So when his IEP comes, I check off this goal as mastered, and on the GAA recording sheet I get to bubble in \u201cFunctional\u201d as in the goal has been mastered.\u00a0 If he didn\u2019t quite make it, but made 50% or more of his goal, I bubble in \u201cProgressing.\u201d\u00a0 Heaven help me if this student is not either functional or progressing, because that would count as a failure on the AYP.\u00a0 Two other ratings are \u201cEmerging\u201d and \u201cInitial\u201d which we will never ever bubble in again, after we failed to make AYP 2 years ago.\u00a0 Our instructions from our principal are explicit and direct: ALL GAA students MUST be either functional or progressing on all goals.\u00a0 No exceptions.\u00a0 No Excuses.\u00a0 So this is why I picked easy goals that I was pretty sure this student could do.\u00a0 I also pick objectives that are easy to measure.\u00a0 All objectives are supposed to be measurable, and my IEPs are among the few in the world where all of the goals adhere to GAA standards.\u00a0  \u00a0 Up till now, you are wondering; what am I procrastinating on?\u00a0 In addition to bubbling in sheets, I have to write up some sort of portfolio on each objective that is one page long.\u00a0 This should include a discussion of the data collection system, results and discussion of his progress.\u00a0 I\u2019m good with graphs so I can take graduated prompting or discrete trial data to make something that takes up half a page.\u00a0 But then I have to come up with more content.\u00a0 For my sandwich goal, this will be a bit challenging as I can\u2019t find his data sheets.\u00a0 At least I had/have them as most teachers don\u2019t have real data.\u00a0 So I\u2019m going to have to resort to doing what other teachers do: make it up.\u00a0 There\u2019s where the artist in me comes into play.\u00a0 I have data sheets on all the other objectives, but this one doesn\u2019t have much documentation.\u00a0 And  I\u2019M  not going to be the one to have my student cause the entire school to not make AYP.\u00a0 So there you have it.\u00a0 Alternate assessment has a lot of room for subjectivity and messing around which is why only 1% of students are allowed to be in it.\u00a0 For students like mine, the whole concept of AYP is a bit ridiculous since we\u2019re more often concerned with maintaining performance rather than progressing.\u00a0 Students with CP, seizures, other health problems and severe cognitive deficits often get worse as they get older.\u00a0 Students with Down Syndrome frequently have health problems as they enter something akin to \u201cmiddle age\u201d in late adolescence.\u00a0 This is not to say they can not learn, because they can and it\u2019s my job to teach them.\u00a0 But their goals don\u2019t resemble what the rest of the high school students are working on. \u00a0 Next year, the GAA will be aligned with the regular, grade level curriculum.\u00a0 We still do not know how it will manifest itself but changes are coming down the pike that will make things more  difficult  challenging.\u00a0  \u00a0 I guess I might as well stop procrastinating and start writing. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/03/29/alternate-assessment/", "title": "Alternate Assessment"},

{"date": "2006/07/12", "body": "Over on  NCLBlog , there was a  brief discussion on the pay of paraeducators .\u00a0 It just so happens that Jane is considering trying for a position the year after this upcoming one.\u00a0 She downloaded the application and the pay scale and asked me if I could figure it out. \u00a0 Basically it is a level-step system, similar to what teachers have, except there is no explanation of what moves a person from one step or level to the next.\u00a0 This pay scale actually covers all noncertified employees except for bus drivers and monitors who have an entirely different compensation deal.\u00a0 so that would be secretaries, custodians, lunch staff and paras. \u00a0 At level 1, step 1 it starts at about $6.75 and the moves up about $0.35 each level or step.\u00a0 Presumably, education influences the level and time is the step axis on the matrix.\u00a0 But I had to tell Jane that I was not real certain how to figure out what she might expect to make as a para. \u00a0 Jane has a degree in early childhood, and is enjoying teaching at the church preschool.\u00a0 However, the school offers more hours (hence more money) and more benefits.\u00a0 She could get her certificate and go into teaching fairly easy once in the system if she wanted.\u00a0 Being a para is a good way of figuring out if it is something a body really wants to do. \u00a0 But back to the pay, it is pretty appalling.\u00a0 She has a friend who has a master\u2019s degree who was making about $8.00/hr. as a para.\u00a0 So why would anyone do it?\u00a0  \u00a0 In Jane\u2019s case, she likes working with the kids, likes the hours and schedule and the benefits.\u00a0 She also does not like the paperwork and planning involved that teachers have to do. \u00a0 Most of the people I get are mothers (like Jane) looking for another income and with similar hours and schedules as what their children have.\u00a0 There is a major convenience factor in not having to find childcare for school breaks, snow days and summer. \u00a0 It is also a good way to transition into becoming certified.\u00a0 Whatever roadblocks there are should be lifted for moving paras through the professional pipeline and getting them certified, especially in special education.\u00a0 I like the idea of paras being paid interns towards becoming full fledged teachers.\u00a0 People going through traditional teacher preparation programs in special education often get hired provisionally knowing nothing about special ed, while paras may already have several years of experience.  \u00a0 It makes more sense now that NCLB is mandating paras having 2 years of college that something be done to enhance the para experience.\u00a0 If we aren\u2019t going to pay them more for this increased education, the least we could do is fast track them into higher paying positions. \u00a0 One benefit that I don\u2019t think many paras have taken advantage of, is that Magnolia  County has been offering a series of computer courses offered as staff development leading to A+ and MS certifications.\u00a0 Granted it is more time, but since the cost is zero, that is not a bad deal for acquiring some extra marketable skills. In the case of the paras in my program, they are supposed to get trained for driving a bus, which is an entirely different skill set that is marketable. \u00a0 Having said all of this, $6.75/hr is not a lot of money for someone with an associate\u2019s degree or more.\u00a0 In Georgia, people can get a Hope grant to pay for a technical degree or certificate and they will end up making a lot more coming out.\u00a0 Many paras end up having to get another part-time job in order to make ends meet, especially when they are single parents which is the case for half my paras. \u00a0 They really do need to be getting raises at the same time as teachers are getting theirs.\u00a0 It makes sense to do so, because these folks are directly supporting teachers and delivering instruction.\u00a0 Much of what we\u2019re required to do as teachers could not be done without the support of these individuals. \u00a0dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/", "http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/2006/07/paraprofessionals.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/07/12/para-pay/", "title": "Para Pay"},
{"date": "2006/07/21", "body": "Yes, some of you might not want to be reading this, but the days are getting shorter.  Today was the first day back to school with all of the teachers, paras, lunch people, custodians\u2026everyone in Magnolia County in the education business. I, for one, was thankful to be back.  I need the structure and routine that regular work provides.  Maybe I\u2019m a nutcase, but I\u2019m okay with that. I had a chance to see all of our adult characters from last year, and they are all doing well.  Coach had his baby in June and was almost as glad as me to be back at work.  Princess was back, and was her regularly snappy self, Patience was her regular patient self.  Ruth was here, as outspoken as usual.  Queen\u2019s husband had some sort of surgery this morning, but she did make an afternoon appearance.  Oh, and Mr. Pyle was also present.  Did I miss anyone?  We\u2019ll catch up to other supporting characters later. We had breakfast provided by the cheerleaders and a fairly brief meeting, introducing new teachers and providing a schedule for next week.  We don\u2019t have too many new teachers (maybe 10) and most of those were in the social studies department.  Maybe they just haven\u2019t filled the Special Ed. positions, yet. There were several things on my mind upon returning, but the biggest was who was going to be assigned where in our room.  We will only have 5 or 6 students so we don\u2019t need 7 adults.   The word did not come until late in the afternoon when the paras had their meeting to find out their assignments.  Up until that meeting, most of them hung out in our rooom. First of all, Mr. Pyle is assigned somewhere else with a different para.  We don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019ll be teaching or even where, but it will not be in this room.  This is good news for me.  The para assigned to him started out in this room and is pretty competent so maybe it will work out.  Not knowing what he is doing or where he will be is driving him batty, though.  Hopefully that will be resolved on Monday. Ruth is assigned to a different teacher in the department.  I\u2019m a bit surprised she hasn\u2019t retired, but she said she really needs the health insurance as she is not quite eligible for medicaid, yet.   The biggest change for me is the loss of Princess, who is assigned to the same sub-department she came from before joining us.  She\u2019ll be with a different teacher but will still have to work with the teacher she had so much conflict with before.  And THAT worries me.  She might just quit over it, as she has been really happy with being with the SID kids this past year.  But I\u2019m in a bit of a spot. Coach, Queen and Patience are currently assigned to worrk with me.  If I could, I\u2019d send Queen off to work in another setting.  But she has been here forever and politics being what they are she\u2019ll have to be carried out of here.  Coach\u2019s position is pretty safe because he is specifically assigned to Spaz.  That leaves Patience, who worked with Charlie last year who is going to the other school.  Patience might be a better choice to move, although I don\u2019t like the idea of losing her either.  But it would be better than having Princess get drummed out after we had made so much progress last year in building her self-confidence. The other concern I had is about the ones I sent to the new school.  Who would they get to fill that spot?  According to someone who went out there today, they hired a football coach.  One with little or no experience.  Crap.  I know that principal and he has no idea the trouble he is asking for.   I suppose it is worth noting that for the second consecutive year, our school made AYP!  The number of high schools not on the Needs Improvement list is very small, so maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said.  But it was something our principal was excited and happy about.  \n Okay, we are off and running for another year!  I\u2019m glad to have you all along for the ride.  I sense some drama coming up, so stay tuned.  Plus, there are always issuues that come up with educational policy and such that impacts what we do.

{"date": "2006/07/27", "body": "Well, this is it.   Ready or not, tomorrow they are coming.  The school year officially begins for students in Magnolia County as the buses begin rolling, the bell rings and teachers begin teaching.  In many ways, that first day is one of the longest of the year second only to the last day.  This is why starting on a Friday is a good idea that I like.  It gives everyone a full weekend to plan and plot what they are going to do on the next day.   I have been visited by 3 parents during preplanning.  Taz\u2019s mother works here, so I expected to see her.  She has been in a good mood so I\u2019m guessing that she likes the new lunchroom manager.  She will probably NOT like the fact that my door will not be open at 7:30 every morning this year, but we\u2019ll deal with that later. Spaz showed up yesterday with his mother and proceeded to exhibit every bit of his old aggressive behaviors of hitting, kicking, grabbing, pinching and scratching.  Just when I thought we could retire that old data sheet, we will be starting from scratch\u2026or scratches as it is back to the arm pads.  Hopefully we can structure and teach that stuff out of him.  He has spent the entire summer wearing his mother out.  Today he was scheduled for graduation pictures which should be a hoot with his present state of mind. We are getting one new student (that I know of) from the middle school.  While he did not appear, his mother did.  Until I pick out a name, he\u2019s going to be the New Student.  I\u2019d just like something short, easy to remember and vaguely associated with him before getting a name.  He sounds like a sweet boy, but it will take some time to get to know him. Yet to appear is Jim, who was on Mr. Pyle\u2019s caseload and moved here late last year.  He might have moved away over the summer as some of our kids do move quite a bit.  And finally, there is the student I\u2019ll call Larry, who was also on Mr. Pyle\u2019s caseload last year.  I\u2019ll give more info on them as the year goes on. Princess has spent a lot of time in our room and is terribly unhappy about leaving us.  She just walked through here on her way home and registered her anxiety.  I\u2019m not thrilled about losing her, either, but I\u2019ve been trying to encourage her to do her best with this new teacher and with the new students.  I\u2019ve gotten fairly used to the idea of change, so I\u2019m not quite so affected as she is.  It\u2019s a tough concept, change.  You either get it and go with it, or you get resentful and bitter.  Speaking of which\u2026 Mr. Pyle is struggling to adjust to his new world of students with mild disabilities.  He has no idea who will show up at his door tomorrow and he has no idea what to do with them.  Frankly, I understand his discomfort and feel for him.  But none of us have gotten IEP folders for our new students, yet which makes teaching the new kids a challenge. In Georgia, the legislature passed a bill and Gov. Sonny Perdue signed a bill giving each teacher a $100 gift card to spend on educational supplies.  Today, we got our cards which are actually a sort of preloaded Visa card.  The card will only be good Aug. 3-6, when Georgia has it\u2019s tax-free holiday for purchasing school supplies.  If a teacher doesn\u2019t use his/her card, it gets deactivated and becomes useless.  Shoot\u2026that\u2019s next week, already!  It can not be used for clothing, alcohol or other non school supply items.  I have no idea how they\u2019ll tell but they are numbered and we did have to sign for them so they could do some auditing if they had to.  I already know I\u2019ll be buying ink for the new printer the county bought for us AFTER I had ordered ink for the old printer.  And that will pretty much blow the whole thing. On the home front\u2026 Thomas is SO excited about going to school.  The boy has been waking up at around 6:30 all summer long but this week has has gotten up at 6:00 a.m.  He actually is sort of getting the concept of time and is getting pretty into his routine of eating and going to bed at certain times by reading the clock.   He is probably more into time than most other 7 year-olds and certainly more than most 1st graders.  The boy has been trying to reset various clocks in an attempt to move his lunch and dinner times up or moving his bedtime back!! Percy is going to pre-K at a different school than his brother.  He sort of gets this, but it hasn\u2019t fully sank in.  He has been going to a summer session of a church pre-K this month, but going all day, everyday is going to be a new thing for him and will definitely wear him out.   While I have a certain amount of anxiety my wife, Jane, is probably the most anxious of all of us even though she is the only one NOT starting school tomorrow!  Just has major anxiety about 4 year-old Percy riding the big bus and will probably take him to school, herself.  I\u2019m actually encouraging her to let him ride the bus.  First, he really is looking forward to riding it.  Second, driving there is going to be a totally nutty experience for any one on the road that morning.  Seriously, Jane is only one of about 10,000 other (mothers) parents with the same anxiety she has.  Kids pick up on that and they end up having that same anxiety all day at school.   It\u2019s because of all the other Janes on the road that I will have to leave my house in the dark in order to get to school before the roads become too congested.  We do have an elementary school next to the high school, so that traffic tangles with the high school kids and teachers and parents and buses and\u2026well, you get the idea.   Actually, you don\u2019t, because in addition to all of that, our county board of commissioners totally screwed up.  We have two major roads going by the elementary/high schools which allow fairly good traffic flow on a good day.  Guess where construction is going on this week to resurface BOTH of those roads??  I\u2019ll be calling my board member tomorrow and letting him have it.  They have done NOTHING all summer around here and wait until the week that school opens to cut BOTH roads down to one lane? Otherwise, I\u2019m looking forward to getting on with the show.  For those of you still on vacation, reading me may help you appreciate and enjoy the rest of your summer even more!  Here\u2019s hoping that my day is too boring to provide material to post and I can talk about NCLB or IDEA or some other boring but meaningful education topic. dick \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/getting-ready/", "title": "Getting Ready"},
{"date": "2006/07/26", "body": "I began my teaching odyssey back in 1987 in Iowa.  In Iowa, I graduated from an NCATE school and was approved for teacher certification.  I went back and picked up some science endorsements by taking several courses and applying.  It wasn\u2019t until I considered teaching in other states that I became familiar with the testing of teachers.  It seemed incredibly odd to me that I had a certificate from a state with an almost 100% literacy rate and among the best in education by any measure used, and it was not good enough to teach in states struggling to make 50% literacy or a 50% graduation rate.    Georgia seems to exhibit the most hubris for a state routinely looking at 49th or 50th place in education.  I sometimes wonder how I ended up here, as I had taken the National Teacher\u2019s Exam (NTE) in order to teach in several states.  However, this was also not sufficient for Georgia.  They had the Teacher Certification Test (TCT) which I took for Agriculture and later for EBD, despite having a master\u2019s degree from one of their own accredited institutions and programs.  And then they finally went with the Praxis tests, joining other states in assessing their teachers. Are you keeping score?  NTE (an early version of Praxis), TCT, Praxis, and now?\u2026. Georgia has once again decided to go it alone.  Say goodbye to Praxis and hello to the  Georgia Assessments for the Certification of Educators or GACE , pronounced GAY-see.  Beginning this fall, the GACE will be used and beginning next year, the Praxis will no longer be accepted.  For those of us already certified in Georgia, our TCT and Praxis scores will still be good.  They claim this new test is aligned to national standards, but they have not even established validity yet!  I know other states do their own testing and develop their own standards, and that\u2019s the nature of our educational system.  But I think it is a joke.  It seems to me with Georgia consistently bringing up the tail end of educational performance, they would accept certificates from just about any teacher that could help improve things.  But instead, they become even more exclusionary, requiring teachers coming into the state to take Georgia\u2019s version of a test in order to get their certificate.  Which basically means that this is simply revenue machine for the state. And then they wonder why education does so poorly, here.  We just learned that in order to be considered \u201chighly qualified\u201d to teach any self-contained special education classes at the high school level, teachers will also have to take the the MR test.  I already took it, as that is how I moved from EBD to where I am now.  But many of those teachers who thought they would get by with that one test (0511) last year, are now learning that they will need ANOTHER test!  Egad.   The federal regulations for IDEA 2004 are not completed yet, so there are no state regulations, yet.  In other words, we are still working under IDEA 1997.  Not that it was that bad, before, but it just goes to show how slow things work. \u00a0 dick \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.gace.nesinc.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/07/26/the-new-test-for-ga-teachers/", "title": "The New Test for GA\u00a0Teachers"},
{"date": "2006/07/31", "body": "A fellow by the name of Ray Schmitt  wrote an article that  got a mention in the daily CEC news brief.  With the victory of a parent in winning a court judgment for their autistic child as the backdrop, Schmitt writes of his own struggle in deciding whether to go to court for his own daughter: \n \n My point here is that there are times when practicality, reality and a sense of reasonableness must factor into decisions made by parents, schools and the legal system. I went through an agonizing internal debate many years ago, wondering whether I should send my daughter to a private school and fight the county to pay for it. I chose not to because sometimes you just have to accept reality. Sometimes a child is simply unable to learn. It\u2019s one of the most difficult things a parent will ever have to accept, but it\u2019s something to consider. \n If a teacher had written that, it would have been blasphemous sacrilege worthy of an Old Testament-style stoning.  As it is, that second-to-the-last sentence has got to make every parent and educator wince.  Or at least blink.  But in a world where \u201clearning\u201d equals taking and passing a standardized test, he kind of has a point.  The reality is that some students will  never  be able to take and pass a standardized test.  How standard would a test be if  everyone  could pass it?  There are a few things about Schmitt\u2019s article that do merit some discussion.  First, he tells how his daughter who just graduated last June had an IEP since first grade and  never  mastered  any of the goals. To me, that is simply astounding. However, I do see where it might happen that way. Under each goal, there are several short-term objectives. If these are not all mastered, the goal is not considered mastered. While it is common not to master every objective under a goal, there should have been times when the goal was mastered.\u00a0 At the very least, progress shouyld have been indicated and communicated.    My 3rd year of teaching, Spaz had mastered ALL of his objectives in the rec/leisure domain.  His mother made a comment that this was the first time he had mastered an entire goal.  What\u2019s more, he had actually mastered it before to annual review of his IEP during the 3rd 9 week progress report.  She had never seen a prior progress report in his school career that had showed actual progress and mastery.  Of course she saw a lot of things out of me she had never seen before, for good or ill.   But Schmitt\u2019s assertion that some students can not learn is a troubling one. If I were his girl\u2019s teacher at any level, I would take this statement as a sign of failure\u2026MY failure. No parent should walk away from a teacher feeling like their child can not learn. Okay, so they can\u2019t bubble in an answer sheet for some stupid test. But this is not a true indicator of a child\u2019s ability to learn valuable skills. Even if the child learns to use the toilet, this is learning!\u00a0 Learning how to stay on task, learning how to go from one point to another,\u00a0 following instructions, learning how to deal with challenges, learning how to get along with others\u2026these are all skills that I end up spending much of my time on and are actually more crucial to success in life than the bubbling in of answers on a test with a pencil.  This gets back to special education teachers and their failure to track progress regularly over a period of time.  They need to be collecting data on a regular basis in order to be able to convey progress. Schmitt talks a bit about teachers in special education.  I need to find out where Henrico County is, because it sounds like there might be some lucrative positions there!  He talks about how new teachers start out teaching at the county system until they gain sufficient knowledge and experience to teach at the higher paying private schools.  In Georgia, that is not the case at all.  Private schools pay less all around.  There are also few to no private schools for special education students.  Some parents will vote with their feet and move to states and districts with better teachers and services.  Jim, who was new to us last year, is a refugee of the the California special ed. system.  Maybe we have better teachers due to a nonexistent private school system. The bigger question Schmitt asks is whether parents should sue the school in order to get them to pay for a more expensive private school.  He uses the comparison of the Cavalier versus the Corvette, and no lawsuit will make his Cavalier run and perform like a Corvette.  When discussing FAPE (Free and Appropriate Public Education) we always hear about how we\u2019re not entitled to a Cadillac.  Schmitt concludes his article by saying that thanks to the judge\u2019s ruling, he\u2019ll have a chance to know what it feels like paying for a private school.   The safeguards for parents in special education are largely procedural.  However, had Schmitt known his rights, he would have known that the independent evaluation he wanted for his daughter could have been at the expense of the county.  The county could have filed for due process and refused to pay, but just paying for the evaluation is much less expensive.   I do believe in looking at things realistically. I don\u2019t believe bankrupting a family or a school system necessarily makes society or an individual better. It would be better if parents went ahead and made a sort of internal cost-benefit analysis, but too many want to leave it in the hands of a judge.\u00a0 As a parent, I understand how we want to do anything for our children.\u00a0 However, the collapse of an entire family system (or school system) isn\u2019t beneficial, either.\u00a0 I admire Schmitt\u2019s courage in speaking out with a voice that is admittedly going to be less than popular.\u00a0 But I also feel bad that his own experiences seem to have left him feeling like his daughter can\u2019t learn.

{"date": "2007/05/10", "body": "In  my last post , I discussed a bit about end of course tests, which many of you are finishing up in one form or another.    But the topic of the Georgia high school graduation test (GHSGT) needs its own treatment, as this is a much bigger fish with it counting towards AYP for NCLB purposes.    BTW, if you don\u2019t like acronyms, a special ed. blog is NOT the thing to be reading! \u00a0 A county that is very near Magnolia county has adopted a policy that any senior who has failed a section on the GHSGT can not walk on graduation day.   ( Here\u2019s an article about another district that did something similar in 2003 ) This caused quite an uproar at a recent school board meeting where parents and students complained bitterly about how unfair this is.    A student goes through 12, 13, 14, 15 years of school, gets all of their credits, pass all of their classes, does all of their work, may even make the honor roll and get a HOPE scholarship.    But if they fail a single portion of the GHSGT, that\u2019s it.    No graduation. \u00a0 They can still take the test every time it is given until they pass, but by then graduation day is over. \u00a0 My attitude towards our test-crazy culture can be seen below.    However there are more insidious things behind this policy that the board passed.    They claimed that it was a policy designed to make sure that they were upholding the standard.    The fact is, this is a  graduation  ceremony.    Why allow someone to be a part of it who is not actually and truly graduating?    A board member stated that this policy was set in order to be true to the standard and to insert some level of integrity into the system.    They want to reward actual graduates, not those who  hope  they will get a diploma at some point in the future. \u00a0 While this is all fine and good, that is not the  real  reason for this policy move.    It has nothing to do with fairness or standards or moral integrity.    It has everything to do with No Child Left Behind.    If your child is left behind, and not allowed to walk across the stage on graduation day because of this test, it is because of NCLB.    You see this policy is all about NCLB and AYP.    A board member stated that he wanted to make sure that the subsequent test takers understood the seriousness of this test and would work harder to pass it. \u00a0 And that is the  real  reason for this policy.    It is the equivalent of chaining the galley slaves to their oars, so they will row harder knowing that if they don\u2019t, they will go down with the ship.    In this case, chaining the student\u2019s graduation exercise to the test in hopes that they will perform better and so help the school\u2019s efforts at making AYP.    If the school fails to make AYP, there will be many students who will NOT be walking across that stage.    They will go down with their ship.    No matter how long or how hard they\u2019ve been rowing, if they fail that test which is tied to NCLB, they will drown in their shame. \u00a0 This is the sort of crap that goes down when politicians in Washington decide to get involved with something they really don\u2019t know anything about.    These folks are too busy raising money for their own re-election to raise their own children, and these are the folks you want deciding how your kids should be raised and educated? \u00a0 NCLB is a terrible law created by beltway baboons in order to gain political points at little cost.    Schools were institutions prone to doing silly things before, but NCLB has raised the standard of insanity to new heights.  dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thebrunswicknews.com/open_access/news/302415883195657.php"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/05/10/graduation-test/", "title": "Graduation Test"},
{"date": "2007/05/26", "body": "\u00a0 \u00a0 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m blogging about this\u2026AGAIN.    Already.    I really, really was hoping to just sort of put things behind me and finish the year, relax and then start next year all fresh.    I was willing to go into next year with a more open mind and determination to do better. \u00a0 But it just couldn\u2019t rest.    \u00a0 This past year, this blog was dominated by the Georgia alternate Assessment and the havoc that it caused in my life as a teacher.    I logged in countless hours going over and over and over the stuff.    I really did try my best to make sure I did all of it correctly.    I did make the one snarky remark and got my butt soundly and roundly chewed for it.    But over all, I put in what I can only describe as my best effort.    As one assistant principal Harry said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the students that are graded, it\u2019s the teachers.\u201d \u00a0   I finally got my grade for the GAA. \u00a0 No, the results for the students won\u2019t be ready until June 11 th !    What the hell good that does, I have no idea.    It\u2019s demoralizing that we broke our butts to submit them in a timely manner and then they can\u2019t score them in a timely manner.    No matter.    The damage has been done.    I personally have spoke to a dozen or so teachers who are moving, retiring and transferring to escape the GAA.    Students with the severest of disabilities will have the most inexperienced teachers next year, thanks to this crap. \u00a0 I was observed earlier in the year and got a good classroom evaluation.    But yesterday, on the last day of school, another assistant principal, Carey, pulled out another evaluation form for me to sign.    It was a reprimand, noting my unsatisfactory performance on the GAA.    They said they found mistakes that I had failed to correct.    They said I had submitted incorrect data collection dates.    They said I failed to measure up.    Carey said that they had to rush at the last minute to correct whatever errors they found.    I had submitted and resubmitted multiple, multiple times and tried to incorporate every suggestion and correction asked.    As my first time through this, I was doing the best I could and under pressure. \u00a0 It doesn\u2019t even matter how Taz did, now.    Because if he passes, the AP\u2019s will take the credit based on their corrections.    If he fails, they\u2019ll blame it all on me.    It\u2019s the ultimate CYA. \u00a0 Now I don\u2019t know if I even  want  to come back next year.    It certainly does provide the incentive to look for other options and it seems to be pointing towards getting out of the severe and profound business.    The Washington and Atlanta bureaucrats are making an already challenging job unmanageable. dick Haha!\u00a0 Misspelling the title was so indicative of my confusion!\u00a0 No wonder I can\u2019t do these things right.

{"date": "2007/05/23", "body": "Jackie stopped by and asked:   If you could go back in time for Spaz, what do you think should have been done to better his outcome (in any and all areas you care to comment on).   Wow.    That\u2019s so tough, but I think it\u2019s important for any parents who do have children with severe autism and behavior problems.    It\u2019s important to realize that back in 1985, when Spaz was born, no one knew much about autism, let alone interventions and services.    So just being born later will improve the prognosis for most kids.    Spaz was born 12 weeks premature, so he\u2019s actually lucky just to be alive.    Even 30 years ago, that may not have been the case. \u00a0 First off, I\u2019ll say there is no substitute for diligence as a parent.    What I mean by that, is holding firm to behavioral expectations like a dog on to a bone.    I\u2019m drawing from my own experience as a parent here, and therapies come and go but parental consistency is the one thing that stays the same.    Hopefully.    Jane and I were hyper vigilant early on, and this paid off as Thomas grew older.    And this leads to a second thing: you can not do it alone.    Jane does an excellent job and takes the bulk of the credit but I\u2019m in there as well.    It helped being in the field and actually trying out some interventions that I was learning about, like floortime, discrete trial, pivotal response training, ABA, augmentative communication, PECS and video modeling.    \u00a0 If I had to recommend one publication for parents who are seeking peer-reviewed literature on Autism, it would be  Focus on Autism and other Developmental Disabilities .    This is a journal but it has stuff that an everyday parent would find interesting.    Jane would get it before me, and read the entire thing before she\u2019d let me have it.    The Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis  is okay, but it quite technical and not specific to disabilities and autism.    The Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions  is another journal of practical interest, especially for teachers. \u00a0 The reason why I recommend knowing the literature is because the temptation towards fads in inescapable.    So many people are out to cash in on the epidemic, that if you have little to on knowledge, you\u2019ll become just another proof of PT Barnum\u2019s maxim.    \u00a0 Jackie mentioned in her comment that her son has many of the behaviors Spaz has.    Keep in mind, Spaz has actually improved and matured since I got him 6 years ago.    I went to work on his most serious behaviors, which were hitting, kicking and scratching the crap out of all of us.    Almost all of that aggression is gone, now.    Now we\u2019re working on the spitting, self-gagging, biting stuff and potty training.    We still have a long way to go, but one has to understand how far we\u2019ve come.    So if a child of 8 years is where Spaz is now at 21, there\u2019s time for making even more improvement.    Sort the behaviors from the most severe, and work on them accordingly.    Be aware that new behaviors can and will probably pop up and have to be dealt with. \u00a0 Boys and masturbation: I\u2019m not quite ready to go there, but it is something to look forward to into the teenage years!    Spaz\u2019s wiring seems to have spared him this ultimate of self-stim behaviors or maybe it just hasn\u2019t hit yet. \u00a0 One thing that really helped Spaz and Thomas was being around peers.    Not necessarily non-disabled peers, but peers who were a bit higher functioning that were social.    It\u2019s when Spaz got interested in making friends that he really made strides with the aggression.    It was the same for Thomas and the potty training.    Once he got around classmates who were all potty trained, that was it for him. \u00a0 Spaz has had access to all sorts of therapies including OT, PT and speech.    His mother really has done well taking him out, enrolling him in activities and making his life as full as can be.    But he still has a tendency to tear the house apart.    \u00a0 It\u2019s hard to say what  I  would do with a younger Spaz.    Sometimes I think I should have went after the potty training more aggressively myself earlier on, but I was still acquiring knowledge myself.    I did the best I could with the physical and mental resources that I had.    And really, that\u2019s all any parent or teacher can do.    It\u2019s interesting to think about what we might do differently, and I hope I\u2019m doing things better nowadays.    That\u2019s why I prefer looking forward to looking back.    I know I made mistakes back there and that\u2019s where I\u2019d prefer to leave them, while carrying the lessons forward.  dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4357", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba/", "http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/proedcw/jpbi/2007/00000009/00000002;jsessionid=agftqh5d5mir1.victoria"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/05/23/216/", "title": "Going back in time for\u00a0Spaz"},
{"date": "2006/05/08", "body": "The transition plan is a required component of IEPs for students 16 years old or older, although most systems do it at age 14, presumably before the student begins high school.\u00a0 For all the anxiety over all the other parts of the IEP, this section probably involves a great deal more fear over the uncertainty of the future.\u00a0 And it should.\u00a0 The end goal of all educational efforts (regular and special education) is a successful transition into adulthood and post-school life.\u00a0 Hopefully the student will be able to live and work independently.\u00a0 But with students with special needs, this is often not the case.\u00a0 As a parent who functions in the role of educational undertaker, it is all too frightening.\u00a0 Fortunately I have 12 years or so before having to facing that eventuality.\u00a0 Some of you parents do not have that luxury. \u00a0 The purpose of the transition plan (known in some districts as an ITP (individual transition plan) is to plan for what that student will do after high school and then map out a course for getting them there.\u00a0 Is the student working towards a regular education diploma?\u00a0 Will they go to college?\u00a0 Will they live in a group home?\u00a0 Will they require services from vocational rehabilitation services? \u00a0 Generally we try to list student preferences, interests and abilities, and then look at possibilities.\u00a0 As the years go by, the ITP should become more detailed and focused.\u00a0 As part of this plan, the student is informed in the year he/she turns 17 that all rights transfer to them.\u00a0 IOW, the student is the one who has parental rights, the student is the one who accepts or rejects service options etc.\u00a0 As a courtesy, schools keep parents involved.\u00a0 But they don\u2019t have to.\u00a0  \u00a0 My students, who are severe, are no exception.\u00a0 Rights transfer to them UNLESS the parent applies for and obtains guardianship of that student.\u00a0 I\u2019ll probably discuss this issue in a later post since it involves some detail, but parents should initiate this process soon after the student turns 17.\u00a0 The process takes away rights from the student and grants them to the guardian by declaring the student incompetent.\u00a0 But it is a necessary process, because it protects the student from being abused and taken advantage of by the system.\u00a0 For less severe students, partial guardianship may be obtained to protect their interests.\u00a0  \u00a0 Planning for transition should take place, in a parent\u2019s mind, right now.\u00a0 No matter the age of the child, parents are the ones who have to take the much longer view.\u00a0 While teachers, schools and programs come and go, the parent is the one constant in that child\u2019s life and along with the child has to live with the consequences of decisions made today.\u00a0 Teachers tend to pass problems along like a proverbial hot potato up the line.\u00a0 As a High school teacher, I am the end of the line.\u00a0 There\u2019s no place left to toss them except out the door.\u00a0 And out there, is a very cold and bleak world for our kids.\u00a0 There is no IDEA, there is no due process, and there are no procedural safe guards.\u00a0 No one has to take your kids once they are out.\u00a0 Parents, at that point, you are STUCK with whatever happened during the previous 21 years.\u00a0 Look for something more from me about this around graduation time.\u00a0  I want to spend just a bit of time on the IHP or Individual Healthcare Plan.\u00a0 Unlike all of the other sections previously covered, this is NOT required by law.\u00a0 But consider this: suppose your son has a seizure at school.\u00a0 Does everyone know what to do?\u00a0 Will someone be trying to stick something in his mouth?\u00a0 Supposing your child takes medication at school and forgets to take it until 3 hours later after they are supposed to take it.\u00a0 Are they supposed to just skip it, or does the nurse give it anyway whenever they can?\u00a0 Suppose your child has asthma, are they allowed to carry their inhaler?\u00a0 If your child is tube fed, who is responsible for feeding her?\u00a0 What if she vomits it up and aspirates on the bus?\u00a0  \u00a0 The reason for the IHP is to work all of these things out ahead of time so that school personnel know what to do when things happen.\u00a0 And things happen at school.\u00a0 I have one student who has seizures 2-3 times a week, and the parent doesn\u2019t want to be called unless in lasts for more than 5 minutes and we administer Diastat.\u00a0 Another parent wants us to call her if their son has ANY seizures ever.\u00a0 The IHP is basically like a nursing plan with sections on actions that school personnel are to take.\u00a0 We try to cover all contincies possible.\u00a0 This document contains the history and medical issues of the student as well as contact information for parents, relatives, pediatricians, neurologists and anyone else that might need to be contacted.\u00a0 If I have to make a 911 call, having such information available for \nEMS can be invaluable as they can note allergies and make arrangements with parents and doctors quickly.\u00a0 For instance, when Charlie was taken to the hospital, \nEMS kept asking him to tell them how he was feeling and trying to get him to respond.\u00a0 Fortunately I was there to tell them that he was nonverbal and couldn\u2019t respond no matter how lucid he was.\u00a0 For students with medical issues, the IHP is a vital part of the student record.\u00a0 Parents who I have developed these for have been very relieved to know this thing exists and is available.\u00a0 And it comes in handy in an emergency.\u00a0 Because emotions can run high during such times, it is helpful to have procedures spelled out so I don\u2019t have to decide. \u00a0 Parents could write an IHP, but they do need to be mindful of school resources and policies.\u00a0 If there is no nurse in the building, parents need to know that.\u00a0 If there is a school nurse, that person needs to be involved with the process, as he/she may have to be trained up on some of the procedures.\u00a0 Yes, I have had to train the school nurse on catheterization!\u00a0 Generally our school nurse is doing administrative stuff and isn\u2019t too awfully stressed until she sees me jogging up the hall.\u00a0 Then she knows it is on.\u00a0 Most special educators have no idea what an IHP is, much less know how to write one.\u00a0 Nurse know how to write a nursing plan of care, but may need a refresher course.\u00a0 Most nurses don\u2019t write one for students in the school because it is a waste of time because no one reads it.\u00a0 Simply adding actions for school personnel, though, makes it a marvelously more functional document. \u00a0 Now, finally, we are getting towards the end of this whole mess known as the IEP.\u00a0 We are at least at a point where we can discuss service options and placement which I\u2019ll cover next time around. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "2006/05/19", "body": "  An article in the London Times  discusses a radical shift from a policy of inclusion  from the largest teacher union inGreat Britain.  I recently published a  letter from  Georgia \u2019s office of Developmental Disabilities  that drew   one comment   from an irate parent who might share in the views of the National Union of Teachers (NUT?!?)     There is something to be said for having specialized schools for children with severe disabilities.  When I was working in the psychoed center, it was a wonderful experience, or at least as good as it could get working with students with severe emotional behavioral disabilities.  Everyone there knew their jobs, everyone there was pulling in the same direction and we all had the same training.  We all knew the procedures, and could operate as a finely tuned operation despite times of craziness and chaos.  Yes, there was stress, but never once did I have to question the dedication and support of our building administrator who helped restrain kids when needed or helped with other interventions side-by-side with us paras and teachers.  We were all in this together.  If a kid needed shoes, clothes or food, we all pulled together and were able to make provision the kids in our care.  We had volunteers come in to help teach music and art to the students and they were given an enriched environment.  We had kids who had several seizure a day, and everyone knew what to do.  Contrast this with my own  recent experience  where all the administrators and resource officers seemed to lose their heads.   Before coming to Magnolia County I worked in a state mental hospital that had a special facility for caring for those with profound and multiple disabilities.  Those residents had nurses, doctors, therapists, teachers and an entire array of services at their disposal.  There was absolutely no doubt that those students were well taken care of.     In regular public education, people are pulled from the streets with no specialized training to care for students with extensive needs.  PT, OT, speech and adaptive PE services are all itinerate services, with overworked therapists traveling from school-to-school.  The transportation system is stretched to the limit having to haul special needs students all over the county because not every school offers every service.  The director of special education transportation has spent hours lamenting with me privately about how hard it is to coordinate getting these kids to all of these schools.  (Why can\u2019t they have just one special school for all of these kids?\u201d she has asked me over and over.  And I explain about the law and LRE and how parents seem to be under the impression that their students are better off at their home school.  Some of these parents are surprised and dismayed at what they find.     Having specialized personnel under one roof offers benefits to the students and the staff.  The administrators in such specialized schools either know what they are getting in to or find out very quickly.  With professionals housed together, there is a much greater chance of collaboration occurring between the various disciplines.  I can see and talk with the PT and OT together during lunch, as opposed to them spending their lunch time traveling between the various schools scattered throughout the county.  We can provide better linkage to community agencies because they don\u2019t have to keep track of several buildings, teachers and programs.  If a teacher leaves, chances are that there are several other experienced teachers in the building to help mentor and train the new teachers and paras.     As it is, Magnolia County is currently looking for 2 severe and profound teachers to teach at the high school level.  The Southside\u2019s teacher is moving to a different program serving moderate kids, and the new school that is opening needs a teacher.  Mr. Pyle is looking to leave the severe and profound field.  That means there is only one SID/PID high school teacher left in the county familiar with our kids and our business.  ME.  The new school is nearly 20 miles away which will make it difficult to be able to just saunter over to help support and train a new person like when the new person started at the Southside school.   Magnolia County is also looking for PT, OT and SLPs.  The burn-out rate is high for those who have to serve students at several schools simply because of the travel involved.  OTs are often forced to work with individual children in a closet or in hallways because it is a low incidence service in each individual school.  With only 3 or 4 students at each school getting OT, why should a school dedicate precious space for a therapy area?   This is not to say that inclusion does not have its place.  Both of my kids are included, but they are able to walk, talk, use the bathroom, feed themselves and they do not have specialized healthcare needs.   Compared to what I do, Thomas and Percy have relatively mild issues that have a direct bearing on their educational progress.     \u201c The Cambridge researchers interviewed teachers, children and parents at 20 schools in seven local authorites. They concluded that the reality of inclusion was very far from the \u201cworld of fine intentions\u201d inhabited by policymakers. \u201cWhile there are many examples of social benefits both for children with special needs and their peers, there is much less positive evidence that learning needs are being met across the whole spectrum of ability,\u201d the report said. I think this is the main point: inclusion in theory is vastly different from the inclusion of reality for many students.  For community-based programs like ours, being in the regular school setting is much less critical because we spend most of our time in the community setting, anyway.  I\u2019m not so much in favor of segregation as much as trying to increase the availability and quality of services for students with extensive needs.  As it is, special education has become highly balkanized, and resources are stretched over a vast area instead of being concentrated to the point of need.  And like it or not, resources are limited.  That\u2019s just a fact of life.  There is not unlimited time, unlimited money and unlimited people with specialized training.  It is unrealistic to expect every single school building to serve students with specialized needs and to do it well. But Lord Adonis, the Schools Minister, said: \u201cChildren should be taught in mainstream schools where this is what their parents want and it is not incompatible with the efficient education of other children.\u201d It is true that this is what parents want, but I\u2019m not sure if parents realize that they have been sold a tainted bill of goods.  In the world of limited resources and the push for accountability, special education students are the minority.  One of the provisions of NCLB is that failing schools do get more latitude in how they spend money that is otherwise earmarked for special services and programs.  Any guess as to who might get shortchanged in the process?  Not the kids taking those high stakes tests.    Regular education has enough problems managing the students that they have who are \u201cnormal.\u201d  Dumping students with severe disabilities on them and saddling them with various modifications is not going to enhance education for anyone.  Rethinking inclusion is a first step.  Common sense should indicate that no one solution works for every person and especially for those with disabilities.  Parents do need to think about outcomes that go beyond the social benefits and more towards getting their students to function as independently as possible.  Those mainstream friends they make at school are not going to be the ones to suction their trachs or catheterize them or change their nappies (the Brits are cute that way!) nor are they going to drive them to the doctors or to a job or even to other social events outside of school.  I\u2019ll write more on this later, but when graduation day comes, all that social interaction isn\u2019t going to amount to a hill of beans.  I would rather have a few places that handled exceptionalities very well than have all of the neighborhood schools handling these students very poorly.  And this is the choice we are faced with.  Not all schools can be all things for all people.   \u00a0 dick   ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2184133,00.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/05/19/rethinking-mainstreaminginclusion/", "title": "Rethinking Mainstreaming/Inclusion"},
{"date": "2006/05/16", "body": "\u00a0 Remember when I said I was finished with my series on IEPs? \u00a0 I lied. \u00a0 I'm beginning to wonder if I'll EVER be finished with the bloody things\u2026 \u00a0 I didn't mention much about ESY in my IEP series, because for 99% of our kids, it isn't much of an issue.\u00a0 However, the law says that Extended School Year (ESY) at least must be considered.\u00a0 Consideration, in reality, involves placing a statement at the end of the minutes stating that it was considered and the committee determined that it was not warranted. \u00a0 If you, as a teacher, would like to get really popular with your county special ed. director, begin doling out ESY services like condoms at an orgy.\u00a0 It's probably the fastest way to get a phone call from him/her saying, \"Please come to my office at once.\u00a0 And bring all of your personal effects with you.\" \u00a0 ESY gets a really bad rap from special educators at all levels.\u00a0 You've just gone 9-10 months with these kids and are looking forward to your summer break.\u00a0 Then this ESY thing comes up and it looks like you might have to spend your whole summer teaching!\u00a0 Who wants that? \u00a0 Before talking about what ESY really looks like, when is it warranted?\u00a0  The 3 areas of consideration are: substantial regression/recoupment; critical point of instruction related to objectives on the IEP; and mastery of goals and objectives. \u00a0 Regression/recoupment refers to a student who has substantial regression when extended periods of instruction are not present.\u00a0 Many students regress over the summer, but most also recoup over just a few weeks.\u00a0 Those that take months to recoups what they lost would be entitled to ESY. \u00a0 Critical point of instruction refers to a student who is learning a critical skill and the break interrupting that instruction.\u00a0 For instance if\u00a0 a nonverbal child begins talking in late May, that would be considered a critical point of instruction and may get ESY to continue with those skills. \u00a0 Mastery of IEP objectives is a consideration when a student has not mastered many of their goals, and this becomes a form of compensatory instruction.\u00a0  \u00a0 In all cases,\u00a0our county special ed, director wants to know before the IEP and before anything is promised.\u00a0 Then he/she will want to know the extent of services and if the teacher is willing to provide those services.\u00a0 And this explains why ESY is not offered more often, because teachers are reluctant to give up their time off.\u00a0 So it is easier to not make much of an effort to offer it.\u00a0 But families may also be reluctant to give up vacation time, so it is not a highly sought after service. \u00a0 ESY does not mean that the child gets dropped off at school at 8 and picked up at 3:00, like a regular school day.\u00a0 I've done ESY twice before and will do it again this summer. \u00a0 A few years ago, the outgoing director of special ed. decided to give out ESY.\u00a0 I'd never known  anyone  to get it before, so I was surprised to learn several folks were getting it.\u00a0 One was my student and it consisted of one hour a week to simply check on him to make sure all the community services were being coordinated.\u00a0 He had a lot of issues, including DFACS and community health services.\u00a0 It wasn't difficult and the kid lived just down the road from me, so it wasn't too big of a deal.\u00a0 During that same summer, the director called me to ask if I would do ESY during summer school for a student with autism.\u00a0 This was closer to what most people think of when they think of extended school.\u00a0 But even that was only a half day 5x/week for 3 weeks.\u00a0 But this student never showed up, so I basically got paid for waiting around for him for a week. \u00a0 For this summer, I am basically extending hospital homebound services for 3 hours a week.\u00a0 I'd be willing to put in more hours if needed, simply because my oldest needs dental surgery and I can use the money!\u00a0 Teachers have often historically done summer jobs for extra money, and ESY isn't a bad way to do it.\u00a0 It involves less than a full day and pay is typically better than what a person might otherwise make on typical summer jobs.\u00a0 Unlike summer school, ESY can be done at the student's home and is 1:1, so it is more relaxed than a typical school day. \u00a0 As a parent, I've never given a lot of consideration for ESY services.\u00a0 One reason is because a parent doesn't know which teacher will do it.\u00a0 If it's not your child's regular teacher, who will be delivering the service?\u00a0 Whoever is willing to do it, which may or may not be what you want.\u00a0 It takes some time to get to know a child and establish a working relationship, which is hardly worth it with a summer only lasting 6 or so weeks.\u00a0 There may be some value in it for transition, for instance the child's new middle school teacher coming an hour a week during the summer when a child is transitioning out of elementary school.\u00a0 But again, the who, how, when, where and why of it needs to be explicitly worked out ahead of time.  \n ESY can be a useful tool, and should be given serious consideration for certain situations.\u00a0\u00a0 As schools get closer to becoming more balanced or year-round, ESY becomes less of an issue.\u00a0 However, even breaks of 2 weeks such as during the winter holidays can be under consideration for ESY.\u00a0 As with everything else in an IEP it comes down to the needs of the individual student. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/05/16/iep-process-esy/", "title": "IEP Process: ESY"},
{"date": "2006/05/09", "body": "This is it.\u00a0 The end of the IEP line.\u00a0  Actually, I could go on forever, but I feel like I've been going on forever as it is.\u00a0 One of the other LEAs has pneumonia, so I'm having to pick up her IEPs.\u00a0 This in addition to having to write my own, which I like to get out 2 days before the meeting. After looking at all the information, including goals, PLOP, accommodations, transition plan and BIP, then we consider the options for services.\u00a0 And there is a good reason for doing it this way as illustrated by comments by  Coach Brown   and  Reflective Teacher   on my  post about accommodations .\u00a0 If a parent demands accommodations to the point where they become modifications, a more restrictive placement should be considered.\u00a0 And there is a continuum of services and placements offered within special education. The \"Least Restrictive Environment\" or LRE part of IDEA is probably the most contentious of the entire IEP process.\u00a0 This is going to determine where the student is going to be served, and everyone begins the IEP with some idea as to where that should be.\u00a0 But according to the process, it really shouldn't be decided until the end, based on all of the supporting data and evidence. So what are the placement options?\u00a0 From least-to-most: -Regular education with no special education support: This is the least restrictive at all and generally one might see this right before a student is discharged from special ed. \u2013 Regular education with special ed. consultative services: Basically, the student is on their own, but a special ed. teacher will check on them and monitor progress and offer suggestions for the regular ed. teachers as well as follow up on accommodations. \u2013 Regular education with special education resource: The student will spend most of their time in regular education but may be pulled out an hour or two for special education services.\u00a0 This includes speech language, hearing and vision services as well as academic support.\u00a0  -Regular education with Collaborative services:\u00a0 Sometimes this is called co-teaching or team teaching.\u00a0 Basically this is most likely to be offered in a class that has several special needs students and there is a regular teacher and special education teacher in the same room.\u00a0 Both are technically serving all of the students, but the special ed teacher is primarily responsible for implementing accommodations, modifications and strategies for the special ed group.\u00a0\u00a0  \u2013 Regular education with para support: It's arguable whether this is more or less restrictive than collaborative services.\u00a0 However these paras tend to be \"helicopter paras\" that hover over the one or two students assigned to them, therefore I count it as a more restrictive setting. \u2013 Special education self-contained with regular education electives.\u00a0 The student will spend most of their time in a special education setting, but will go out to some elective classes like art, music or P.E. \u2013 Special education self-contained:\u00a0 This is where the student spends all of their time in special education.\u00a0 However this does not mean they are in the same class with the same teacher all day.\u00a0 It simply means their services are being delivered by special education personnel.\u00a0  \u2013 A special school or facility: \nGeorgia has a psychoed network for student with severe emotional behavior disabilities.\u00a0 Several states also have special schools for the deaf and blind.\u00a0 And there are still a few residential placements around, but these are becoming increasingly rare. There are also a variety of other services to be considered such as PT, OT, speech, vision, hearing, adaptive PE and special transportation.\u00a0 Yes, the short bus is sometimes considered a service option.\u00a0 Health services, adaptive technology and nutritional services are also\u00a0 services I have listed and used in the past.\u00a0 These services will either be direct services or indirect.\u00a0 Indirect services are consultative, where the OT or PT or whoever comes once a month or so and consults with the teacher about any issues or needs.\u00a0 I have heard of some students getting counseling or mental health services, but this is not very common around these parts.\u00a0 What passes for school counseling nowadays is not what I would consider very good.\u00a0 These counselors are not really proper therapists compared to what is in the private sector.\u00a0 They can listen and offer some wise guidance, but they usually have other administrative duties in addition to their counseling functions.\u00a0 But I would welcome input from any readers more familiar with the school counseling field.\u00a0 School psychologist are devoted almost exclusively to testing and evaluation, leaving intervention to others. In considering options, I generally list all options the student has had previously and then maybe one that is the next least restrictive.\u00a0 It is useful to talk to parents to get a feel for what they are thinking in advance, and I will keep saying that advance drafts of the IEP need to be available to parents before the meeting. Pretty much everything I've discussed before this point could have/should have been written and prepared in advance of the meeting.\u00a0 The stuff is written or typed beforehand and is reviewed during the IEP.\u00a0 Parents, I would encourage you, a week prior to the meeting, to ask that anything written in advance of the meeting be made available to you at least the day before.\u00a0 This is why so many parents are so dazed, confused and angry at these things.\u00a0 They show up, get all of these things shoved on them and are then expected to make a decision then and there regarding their child's future. Service options that are considered can be written in advance.\u00a0 Options rejected and accepted can NOT be done in advance of the meeting.\u00a0 EVER.\u00a0 That is supposed to be a committee decision, and if that is filled out beforehand, the school could get in a world of hurt.\u00a0  Parental involvement and participation are mandated by both NCLB and IDEA.\u00a0 Spend time getting parents' thoughts and feelings beforehand.\u00a0 Help them prepare for their meeting, if you can.\u00a0  As parents, being prepared is the best defense against misunderstanding.\u00a0 And really, over the long haul, it falls on the parents to assert their rights.\u00a0 And sometimes that means raising some hell.\u00a0 Inviting an advocate is almost always a good idea.\u00a0 If there is the slightest chance of misunderstanding or suspicion, don't go to the meeting alone.\u00a0 Bring your spouse or a friend.\u00a0 Having said that, don't show up with an attorney for the very first meeting.\u00a0 If that happens, our instructions as teachers are very clear: shut down the meeting immediately, and inform the county office so that they can invite the school attorney and reschedule.  Suppose you go to the IEP, they go through it all, you agree to everything, you sign it and then walk out with an uneasy feeling.\u00a0 You begin to wonder if you did the right thing.\u00a0 As a parent, you have the right to call for an IEP at anytime.\u00a0 But first talk to the case manager or write them a note expressing your concerns.\u00a0\u00a0 It is in their best interest to make sure you are a satisfied customer.\u00a0 We all hate these things, and the teacher who has a dissatisfied and motivated parent has a real problem on their hands.\u00a0 On the other hand, a satisfied and motivated parent can do wonders.\u00a0 I've gotten extra needed help and needed renovations thanks to parents who were willing to complain and advocate. There a group of parents that will probably not read this.\u00a0 Ever.\u00a0 If I write about parents, I'm talking about those that are very involved (sometimes to a fault).\u00a0 But there are some who have very little involvement at all.\u00a0 They never come to IEP meetings and sometimes not even a manifestation hearing.\u00a0 They simply allow the system to do whatever it wishes.\u00a0 That's not to say I'm not going to do right by those students, but there is an impact a parent can have simply by meeting with a teacher that can pay grreat dividends\u00a0 Right or wrong, when a parent tells me they intend to attend an IEP, they go to the head of the line in the preparation process.\u00a0 Those that say they are not coming still get an IEP, but they are simply demanding less diligence on my part. Okay, hopefully you have some better background on this IEP business.\u00a0 Now, if you don't mind, I need to get busy writing some of my own! dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ukiahcoachbrown.blogspot.com/", "http://thereflectiveteacher.wordpress.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/05/09/91/", "title": "IEP Process: Service Options and\u00a0Placement"},
{"date": "2006/05/23", "body": "The past week has been a hideous mess.\u00a0 Well, not so much in the way of daily drama, but this is the last week of school and we each have our end-of-year checklists where we get things signed off by various people around the building.\u00a0 For instance we get checked off by the media specialists when we have everything checked in.\u00a0 The computer lab person checks us off when we have our computer inventory done, etc.\u00a0 It's sort of like a scavenger hunt. \u00a0 I addition to the stuff all teachers have to do, the special education department has its own extensive checklist.\u00a0 All IEP's have to be completed, checked, double checked and organized.\u00a0 The county office inundates us with various forms requiring us to fill them out and send them in for certain things to get checked off.\u00a0 \u00a0 It's just a lot of headache that is piled high atop shoulders already weary and trying to hold the line as we go through the last few days of school.\u00a0 2 more days and a wake-up, as we'd say in the army. \u00a0 I like what I do and I have liked it these past 6 years.\u00a0 Not every minute of every day, mind you, but I have generally enjoyed being with these students and all of the adults that I work with.\u00a0 I have built some real bonds with them and the parents.\u00a0 Taz and Spaz, especially, despite being total loons have become such a staple in my daily life.\u00a0 I have spent the better part of the last 3 months looking forward and planning to work with them next year. \u00a0 However, something has come up that threatens my little pastoral world of student-teacher-parent-para.\u00a0 An opportunity that is irresistible and is tailor made for me.\u00a0 They are looking for a behavior intervention specialist. \u00a0 My oldest, Thomas, needs to have dental work done as he has a few cavities.\u00a0 We simply don't have the money, because for someone with ASD, dental work is the 5th circle of Hell.\u00a0 We can't even give the boy a haircut without 2 people holding him down.\u00a0 So he will need to be knocked out in a hospital in order to have his teeth worked on.\u00a0 Magnolia County will cover 50% of the cost of dental care for their employees, but nothing for family members.\u00a0 And guess who is the only one in the family with perfect teeth?\u00a0 \u00a0 So I was thinking about stringing together a series of ESY jobs this summer in order to pay for it.\u00a0 While looking for my hourly rate, I saw the interventionist position vacancy notice on the county website.\u00a0 That was last night, and I've been thinking on it ever since.\u00a0 It starts July 1st and would involve an extended school year contract which means more $$$$.\u00a0 But that is not the main attraction, here.\u00a0 I've been studying applied behavior analysis alongside PhD and BCBA candidates for the last 4 years for exactly this position.\u00a0 This is the one.\u00a0 I talked to our SLP, Cleotis, who is one of the wisest folks I know.\u00a0 She said \"Do it! This position is YOU and has YOU written all over it!\"\u00a0 Cleotis was one who made me promise not to transfer to the new high school, and has begged me not to leave.\u00a0 But now she sees this as a higher calling, and really jumped in behind me on it.\u00a0 I told my department head about it and she was equally enthused, saying she'd be happy to be listed as a reference. \u00a0 Hmmm.\u00a0 I admittedly have mixed feelings about it.\u00a0 What about Taz and Spaz?\u00a0 I hardly think their parents would be equally as excited.\u00a0 But I could be wrong.\u00a0 I suppose I should feel good about the confidence my peers have in me.\u00a0 But leaving what I have built will be most difficult.\u00a0 I have so many loose ends.\u00a0 The ESY and the hospital homebound student.\u00a0 Bella and her transition into our program.\u00a0 Jim, our newest student with full-blown autism whose mother pleaded for help with some of his issues.\u00a0 These are commitments I made that will change over time with me attempting to cover an entire county if I get this new job. \u00a0 If I applied and wasn't hired, I would be so okay with that.\u00a0 I have sufficient challenges where I'm at.\u00a0 But if I didn't apply, I would always wonder.\u00a0 I would have a difficult time dealing if someone lesser took such a big job.\u00a0 \u00a0 And I know there are precious few of us around with ABA training as well as backgrounds in EBD and developmental delays.\u00a0 In fact, out of the 9 of us going through the Ed.S program at GSU, I was the only one going for an ABA certificate.\u00a0 Everyone else was going through the research-based instruction route save one who was in the assistive technology track. \u00a0 In any case, this is a position that is long overdue.\u00a0 There are behavioral hot spots all over the place, from those going through manifestation, to the problems on school buses to managing behavior in the hallways.\u00a0 This last week of school, students are dawdling around instead of going to class, resulting in a lot confusion and delay as seniors take their final exams.\u00a0 I have an idea that might work.\u00a0 It might not work, but it's hard to imagine more confusion than I saw this morning. I'll see if I can give the principal my idea before the 8:00 meeting for all of the graduation ushers. \u00a0BTW, tomorrow is the last IEP I have to LEA\u2026HOORAY!\u00a0 IEPs are FINISHED!\u00a0 My son's went off without a hitch, Monday. They only arrayed 9 people on the other side of me this year.\u00a0 It hardly seemed fair.\u00a0 No major issues, here.\u00a0 One thing of note is that we will definitely be canning the Concerta.\u00a0 No one saw a difference in him at all during the past month.\u00a0 And I have to admit that this was a surprise to hear this, as Jane spilled the beans a bit earlier than I would have.\u00a0 But the whole group of teachers and therapists agreed that they couldn't see any substantial difference, and the bits of data they had didn't support it, either.\u00a0 And we suspected that we were seeing some rebounding in the late afternoon.\u00a0 Rebounding without benefit doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. dick \u00a0\u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/05/23/new-job/", "title": "New Job?"},
{"date": "2006/01/20", "body": "So I\u2019m setting up shop to serve a very under served group.  That would be parents and teachers and students with exceptionalities.  Special Education.  Special needs, whatever you want to call it.  This blog is about the world of the people who have special needs and those who care for them.  But unlike most other writings this is going to be honest and gritty.  I mean really gritty.  That\u2019s the way the truth is, sometimes.  It isn\u2019t always nice, pleasant and easy.  And with persons with disabilities, it can get very raw in the reality.  So brace yourself.  Don\u2019t worry, there will also be some warm, funny moments here.  You will be informed as well as entertained.  And often shocked.  So let us begin. I\u2019m going to be anonymous, but there will be some personal info here where someone may just be able to figure out who I am.  I\u2019m okay with that.  If you see me in real life, pretend you know nothing about the blog.  Difficult if you happen to be in it, but I am going to change names to protect the innocent and not so innocent. I am a special education teacher and have been for over 10 years.  I\u2019ve taught almost every disability category recognized by school systems, mostly in the secondary level, although I\u2019ve worked with younger kids.  I\u2019m currently working with students with severe and profound disabilities.  I supervise one other teacher and 5 paraeducators.  We\u2019ll get to them later. I started my special education career working with students with emotional and behavior disorders (EBD).  I did self-contained for a few months, and then worked in a psychoed center and then a state mental hospital, before settling in to my current spot. Somewhere during this odyssey of becoming a Sp.Ed teacher, I got married.  And then had kids.  My oldest has some significant developmental delays along the autistic spectrum.  He\u2019s almost 7, in regular kindergarten and is doing well. My youngest, age 4, is also in special ed preschool part-time. So, yeah.  I know a thing or two about special education from both sides of the table.  And just to sweeten this even more, when I was in 7th grade,  I  was tested for special education!  So it takes one to know one, or something like that.  While I didn\u2019t qualify for anything, I never forgot meeting in a janitor\u2019s closet with some strange guy doing all these tests with me for 2 or 3 days straight.  I remember being kind of embarrassed about the whole thing.  More on that, later.  Maybe. So I have a story to tell.  I\u2019ve also got things to say as a teacher and as a parent.  I think I\u2019ve got things to contribute.  I also have a lot to learn from other teachers and moreso other parents.  I admire fellow parents who have already blazed the trails and those still blazing.  There\u2019s nothing easy about this business.

{"date": "2006/05/26", "body": "For many students, this is it.\u00a0 It's the end of the line.\u00a0 A very long line, but it is finally the end.\u00a0 Of course, lot's of speeches will be made about how this is not the end, but the beginning.\u00a0 About a new life, filled with potential, and how the world lies at the feet of every graduate.\u00a0 Some will thank their teachers and parents.\u00a0 Many will express some anxiety about getting out into the 'real' world.\u00a0 But for the vast majority of graduating students and their families, this is a joyous occasion.\u00a0 They walk across the stage, get their diplomas in their caps and gowns and exit the stage.\u00a0 For most of us teachers, it is the last time we will see them for better or worse.\u00a0 For some of us teaching in large school systems it might also be the first time we see them for the last time. \u00a0 The highlight of every ceremony is when the students walk across the stage, and the families cheer, hoot and holler despite an administrator's admonishment to refrain until the end.\u00a0  \u00a0 I've observed several of these, and have been actively involved in some of the real highlights.\u00a0 While families hoot and holler for their favorites, it's a pretty isolated thing.\u00a0 Students generally refrain from being overly enthusiastic towards each other, except for their closest friends.\u00a0 Families cheer for only those they know.\u00a0 With one exception. \u00a0 Niles was a young man with a severe case of autism combined with some serious OCD issues.\u00a0 I wasn't there when he first entered Magnolia H.S., but I did get a chance to teach him for a couple of years at the ages of 21 and 22.\u00a0 He was 6'2, 190 lbs. and thrived on sameness.\u00a0 In the cafeteria, he always sat in the same place at the same table.\u00a0 One time when the rest of the school was on the testing schedule, some unfortunate girl was sitting in his spot.\u00a0 He simply picked her up by the neck and moved her.\u00a0 He didn't hurt her, but she was pretty scared.\u00a0 We always went to lunch when the lines were clear because Niles moved like the wind.\u00a0 People were simply annoying bits of furniture that got in his way.\u00a0 One day he even knocked the assistant principal to the floor, as she refused to get out of the way when Niles came flying through.\u00a0 My kids have never been intimidated or impressed by power or position or status.\u00a0 He always passed people on the side closest to the wall.\u00a0 One day, a student passed  him  and passed him on the wrong side.\u00a0 This small freshman had no idea why Niles tore after him, but he ran as fast as he could with Niles in hot pursuit.\u00a0 The kid was terrified to see this big guy running after him.\u00a0 Queen happened to see this and called out to the freshman to stop. \u00a0 \"HELP!\" yelped the freshman. \u00a0 \"Just stop and freeze!\u00a0 He's not going to hurt you!\" \u00a0 The poor kid cowered and trembled in the middle of the hall and Niles ran to him, past him and circled him 3 times.\u00a0 Then walked briskly back to our room without laying a hand on him and really not even looking at the kid who probably needed to change his underwear afterwards. \u00a0 So many stories about Niles with the blank stare and a terrible foot fetish.\u00a0 Niles who quickly ate his lunch and covered his ears, run-walking back to the room to escape the noise in the cafeteria. \u00a0 It was going to be the last graduation before Mr. Rogers retired.\u00a0 Everything had to be perfect.\u00a0 But there was problem.\u00a0\u00a0 Niles was graduating.\u00a0 The administration was terrified that this young man would do something to wreck this occasion.\u00a0 They suggested that Niles might have a private graduation in Mr.Roger's office.\u00a0 But we were having none of that.\u00a0 The boy had done 7 years of high school and had earned the right above and beyond anyone else.\u00a0 Even if it was only a special education diploma. \u00a0 We compromised by making a series of accomodations.\u00a0 First, Niles would wait in a room behind the stage instead of on the floor with all the other graduates.\u00a0 Second, when it came time for him to cross the stage, we would have someone at the other end to receive him and whisk him out and back to our classroom.\u00a0 He would not have to endure the long program.\u00a0 Third, while he went across, someone would walk on the floor, in front of the stage to direct him and be close by if anything happened.\u00a0 That person would be me.\u00a0 This was my first graduation and I would be very intimately involved. \u00a0 We practiced all week, taking Niles to the gym and having all sorts of different people on stage to hand him a replica of an actual diploma and shake his hand.\u00a0 We had various women and girls do this, wearing their sandals, as women and sandals were a trigger for Niles to fall on the ground and seduce the ground, so to speak.\u00a0 All of the practices went flawlessly.\u00a0 We had the head of the department play superintendent or principal just so she could help reassure the administration that all would be well. \u00a0 Queen had to do some convincing to get Niles' father to even attend.\u00a0 He was just as scared as everyone else that Niles would go nuts.\u00a0 Niles' parents were divorced, and he lived with his father.\u00a0 He had not seen his mother in years, despite the fact that she lived in the same town and worked in a nursing home that some our more social kids visited often.\u00a0 But Queen somehow managed to convince both his parents to not only show up, but to even sit together. \u00a0 The stage was set.\u00a0 Graduation day came.\u00a0 A nervous assistant principal \u2013 the one Niles had floored the year before \u2013 asked if we were ready.\u00a0 We said we were.\u00a0 But in reality, there was one factor that we had not counted on.\u00a0 We had not even considered it.\u00a0 All we were concerned about was Niles getting across the stage without knocking down Principal Rogers and General Superintendent and the entire school board.\u00a0 We had practiced and were ready.\u00a0  \u00a0 As the program began, Niles was in his room, behind the stage with Queen, who had known him since he had came to MHS.\u00a0 She was his one constant in the myriad of changing paras and teachers.\u00a0 I went backstage to that room to check on them and let them know how far in the program we were.\u00a0 Finally I went back and said, \"It's time.\" \u00a0 Queen was a nervous wreck.\u00a0 I was just a bit concerned, but was okay.\u00a0 Afterall, we had practiced this dozens of times, right?\u00a0 What could happen? \u00a0 But we had practiced in an  empty  gymnasium.\u00a0 Now there were over 2000 people watching!\u00a0 I was totally unprepared for what happened next. \u00a0 Queen took Niles to his mark.\u00a0 The announcer read his name.\u00a0 Queen pointed to the Principal Rogers who held out the diploma.\u00a0 Niles walked right on over, just like we had practiced.\u00a0 I walked with him in front of the stage on the floor of the gym, pointing and gesturing to the Superintendent and the safety of the far side.\u00a0 Niles took his diploma.\u00a0 And he stopped.\u00a0 And looked at the huge sea of faces. \u00a0Eyes.\u00a0 Thousands of eyes.\u00a0 My heart froze. \u00a0 Oh no. \u00a0 I actually felt it before I heard it.\u00a0 I was facing the stage, with my back towards the audience, totally fixed on Niles and his movements.\u00a0 Or in this case, his lack of movement.\u00a0 I pointed and almost barked his name when it hit me from behind.\u00a0 The unexpected force of a compression wave generated by a gym full of 2000 people roaring, clapping and shouting and cheering almost knocked me down. \u00a0 Shit. \u00a0 It was truly deafening.\u00a0 Niles' classmates made the biggest racket I had ever heard from directly behind me and directly at him.\u00a0  Jesus. \u00a0 I closed my eyes and prayed.\u00a0 Good thing it was a one-word prayer, because just as I opened them, Niles was on his way\u2026to the proper side of the stage.\u00a0 I never did see if he shook the Superintendent's hand. \u00a0 Once off the stage and out, I breathed after what seemed like forever.\u00a0 Queen had her car waiting on the other side of the building, by the door in a straight line from the stage.\u00a0 Just like that, Niles was done.\u00a0 He waited in his now-former classroom and sat at his desk in the corner one last time until the conclusion of the ceremony. \u00a0 Every year that we have severe and profound kids cross the stage, it is the same.\u00a0 The crowd erupts in the greatest, loudest eruption of applause of the entire day. \u00a0 There is another side and another part to the graduation story.\u00a0 It continues with part 2. \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "2006/01/20", "body": "Mi Familia   In 1996, the Dalton family officially began when I, Dick, took Jane as my lawfully wedded wife.  This blog is not about our relationship but we do have our differences.  My undergraduate degree was in agriculture education, but by the time I met Jane, I was half way through my master\u2019s program.  We were married almost as soon as I finished it.  She has a degree in early childhood education but decided not to teach right after her student teaching.  She was working at a doctor\u2019s office when we met.  After we married, she went back to school and got her LPN license which has never been used since she was pregnant as soon as she graduated. The pregnancy was normal in every way.  It was with the birth that things started.  Thomas spent the first few days of his life in the Newborn ICU due to a pneumothorax\u2026a tiny hole in his lung.  With oxygen, this did heal up and we brought him home.  A few weeks later, he was back in the ICU because it was suspected he had gotten some fluid in his lungs.  But he was okay and we brought him home again.  At 8 months old, he had a series of grand mal siezures.  These were stabilized with Phenobarbital, but the phenobarb probably contributed to Thomas\u2019 developmental delays.  He has been seizure free ever since. Thomas did not speak until he was 3 1/2.  He was in the early intervention program and also participated in a communication research study. I was the one who suggested to his neurologist that Thomas might have autism.  The neurologist agreed, sort of, and Thomas was diagnoses with PDD-NOS.  Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. Thomas learned to communicate through pictures, then signs and finally with spoken words.  In between, he got a voice output communication device through the study and his language really did take off.  Now he talks constantly.  He does have behavior and social issues which we can discuss later. A few years later, Percy was born.  Jane was on some sort of bed rest almost the entire pregnancy, but the birth and delivery were normal.  Easy, compared to Thomas.  Percy has progressed normally, pretty much, except for a few language and fine motor issues.  We just had his first IEP a few months ago as he did qualify as significantly developmentally delayed.  I\u2019m not sure about that, but he is getting some services so I\u2019m okay with it for now.  While he does talk, he is pretty shy around his peers.  Jane is a lot like that, so hopefully it is just a personality thing. The closest relative is Jane\u2019s mother who lives 350 miles away and who isn\u2019t in that good of health.  My parents, siblings and her parents and siblings live more like 1,000 miles away.  So support is in short supply, at least in the way of family help.  We sometimes find ourselves very much alone.  The church does provide some assistance to us, but we are very proud, self-reliant people.  And we do a good job, for the most part. dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/01/20/characters-mi-familia/", "title": "Characters: Mi Familia"},
{"date": "2006/01/23", "body": "I suppose I should explain the title of this blog.\u00a0 I had several ideas in mind, but when I looked over and saw my boys playing, I realized what is was going to be.\u00a0 My journey into special education and exceptionalities began long before I was married and parents. \u00a0 I graduated from Iowa State U. with\u00a0 B.S. in agriculture education in 1987.\u00a0 I liked my ag. classes in high school, and thought I\u2019d like doing it.\u00a0 But there were not many jobs teaching ag. in those days and I struggled to find a half time position, only to see that evaporate under me in a year.\u00a0 I went back to school and got endorsements to teach science.\u00a0 It was during that extra year in school that I had a couple of experiences with special ed.\u00a0 One was being a volunteer tutor at a Mesquakie Indian settlement.\u00a0 The other was being a volunteer at a special preschool with hearing impaired kids.\u00a0 Unfortunately it was at the end of my money to consider another career change.\u00a0 But I had a great time.\u00a0 And I reflected back that my best teaching seemed to be with the slower kids. \u00a0 I was looking for warmer climates and looked for teaching jobs in Florida but eventually settled in Georgia.\u00a0 I taught science for a few years at a private school in the Atlanta area that specialized in teaching (rich) students with ADHD and learning disabilities.\u00a0 I decided to go back to school again and get my Master\u2019s degree in special education, specifically for learning disabilities.\u00a0 But an instructor at Georgia State convinced me that I\u2019d be good in the emotional behavior disorders (EBD) program.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what I ended up doing.\u00a0 It was instant job security.\u00a0 But it was also instant headaches. \u00a0 The most hideous teaching job on the planet is EBD self-contained.\u00a0 And after I applied for a paraprofessional position in a metro county, they interviewed and hired me as a full-fledged teacher despite not being certified and no experience with these sorts of kids.\u00a0 THAT was a mistake for them and me.\u00a0 I was enticed by the money, and they were enticed by having a warm, male body in a classroom for these kids.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why the skid marks on the wall didn\u2019t warn me.\u00a0 I lasted until October, when they had me finish my one semester contract as a long-term substitute.\u00a0 I had a chance to spend time with all the kids of all disabilities in the high school and junior high.\u00a0 I might have been able to land a job in the county except I was blackballed.\u00a0 Or that\u2019s how I felt.\u00a0 I finally did get that paraprofessional job at a psychoed center the next year.\u00a0 It was a wonderful experience. \u00a0 Psychoed centers in Georgia are unique to this state, and serve students with severe emotional behavior disturbed (SEBD) kids.\u00a0 Everyone in the building serves SEBD kids.\u00a0 Everyone works together and pulls together in the same direction.\u00a0 While inclusion and mainstreaming are fine concepts, there is no substitute for having an expert and well-trained staff working together to deliver first class services.\u00a0\u00a0  During this time, I met my wife and was finishing my Master\u2019s.\u00a0 I ended up teaching for 4 years at a Child and Adolescent unit at a state mental hospital.\u00a0 These kids were in the worst of the worst shape, emotionally and behaviorally.\u00a0 And I saw every type at every age.\u00a0 Suicidal, homicidal, schizophrenic, severely developmentally delayed, gifted, hearing and visually impaired\u2026you name it.\u00a0 I did work with a highly qualified\u00a0 EBD teacher but also worked with some who were teachers pulled off the street who knew nothing of teaching kids with disabilities.\u00a0 People who were as unqualified as me when I first started those years ago.\u00a0 I became a parent during this time.\u00a0 When my son was 8 months old, he had a series of seizures which were eventually brought under control with Phenobarbital. \u00a0 I wanted something different once the state governor decided to close down our unit.\u00a0 And that is how I ended up in the present position I occupy now.\u00a0 It was also during this time that my son was diagnosed with PDD-NOS.\u00a0 I was actually the one who went to the neurologist and said, \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at behaviors that match up with Autism!\u201d\u00a0 Sure enough, Thomas would not begin speaking until he was almost 4 years old.\u00a0 Today, he chatters incessantly. \u00a0 I\u2019m teaching special education largely because it is a profession that has chosen me.\u00a0 Certainly the business of teaching severe and profound kids.\u00a0 My experience and expertise with autism landed in my lap as both a teacher and a parent almost simultaneously.\u00a0  \u00a0 I made a lot of choices in my life, but this is a profession that seemed to call out to me and draw me to itself.\u00a0 I think many teachers find themselves drawn into their professions.\u00a0 There are certainly easier ways to make a living and things a person could do to make a lot more.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not complaining about what I get paid.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had harder jobs that paid a lot less, too. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [],

{"date": "2006/01/20", "body": "Acronyms In the world of special Education, we live on a steady diet of jargon and acronyms. So this will serve as a lexicon of sorts that will guide you through the sometimes confusing world in which I live. IDEA  \u2013 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1992, 1997, 2004). The original law was called PL 94-142, or the Education for All Handicapped Students Act (1973, 1976, 1982, 1987). These laws guaranteed a free and appropriate education for all individuals with disabilities. It is supposed to be renewed every 5 years, but you\u2019ll notice a big gap between 1997 and 2004, mostly because of a certain war in Iraq. NCLB  \u2013 No Child Left Behind Act. This law was the first law G.W. Bush signed after taking office in 2001. It was a bipartisan bill originally drafted by none other than Ted Kennedy in 1998. The new version made sweeping changes and enforced them by tying federal funding to the requirements. I\u2019ll get to NCLB more later. IEP  \u2013 Individual Education Plan. This is the document that determines how a child with disabilities is to be educated, according to IDEA. It is, in essence, a mini piece of legislation drawn up by parents teachers and the school system for each child. The law requires that this be reviewed every year. As a teacher and as a parent, it is an extremely important document. It also causes a lot of stress. IFSP  \u2013 Individual Family Service Plan. Part H of IDEA provides services to disabled individuals from birth to age 3, when school systems take over. The IFSP is essentially the IEP for children under the age of 3. These services do vary a lot by state, but all states offer them. LRE  \u2013 Least Restrictive Environment. According to IDEA, a child must be educated in the least restrictive environment in order to meet the child\u2019s IEP goals. There is a continuum of LRE, the least which is a regular education classroom and the most restrictive being a specialized facility. LEA  \u2013 Local Education Agent. There must be a LEA present at each IEP meeting in order to represent the school system\u2019s interest. This person should have enough knowledge of the system\u2019s resources as well as the law in order to speak for the district. In addition to my own IEP meetings and those of my own children, I attend several as an LEA. EBD  \u2013 Emotional and Behavior Disorders. This is one area of disability I\u2019ve dealt with. EBD students may also have intellectual impairments, but mainly they have behaviors which interfere with their and other\u2019s ability to learn. Pragmatically speaking, students with EBD end up being served with this label because their parents are not savvy enough to advocate for an LD or OHI label. LD  \u2013 Learning Disabled. Sometimes it will be SLD or specific learning disability. An LD student usually has one or more performance discrepancies in math, reading or written expression. OHI  \u2013 Other Health Impaired. The largest group of OHI students are those with some form of attention deficit disorder (ADD) such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). But OHI can also be used as a catch-all for students who have a mixture of problems that don\u2019t necessarily fit other categories of impairment such as severe asthma, epilepsy or chronic illness. OI  \u2013 Othopedic Impairment. These are students who may be in wheelchairs but whose intelligence otherwise falls in the normal range. Cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy may cause OI. Stephen Hawking is an example of someone who would be served within the OI model today. TBI  \u2013 Traumatic Brain Injury. When  Coach  joined our staff, he was assigned to assist a TBI student. The student had been in a car wreck and could not eat, toilet,talk or walk without assistance. Yet he still had most of his marbles. A lot of these students are served by OI teachers. To my knowledge, we have no OI teachers in Magnolia county. MID  \u2013 Mildly Intellectually Impaired. We used to say \u201cMildly Retarded\u201d before middle school students and the media co-opted the word \u201cretarded.\u201d I.Q. is generally 55-70. EBD, LD and MID students make up the largest segment of the special education population in most schools. Students may have several labels, such as MID/EBD or LD/OHI or MID/Speech. MoID  \u2013 Moderately Intellectually Impaired. These are the Wal-Mart greeter types you see, many with Down Syndrome. They are usually verbal, can read a few words and know some numbers and colors. I.Q. is 40-55. These are generally the most loving and kind people in any school. If you are a teacher and are feeling depressed, walk into a class full of MoID kids. They\u2019ll hug you and love you and admire you no matter who you are. SID  \u2013 Severe Intellectually Disabled. These kids may or may not be able to walk and talk. They\u2019ll be lucky to recognize their own names, let alone write it. These are some of my kids. Since many are nonverbal, they communicate with behaviors, many times aggressively. Toileting and eating independently are iffy for this group. Some can but many can\u2019t. Other kids can play games while these folks have few independent leisure skills. PID  \u2013 Profoundly Intellectually Disabled. Most of these are not walking. None are talking. They need assistance with everything, sometimes even to eat and breathe. I.Q. is below 25. There are often a lot of medical issues with this and the SID population. I\u2019ve had to do tube feedings and catheterizations with this group. Other teachers are doing trach suctioning, oxygen management, colostomy care and other healthcare procedures. Out of my 8 students, only 3 can use the toilet independently. Everyone else is wearing a diaper or pull up. Only 2 can speak and be understood without an assistive device. GPS  \u2013 Georgia Performance Standards. This is the curriculum that all students in the state of Georgia will be using next year. My students are on a functional curriculum but some lunatic decided it would be good if severe and profound students also were aligned with GPS standards. Grade level standards. Meaning my 9th grade severe kids have to be aligned with language arts, science, math and social studies on the 9th grade level. Right. GAA \u2013  Georgia Alternate Assessment.\u00a0 This is the assessment process students with severe disabiloities use instead of the syandardized tests regular kids use in order to comply with provisions of NCLB.\u00a0 It is basically a portfolio of stuff that is supposed to show that the student is engaged with grade-level tasks and materials. \n O.T.  \u2013 Occupational Therapy. Assists with fine motor skills P.T.  \u2013 Physical Therapy. Assists with gross motor skills. SLP  \u2013 Speech Language Pathologist. Assists with speech, language and communication issues. Often SLPs also assist with feeding and swallowing issues. We currently have a severe shortage of SLPs, OTs and PTs in Magnolia County if any of you are interested! VI  \u2013 Visually Impaired. This can refer to a student with that disability or the therapist that serves them. I\u2019ll let you know which I refer to, but I currently have no VI students so I\u2019m not even sure who our VI person is in the county anymore! CBI -Community Based Instruction. This is where we go into the community and to job sites. We practice shopping, purchasing and generally just behaving right when being out around regular people. APE  \u2013 Adaptive P.E. A sort of extension of PT, where students participate in various sports skills. They might not play base ball, but they practice hitting, throwing, catching and base running. FAPE \u2013  Free and Appropriate Public Education.  Under IDEA, all students are entitled to FAPE until they turn 21. IEE  \u2013 Independent Educational Evaluation.  Under IDEA \u201997 and 2004, parents are entitled to free independent educational evaluations.  The school can refuse to pay for it, but in order to do so they would have to file for due process in order to defend their own evaluation. I\u2019ll probably add more as needed. Hopefully this is helpful. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/01/20/acronyms/", "title": "Acronyms"},
{"date": "2006/01/22", "body": "01/21/2006 The most important part of any special educational program is the IEP.\u00a0 This is the key document that will govern what can and cannot be done with a child during the coming year.\u00a0 It determines what will be taught, where it will be taught and somewhat who will be doing the teaching. \u00a0 Now that I have a new student, preparing for this IEP is job #1.\u00a0 And step #1 is getting as much information from the parent as possible.\u00a0 I want to know what a parent\u2019s dreams and aspirations for this child.\u00a0 I want to know what he can do.\u00a0 I want to know what the parent struggles with at home and in the community.\u00a0 What issues does the parent have?\u00a0 While academic and adaptive skills in school are important, the parent is with this child pretty much forever.\u00a0 Teachers come and go.\u00a0 School eventually ends.\u00a0 What happens beyond school?\u00a0 This is so critical.\u00a0 Even at the preschool level, we need to have an eye on post-school transition.\u00a0 They may be in school through the age of 21 or 22 (In Michigan, through 26) but if they live even a modest life span, they will spend the majority of their lives out of school.\u00a0 There is NO legislation governing post-school placement.\u00a0 No one HAS to take them.\u00a0 They can spend YEARS waiting for placement in a group home after school.\u00a0 Even DECADES! \u00a0 Getting parents to think about this bigger picture is important.\u00a0 The only reason I\u2019m so intense on it is because I am a parent of two young ones beginning the process.\u00a0 But I teach students at the end.\u00a0 I am the undertaker and the pall bearer of the special education process.\u00a0 I\u2019m the last school teacher many students and parents will ever have.\u00a0 Do I simply try to console them and make their passing as comfortable as possible while I wait for retirement and my pension?\u00a0 Or do I keep fighting and advocating?\u00a0 I hope to do the latter, but the temptation to do the former is quite powerful.\u00a0 I know what lies beyond, and it is almost too grim to think about.\u00a0 Graduation day for special education students, if they graduate at all, is not the happy time it is for typical students.\u00a0 While all students have some anxiety, those graduating from special education face even more daunting challenges.\u00a0 And for my students, the parents bear the entire burden.\u00a0 The law is gone.\u00a0 The mandate for accommodations and services is gone.\u00a0 Free and reduced lunches\u2026GONE.\u00a0 Teachers and paras and administrators that can be sued\u2026GONE.\u00a0 The IEP with its mandate for services, supports, accommodations, plans and goals\u2026GONE.\u00a0 This system of support vaporizes in a single day. \u00a0 There are services out there, but these are mere husks of what existed in the school system.\u00a0 As teachers, the responsibility can be overwhelming if we think too much about it.\u00a0 As parents, it\u2019s easier to live in the present struggle and keep pushing those thoughts away.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to face it.\u00a0 We can keep hoping for quite awhile, that things will eventually turn out \u201cnormal.\u201d\u00a0 Again, I do face the enormous temptation of denial.\u00a0 Denial exists because it feels comfortable, and I admit to taking refuge there more times than not.\u00a0 But I know the day is coming. \u00a0 So during the IEP and assessment process, I am measuring the parent as well as the student.\u00a0 I need to know how prepared the parent is, and help them along.\u00a0 But unlike most of my colleagues, I have a lot more compassion and understanding as well as a sense of urgency.\u00a0 Every student represents a possibility.\u00a0 I look into a parent\u2019s eyes and see my own future.\u00a0 I respect and admire them all, even seemingly uninterested and uninvolved ones.\u00a0 There is no possible way they have an easy life.\u00a0 Can I blame them for trying to take shortcuts?\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame them for not showing up to IEPs as the system, despite safeguards, is stacked against them.\u00a0 My oldest is in kindergarten and I\u2019M sick of it already!! \u00a0 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll write more on this later on.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have any students graduating this year, but a bunch going next year.\u00a0 At that time, there will be much more to say.\u00a0  \u00a0 dick \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/01/22/transitions/", "title": "Transitions"},

Ed. teachers are primarily concerned with helping their students acquire greater cognitive skills.\u00a0 Getting their kids to think and behave as increasingly mature and responsible people.\u00a0 This is a challenging enough task, in itself.\u00a0 Now imagine doing this in addition to motor skills (fine and gross), leisure skills and self help skills such as feeding and using the bathroom.\u00a0 In a room with eight students, only 2 are able to use the bathroom fairly independently.\u00a0 Meaning they don\u2019t wear diapers.\u00a0 They still can\u2019t button or snap their pants independently.\u00a0 The rest are all in diapers.\u00a0 There is a lot of lifting involved.\u00a0 Remember, these are  high school students! \u00a0 Even the smallest one is pretty heavy.\u00a0 And they can be strong, so they often don\u2019t cooperate when being changed or fed. \u00a0 If I don\u2019t feel like working on cognitive skills, there are stretching exercises, walking exercises, getting them to sit up or just stand up.\u00a0 Transferring from one chair to another.\u00a0 All of these are physical tasks.\u00a0 If it is above 50\u00b0, I don\u2019t bother with a long sleeved shirt, because I can get warm enough just with the work we do. \u00a0 It is challenging.\u00a0 Rewards?\u00a0 Well, I do think I get paid well enough although I can always use more.\u00a0 But occasionally there is a small breakthrough and that is satisfying.\u00a0 A kid finally begins to communicate more or learns to play with a peer.\u00a0 These are small but significant things.\u00a0 Probably I get the biggest strokes from the parents, who are appreciative of what we do.\u00a0 Also colleagues, giants in their own right, who marvel at what we do.\u00a0 But yes, I think I\u2019m good at what I do.\u00a0 I feel competent and confident here. \u00a0 This is probably why this business with tomorrow\u2019s IEP is so irksome.\u00a0 My competence is being called into question.\u00a0 Maybe I need to be taken down a notch. \u00a0 I think that we educators can get too caught up in all the negativity surrounding our business.\u00a0 NCLB, being Highly Qualified, AYP, school choice and school vouchers\u2026these are all fine issues for debate.\u00a0 But on a day-to-day basis, these issues are navel gazing.\u00a0 Yes they affect us all.\u00a0 But when you close the door to your classroom, you are still the captain of that ship.\u00a0 We all have to jump through more and more hoops, endure more criticism and abuse from parents, students, administrators, politicians and the general public.\u00a0 There are so many insanities in educational institutions at all levels.\u00a0 I\u2019m all for realism. \u00a0 But there is room for optimism.\u00a0 Everyday we have the chance to make a difference, however small. Teachers do it all day long in ways that they are not even aware of.\u00a0 By and large, local communities do support their teachers.\u00a0 At least in the recognition that it is a very honorable and noble profession.\u00a0 It\u2019s because we really are a cut above.\u00a0 Who do you think you neighbors trust more?\u00a0 School teachers or politicians?\u00a0 Constantly acting like victims will not get us more respect.\u00a0 Acting like the responsible and dutiful public servants that we are will.\u00a0 Holding our heads down will not have the same impact as holding them high.\u00a0 We ARE professionals and we have important jobs to do.\u00a0 We are not irrelevant.\u00a0 We are on the frontlines in the war against ignorance.\u00a0 Stay strong and keep the faith. \u00a0 D. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/01/30/why-do-i-do-it/", "title": "Why Do I Do\u00a0It?"},

{"date": "2007/03/12", "body": "This is the second post on manifestation determination, which is an important variation in the IEP process.\u00a0  See part 1 here. Raising a child with a disability is difficult.You\u2019ve been dealing with this person\u2019s behavioral issues since day one.And you still love them because this is your child!Little Johny might not be an angel, but he\u2019s trying his best.You may be getting many phone calls from the school regarding your child\u2019s behavior and heaven knows you hear enough at the annual IEP meetings. But in about 7th grade, it might be a bit more serious.Johny or Joni might have done something for which they are being suspended.Perhaps it is something like getting into a fight or stealing something or bringing something they ought not to have brought to school.Formal charges might have been filed with the police.For most students, they will go through a tribunal or disciplinary process to determine the facts and then give out the punishment.But for students with disabilities, there is an added part to the process called a Manifestation Determination. The idea for doing this is because the disciplinary process could be used in such a way as to deny a student their right to a free and appropriate public education.If we can just frustrate a student with a behavioral disability long enough, they\u2019ll do something dumb and they can be kicked out. To a parent, this manifestation is going to look an awful lot like a tribunal or trial.In a sense it is, but it\u2019s not exactly what you think.If your child is up for suspension for fighting, the specific facts of the case will be brought up but that is not going to be the focal point of the discussion.This often confuses parents because they come to the meeting prepared to argue on behalf of their child staying in school.While this is what is at stake, it is not going to be treated directly.This is both good and bad.The good news is that there is at least one more meeting where the case can be argued if this one fails.The bad news is that it can be very confusing to parents. Using my example from the previous post, where a student accepted money that he knew had been stolen, it looks very bad for the student.How does a disability in writing influence whether or not a child steals? However, the present level of performance did reveal some impulsivity and a vulnerability to undo influence from peers.These are not untypical for individuals with various disabilities who lack social skills.It\u2019s not so much the writing disability at issue as much as the topography of the entire disability.So a savvy parent could legitimately make the case that the incident could indeed be a manifestation of the disability.However expect heavy argument and dissention from the administrator. This is a good reason for a parent to have an individual private evaluation done and included as part of the IEP record.Such documentation is the key to turning things around. At one point during that manifestation I thought the parent might actually be on the verge of prevailing.Not on the first question, but on the second regarding the school\u2019s implementation of the IEP.She started asking questions about her son\u2019s teachers, specifically the special education teachers.He had several collaborative classes plus one resource class.The fact was, that one of the collaborative classes was staffed by a substitute all semester and the resource class only has had a para since the end of January.The fact is, fully one third of his services were not being provided in accordance with the law by having a highly qualified teacher.But the parent did not sufficiently pursue her line of questioning, and dropped the matter. When asked, the caseload teacher said the student was getting all the services as written in the IEP. My role in this meeting was not an active one, as I was not a case manager or a teacher of this child.\u00a0 One can imagine the reaction I would have gotten if I had said anything resembling what I was thinking. I\u2019ve tried to summarize something about manifestations that might be helpful.If you\u2019re a parent, I would advise bringing in an advocate for a manifestation just because it can help to have someone who is not so emotionally bound up in the process who might be able to keep you from being steam rolled.It\u2019s a lot like an IEP except more emotionally charged and consequences can be dire as far as suspension and alternative school. Hopefully I won\u2019 t have to sit through one as a parent but I think I know enough about the process to make all parties involved very nervous. And they should be. Having said that, there are times when the action has no relationship to the disability.For instance I once had a student who went through a manifestation because he brought a porn tape to school and tried to play it.He intended to trade the tape for something else, but when he tried to play it he was busted.While he was being served in a self-contained EBD class, his actions were clearly deliberate and not related to being EBD.In fact, his deliberateness and ingenuity at working to get something he wanted by trading rather than intimidation might almost be seen as an improvement.So in this case, his trip to the alternative school was earned. I\u2019ll write more about IEPs later, but thought this needed to be talked about at least a little bit. d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/03/12/iep-process-manifestation-determination-part-2/", "title": "IEP Process: Manifestation Determination Part\u00a02"},
{"date": "2007/07/12", "body": "I had no idea that I would have so much to say over the summer!    I\u2019m still on vacation but my mind is shifting back towards school more and more.    I had a couple days of workshops this week and stopped by the classroom for a few minutes.    They\u2019ve re-imaged one of the computers, waxed the floor and otherwise left a mess.      We teachers start back in one week.    I know, a lot of you just got out!    It\u2019s okay not to read blogs while on vacation but it\u2019s nice to write when I have time to think.   I\u2019ve heard from one representative and one senator.    My representative was very nice, personal and empathized with my plight.    He actually read what I wrote and replied.    I sense that he still thinks NCLB is a good idea but sees the need for revision and changes especially in my area of severe disabilities.    I will be crossing my usual party line to vote for him.   Saxby Chambliss replied as well.    While it was nice of him to do so, considering he\u2019s going to be in for a tough re-election race, his reply was not supportive.    In fact, I doubt he (or his staffer) read beyond the subject line.    What I got was a canned reply stating his commitment and support for \u201cPresident Bush\u2019s Education reforms.\u201d   Egad.   My Letter:   Dear Senator Chambliss,   I am writing to you regarding the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act.    I am a teacher who teaches students with severe and profound disabilities.    I am also a parent of two young children who have mild disabilities on the autistic spectrum.   NCLB is destroying education for children in  Georgia  and across the nation.    The over-emphasis on testing has been a costly exercise that is causing the neglect of both gifted and those with severe disabilities through most resources being channeled towards those who are just below the passing mark in the core subjects.   Personally, I feel like a criminal when having my students with profound disabilities go through the new alternate assessment.    Why on earth would anyone demand and expect that an 18 year old with an I.Q. of 7 go through an assessment of American Literature, American History, Algebra, Geometry and Biology or Physical Science?    Why are students who can not speak, can not feed themselves or who wear diapers forced to prove performance to grade-level standards?    It is not fair to these students and does a disservice to those who do get a regular diploma.    What kind of world class educational system shows equal proficiency between someone with and I.Q. of 7 and someone with an I.Q. of 107?      All around the state and nation, teachers such as me are required to demonstrate in some way that these students have some sort of basic  grade-level  proficiency in the core subjects.    These are students whose mental functioning is measured in  months  not years!   Please help restore some sanity by either scrapping the current law or reforming it in such a way that it might better serve the students that I teach.    Our students, their parents and their teachers are in dire need of your help.   I would be happy to answer any questions you may have regarding students with significant disabilities and the impact of these NCLB-mandated assessments on teaching and learning in our schools.   Thank you for your time and attention.   Sincerely,   Dick Dalton   His Reply:     \n Dear Mr. Dalton :  \n     \n             Thank you for contacting me regarding your concerns about P.L. 107-110, the \u201cNo Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001.\u201d It is good to hear from you.  \n              \n President Bush\u2019s landmark education bill, NCLB, set high standards for public education and educators. This bill is set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2007 and must be reauthorized by Congress. It is imperative that every child in  Georgia  \u2018s public school system learns to read to their maximum potential. This is one of my top priorities because reading is the foundation to our children\u2019s academic success and the gateway to knowledge. We need increased accountability for students and teachers, improved results for students with disabilities, increased safety in schools and classrooms, and more parental involvement. Meeting these goals will go a long way in improving the quality of education for all of  Georgia  \u2018s children.  \n     \n While there have been some concerns with this legislation, I am committed to continuing to implement high standards for our students. Over the last few years, I have met with teachers, principals, and administrators all over the state to discuss the successes and failures of this legislation. I look forward to working with both educators of Georgia and my colleagues in Congress to make positive and necessary changes and improve our education system through the reauthorization of NCLB.  \n                                                                                                         \n As the husband and father of public school teachers, please know I am committed to improving public education and making sure our children and grandchildren get the best education experience possible. If I may ever be of assistance in the future, please do not hesitate to let me know.  \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 Now tell me: Did the good senator address my letter  at all ?    My congressman actually typed and wrote his response using snail mail despite my using the web to submit my letter.    I thought that was pretty nice.    My senators each have snail mail letters on the way with identical text.    We\u2019ll see if there is any response and anything deviating from the party line. \u00a0 Fact is, I don\u2019t think the republicans are listening, or at least the two senators from Georgia aren\u2019t.    They both got \u201cboo\u2019ed\u201d at a republican fundraiser when they tried to defend GW\u2019s immigration policy and I think they would get a similar chilly response from voters on NCLB.    The more people know about this thing, the less they like it. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 [Update: I managed to OCR scan the letter from my representative. Can you see the difference in style and tone here?: \n \u00a0 \n Dear Mr. Dalton: \n I couldn\u2019t agree more that the NCLB Act (NCLB) needs wholesale change  with regard to children who have severe development disabilities. You described the problem quite well. And you are not the first to highlight this  issue. \n I don\u2019t serve on the House Education and the Workforce Committee,  where NCLB reform legislation will be drafted. I have also been told that NCLB  is not expected to be reauthorized until later this year. I know Members of that  Committee are sensitive to the issues you raise. I will wait to see the final  version of the bill drafted by the Committee before making up my mind, and I will keep your thoughts in mind when making a decision. \n Please let me know if I can help in any other way. \n Very truly yours, \n Jim \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/i-dont-think-hes-paying-any-attention/", "title": "I Don\u2019t Think He\u2019s Paying any\u00a0Attention"},
{"date": "2007/07/18", "body": "I like to try to recruit smart people into the Special education business as much as anyone else.    We need more people, and we need smart people.    At the same time, I\u2019m a strong advocate of doing whatever I can to support teachers who are already in the business.    This business with NCLB and alternate assessments has made that task a lot more difficult and has taken quite a lot of the heart out of any efforts I might make. It\u2019s very difficult talking about bringing in new talent into a business that I\u2019m not sure that I want to stay in.    \u00a0 That last sentence was a tough one to write.    \u00a0 Special education is a VERY tough business, no doubt.    The attrition rate 3 years ago when I last saw the figures was a 50% turn-around within 5 years.    Less than 3 years in some areas such as teaching those with emotional behavior disorders and those serving children with severe disabilities.    And NCLB has probably increased those figures considerably.    At this point, school districts are happy with any warm body, let alone someone who is reasonably competent and experienced.    \u00a0 For your reading pleasure, I direct you to  an article from the boston.com news  about New Hampshire trying to alleviate its shortage of special education teachers.    Early on it is noted that  no one  had registered for the special education program at the University  of New Hampshire for  the last two years!    No one.    Not even one.    There\u2019s a bit of a problem here, isn\u2019t there?    NH\u2019s solution is to offer reduced or free tuition for those enrolling in the UNH special education program funded by a federal grant.    They are hoping to attract 20 new students this year and 20 more next year.    So far they\u2019ve accepted 6 applicants with 6 more saying that they plan on enrolling this fall.    I wonder if they will make their goal. \u00a0 Even if they do, there are some problems.    First and foremost, this is like sticking a finger in the proverbial dike.    With the attrition rate running as high as it is, 20 new teachers will not even come close to addressing New Hampshire\u2019s needs.    \u00a0 Secondly, even with 50% off or free tuition, they are having trouble meeting their goal.    Finally, with the \u201cwarm body\u201d mentality running amok, there\u2019s little controls or measures to make sure that the applicants they DO get are going to be competent enough to do the job.    There may be unseen checks that were not written about in the article, but that is a substantial issue nation wide. \u00a0 So what do I think should be done to ease the supply problem? \u00a0 1. Untangle the mess that is the teacher supply-line.    There are a myriad of ways a person can become a certified teacher, but state departments all too often put up silly road blocks such as the lack of reciprocity between states or requiring teachers take a course on their state history before giving them a certificate.    Many of these hoops have nothing to do with teacher competence.    Also, they are not always clear.    People call the state DOE and get conflicting answers as to what they have to do to get certified.    \u00a0 2. Concentrate efforts at retention.    I witnessed my own administration seemingly bent on running off teachers who were doing a decent job.    Instead of offering more training and mentoring, they simply try to run off teachers who make mistakes.    Okay, I\u2019m against incompetence as much as anyone, but reasonable attempts should be made to train the people already warming those spots before cutting them loose. \u00a0 3. Differential pay.    Oh boy.    This is a touchy issue, but right now there is a very steady migration of teachers  out of  special education and into other subject areas.    Once a special education teacher gets highly qualified in a core subject, they say \u201cScrew this!\u201d and simply move over into a regular classroom.    In contrast, the migration from regular education to special education is practically zero.    Differential pay would help balance this migration problem as well as help with recruitment.    Oh, and this pay differential should include para educators as well.    It\u2019s getting harder and harder to staff those positions as the requirements go up but the pay does not. \u00a0 4. Produce a special pipeline that will help para educators get certified.    This  is where the grant money NH got could have been better spent.    Paras often have years of experience already in the classroom with these students.    They already know many of the ropes.    They are already there and if they are willing, they\u2019ll have a better idea of what they are in for than those walking in off the street.    In fact, paras should be allowed to turn their para positions into paid internships for student teaching.    With the current state of para pay, they are not likely able to afford the cost of higher education.    Give these folks a helping hand and grow your own supply of competent  experienced  teachers. \u00a0 5. Include in the supply pipeline an avenue for advancement to administrative positions.    Administrative support is one of the single biggest issues in the retention of special educators.    And more and more we find ourselves working under supervisors who are pretty clueless as what special education entails.    This has such a direct bearing on competence and could help prevent many due process hearings.    Time and again I have been in IEP meeting where the administrator who was acting as LEA knew little or nothing about IEP\u2019s and special education law and then they said something absolutely stupid that pissed a parent off. \u00a0 I think that\u2019s a decent start.    Any other ideas? \u00a0 dick \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.boston.com/news/education/k_12/articles/2007/07/15/grant_prompts_future_special_ed_teachers_to_enroll/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/07/18/a-teacher-supply-problem/", "title": "A Teacher Supply\u00a0Problem"},
{"date": "2007/07/20", "body": "I finally got an email from Senator Isakson in response to my email.Take a look: \n Dear Mr. Dalton: \n  Thank you for contacting my office regarding No Child Left Behind. I appreciate your concerns and am glad to have the opportunity to respond.  \n  As one of the authors of President Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind law, I have a vested interest in this legislation and its impact on our nation\u2019s education system. Overall, our school systems are improving and our students are receiving more of the educational tools they need to compete in the 21 st  Century. I am especially pleased with the increased accountability under No Child Left Behind. That being said, I do realize that there are some areas that need revision, specifically those dealing with Adequate Yearly Progress, Special Education and non-English speaking students. As we work on reauthorization, please know that I will keep your concerns in mind as we begin to formulate ideas to improve the bill. \n  Thank you again for contacting me, and I hope you will not hesitate to call on me in the future if I can be of assistance to you. \n Sincerely, \nJohnny Isakson \nUnited States Senator \n \n Now  go back there and read Senator Chambliss\u2019 reply .See anything in common?See any difference between that and the reply from my congressman?There is one thing that particularly bugs and irritates me about these two republican senators.Namely, they both refer to this as President Bush\u2019s education law.What the hell is up with that?I never heard anyone refer to IDEA 1992 as President H.W. Bush\u2019s education act.I didn\u2019t hear anyone referring to the ESEA 1998 law as President Clinton\u2019s education law.And even though President Bush had little to do with actually writing this thing, those loyal to him seem to want to hang this all over him.Whatever happened to bipartisanship which was supposedly so prevalent when it was first passed? I thank all the legislators who have responded, so far.Perhaps I should issue some letter grades to them based on their responses.Ranking them, my congressman gets the highest mark, Isakson gets a distantly lower mark and Chambliss lags further behind for not even addressing any of my concerns at all.At least Senator Isakson conceded that some changes would be in the works albeit in a more generic fashion.

Today was our first day back at work.Yep, it\u2019s that time and the rest of you teachers can think about when it\u2019s your turn.Our principal welcomed everyone back and then announced that the final results were that we made AYP. Fully one third of our faculty is brand new.That means that many of those folks that helped us make AYP are no longer present on the team.A lot of those folks were first string teachers.The special education department experienced a rather large turnover, as it always does, with close to half those people who were here last year not returning.Most of the replacements are not first stringers, but folks walking in off the street who have never taught before. dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/07/20/more-activism-plus-back-to-school/", "title": "More Activism plus Back To\u00a0School"},
{"date": "2007/09/07", "body": "Here\u2019s a couple more new acronyms to add to your lexicon.    These are not limited to special education.    No, they are coming to regular education classrooms nationwide and especially (as far as I know) to the state of Georgia.    RTI is Response To Intervention, which is the latest buzzword burning across all levels of the educational spectrum.    In fact, my blog traffic will probably jump just because I\u2019m referencing it.    Everyone is talking about it, or at least writing about it so I though I would throw in my two cents.    POI is  Pyramid Of Interventions , which might be Georgia\u2019s tricky take on RTI.    Here, the two seem to be used together and the state is basically mandating that the RTI/ POI approach  be used effective immediately.    We just had a recent faculty presentation on it, and it certainly caused a lot of buzz amongst the teachers.    At least for the regular teachers. What RTI basically involves is a sort of approach that behaviorists have always used.    Basically, if a student is falling behind in a subject, the teacher begins collecting data and tracks the students\u2019 progress.    There are some interventions that the teacher can try such as peer tutoring, extra practice, a graphic organizer or some other instructional strategy in order to help the student progress in the curriculum.    If the student fails to respond to the intervention, then another intervention is attempted and the student is tracked some more.    If the student makes progress, that\u2019s great!    If they do not, you progress up a level on the pyramid of intervention (POI).     The intent is to keep students from falling behind and to keep them from having to go into special education.    The goal is to have less than 5% of the school population in special education as opposed to the present rate which is about 13% in our system.    This is a procedure not altogether foreign to most special educators because we tend to be more behaviorally oriented.    However, the general education teachers are not from behaviorist backgrounds, so they almost instantly begin thinking in terms of learning styles, modalities, multiple intelligence and other assorted theories that may be very nice but are not really shown to be efficacious according to any sort of empirical research. What really makes the regular ed. teachers groan (especially at the high school level) is the increased paperwork this is going to involve.    Much of the load that us special educators have been carrying for years is being shifted to the regular teachers.    And for a high school teacher who may teach 150 students per day, this is VERY substantial!    This is why a collaborative model of instruction begins making more and more sense because well-trained special educators can help with the data collection and interpretation as well as help implement research-based interventions that might yield some results.    However, this does not appear to be the way things are shaping up from what I can see in my school.    Special education seems to be more and more marginalized, and the emphasis seems to be on trying to bypass and eliminate that exceptional subgroup altogether.    Hey, if kids can learn better, I\u2019m all for it!    I have other areas I can (and will) teach.    But regular education has been struggling with the load they already have.    Increasing the non-teaching paperwork burden on those folks will not improve the special educator\u2019s lot, nor will it improve teaching quality.    It might make an already severe teaching shortage even moreso.  Plus their concept of \u201cresearch-based\u201d is sort of loose compared to what I\u2019m used to seeing in special education literature. If you haven\u2019t heard of RTI, you need to bone up on it.

{"date": "2007/07/26", "body": "We\u2019ve been at it all week, and it was only today that we were really and truly able to get down to some serious business of planning actual programs and lessons for the students. \u00a0  Why just today, you might ask?  \u00a0 First off, there has been an endless parade of meetings that needed to be attended for various and sundry departments, committees and functions. \u00a0  This was a lot of it. \u00a0  But it was also difficult focusing on the tasks until our backs were right up against it, and we knew that the reality of tomorrow was upon us. \u00a0  We\u2019re going to have the kids and we\u2019re going to have them all day. \u00a0  Ready or not, they are coming. \u00a0 We had an Open House this evening, so I didn\u2019t get home until late. \u00a0  But like most teachers and students, the evening before opening day doesn\u2019t bring a lot of rest and the thoughts come racing. \u00a0  So I put those thoughts to good use. \u00a0  Maybe. \u00a0  I\u2019ll let you be the judge. \u00a0 My syllabus is very general and very weak, so I began revising it. \u00a0  \u201cOverhaul\u201d would mildly describe what I just did. \u00a0  One of the things the administration saddled me with was aligning what I do everyday with the general education curriculum. \u00a0  That means math, science, ELA and social studies. \u00a0  So I first overhauled my thinking and then set it up thus: \u00a0 \n Schedule \n \u00a0 \n 8:00 \u2013 8:30 \u2013 Buses arrive and prepare for our day \n 8:30 \u2013 Announcements, moment of silence and pledge \n 8:35 \u2013 Breakfast \n 9:00 \u2013 Restroom & American Literature time \n 9:30 \u2013 Writing and communication time \n 10:00 \u2013 Position change for wheelchairs, Geography \n 10:30 \u2013 Community time, Algebra and geometry \n 11:00 \u2013 American History, World History & Economics (Community time continues) \n 11:30 \u2013 Earth science, Physical science and chemistry (community time continues) \n 12:15 \u2013 Lunch \n 1:00 \u2013 Restroom break, \n 1:30 \u2013 Recreation/leisure/art time \n 2:20 \u2013 Adaptive PE (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday) \n 2:30 \u2013 Restroom, changing, Biology (Tuesday, Friday) \n 3:00 \u2013 Snack time \n 3:15 \u2013 Dismissal \n \u00a0 That was simple enough. \u00a0  You\u2019ll notice I\u2019m hitting science twice because it\u2019s my thing and I find it easier to plan and think about it. \u00a0  Plus with adaptive PE, biology is still going to get a short shrift. \u00a0  That 1:30 \u2013 2:30 time slot is my planning period. \u00a0  Pity the poor teacher who has them for that period of time\u2026as well as the other students and teachers on that hall as my kids can get kind of loud! \u00a0  I am assigned a new teacher to mentor. \u00a0  He\u2019s doing collaborative work but actually has experience with severe and profound students so he\u2019s not exactly just off the street. \u00a0  But since he\u2019s in a spot where I might want to be down the line I\u2019m as interested in learning from him as anything I might have to offer. \u00a0  But being available is key. \u00a0  And now for the curriculum: \u00a0 \n Curriculum of subjects: General Scope and Sequence \n (These can change at any time as other learning opportunities arise) \n \u00a0 \n American Literature Topics \n August: Poetry \n September: Moby Dick \n October: American Folktales and Legends \n November: Mark Twain \n December: More poetry, rhythm, rhyme and verse \n \u00a0 \n Wish list: graphic literary novels, adapted books by American authors, computer adaptations of stories and poems \n \u00a0 \n Writing and communication topics  \u2013 Integrated across all curriculum areas \n August \u2013 Personal information, classmates, class schedule \n September \u2013 Special Olympic softball, Community activities, having a conversation \n October \u2013 Community activities, Fall holidays, Special Olympic Roller skating \n November \u2013 Thanksgiving, table manners, ordering food \n December \u2013 Christmas vocabulary, feelings and emotions, humor \n \u00a0 \n Wish list: Pictures of important (to the student) people and places such as home, family, favorite activities and foods, collections of jokes and riddles. \n \u00a0 \n Geography  \n August \u2013 Personal geography: Up, down, over, under, between, inside, outside, closer, farther \n September: School geography: cafeteria, media center, gym, office, hallways, doors, steps, track, auditorium \n October \u2013 Natural landforms: Hills, valleys, rivers, oceans, forests, fields \n November \u2013 Community geography: roads, streets, bridges, houses, stores \n December \u2013 Finding it on a map: Atlanta, Covington, Georgia, United States, Atlantic  Ocean \n \u00a0 \n Wish list: Personal laminated U.S. and World Maps. \n \u00a0 \n Algebra and Geometry \n August \u2013 Rational, positive whole integers less than 10, Integers in the environment \n September \u2013 mathematical patterns, inequalities \n October \u2013 Geometrical representations and 3 dimensional polygons \n November \u2013 Visual analysis in recognizing representations of equal value \n December \u2013 Probability and cooperative problem solving \n \u00a0 \n American History, World History & Economics \n August \u2013 Supply and Demand, Opportunity cost \n September \u2013 Scarcity, the U.S. monetary system \n October \u2013 Mesoamericans, Christopher Columbus \n November \u2013 European settlement and colonial culture \n December \u2013 Contemporary world cultures \n \u00a0 \n Earth science, Physical science and Applied chemistry \n August \u2013 Minerals and geological samples, matter, mass \n September \u2013 mass, gravity, friction \n October \u2013 Newton\u2019s 3 laws of motion \n November \u2013 States of matter \n December \u2013 Heat transfer: convection, conduction, radiation \n \u00a0 \n Wish list: unusual rock and mineral samples \n \u00a0 \n Biology \n August \u2013 Animal, mineral or plant \n September \u2013 Roots, stems and leaves, grass, trees \n October \u2013 Animals and ecosystems \n November \u2013 Anatomy and physiology: digestion \n December \u2013 Anatomy and physiology: Sensory systems \n \u00a0 \n Some of this might make sense. \u00a0  Most of it might not, since we  are  talking about nonverbal kids with IQs in the severe and profound range. \u00a0  Stay tuned as I work this business out. \u00a0  It will be an adventure and I\u2019m down with that since I\u2019m going to end up doing something different one way or another. \u00a0  I might as well get a jump on the wave of the future, whether I teach in a different setting or teach in a different way to the same kids. \u00a0  This is one advantage with my population; most administrators, politicians, other teachers and community members are so clueless that I\u2019m seen as a miracle worker regardless of what I do, for good or ill. \u00a0 I know it is a bit sad, but I\u2019m also offered the opportunity to try out some newer things with a minimum of trouble.\u00a0 O nce folks get a load of this, I\u2019ll probably be laughed out or carried out in a straight jacket. Oh well. \u00a0  At least I\u2019ll go out with a bang!\u00a0 The administration asked for a syllabus reflecting alignment with the regular curriculum and that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re getting.\u00a0 The wacky thing is, is that I actually plan on trying to teach from it. \u00a0dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/07/26/the-end-of-pre-planning-going-loco/", "title": "The end of Pre-Planning: Going\u00a0Loco?"},
{"date": "2007/09/24", "body": "My little blog was puttering and sputtering along until the other day traffic spiked up all around my post on Oprah\u2019s previous special. \u00a0 Sure enough, the queen of daytime did it again with Jenny McCarthy and Holly Robinson Peete as guests, telling their stories. \u00a0  You can read all about it and see pictures on  Oprah\u2019s site . \u00a0  Since I totally missed watching it, that\u2019s where I had to go to get the scoop. \u00a0  So those of you looking for more on that show can go there. \u00a0  Then come back if you\u2019re interested in my take on what I read. \u00a0 First off, I\u2019m all for more awareness about autism. \u00a0  The more people know, the less fear they will have. \u00a0  Hopefully. \u00a0  Those people with disabilities (especially those you can\u2019t see) are the last ones to really benefit from the civil rights movement. \u00a0  And making fun of people who are different is still a favorite pastime. \u00a0  So getting some exposure with the likes of Oprah should be a good thing. \u00a0 This was definitely a more cutting edge show than her previous special done last spring, as her guests really did push harder towards the various treatments and did not dodge the vaccinations and biomedical controversies. \u00a0  Jenny McCarthy was all about the diet and the mercury in vaccinations. \u00a0 As a mother, I think it might be fair to characterize Ms McCarthy as intense. \u00a0  She has always been intense about everything she has ever done. \u00a0  When she posed for  Playboy  all those years ago, she was no young naive little girl. \u00a0  She was driven and deliberate, and utterly conquered using her brains as well as her body to propel her videos into the #1 spot, which I\u2019d never heard of any Playboy video doing before or since. \u00a0  She then tried her hand on TV, which had a mixed degree of success. \u00a0  More recently I noticed her on Weight Watchers commercials, looking as fabulous as ever. \u00a0 So what\u2019s this got to do with autism? \u00a0  Not much, except she has parlayed her son\u2019s autism into a book as well as her own  educational business. \u00a0   I know she likes helping people, just like she seemed to enjoy being naked for Playboy. \u00a0  But I\u2019m not having as good of a feeling about her leveraging her son\u2019s autism into another business venture as when it was just her body for either Playboy or Weight Watchers. \u00a0  But maybe that\u2019s just me. \u00a0  \u00a0 Ms. McCarthy\u2019s story is a good, compelling story and it does give a lot of hope to a lot of parents out there who are struggling. \u00a0  I do give her some credit for attempting to put her initial disclaimer of not being a doctor (nor having played one on TV), not being an interventionist but just a concerned mother out front. \u00a0  But I don\u2019t think anyone really heard that part once she got into the diet. \u00a0  \u00a0 Wait\u2026is Weight Watchers GFCF? \u00a0 I liked a lot of what she presented in terms of her own life, her struggles with doctors and her marriage. \u00a0  \u00a0 I think the appallingly high divorce rate among parents of children with autism is an area that simply has not been dealt with at all. \u00a0  At least a little light was shown on it here. \u00a0  Perhaps I will shine more light on it later. \u00a0 Holly Robinson Peete \u00a0 I didn\u2019t see her but liked what I read of her and about her. \u00a0  Her and her husband have a  foundation dedicated towards the treatment and cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease  which claimed her father\u2019s life just a few years ago. \u00a0  Their (Holly and Rod) approach was to not be extremely public about their son\u2019s autism. \u00a0  But they were extremely proactive in seeking a variety of treatments that included the diet, floortime, ABA and speech and OT. \u00a0  \u00a0 My impression just by reading the two different accounts (and the questions and answers in their own words) is that Holly is motivated and driven but at the same time is more balanced in her approach to autism. \u00a0  Her son has a sibling, which helps with socialization but also helps take some heat off the autistic child\u2019s issues. \u00a0  Ms. McCarthy only has the one child, and this can lead down a very unbalanced road, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that in and of itself. \u00a0 I also think Holly has more balance in that she had the Parkinson\u2019s foundation as a cause already and didn\u2019t fall into the black hole that the autism world (as a cause) can quickly become. \u00a0  It can consume every bit of energy and time and effort that you can shovel into it. \u00a0  And it always begs for more. \u00a0  There\u2019s always a new megavitamin, a new therapy, a new chemical, a new threat, a new promise and new something or other that promises hope on one hand and inflicts guilt on the other if you decide you don\u2019t want to do it. \u00a0  I\u2019ve written about the black hole before. \u00a0 I think the single best move for Oprah to make is this next spring, during Autism awareness month, to have a panel consisting of adults who actually are on the autistic spectrum. \u00a0  This would add some balance to where she went this fall in her focus on the parents. \u00a0  \u00a0 I sort of lurk around the edge of the spectrum, myself. \u00a0  I\u2019ve been to conferences where I sort of felt a certain kinship with a lot of the guys who claimed to be/have ASD.  \u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a happy realization by any stretch. That may be one reason why fathers struggle so mightily with the issue beyond other disabilities; it hits a bit closer to home perhaps. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 There was a brief clip on Oprah\u2019s site showcasing views by Rodney Peete on being a father. \u00a0  I also noticed that several women had asked about how to get fathers involved with their autistic sons. \u00a0  I may speak directly to that later. \u00a0  But in the meantime, welcome to all you new folks searching for info about Oprah\u2019s autism special!

{"date": "2007/08/05", "body": "Holy crap. \u00a0  Four freaking hours of testing! \u00a0 In the state of  Georgia , a whole butt-load of teachers joined me in jumping through the certification hoop of  GACE testing . \u00a0  A lot, lot, lot of very young teachers were at my site, which happened to be waaay out in the boondocks, at least by the route Mapquest took me. \u00a0  I expected those guys from Deliverance to come out of the woods at any second! \u00a0  I was there around  7:45  a.m.  and we were eventually let in to find our hall, room and seat. Our test proctor was a bit of a test Nazi, and clamped down on our pre-test chatter. \u00a0  But before the gag order, I was able to learn that some of my fellow teachers from  Magnolia   County  were there, mostly Special education and Early Childhood teachers. \u00a0  \u00a0 I was taking Science I and Science II tests. \u00a0  Science I is life and earth science content areas, while science II is the chemistry/physics stuff. \u00a0  I have a decent background in all areas except the earth science where I\u2019ve just managed to pick up things from my other science courses. \u00a0  All in all it wasn\u2019t too bad, except the two written response questions at the end of each test. \u00a0  That was an effort for me, not because I can\u2019t write (I have a blog, hello?!) but because my penmanship is so sorry that it alone would probably qualify me for any medical school. \u00a0  So I had to try to take my time to be neat. \u00a0  I still wonder about that. \u00a0  At least the GRE was computerized and I could type it so it felt more like blogging than a test! \u00a0 The early childhood folks were the first ones to escape our overheated classroom. \u00a0  Those of us taking tests requiring calculators were the last ones sweating it out. \u00a0  By the end of the thing, I was pretty much spent. \u00a0 Aside from the youngerness of the other test takers, there was one another feature that made me stick out. \u00a0  I was the only guy in the room.  \u00a0 The male-female ratio in education has always been lopsided, but 25:1? \u00a0  Too bad I\u2019m no longer single, because these tests would be a great place to meet women! \u00a0  Oh well, if Jane kicks me out, I\u2019ll know what to do. \u00a0 For all of my fellow teachers who took the GACE this last time out, relax. \u00a0  I know you\u2019ll pass because the tests are only designed to determine a  minimum  level of competency. \u00a0  The fact that you\u2019ve been able to suffer through my blog indicates that you\u2019re already exceptional! \u00a0 In other news, I did spend Sonny\u2019s Funny Money. \u00a0  I was in the local Big-Store and I had more than one person ask me which school I taught at or if I was a teacher. \u00a0  No, I was not wearing a name tag or badge or anything, and I was just buying office supplies. \u00a0  One was a girl who couldn\u2019t have been more that 11 or 12 and I\u2019d never seen before. \u00a0  Another was the checkout lady in electronics. \u00a0  She said I just looked like a teacher. \u00a0  \u201cIf you said you weren\u2019t a teacher, I was going to say you should be one because you just look like a teacher.\u201d \u00a0 So if you\u2019re curious as to what I look like, just picture in your mind a male teacher in his 40\u2019s. \u00a0  Apparently I match the archtype. \u00a0  Perhaps when a body is in a profession long enough they begin looking the part. \u00a0  I don\u2019t mind looking like a teacher as there are many worse things a person could look like. \u00a0  \u201cHey, you look like arsonist!\u201d or \u201cHey, you like you should be a politician!\u201d \u00a0  Or perhaps \u201cYou look like you should be an educational lobbyist/consultant in  Washington !\u201d \u00a0  Now that would just be plain rude. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gace.nesinc.com%2F&ei=L9C1RrGWMIOkwgGC5PTbBA&usg=AFQjCNEA5ysDBNmkgtq8kvH9SM-bYoDMaA&sig2=kdaEAc9VkKfpcwNNY_5Rxg"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/08/05/testing-testing-testing/", "title": "Testing.

{"date": "2007/08/24", "body": "\n There are two basic reasons people make a major change from one occupation or location or relationship into another.   One is that they are drawn or attracted.   The other reason is that they are driven from where they are through dissatisfaction or circumstance.   In my case, both of these factors apply.   The dissatisfaction is well-registered through recent posts (although there is more to come) so I thought I\u2019d deal with the attraction/enticement factor. Now that it comes to me, it\u2019s difficult to deal with one without the other.   One thing that has plagued me throughout my career in special education is trying to realize how I fit into the larger school mission.   Sure, we are all devoted to educating students first, no matter the condition that those students happen to show up at our door.   No matter what disability they have or whether or not they know English, we still teach them, such is the nature of public education.   But the larger school culture does center on the core academic subjects.   Therefore, when I go to a faculty meeting, I am pretty much relegated to passive observer for information that mostly does not apply to me.   Information on the graduation test, end of course tests, Learning Focused Schools and assorted other issues.   When we went over our school improvement plan last week, I struggled to see where I fit into that plan.  I\u2019m not raising any test scores and certainly not improving the graduation rate.  I try to be postive with whatever students I see, but we\u2019re sort of in our own time and space. \n \n Our program is about \u00bd nursing home and \u00bd school, which is unlike anything else in the building.   And for the past 7 years I\u2019ve been okay with that as there are advantages.   The administration is unaware of what we do, and largely leaves us be as long as we keep the peace.   And I am really stretching us out with the level of instruction we are doing as far as the grade level performance standards.   And this has only fueled things in my own psyche. I want to be a real teacher. The other thing that really ignited my desire to move on, are the IEPs I LEAed for the milder students last spring.   I attended scores of these meetings and the refrain coming from both the special educators and regular teachers was the same: there aren\u2019t enough Highly Qualified science or math teachers to meet the needs of these students and teach collaborative classes.   The choices were: regular education with little support or the special education diploma which is akin to dropping out.   Rewind 12 years.   My first teaching job in the state of Georgia was at a private school teaching physical science.   The school\u2019s claim to fame was teaching kids with learning disabilities and getting them admitted into a college.   For 3 years I taught there and felt I did a good job teaching the various science courses.   I managed to get some pretty low-functioning students past the departmental exam.   I did truly enjoy teaching science.   I was eventually given a lot of the lowest level students precisely because that seemed to be where I did my best teaching.   And that is precisely how I got the idea to get my master\u2019s degree in special education. So now I am coming around the circle and feel the urge to get back to the science teaching game.   I try to do some of it here, and that\u2019s been okay but it doesn\u2019t resemble the sort of thing I was doing back then because my students are of an entirely different stripe.     For instance, today\u2019s essential biology question was \u201cdoes the animal have fur, feathers or scales?\u201d and I used some animal pictures along with a Gotalk to see if the students could tell me.   Then we talked about birds having feathers and reptiles having scales and mammals having hair.   \n Thing is, the kids are sort of oblivious to all of this as I prompt them for their responses, mostly hand-over-hand. I push a student around the school while he\u2019s in his stander and we visit the academic halls.   I find myself wanting to be a part of that.   I see the teachers in there teaching and the students learning in less than 1,520 trials over less than 200 sessions.   I feel it calling me.   Administration pretty much treats those of us in the self-contained severe settings as step-children.   Our primary mission is to keep our kids from interfering with the real learning and the real learners.   Our administration seems to see special education as sort of a pseudo-department and have no idea what to do with us.   That just might be a skewed perspective based on my own limited view, however. I can say the NCLB has not improved the lot of my students at all.  It has served to marginalize them even more, in fact, as we are more short staffed in favor of servicing the golden band and we are not able to go into the community anymore.   My paperwork requirements have tripled because of NCLB, when it was already daunting because of IDEA.  IDEA has been marginalized while NCLB has taken over priorities and funding. What I have been doing has value to the kids and their parents, but the larger society could care less as long as no one is getting abused.    I\u2019m staffed just enough to make us barely functional.   It\u2019s difficult keeping skilled people around.   dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2007/08/24/enticed-away/", "title": "Enticed Away"},
{"date": "2008/04/15", "body": "I have a few videos on  TeacherTube  with many more to come.  My first attempt was  demonstrating the Qchord , which is a sort of musical instrument that I sometimes use in the classroom.  A more practical video is one I made  on the use of switches  for students with severe disabilities to use for communication. There\u2019s also an activity attached to that lesson, about 101 uses for using switches in the classroom.  Then I did a couple of videos on  positioning  for  students  with orthopedic impairments that some might find interesting.  And my most recent effort was a  screencast  about using the  Boardmaker  software program that special ed teachers frequently use for communication and language instruction.  I have some more videos demonstrating that software that I\u2019ll be uploading once I get the narration audio track finished.  The problem is that I\u2019m very seldom in a space or environment where it is quiet enough to do narration!  There seems to always be noise somewhere around that can be picked up by the mic!  Plus we are in full-IEP mode right now so I\u2019m squeezed for time.  A ton of folks are hitting my  IEP series  right now, so I know a lot of people are using that resource. After talking with one of the new SID teachers in the county, I got a lot of new ideas for resources to add.  One of the most common questions I get asked is about my lesson plans.  They are not very good or satisfactory enough for my taste and certainly not for addressing state standards.  However I do have a data sheet that sort of functions as a lesson plan that I\u2019ll be attaching to a future video on discrete trials.  Future features will involve: -Discrete trial teaching (DTT) \u2013 More Boardmaker overlays \u2013 Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) \u2013 Para training \u2013 Schedule/lessonplanning/curriculum I\u2019m presently looking to get permission from parents to include actual students in future videos, so that should be pretty exciting.  Even if I only get one permission form, I can demonstrate quite a lot of what I actually do.  So far, I don\u2019t know of anyone else doing anything like this, but if there is I\u2019d like to know about it! I use TeacherTube because YouTube is blocked by our school and TeacherTube does allow unlimited uploads.  You can also attach lesson plans and activities to the video which can really increase its usefulness to other teachers.  The downside is that viewers don\u2019t often leave very many comments or give very much feedback compared to what I see on YouTube.  The most discussed video is entitled \u201cPay Attention\u201d which has over half a million views but only 83 comments and the next most discussed has less than 50 comments.

I spent a huge amount of time bitching about it last year and went on to contact my various congressional representatives about it and the general atrociousness of NCLB.  I did what I could on every level that I could.  I blogged it and had some email conversations with the state DOE.  I also had some conversations with Harry and Carey our local testing/Sp. Ed. AP\u2019s about some things that could be done differently.  I had mixed results all around.  This year, Harry and Carey have let me go about my business with little hassle.  In return I haven\u2019t tried any snarkiness in my packet and have gotten the thing finished in good form and in record time. \n Yes, I am FINISHED!  What an ordeal.  At times it was kind of fun but at other times it was simply annoying and bothersome.  By 3 weeks ago, there was no longer any joy, I simply wanted to be finished.  And I did exactly what I needed to do in order to do just that.  There are many routes to failure on the GAA but none of them have to do with actual student achievement.  Actual student achievement counts less on the assessment than whether or not the paperwork is done properly.  Some might make the case that this is an accountability measure for teachers.  Again, accountability towards  what?   If it isn\u2019t student achievement, what are we supposed to be doing, again?  For kids with an I.Q. of less than 25, the regular education process clearly is not able to handle the task.  And the fact is, no one has even bothered to define what that task is.  Of what possible use is algebra or literature to someone who can not feed themselves, talk, wipe their own butt or show any aptitude towards learning these skills?  I\u2019ll entertain ideas as to how to align butt-wiping with the general curriculum, especially from anyone who continues to think NCLB is such a grand idea.  Senator Chambliss? \n BTW, I\u2019ll say a word about the primary election.  I\u2019m a social conservative, and am glad I had someone to vote for in the primary, despite some Yankee conservatives who were chafing at the idea of this concept of letting actual voters decide who they want to elect.  I\u2019m also planning on splitting my ticket in November at the very least, or perhaps bending the opposite way I normally lean politically.  When it comes to educations, NONE of the politicians seem to be getting it.  Sen. Chambliss said he couldn\u2019t wait to vote for NCLB again.

Using a Wii remote game controller, he creates an interactive white board sometimes called a  Smartboard .\u00a0 these things typically run around $3000,\u00a0 but the total cost of the Wii setup is\u00a0 less than\u00a0 $75!\u00a0 I would think a lot of schools would be interested in this.\u00a0 you can find video demos on Teachertube  here  and  here .\u00a0 There are probably dozens more on YouTube and any teacher into technology should be getting excited about this.\u00a0 Using open source software and the Wii, every teacher can have this useful technology at their fingertips. It\u2019s a bit late in the year for me to be diving into another technology project, but if I end up coteaching, I\u2019ll definitely be there. But the head array that he demonstrates is  really  something exciting for students that need an alternative way to access the computer and content.\u00a0 He basically mounted a couple of infrared dots on some sunglasses and he had something that typically costs thousands of dollars to parents that use this technology for their kids with severe orthopedic impairments.\u00a0 That is kind of exciting on a lot of levels and means I might be getting a Wiimote no matter where I end up next year.\u00a0 The biggest issue, is of course, time.\u00a0 I have a mountain of paperwork that I\u2019m procrastinating from at the moment with all of my IEPs!\u00a0 In fact, Johnny Lee himself developed this stuff while procrastinating from doing actual projects he was supposed to be working on. While I know a lot about severe disabilities and a lot about technology, i still have a lot to learn about adaptive technology.\u00a0 I know of a lot that exists, but I have never gotten my hands on a head array or other alternative switching devices besides the standard switches we use.\u00a0 So while I\u2019m up on a lot of things, I still feel behind on adaptive technology.\u00a0 The sad thing is, is that I\u2019m still way ahead of most teachers serving this population.\u00a0 In the span of 8 years I\u2019ve learned a lot, but most teachers don\u2019t last more than 2 years. Technology can change the way students access material but learning is still a function of a series of antecedent \u2013 response \u2013 consequence chains.\u00a0 I\u2019m excited about the potential, but it won\u2019t be realized until more of us teachers get it into our hands and have a chance to really fiddle around with it.

{"date": "2008/03/04", "body": "If you want to witness the height of absurdity, you have to look no further. \u00a0  I invite any of the NCLB apologists to defend this, if they can. \u00a0  They won\u2019t because they can\u2019t. \u00a0  It is just the natural progression of drunkenness from a drunk/high law. I\u2019ve discussed on numerous occasions how absurd it is that students with an IQ of less than 25 have to show progression in the standard curriculum. \u00a0  The Georgia Alternate Assessment (GAA) is supposed to show some sort of progression in the regular education curriculum thus meeting the mandates of NCLB. \u00a0  Up until now, those students undergoing the GAA received a special education diploma which is essentially a certificate of completion and little else. \u00a0  It\u2019s only fair, since these students are not taking the regular education classes, could not ever pass the end of course tests or the graduation tests. \u00a0  They can not do the work or even a reasonable facsimile thereof. \u00a0\u00a0  The GAA is NOT even close to the regular curriculum. \u00a0  My students will  never  write a research paper. \u00a0  They are pretty high functioning if they write their name! \u00a0  I have students who I work with on  recognizing  their own name and still can\u2019t do it after 4 years! \u00a0  So giving them a standard diploma would seem to be some sort of sick joke and totally out of the realm of reality. Now I have been told that this is about to change. \u00a0  According to the latest information handed down from  \u00a0 our county office, those students who pass the GAA will be getting a standard diploma. From the merely absurd to the outrageously ridiculous. \u00a0  It\u2019s the most abnormous* phase of NCLB but at the same time it is just a logical progression as school districts are forced to game the system. \u00a0  For those still absorbing this, let me paint a picture\u2026 Jim and Larry are two students who are severely and profoundly intellectually disabled respectively. \u00a0  They are currently going through the GAA which means doing several tasks that show they have access to grade level standards. \u00a0  Jim can not speak but he can at least use the bathroom independently. \u00a0  Larry functions at the level of an 11 month old. \u00a0  There are many ways to fail the GAA but  none  of those ways have anything to do with student achievement. \u00a0  Tameka is actually a pretty bright girl, but she is on her 4 th  or 5 th  try passing the Georgia High School Graduation Test (GHSGT). \u00a0  She took algebra, geometry American literature , physical science, biology and world history among other requirements in order to get sufficient credits in order to graduate from teachers specializing in those content areas. \u00a0  She has no diploma of any sort and she will not get one until she passes that test. \u00a0  Jim and Larry  will  pass their GGAs. \u00a0  Jim and Larry will get standard diplomas but as of this writing, Tameka will not. Now let\u2019s talk a second about accountability, which proponents of NCLB like to glom all over. \u00a0  Tameka is one of a class of 400 or so. \u00a0  Jim and Larry are part of the class but the GAA group consists of less than 30. \u00a0  When a student fails the GHSGT, it counts against the school for making AYP. \u00a0  However, as an individual, there is no one pressuring her teachers to get her to pass this test. \u00a0  There is no directive issued: TAMEKA MUST PASS THIS TEST OR ELSE! \u00a0  That is not the case with Jim and Larry. \u00a0  Remember, the GAA is not really based on student achievement. \u00a0  It is based on  teacher  achievement. \u00a0  I have a figurative gun pointed at my head to get them to pass that assessment. \u00a0  Last year I got a nasty letter in my file even though my students passed it, so passing is not even the sole criteria in this thing. \u00a0  But  none  of Tameka\u2019s teachers got a letter in their file stating that they did not do enough to get Tameka to pass the GHSGT. As long as enough other students pass the test for the school to make AYP, Tameka\u2019s teachers can move on with what they are doing. \u00a0  My kids will get a standard diploma, not because they have learned physical science, but because I was clever enough to assemble a portfolio that shows they had access to the curriculum. \u00a0  Tameka will not get a standard diploma because she has failed the test. \u00a0  It could be because she did not study or work hard enough while doing the coursework, and this is the assumption as long as other students do pass. \u00a0  How, exactly, does this show accountability when teachers of students with IQ\u2019s below 25 are held to a more rigorous standard than those who teach kids with a normal IQ? \u00a0  Or to put it another way, how is accountability demonstrated when the students who have little or no accountability are awarded a diploma when students who are given greater responsibility are denied it on the basis of a single test? The devastating truth is that a student like Tameka who takes all the classes and does all the work and has actual potential of holding a competitive job may be locked out, while my students will be given the standard diploma even though they will  never  hold a competitive job and will be recipients of welfare for the rest of their lives. \u00a0  Any system that awards the standard diploma on anything other than student achievement is a farce. \u00a0  Any system that esteems accountability on the basis of anything other than student achievement is worthy of nothing but contempt. \u00a0 NCLB is worthy of nothing but contempt because Tameka is being left behind while Larry and Jim will be getting credentials that they do not know or care about. \u00a0  Tameka cares deeply about getting her diploma. \u00a0  Larry could care less as long as someone is there to feed him and wipe his bottom. \u00a0  For him, these are major priorities. \u00a0  Tameka passed all of her classes and did all the work and could get a higher paying job, enabling her to produce more in order to pay taxes that could help support people like Jim and Larry. \u00a0  But she will have to live with the minimum wage while Jim and Larry will have less and less services available to help them because of resources that are increasingly scarce. \u00a0  In fact, Tameka herself may join them on the welfare role. \u00a0 Accountability indeed. *abnormous \u2013  A  portmanteau  of absurd and enormous ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/the-abnormous-progression-of-nclb/", "title": "The Abnormous Progression of\u00a0NCLB"},

Most of the waking hours of children are spent away from school.\u00a0 While it is certainly a significant part of their young lives it is not the majority as they are in school for only about 180 days out of the year.\u00a0 And yet, the Georgia senate passed a bill mandating that schools take the BMI of all their students and then aggregate the data to come up with an average for their school.\u00a0 Those with a BMI that is too high will be deemed \u201cUnhealthy Schools.\u201d Oddly enough, one of the biggest and best supporters of our schools is a place in town that offers a low priced pizza buffet, often giving away coupons for free meals for the book reading clubs and good behavior or academic performance.\u00a0 Chick-fil-et offers fundraiser nights at their restaurants for individual schools.\u00a0 The PTA uses bake sales to raise money.\u00a0 The Girl Scouts sell cookies!

It\u2019s true that there are some seriously overweight kids around here, but most of the time all you have to is look at the parents to see where that is coming from.\u00a0 Schools can not, nor should they, turn out people who all look the same.\u00a0 We can and do educate our children about healthy lifestyles but if the parents aren\u2019t going to do it, how far are the kids going to go with it? Schools are tasked with far too much as it is.\u00a0 If the government is serious about this, they need to tax fattening foods in order to pay for educating ALL people about healthy lifestyles.\u00a0 Food choices are mostly about culture, and activity levels reflect the family lifestyle.\u00a0 I\u2019m not serious about the tax because it would impact poor families the most, which is what this bill also does.\u00a0 It will impact the poorest schools the most, just like every other unfunded mandate that comes from Washington or Atlanta. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amateurgourmet.com/2004/04/best_ice_cream_.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2008/03/09/more-on-the-bmi-law/", "title": "More on the BMI\u00a0Law"},

Yeah, let  them  look up all the stuff! Students desired postsecondary goals.   This should take into consideration education, employment and community access. Spaz is pretty darn sick of school and seems tired of everything else for that matter.   He\u2019s tired of going into the community, which he used to love more than anything else.   But we need to put something down so I can say that he will pursue a placement in a day-hab/sheltered workshop setting.   Also, because of the severity of his disability, paid employment is not a goal. That last statement is a tough one, but it\u2019s the truth.   Even as a greeter at Wal-Mart, his spitting on people is not exactly going to earn him a big paycheck.   He bites any materials he works with, and his hands are all in his mouth.   At least he\u2019s not biting people, and that\u2019s progress. Spaz will live with his family as long as possible but group home, respite and other living alternatives will be pursued.   And I think those alternatives will be pursued diligently as his mother has endured a lot of hardship over the years with Spaz.   I daresay, more hardship than most because Spaz has some extensive needs and some extreme behaviors which will try and test the patience of the best of people at their best.   She\u2019s had to endure being with him, who has only needed 10 hours of sleep per week, and his waking hours seem to be spent bent on destruction.   He breaks things, chews on things, picks at things and generally raises havoc.   Curtains, window blinds, windows, walls, electrical outlets, appliances, fixtures\u2026nothing is immune once he fixes upon it without constant supervision.   And try keeping your temper on less than 2 hours of sleep every single night. Moving on\u2026 Academic area: Reading Well, if I had to pick his brightest spot, this might be it.   Spaz can read a few sight words (Walk, don\u2019t walk, go, in, out) but he\u2019s not reading extensively beyond the pre-k level.   His functioning according to an adaptive behavior questionnaire is less than a 2 year-old level.   He might read at a 3 or 4 year-old level.   They want accommodations and assistive technology, but there\u2019s not a lot to offer as far as his reading. Math He can almost count to 15, and does so failry clearly with his own voice.   Otherwise he uses an AAC device with supervision.   Again, he is functioning at a 3-4 year-old level, tops.   Written Expression Spaz has been working on writing his name for several years and can almost write \u201cSpaz\u201d legibly, but he does bite the pencil, pen and/or paper that he is writing on/with.   Which means that writing is not very functional at all for him as he will destroy/eat whatever he is writing on/with.   This includes a computer mouse or keyboard. Learning Skills   (Class participation, Note taking, Keyboarding, Organization, Test taking, Study skills) He participated in class using his AAC device, answering orally or by pointing to people and pictures. In every one of these areas, they want to no the accommodations, the date and an accommodations rationale.   The rationale is the same every time for Spaz: He has a severe intellectual disability and his skills are negligible to nonexistent!   That\u2019s the assessment report\u2019s words, not mine.   But they have the virtue of being true.   And depressing. Social Skills and Behavior This area is even  more  depressing, as he has a laundry list of all sorts of behaviors that have came, went, and returned again over the years.   Why on earth am I required to fill this out?   How can a parent read this, if it is a truly honest account, and NOT be reduced to tears? Comunication Independent Living Environmental Access Self Determination/Self Advocacy Skills Career/Vocational Medical/Family Concerns On and on and on and on this thing goes!   And that is only page 3.   The accommodation for my student is basically the same: 1:1 adult assistance pretty much every time, and the rationale is that Spaz has a severe intellectual disability, and is functioning at less than a 2 year-old level.   What else do you want me to say? And then I get to summarize all of this to recommend postsecondary outcomes, which for him will require 1:1 supervision and support at all times.   As a teacher, this is totally demoralizing.   Yeah, I know he\u2019s got a severe disability, but the outcome of 7 years of instruction should have come to more than this.   No wonder most teachers quit before they see the results of all their work.   It\u2019s too depressing to contemplate. The next section is even  more  depressing as if that were possible.   It\u2019s the student perspective.   I\u2019m somehow supposed to interview Spaz and ask him: How does your disability affect your schoolwork and school activities? (Think about grades, relationships, assignments, tests, communication, extra-curricular activities.): In the past, what supports have been tried by teachers to assist you in being successful in school?: Which of these accommodations and supports worked best for you? Why did they work?: D.   What strengths should others know about you as you begin college or work?: E. What has been most difficult for you in school? As if Spaz is going to answer any of these! What a load of rubbish. And then we\u2019re supposed to provide a list of contact information for service providers that parents may contact.   And I know for a fact that our county has precious few, if any of these numbers.   In fact, they had training material for filling out the forms and they used people at the board office as examples for each of those contacts for High School Team, Health and Family Services, Employment Agency, Community Agency, Institute of Higher Education as well as other agencies.   I\u2019ll be writing them to see if I can use their info!  As it is, I know of no such database in the county, much less the county office of such agencies.\u00a0 It\u2019s as if they all have some sort of stealth technology to keep people from being informed.\u00a0 I am NOT looking forward to going through this mess as a parent.\u00a0 I also appreciate the parents who are doing it right now and blazing the trail for the rest of us. \n This thing is painful to the max, emotionally as well as in the sheer scope of all the stuff they want.   It\u2019s the caseworker who has to fill all this horse manure out and it really stinks. Thank you for listening, even if it was not as helpful as other entries about IEPs.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019ll come up with a better informed follow-up or perhaps some of you can help me out D.

{"date": "2008/05/11", "body": "Re:  Unraveling the Mystery of Autism \n \n I wish I had time to read a book like this, as I know a lot of other parents are reading it.  However, I did manage to find the  most top-rated review of the book  by someone who DID read it, and her response is much better than anything I could have written. \n \n  Would that it Were so Simple, October 6, 2000 \nBy \t Liane Gentry Sky e, \u201cwww.lianegentryskye.com\u201d  (Florida, USA) \u2013 Karen Seroussi has woven a remarkable, well-written story of her son\u2019s recovery from Autism through tedious dietary interventions. Her offering of recipes gives the parents considering the diet for their children a place from where to start. As the mother of two Autistic children myself, I felt compelled to read it, even though a grueling 18 month trial of the diet in our home offered few, if any, results, other than depriving my sons of what foods they were willing to eat. \nSeroussi is a gifted writer, and tells her story from her mother\u2019s heart. But facets of her story disturbed me deeply. After reading this book, I felt my choice to live as a mother who has come to accept her children\u2019s Autism and lead them towards a good life in spite of grim prognoses was viewed by the author as something to feel ashamed of. While this may not have been Seroussi\u2019s intent, the insistence that something is wrong with parents who don\u2019t try her techniques, or tried the diet and had it fail are somehow lacking was very bothersome to my heart. \n \nGranted, dietary interventions have helped many Autistic children. However, this his book implicates that any parent who does not attempt the diet which benefitted Ms. Seroussi\u2019s son is failing his/her child. Children who respond to diet are most specifically those showing a serum IGE response to specific allergens and gliadin antibodies. I\u2019d strongly recommend any parent who considers putting a child through such a restrictive regime will get the bloodwork done first. This diet is not easy to implement and it is not easy to encourage an older child to follow it when away from home. \n \nThis book tells a rare, triumphant story. It is well documented, and worth a read. But please, don\u2019t see diet as a cure-all if the techniques outlined simply don\u2019t work for your child. The sad truth is, if diet were the cure, there would be no Autism. I felt the need to blog on this because I had a parent of one of my students who wanted to try this diet bring the book up.  I gave her what you read above plus a link to my blog so she can see whatever comments this particular article generates.  And it will probably generate a few. The Gluten Free Casein Free (GFCF) diet is  controversial for a lot of reasons , most of which are covered above by Ms. Skye above.  I do have a study that was done on dietary intervention for autistic behaviors and it did seem to indicate that the diet might be helpful:  Knivsberg, Reichelt, Hoien and Nodland (2003) Effect of a dietary intervention on autistic behavior. Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, 18, 247-256 Abstract: \nAutistic syndromes are characterized by impaired social, communicative, and imaginative skills. Urinary peptide abnormalities, in part due to gluten and casein, have been detected in some individuals With autism. These abnormalities reflect processes With opioid effect, Which may explain the behavioral abnormalities seen in autism. The aim of this single-blind, controlled study Was to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free and casein-free diet for children With autism and urinary peptide abnormalities. Observations and tests Were carried out With the 20 participanting children before they Were randomly assigned to either the diet or the control group. The experimental period Was 1 year, after Which observations and tests Were repeated. Significant reduction of autistic behavior Was registered for participants in the diet group, but not for those in the control group. It\u2019s the best study I\u2019ve ever seen on the subject, but it still has flaws that you can read for yourself if you want to get the full article. My wife and I did try the diet when our son was younger.  It was not the best of efforts and it was resisted strongly by Thomas (I\u2019ll keep his blog name the same to avoid more confusion than there already is!).  His favorite food of all time is pizza which is pretty much nothing except gluten and casein.  His favorite thing to do of all time is to eat out at the neighborhood pizza buffet.  So right off the bat, we were off to a poor start.  Let\u2019s add a couple of other things into the mix: \n \u2013\tHe has a younger brother who likes pizza, hot dogs, cheese burgers and other more typical \u201ckid food.\u201d \n  \u2013\tHe has a mother who basically likes the same sort of diet. \n  \u2013\tWe were a single-earner family, and that would be me on a teacher\u2019s salary. \n  \u2013\tWe had a lot of other things going on just like everyone else \n The cook in the family is me, and I resisted the diet for a long time because of the bother and the expense, but my wife, Jane (We\u2019ll keep her blog name too) convinced me to try it, especially after I read the above study.  So I did more research on the subject and did some thinking. Wheat is not native to North America, so the people living here before the arrival of Europeans had to live on something else.  That thing was maize (corn) and a variety of vegetables and potatoes which *are* native to the Americas.  So it seemed like a more simple task for us to adapt to a more native diet as opposed to trying to find adaptations of a European one.  I was thinking outside the box, but apparently ranged too far for the rest of the family.  I did by the corn and soy-based noodles and flours and assorted other GFCF foods. The entire family, including Jane, rebelled and none of them really went for it.  They were sneaking donuts, cheese, pizzas and every type of forbidden thing every chance they got.  The thing about doing this sort of diet is that \u201cin for a penny, in for a pound.\u201d  You are either all in or all out.  Having ANY gluten at all basically kills the whole process.  This is not about scaling back or reducing intake it is about going cold turkey!  So the entire family really has to be on board for it to work, and it was a forgone conclusion that by the end of our experiment the only one who stayed gluten free was me.  That\u2019s because I liked the things I made with corn tortillas and I don\u2019t mind eating the same thing almost everyday.  For everyone else, it was not a happy arrangement.  The corn and soy noodles are probably still in our pantry as is some extra GFCF pancake mix. Will a parent see improvement?  Some will and some won\u2019t, but this is not a light undertaking.  A body has to be willing to go all the way with it, which our family was not collectively willing to do.  And you know what?  It\u2019s all right.  We are not poisoning our children by letting them eat the food they enjoy.  We balance our meals with fruits and vegetables every meal.  I grow a lot of my own fruits and vegetables in our own garden.  Our family is okay and I might venture to say we are doing well because we are a more balanced family that has gotten away from letting autism rule over our lives.  It\u2019s something we live with and deal with but we\u2019re not going to let it dominate us and get us all down.  Parents who don\u2019t want to try every single intervention under the sun shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for not doing it anymore than I should be made to feel guilty about not getting LASIK surgery for my eyes.  I have bad eyes and I wear glasses.  My choice.  If Thomas decides he wants to go on the diet later in life, that\u2019s his choice.  What about those autistic persons who can not make their own choices?  Then caregivers do have to make those choices and make it on the best information available. But let\u2019s knock off the evangelical guilt-mongering by the various proponents of various cures.  If you have a cure, conduct a study and publish it and open yourself up to some serious scrutiny.

{"date": "2008/05/20", "body": "I have new videos posted on TeacherTube!  On one,  I began a rant  on the onerous IEP process that parents never see, which is all the work that goes into preparing these things.  It turned out to be more of a rant on  goals and objectives , though.  I\u2019m also playing around with Movie Maker effects to make it slightly more interesting. From the autism walk, you can see CJ  singing the National Anthem !  I don\u2019t know him that well, but I\u2019ve always looked at CJ as being pretty severe as I\u2019ve never heard him say  anything !  But seeing is believing, and there he is singing just as well as ever, and pretty much stayed on-key the whole time with no music to help him.  Is it true the national anthem is one of the hardest songs to sing?  CJ made it look pretty easy!  Plus there is a presentation by Kimberly Rockers where she talked about  genetic links to autism .  Yeah, that\u2019s my oldest running around and standing in front! \n But I want to do more than just post updates, as I have some actual thoughts to blog about.  And this time it is about parent advocacy.  I ended up on the other side of it recently, and it was more traumatic and harrowing than I would ever have anticipated.  Part of the reason was that it was very much unanticipated. If you want to raise the blood pressure of the teacher, waiting until the IEP to spring all sorts of concerns and complaints is one way to do it.  But you\u2019re going to pay a price for that tactic, which is some resentment from someone who could be advocating with you.  Is it worth it?  Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn\u2019t. When going through the IEP Process, I advocate the teacher and parent working together hand-in-hand and step-by-step, collaborating on providing the best services for the student.  \u201cBest\u201d in a public school is a relative thing.  The first, greatest and best teacher for your child is YOU.  Not the teacher, the SLP the OT or PT.  It is YOU, the parent.  No one else has the time that you do with your child.  No one else cares as much.  No one else has the motivation that you have.  No one else has the knowledge you do.  No one else has the intimate relationship and attachment that you do.  And more often than not, many of these other people you rely on to provide services have their own children to care for and feed. During school time, you want these other people to be effective in helping your child to meet their potential.  Meeting potential in the school system nowadays means accessing the regular education curriculum.  Math, English, social studies and science are what we\u2019re supposed to be teaching.  Communication, mobility and other skills must fit into that general education context.  Folding laundry and washing dishes are not part of the general education curriculum.  Those days are disappearing.  Write your congressperson if you feel differently.   I have. One area of contention I had to endure was Extended School Year or ESY.  In my view, given what I said above about the parent being teacher #1, ESY makes less sense when you consider that the person that is going to be delivering services is not necessarily the child\u2019s teacher/therapist.  It is also probably not going to be in the same location and it is not going to be following the same schedule as the regular school year.  Different setting + different teacher + different schedule + different bus + autism = \u2026..progress?!??! Think again.  A child would do much better to have services done in the home or staying with family for the summer.  As it is, it is a recipe for behavior problems all the way around and NOT a recipe for progress.  Some people are wild about providing social skills instruction during the summer.  I can say from reading the research that the efficacy of even the best social skills programs is suspect, at best.  But I see more and more parents advocating for it.  So let\u2019s plug in a novel peer group into the equation I just outlined above.  You have a sudden, severe series of transitions that will be repeated at the end of the summer when they go back to school.  Are you really doing your kids any good?  I don\u2019t know.  You decide. When I see this sort of \u201cadvocacy\u201d it begins to look more and more like the parent simply wants the school to raise their child for them.  It is also the failure to see the reality that school services might be able to make progress but school services are  not a cure!  As parents, we didn\u2019t ask to have children with disabilities.  We\u2019re sending the best children that we have.  I just want to make sure that my children have the same access that other students have to an education.  However, I do not rely on the schools to teach my children everything.  His mother has really done most of the real grunt work when it comes to his education.  And she has done a stellar job of it.  I\u2019m realistic enough to understand the limitations of public schools in that they do not have the resources to do everything demanded of them.  I believe that parents need to step up and take the responsibility for educating their children.  The school system is there, but it is not the main education agent nor should it be.  We, as parents, need to step up.  And if you are a parent of a child with disabilities, you\u2019re going to have to be twice as diligent.  Does that mean being more diligent in getting your child services?  No.  It means learning how to do the things service providers do, and do them yourself.  The best  therapy my son ever got was after we were able to watch what the therapist did.  We have video of his OT, SLP and PT therapists working with him, and we were able to replicate what PT, OT and speech were doing at the private therapy clinic.  The light bulb came on in my mind when I saw my son participate a  Georgia State study with Mary Ann Romski , and I saw exactly what the SLPs were doing.  In fact, much of her research revolves around training parents how to implement interventions. I\u2019m a big believer that if parents are given the knowledge and tools, they can be the ones who are making the real and significant contributions to a child\u2019s development.  Fighting with the school system simply saps your own resources and energy that you could devote to more meaningful activities. The experience of being rolled over was an exercise in humility.  I\u2019m not as good as I thought I was.  I am not a special ed. wizard.  I\u2019m one person, trying to do the best I can within my own limitations and I have a lot of those.  I\u2019m not able to cure anyone, and I\u2019m sorry if I gave the impression that I could.  I\u2019ve come to realize that the best I can do is to extend the hard work parents have already put into raising their kids, not the other way around.  Nowadays, people often talk of parents needing to support their schools and teachers, which I think is backwards.  The parents are the primary educational agents in the lives of their children, and the school plays a supportive and augmentative role.  I\u2019ve been around enough to see what happens when family support at home breaks down.  Performance at school also slips and behaviors worsen and little learning takes place.  So teachers and parents need to be supportive of each other. So when you are advocating, just what exactly is your expected outcome?  If it\u2019s a cure, you\u2019re going to be frustrated pretty much all the time.  If it\u2019s for everything you want, you\u2019re going to be frustrated all  the time because even when you think you\u2019ve gotten it all, there\u2019s going to be a missing piece.  Perhaps you get the para support but the para is untrained and lazy.  Or perhaps you get an untrained teacher.  Training these folks takes time.  Are they going to spend school time getting the training?  That\u2019s less time with your child.  Is it over the summer?  Oh wait\u2026you want them to do ESY!  You\u2019re going to have to break in and break countless teachers, paras, therapists and administrators as you fight and battle your way through your child\u2019s school years.  Because I have seen more than one teacher move on to another setting rather than continue battling a contentious parent, especially with the prospect of having to be locked in battle for  years  in the self-contained setting.  Let\u2019s face it, I am not up to the task of fighting with the parent of a 16 year-old until that child is 22.  Quite frankly, some of you are bent on being angry and frustrated and seem to be conditioned to making everyone else scared, angry and frustrated.  As a parent I have had skirmishes with teachers on a few occasions, usually when the teacher wants to put the child in an overly restrictive environment when they have no data to substantiate such a placement.  Basically, if the school starts making noises about putting my child in a self-contained setting, they need to show me something more than just an opinion.  Sometimes a parent wants to try a less restrictive setting, and I admit I get nervous about that with my students whose functioning is measured in  months .  There\u2019s the whole fear that they\u2019ll be victimized by some of the street-wise kids.  But you want to try, go ahead and try.  Perhaps it will work.  I\u2019ve seen good things happen when severe kids are around those less severe.  But transitions can be rough. I\u2019m interested in hearing/reading stories from parents whose advocacy has helped turn a situation around.  Perhaps you managed to turn a bad teacher into a good one?  Or maybe you\u2019ve battled for years and finally got everything you wanted and it turned out the way you wanted.  I have heard of parents who battled until they eventually got a teacher they wanted.  I\u2019ve been on both sides of that one, as a parent getting good teachers and as THE teacher some parents wanted. But I am not all that, as either a parent or teacher.  No super teacher/parent here.  I can write about it better than I can actually do it!  In fact, this is not as much me choosing this life as it is the life that has chosen me! \n D. \n \n\t\t Tags:  advocacy ,  autism ,  emory ,  genetics ,  parents ,  psychology ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=b3e48e6aa854e126f705", "../2006/05/06/iep-process-goals-and-objectives/", "http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=e7d32e53ac9c29e14845", "http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=9608aadc50b21c466627", "../2007/07/12/i-dont-think-hes-paying-any-attention/", "http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwpsy/faculty/romski.htm"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/a-word-or-two-about-parent-advocacy/", "title": "A Word or Two About Parent\u00a0Advocacy"},

{"date": "2006/02/01", "body": "Reading the AFT  NCLBlog  has been somewhat enlightening if not entertaining.  John and Michele are doing a great service in covering this and I appreciate a tone of reasoned thoughtfulness.  I guess I expected something more shrill since I have not met many educators thrilled with anything about NCLB.  I think it was  Michele who noted  that the more people learn about NCLB, the less they like it. While NCLB is federal legislation, it manifests itself on a state and local level in different ways.  So I\u2019ll share my personal interactions with NCLB as a special education teacher of high school students with severe and profound disabilities. The first impact of NCLB was not a direct hit on me.  It first came crashing down upon my paras, who had to either have 2 years of college or pass the Para Pro Praxis test.  There are precious few 2 year college paras in our system and I had none (out of 5 paras) in my room when this came barreling down the pike.  They were all very anxious about this test.  Coach was one of the first to take and pass it the first time.  Queen also passed it the first try, which sort of surprised me.  Princess and Ruth were still trying to pass coming into this year.  I worked hard with Princess, reviewing with her and drilling her and generally trying to sweat off her test anxiety.  I gave her a timed practice test in the middle of our room with our kids moaning, yelling, screeching, laughing and generally being themselves all around her.  I put enough pressure on her, that standard conditions were gravy.  And she finally passed.  Ruth, however, did not.  It\u2019s almost the end of the road for her.  Patience came in this year with 2 years of college, so she never had to sweat the test. My kids are under what is called \u201cAlternate Assessment.\u201d  Meaning that they don\u2019t participate in standard statewide tests.  My kids would literally eat the tests.  And the pencils.  And possibly the proctor.  Most can not recognize their name let alone write it or bubble anything in.  But they all like bubbles.  Just not the kind on paper.  So high stakes testing really hasn\u2019t hit my classroom.  Yet. What makes a \u201cHighly Qualified\u201d(HQ) special education teacher?  Sp. Ed. teachers had to wait for the reauthorization of IDEA in 2004 to answer that question.  When it came, we were all stunned.  We had already taken a Special Education Praxis for our area, whether it was MR, LD or EBD or some other area of special education.  When I taught EBD self-contained, I taught math, social studies, science, literature and English.  Many times across many different grade levels.  According to NCLB and IDEA, we were no longer  HQ.\u00a0 None of us.  You read that correctly.   I , who am teaching kids how to use the potty, eat with a spoon, button a shirt, and read and write their name\u2026I was not highly qualified.  I, who had a Master\u2019s degree in special Ed\u2026I, who was in his final year of a Specialist degree in special education for applied behavior analysis\u2026I who had a clear and renewal certificate for 10 years, was not highly qualified.  Unless I became HQ before June 2006, a letter would be sent to parents of my students telling them that I was not HQ.  And then my students were supposed to be assigned to regular ed. teachers who were HQ.  I almost decided to deliberately  not  take the test to be entertained by that prospect.  I jibed several of my regular ed. colleagues, \u201cBetter pick out which one you want now, or you might get STUCK with one!\u201d  They were less than amused at the prospect.  My kids scare them more than any gang member/thug.  The gang bangers don\u2019t even mess with my kids. NONE of the special ed. teachers in the county were HQ.   If any had enough college courses to teach science or math, that\u2019s what they would be doing!  The solution was to take another Praxis test.  Elementary teachers took elementary ed. praxis and middle and high school teachers took a general knowledge test for teaching students with intellectual abilities up to middle school level.  If our students had high school cognitive abilities, they could be served by regular English teachers, right?  So, a month ago, on a Saturday most of the Sp. Ed. teachers in Georgia took that Praxis.  Oh Five Eleven.  0511.  In order to become HQ.  I\u2019m still waiting for my results. The next NCLB insult came just a week later.  NCLB requires  all  students to be working on grade level.   ALL  students.  100%.  And that means us.  The kids who can not walk, talk or pee without assistance must be working on  grade level .  Not cognitive level.  Not effort level.   Grade Level.   Meaning that my 11th grade student who is profoundly intellectually impaired must be working on 11th grade level work.  I\u2019ll restate just to be redundant: My student who is in his junior year of high school, but has the adaptive and cognitive abilities of a 17 month old,  must  be working on the same stuff as his 17 year-old regular ed. peers. IEP or no IEP.  Goals will have to be aligned to the state curriculum standards for the grade that they are in.  The week after trying to get HQ, I attended a workshop for us teachers of the severe and profound on how to do this.  Basically, it was a workshop on how to  cheat  walk us through aligning our IEP goals with state standards.. Since NCLB allows states to set the standards, Georgia set up a new curriculum that is more flexible and adaptable than the old skill-based one.  And since we are on alternate assessment, we don\u2019t have to meet  all  of the curriculum standards.  Just some of them.  And we don\u2019t have to meet all of the elements of a standard.  And we, as teachers, more or less get to pick and choose which elements of which standard we can align with our goals.  All of our goals do not have to align with the curriculum standards, therefore we can still work on daily living skills.  It really is a nifty trick.  I originally attended this workshop with my pockets stuffed with rotting vegetables to hurl at the lunatics who were proposing that we align our goals with the state curriculum.  But once I saw what they were doing, I caught the wink and learned a thing or two. This, so far, is the impact NCLB has had on me and my program.  I feel somewhat fortunate to be sheltered from the biggest storm of testing and AYP but special ed. teachers have had their own unique headaches with NCLB as well as the stuff still tinkling down from IDEA 2004.   One more word to my hopeful brothers and sisters in education: Full funding of NCLB will  NEVER  happen.  Special educators know this, because IDEA has never been fully funded over the last 33 years.  Ever.  I think we in sp. ed. should get our money first, because we\u2019ve been waiting longer!  You regular ed. folks are Johnny-Come-Latelies when it comes to strict, intrusive and under funded federal mandates. dick     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/", "http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/2006/01/bring_back_the_joy.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/01/nclb-one-teachers-dealings/", "title": "NCLB: One Teacher\u2019s\u00a0Dealings"},
{"date": "2006/02/04", "body": "The  Greater Georgia Chapter of the Autism Society of America  is hosting its annual  Autism/Asperger Conference  and I\u2019m sitting in the main conference area.  And I\u2019m a bit miffed, irked and irritated.  I sent all my papers in to the county office a couple of weeks ago and when I arrived this morning, they knew me not.  So instead of a nicely typed nametag, I have the scrawly hand-written one written in my scribbly writing.  More irritating is that they won\u2019t give me a lunch ticket until they are sure they have enough food for everyone else.  And that is mightily inconvenient.  Not so much for the lunch (which is usually just okay), but for the Keynote given during the mealtime given by Drs. Bob and Lynn Koegel from the Koegel Autism Center. Fans of  Supernanny  may remember an episode where Nanny Jo helped a family with a young boy with autism.  She brought in  Lynn Koegel  to help out.  The Koegels are well known and respected in the autism and autism research communities.  They are pretty big news and missing them would really torque me off.  Skipping the lunch is inconvenient and bothersome.  I can bring a PB&J sandwich tomorrow. The other major insult is that I had to pay my own way in, and hope and pray that the county reimburses me.  They already had approved it, so I\u2019m not taking any prisoners on that.  They better cough up the $200 bucks. Session #1 :  Walking Through Fire The first session we\u2019ll attend in our conference is presented by  Pat Howey  and  Wayne Steedman  from  Wrightslaw .   Wrightslaw is a good resource for parents looking to advocate for their children as they specialize in special education law and advocacy.  Teachers need to be aware of these folks and the resources as well.  Both presenters are members of  COPAA , which stands for Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates.  Both have experience in due process hearings on up through the federal court system. Pat Howey began her presentation by talking about her own walk through the fire as a parent.  Her journey began in 1979, with the birth of  her daughter  who had a disability.  She had to negotiate through the medical system, the insurance system and the educational system.  She talked about many of the lessons she learned as a pioneer as a parent advocate.  Parent advocates are not very popular in most school systems.  Ms. Howey shared that she will probably never receive a Christmas card from her county\u2019s director of special education.  She was never invited to a PTA meeting.  She was simply not very popular although well-known.  30 years ago, there was no ADA and special education was still in its infancy.  She went through due process for her own daughter in 1986 and continued to attend IEP meetings with other parents. Her daughter is now a married nurse, who drives race cars.  Her daughter was in a wheelchair at 7 years old.  The PowerPoint  image of her daughter standing next to her race car  was powerful.  So this woman has a real story of success to share. Wayne Steedman gave a presentation on how to avoid a due process hearing.  Steedman is an attorney who specializes in representing students with disabilities.  He began his presentation talking about many reasons to avoid due process.  It is expensive in terms of monetary costs, relationships and services, costing tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars.  It simply is not fun for anyone. 1. Treat Parents as equal participants:  This includes giving parents advance copies of evaluations and draft copies of the IEP. 2. Write goals and objectives that are clear and measurable. 3. Use research based teaching methodologies: It must be  peer reviewed research . 4. Conduct annual assessments or as needed.  The law states that it only has to be done every 3 years or longer.  But doing it more often can help the educational program and the process. 5. Special Education is a service is a  service  not a place.  This has a powerful bearing on LRE. 6.  Encourage IEEs and give them due consideration.  IEE = Independent Educational Evaluation.  If a parent thinks the school is cooking the books, an independent evaluation can actually help make the schools case and help parents feel more secure about what the school says.  But sometimes it supports what the parent says.  In any case, it will help avoid a due process.  Even if an independent evaluation costs hundreds of dollars, it is still cheaper than a due process hearing.  If a parent requests an IEE, the school has two choices: Do it and pay for it OR file for due process to defend their own evaluation.  Guess which is easier and cheaper? 7. Encourage parent involvement: this fosters trust\u2019 facilitates communication and collaboration, and fulfills NCLB requirements.  NCLB has significant requirements for parent involvement. 7 steps for parents   to avoiding due process     1. Prepare for your IEP meetings as though you expect to go through a due process hearing.  Have some authority walking in. 2. Become your child\u2019s best expert.  IDEA and NCLB both emphasize the use of  peer reviewed  research-based practices.  Parents need to be familiar with those practices and the research.  Parents can help disseminate such research to teachers and administrators.  Stuff just pulled off the internet will not be viewed as credible 3. Maintain a  well organized  file.  Steedman uses 3 ring binders to store documents related to each student with tabs.  Being organized boosts credibility. 4. Know your rights; know the law.   Wrightslaw.com .   COPAA  is another source.  However school personnel are not allowed to be members.  I\u2019ll have to find out what my status would be, since I\u2019m both. 5. Document everything and maintain a comprehensive log.  Use letters and e-mails.  Steedman also recommends parents tape record the IEP meetings.  An example he gave was a teacher who says something \u201coff the record\u201d where it might help the child but might deny it later.  However, if a parent writes a letter (or an email) including those remarks then it becomes incumbent on the teacher to write a letter denying it.  Otherwise the law assumes those statements are accurate and true. 6. Obtain an IEE and have the evaluator attend the IEP meeting to explain the results. 7. Stay cool.  When a person loses control, someone else is in control. These are just notes I took and are only loosely organized.  More to be added later! dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asaga.com/", "http://www.asaga.com/Conference2006.html", "http://abc.go.com/primetime/supernanny/", "http://www.education.ucsb.edu/autism/index.html", "http://www.pathowey.com/", "http://www.wrightslaw.com/speak/steedman/bio.htm", "http://www.wrightslaw.com/", "http://www.copaa.org/index.html", "http://www.pathowey.com/tiffany_lorton.htm", "http://www.pathowey.com/tiff_cavalier.gif", "http://www.wrightslaw.com/", "http://www.copaa.net/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/04/autism-conference/", "title": "Autism Conference"},
{"date": "2006/02/05", "body": "Dena Gassner MSW Dena is the second of 3 generations of persons with autism in her family. She advocates strongly for the correct diagnosis of women with autistic disorders.  She believes that women are vastly under diagnosed. She also talked about an \u201cinvisibility bias.\u201d  People are generally more accepting and understanding of disabilities that they can see.  But the concept of \u201cnormality\u201d is a false one.  \u201cNormal\u201d does not exist. Many women are misdiagnosed.  Common diagnoses for women who might be on the spectrum: -Fibromyalgia -ADHD -Eating disorders possibly caused by visual perception problems -Immune dysfunction -Sensory problems resulting in avoidance issues -Addictions -Domestic and workplace violence \u2013 Social paranoia \u2013 alienation \u2013 Troubled family relationships -intense splinter interests.  Dena\u2019s is autism. \n Women of color are the most under diagnosed Unidentified mothers struggle more and succeed less than neurotypical mothers to obtain supports for their children with autism. Dena said she has never met an adult on the autism spectrum who has not had some background of sexual abuse. Research suggests that boys outnumber girls with autism 4:1.  However Dena believes that this is a myth.  She believes that women are not diagnosed because they tend to be under responsive to sensory overload.  Weepiness, anxiety, fatigue, day dreaming and mostly by a sense  of engulfing, unbearable helplessness  and an inability to have an impact or control on outcomes.(!) When do you tell a child that they have autism? After talking to parents of children of autism and parents with autism, they all agreed that it shouldn\u2019t be an issue.  It should be like having blue eyes.  It should be natural and parents often have enough similarity with their kids that they probably have it themselves! Dena encourages the use of scripting to develop a larger body of language and mimicry.  She, herself, used the humor of Carol Burnett to develop her own humor. When her daughter told her that she was a lesbian, Dena was thankful that it wasn\u2019t autism. Whoa\u2026   When talking about societal gender bias, she spoke about how men can be successful just by working.  However, women with autism are judged more harshly.  They typically  fail to manage time, space and resources. \nSounds eerily like Jane.

{"date": "2006/06/03", "body": "If you haven\u2019t read  Part 1  go do it now and then follow the link back here. You read about the extraordinary response to our severe kids going across the stage at graduation.  As with other students, many tears were shed by parents.  However, the tears shed differed from the parents of my kids, compared to the parents of more typical students. Remember; graduation is not an end but a beginning.  But the beginning of what?  For typical kids, the beginning of college, technical schooling, military careers and jobs.  But what about the kids with severe disabilities?  I get this all the time; What happens to your kids after they graduate?   The post-school transition for students graduating from special education programs, in general, is hideous.  EBD, LD and MR students seem to suffer great impoverishment when it comes to post-school life.  They are the last to get hired, and only for the most menial of jobs.  And those are the lucky ones.  Some of them will spend many of their post-school years in the judicial system, in and out of jail.  For the severe kids, none of the above apply.  They are not going to be able to get and hold cempetetive employment.  Most need extensive support just to live a normal life with feeding and toileting. For the past 22, a graduate has been taken care of at public expense and with the protection and provision of the various educational laws.  First through the early intervention program and then through the public schools.  Parents spend the better part of 15 years battling and fighting and begging and negotiating and advocating for their child\u2019s educational needs.  Sometimes they get a bit and sometimes don\u2019t get what they want.  But the struggle and fight seems to never end.  Many bring in their advocates and lawyers, persuading the schools to follow the law and provide needed services.  Winning such a battle brings some satisfaction for a parent.  But the day quickly approaches until it is right there; Graduation Day. Graduation is the end of the line for the educational system.  That\u2019s it.  No more teachers, administrators or special education buses.  No advocates.  No special education law.  No IEPs.  No IDEA. Finished. If that was it, those tears from our parents might be tears of relief for not having to fight the system anymore.  But they are not.  What is waiting for my kids outside of school is a dark abyss.  Cold, uncaring and bottomless.  The laws protecting and guaranteeing the rights of these kids end.  There are no laws that state that  anyone  has to takes these young adults in.  Well, that\u2019s not quite true.   Someone  has to take them in.  If not family members, than the state can take custody in a group home.  But the burden falls on the people who have been doing this for the past 22 years which is usually the parents.  Only now, there is no school system to either cooperate with or fight.  There are some services out there.  The moderates graduates have a shot at maybe getting some vocational rehab services.  But voc rehab favors the higher level kids.  The severe kids MIGHT be able to get into a sheltered workshop\u2026after being on the waiting list for several years.  For Niles, whose story was in Part 1, post-school transition meant staying at home with his father.  And sitting around.  All.  Day.  Long.  For 3 long years, Niles sat at home until the sheltered workshop either had an opening or got some additional funding.  Niles was fairly lucky because Queen kept tabs on him and kept feeding Niles\u2019 father what information she could get to him.  But his father, while sometimes loud was not particularly contentious.  He was able to get close to some folks who could hang with him beyond school time.  Did I hang with Niles beyond school?  No.  And I don\u2019t support parents substantially once they leave us because I use every spare moment to support the new kids on my caseload.  For the old ones, they are on their own, more or less. I am, for all practical purposes, the undertaker.  I have very little to offer these kids beyond what I\u2019ve already given them in the way of independent skills.  I\u2019m working more and harder on the interagency transition council to get some things, but it all comes down to money.  IDEA is a mandate, albeit with limited funding, that does have the threat of due process hearings and expenses to schools.  Outside of IDEA and school, there is no legal mandate to supply productive activities.  No one has to take our kids if they don\u2019t want them.  This is why I\u2019m all over aggressive behaviors, because no sheltered workshop or home will accept a kid who is going to beat on staff and other students.  Those tears shed by Niles\u2019 parents were the tears of someone who was going from bearing a heavy burden alongside the school system to having to carry the entire burden alone.  The school is no longer a partner.  The bus is not going to pick them up, the school is not going to feed them, change their diapers, wipe their noses or do their catheterizations anymore.  Even if the school was an unwilling partner, the world on the outside is far, far more hostile. In the world of welfare and public assistance, the turnover rate is higher than it is for special education teachers!  Chances are pretty slim that a family will have the same case or social worker for more than a year or two.  Also, I have seen entire regional boards upended, moved, turned over, reorganized and relocated almost every year.  Services are most often scheduled and assigned on a regional or state level which is far less responsive than a local school district.  Everytime a shift or change is made, funding is interrupted and services are effected.  Service board directors do not answer their phones and even more rarely will they return a call.  And you can not sue them.  As a parent, the best leverage you have are your local state representatives\u2026politicians.  You literally have to throw yourself upon the steps of your state capital and beg for funding.  Those trying to get medicaid waivers for their younger children in Georgia have some idea as to what I\u2019m talking about.  It\u2019s why I\u2019m having to take extra summer work to pay for dental care for my oldest son.  We\u2019re trying to lobby for some sort of coverage that is reasonable, even with a monthly premium, because our regular insurance will not do it.       Fighting congress, even on the state level, is harder than dealing with a teacher, a principal or a local school board.  But this is what a parent of a student with severe disabilities faces on graduation day.  It is not really a happy occasion at all.  The tears shed that day are more like a funeral than a wedding.      Which is why I often feel like the undertaker at these things, trying to console a family that faces such an uncertain future.  Niles did eventually get into a sheltered workshop, after being on the waiting list almost 3 years.  Fortunately his dad isn\u2019t the sort to move, because if he did, he would face these hurdles all over again.      So what can families do?   -Preparation starts well before graduation day.  In fact, as soon as they enter the public school system, begin thinking about graduation day.  20 years seems like a long way off, but it that day will come.   -When planning educational programs, emphasize daily living skills; potty training, dressing, eating and eventually being able to move around and take care of themselves independently.   \u2013 Communication skills also need priority.  Using strategies like Pivotal Response Treatment and AAC, purposeful communication can become a reality.  This means making the person ask for what they want instead of anticipating their needs.   \u2013 Consider what happens to them if you (as a parent) are not there, or become disabled, yourself.  This is scary for any parent, but this needs to be driving you a bit as the child moves through the system.   \u2013 Look into wills, trusts and guardianship issues.  Probably the scariest stuff at all, and all of us parents put it off.  Regular parents don\u2019t have wills, and parents of students with disabilities are not any better about this.  But at least look into it.  Find some parents who have already done it, which leads to\u2026   \u2013 Get support from other parents who have gone before.  They will be invaluable because once the school system is behind you, don\u2019t expect much help from them.  Schools have new students to worry about, and in growing numbers.  Hooking up with other parents will give you more accurate information about the system.      \u2013 At the same time, be available to other parents following you through the system.  It makes your own experiences so much more meaningful if others can benefit from your struggles.   \u2013 Keep your faith.    Graduation Day is often a rich mix of all sorts of feelings and emotions.  Preparing while the student is in preschool can make it a bit less chaotic.  Teachers need to be mindful of Graduation Day, as well.  While those teachers in elementary and middle school are able to just shuffle off the kids from one grade to another, those of us at high school are the end of the line.  The only time I see any of these teachers at a graduation is when their own kids are getting a diploma and getting ready for college.  My students are probably not going to see their 2 nd  grade teachers ever again after elementary school. Many won\u2019t be able to go up to them and say \u201cThank you for being my teacher!\u201d  But I think it would be very useful for the teachers in earlier grades to attend a graduation every other year or so and watch their kids, meet the families again and show a bit of support.  Afterall, graduation represents a collective effort of dozens of people over the years.     dick     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/06/03/graduation-day-pt-2/", "title": "Graduation Day Pt.\u00a02"},
{"date": "2006/06/05", "body": "One of the core deficits of autism is a deficit in relating to others socially.\u00a0 The inability to maintain successful interpersonal relationships also happens to be a core deficit of those with EBD. \u00a0 Today, Jane showed me a flyer distributed by a Ms. Deering, who is trying to put together a social skills group for the summer for younger elementary aged students.\u00a0 She is offer 2 hour sessions over 5 weeks this summer.\u00a0 That would be a total of 10 hours of training, if a child committed to the full 5 weeks. She is also offering the same deal for older elementary aged kids.\u00a0 She plans on using social stories, role play, snack time and other teaching methods to help teach the hidden curriculum of social skills at a neighborhood church.\u00a0 The cost is $50 per session or $250 for all 5 sessions.\u00a0 This is becoming a bit of a side business for her. \u00a0 Ms. Deering was Thomas' teacher when he was in preschool, and when it comes to working with kids with autism, she is second to none.\u00a0 Energetic, ambitious, driven, intelligent\u2026I can't say enough good things about this gifted and talented teacher who also helps Thomas and the other kids at his Saturday karate class.\u00a0 She taught one of my first autism in-services, and I learned a lot from her.\u00a0 I still do when I get the chance.  \u00a0 There's a \"but\" coming, but let us bask in Ms. Deering's competent glow for a minute while I relate another, related, tale. \u00a0 I spent an hour or so talking Mrs. Montel on the phone yesterday about her son, Darius.\u00a0 Darius is 4 years and being served under the autism eligibility and will be getting ESY services from yours truly.\u00a0 Big Boss called me the evening before to confirm the hours so she could arrange for a bus to pick him up from his daycare to take him to Middlepoint elementary school where I would deliver instruction in social skills and communication.\u00a0 I've never met young Darius,\u00a0 Middlepoint is not his regular school.\u00a0 Westpoint is.\u00a0 So, I'm scheduled to deliver services to a little boy with autism I've never met, in a school neither of us is familiar with using whatever expertise I can happen to dream up.\u00a0 The reality of ESY is so far removed from the ideal, it is ridiculous.\u00a0 The boy is destined to spend 2 hours a day, for 2 days a week crying, unless we can make it meaningful to him.\u00a0 Which means I may need to change the plan, haphazard as it is. \u00a0 Mrs. Montel told me that ESY mysteriously materialized as an option at the end of the IEP meeting.\u00a0 She didn't even know what it was, when the preschool coordinator handed her a transportation request and sort of foisted it on her.\u00a0 Far be it from her to turn down a service when offered. \u00a0 The problem with the current ESY arrangement and Mrs. Deering's social skills class are the same.\u00a0 Basically, taking a group of autistic kids and placing them in an unfamiliar environment which they will probably never see again, and then trying to teach social skills in isolation for very short periods of time and then releasing them back into their regular environment is not terribly productive. \u00a0 One other core deficit of individuals with autism is the inability to generalize from one setting to another.\u00a0 And so, teaching outside of natural settings and routines is a hit or miss proposition at best.\u00a0 So I've been thinking about how to make the instruction I'm being paid to deliver functional and relevant.\u00a0 Mrs. Montel works full-time, hence Darius spending his summer in daycare.\u00a0 So it seems to me, that this daycare is the most relevent setting to deliver his services, with a component of it involving training the staff there and listening to their concerns.\u00a0 At 7 a.m., when Mrs. Montel drops her son off, I plan on meeting her and Darius and the daycare staff in order to see if we can work out something and the go to Big Boss to see if she can agree to it.\u00a0 Fact is, this ESY was not even supported by the data included in the request, which only consisted of his new IEP and old IEP mastery.\u00a0 He mastered 5 of 6 communication goals and 4 of 5 of his social goals!\u00a0 That's not to say he couldn't benefit from some additional attention and instruction\u2013 what kid wouldn't?\u00a0 But he stands a better chance at benefiting within the daycare or his home, which I would do if that were possible.\u00a0 And I might have to work some odd hours to make that so. \u00a0 Ms. Deering's social skills idea is a fine one, and I don't doubt her skills.\u00a0 But if she were really going to benefit the kids more than her pocketbook, she would include a parent training component with this.\u00a0 Afterall, parents will be with them far more than her, and could deliver such instruction for many more hours across many more contexts than Ms. Deering could.\u00a0 All I'm saying is that Ms. Deering could deliver more valuable instruction by including the parents. \u00a0 And that's a thought that has been burning in my mind lately.\u00a0 ESY has been set up in a very haphazard way, and efforts at delivering social skills training have been equally disjointed.\u00a0 One of the interventions for students with EBD that has been empirically validated has been parent training.\u00a0 I can see  Pivotal Response Treatments (PRT)  for individuals with autism eventually working its way up to empirical status by virtue of having parent involvement as its core features.\u00a0 And it is going to be one of main tools for working with young Darius if I can get permission to work with him, his parents and his preschool teachers in more natural settings. \u00a0 I would also like to see these summer social skills groups offered in conjunction with teacher and para in-services, where the groups provide opportunities to practice in vivo, with actual kids, rather than just presenting material in a typical workshop environment.\u00a0 By offering practice and feedback, teachers and paras can actually use, practice and improve their instruction on-the-spot, while offering valuable instruction for the students, even if it is occurring in a setting that is not as naturalistic as a home or home school, making it more analogous to a summer camp.\u00a0 In fact, this is how Robert Koegel described how he provided training for paras in his  latest book  which I had him autograph at the  autism conference . \u00a0 I'm going to say one more thing about Ms. Deering's groups.\u00a0 It goes right back to my  Fleecing  article, in that the $50 per session price tag is going to exclude a number of kids.\u00a0 This is true of any variety of opportunities, like summer camps, karate, clubs and other activities. And I'm also go ahead and say, despite my admiration of Ms. Deering's considerable skills, that her service is providing not a lot of value compared to if she was training parents.\u00a0 The value is dubious by virtue of it being of such limited duration, conducted in isolation and over scattered and limited intervals throughout the summer.\u00a0 She is going to have the kids take social stories home and snack activities home with them after each session, so at least there is that much follow-up.\u00a0 But to put it another way, I will have to work 10 out of my 20 hours of ESY just to pay for one of my boys to take her social skills classes! \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.education.ucsb.edu/autism/help.html", "http://www.brookespublishing.com/store/books/koegel-8191/index.htm"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/06/05/esy-for-social-skills-training/", "title": "ESY for Social Skills\u00a0Training"},
{"date": "2006/06/09", "body": "\u00a0 I Have an Interview \u00a0 I finally got that phone call I've been waiting for, scheduling me for an interview on the 15th for the Behavior Intervention Specialist position.  Seems a bit late for a July 1 start date, but I'll let the folks at the county office do their jobs. \nAs far as the position is concerned, I know I have a couple of key components in my background that not many others have.  One is my background in developmental disabilities and the other is my background with EBD.  Not too many people are around with both of those plus the behavior analysis stuff.  One key component of the job is supporting EBD teachers, and for some reason I'm feeling a bit shaky there. \u00a0 Not that any of them (EBD teachers) would know, simply because we have so few veteran EBD teachers in the county.  I'd wager that there are precious few in the entire country.  The burn-out rate among EBD teachers is higher than in any other segment of eduction, regular or special.  In fact, if I wasn't so stubborn, I would have become just another statistic. \u00a0 Back in the early '90's I was teaching science at a private school and began looking at going for my Master's degree in order to get Georgia certification.  I talked to a professor at GSU (Harry Dangel, if you must know) and he laid it out that I wouldn't have to quit working to go back to school.  So I began the arduous task of taking my GRE and taking a class or two.  I initially decided that I would get certified in Learning Disabilities, since I had good success with those kids in the past.  But my second GSU class happened to be in behavior mod. which was really Applied Behavior Analysis for Teachers.  The class was taught off campus by Dr. Powell who still might be managing the psychoed center in Marrietta.  In any case, I found the class very reinforcing and it really did change the way I taught.  At one point, Dr. Powell put the bug in my ear, \"You know, you seem like you could do what we do,  Ever consider behavior disorders?\" \u00a0 I hadn't, but did soon after.  And so I ended up entering the EBD program.  One reason was that I saw so many job openings; it looked like there was some real job security there.  I was soon to realize why that was. \u00a0 I quit my private school job and applied to be a para in Dr, Powell's county, hoping I might get a job at his center.  But personnel took a look at my application, and had other ideas. \u00a0 I had an Iowa certificate in Agriculture Education, and some experience teaching.  The personnel director called me in, and said, \"You know, paras don't make very much money.  Why don't you try for some teaching positions? You can do that while you complete your schooling and get fully certified.  We might even be able to get some grant money to help out with that.\" \u00a0 She showed me the two pay scales and that was that.  My application went from the para pile to the teacher pile.  And I got some phone calls.  The first place I interviewed was a large school in a fairly affluent part of Newt Gingrich's old congressional district.  I spoke with the principal who introduced me to the department head and the other EBD teacher, who really was a bona fide veteran of 6 years or so.  They also showed me the classroom. \u00a0 Why didn't the dented file cabinets and skid marks on the wall clue me in?  Lesson #1 \u2013 pay attention to the environment.  It might be trying to warn you of something. \u00a0 The other school was newer, and further out, so there were no skid marks or dents that I could see. \u00a0 I remember I was offered both jobs the same day.  I took the first one.  Lesson #2 \u2013 Never take the first offer.  At least not right away. \u00a0 I had taken exactly 2 classes in my program, one of which was that behavior analysis class.  I thought I could do anything with that.  I was SO naive! \u00a0 First off, I had never done an IEP in my life and had only a vague notion of what they were.  The middle school teacher had neglected to do some the year before so we had several to do right at the beginning of the year.  Fortunately she was a returning teacher so the county director made her come to the high school and do them.  But I was still clueless.  The paperwork was incredible, as the county office generated huge numbers of forms.  I had one kid going through re-eligibility so I had all of THAT paperwork piled on.  And during my brief 12 week tenure, I was part of 2 manifestation hearings. \u00a0 The kids were, well\u2026they were high school EBD kids.  I was cussed at pretty much on a daily basis.  I was preparing to teach math, English, geography and social skills, none of which I had any experience teaching.  And I was teaching the English/literature across all 4 grades, 3 of which were taught in the same room at the same time.  I was SO clueless! \u00a0 I do admire English teachers because they have to make something most students take for granted, and make it come alive and be interesting.  I didn't like English much when I was in high school.  Teaching it was even worse. \u00a0 I only had one parent who went after my scalp, who brought her son's psychoanalyst to the meeting.  My behaviorism clashed with her Freudian psycho babble.  That one parent (and her psycho-analytico guru was enough. \u00a0 I had 2 different paras who were as new as me who rotated through my room.  I had no idea what to do with them.  One was an ex-music teacher who had a bit of a clue, so I was able to send a few of  my (relatively) best students with her to work in the library while I remained alone within my den of inequity.. \u00a0 In October, it was looking bad.  I really was unhappy with almost everything about this job.  My first evaluation was terrible.  Even though the kids behaved marvelously while I was being observed, I was gigged on every single one of the GTEP points.  NOTHING was marked satisfactory.  I needed improvement all the way down.  I was so screwed.  But I was still too naive to really know it. \u00a0 The principal finally called me in mid October and said that they were making a switch.  They put me in the permanent long-term sub position, and moved that guy into my position.  My pay would stay the same for the rest of my contract, which ended at the end of the semester in January. \u00a0 Things improved almost immediately for me.  I had a chance to work in collaborative settings and see other teachers teach.  I spent time with the MR kids and fell in love.  I spent several weeks at a middle school EBD classroom and had a great experience. \u00a0 But I was screwed.  I would have gladly stayed in that position, but the principal said they were terminating that spot.  Which was a lie.  I then said that I was interested in the middle school job after that principal asked me if I'd be willing to take it.  I never heard any more about it.  I also said I was still interested in being a para \u2013  remember that is what I had originally applied for!   I never heard a word.  Ever. \u00a0 I was chewed up, and spit out by that system.  They wanted nothing more to do with me.  I was dumb to take the job.  They were bigger idiots to offer it to me.  They didn't want anyone qualified, they wanted a warm body! \u00a0 Teaching has been called the profession that eats its own young, and that is how I felt after going through that ordeal.  They had me teach subjects I had no business teaching and put paras with me who were equally clueless.  The 6 year veteran kept her veteran para and taught the science classes I had been teaching previous to this job.  I was set up to fail. \u00a0 So why didn't I leave teaching?  Why didn't I leave special ed?  Why didn't I at least leave EBD? \u00a0 By the time I was kicked out of that teaching spot, I was further into the program.  I remember writing my advisor, asking him what else I could do with a Master's in EBD besides teaching.  The short answer was; not a lot.  Maybe go on for my PhD? \u00a0 But that experience, sad as it was, provided an important backdrop for the rest of my academic studies.  I realized I had a LOT more to learn.  I soaked up every single bit of knowledge that I could and made the most of every silly exercise, test and project. \u00a0 After 7 months working fast food, I finally landed that para job at the psychoed right here in Magnolia  County.  And it was a  wonderful  experience. \u00a0 I got my M.Ed. in EBD, and taught it for several years, but not in a self-contained setting.  I remember interviewing for an EBD self-contained position at the other high school the same day I interviewed for the position I occupy today.  That principal said that was his only opening.  I said I wasn't too interested in being shoved into a corner room in the back of the building with the worst students in the school.  That was the end of  that  interview.  It lasted all of 5 minutes.  The principal had absolutely nothing more to say to me.  Needless to say, I was never offered the job. \u00a0 I was offered and accepted this job in  April.   But my application was still out there and on the GDOE website.  By late July, my phone was ringing off the hook with administrators from all over the metro area wanting to talk to me.  They were all a day late and a dollar short. \u00a0 The average tenure for EBD teachers is less than 3 years.  My initial outing was less than 3 months. \u00a0 Maybe that experience was just a fluke.  Or maybe it wasn't.  I found myself repeating almost the same thing just 4 years later.  But that's for Part 2 of this story. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/06/09/a-profession-that-eats-its-young/", "title": "A Profession That Eats Its\u00a0Young?"},
{"date": "2006/06/12", "body": "Part one was a longish tale of my experience as an EBD self-contained classroom teacher.  This was followed by a very good experience as a para in a psychoed.  As that year closed, I was wrapping up my Master's Program at GSU.  Some irksome policy by either the state or the university prevented me from being able to do my student teaching while being a para.  My supervising teacher did hers while teaching, why couldn't I do mine?  It's an insane rule.  Fortunately, I was able to do my practicum during the summer which was a shorter session made even shorter by the summer Olympics.  Yes, it was 1996. \u00a0 My summer practicum was being done at a psychoed that was running a summer school.  I happened to draw the higher functioning SEBD kids who were actually pretty street smart but they were also not keen to do the sort of work that I was assigned to assign them.  The supervising teacher wasn't keen to do much either.  Once again, I felt like I was being thrown to the wolves as I was trying to teach and there was little to zero support from the teachers or the school as no one wanted to do any academic work.  And the predictably acted out.  But my supervising professor rescued me, and found another placement at a private residential hospital for kids with SEBD.  This worked out  really  well as they were actually running more of a real school instead of some sort of summer camp.  And it also really worked out well as my next job would be at a residential hospital for students with SEBD in waay south Georgia. \u00a0 The hospital job was a good one, even though it was year-round.  I still got all the other school breaks, just not the summer one.  But I did get 2 weeks extra vacation.  In addition, my budget was  thousands  of dollars.  I could buy whatever I needed and more, mainly because the FTE money went straight to instruction instead of filtering through endless amounts of administration.  The hospital budget was entirely separate from mine.  It was a locked unit, and if kids acted up too much, they were sent to the nurse who gave them a shot which knocked them out.  I could teach whatever I wanted and so I increased and expanded my teaching.  I actually did teach some reading and literature type things. \u00a0 But the hospital was suffering, budget-wise.  The state was cutting  back and the Child and Adolescent unit was on the chopping block.  There were two of us teachers there, and we were told we might want to look for other jobs.  So we did. \u00a0 I was picked up by the local psychoed, whose director happened to be from my hometown in Iowa (pop. 1500), can you believe THAT?  Anyway, I was not in the main center, but in an outpost 15 miles away in another town.  And then I was sent to an outpost of that outpost.  I was waaay out.  Me and one other teacher were out there with the high schoolers.  I should have known. \u00a0 Before starting the school year, all of the new teachers and paras were given training in the Boys Town system.  It is a very structured management system, that does have a decent track record of success.  I had the freshman, and actually knew some of the kids from the hospital job as they had visited our facility a time or two. \u00a0 There were some difficulties.  I had no materials.  I had gone from having anything I wanted to  nothing , and a budget of $150 to spend.  Then there was my para.  I was still not savvy what to do with them, but had learned a thing or two from working both sides.  Unfortunately, my para was also a bus monitor, so she arrived with the kids and left with them.  We had absolutely no time to talk.  And there was no planning period.  And I had to teach a regular and full curriculum.  Every subject a freshman would take in high school, I had to prepare for and teach.  Plus follow the Boys Town stuff. \u00a0 Add to this some racial tension. \u00a0 My class and the older high school students did their PE together in the gym.  Or at least that's how it started out.  But eventually, there was a huge brawl which shut that down.  PE was easy up to that point, because they just played basketball or hung out.  Now that we couldn't be in the gym, I had to prepare for PE, too.  And I was on my own because my para refused to go outside on the ball field.  So we had a few incidents there. \u00a0 The real deal breaker came when one of the juniors, who had skipped school returned while I was having PE.  We were playing dodge ball, which was actually fun.  My version consisted of me hurling a large rubber ball at the kids as hard as I could.  At their heads.  They actually sort of liked it. \u00a0 Anyway, Junior came strolling up the street and started talking to a couple of my kids through the chain link fence.  Then some words were exchanged.  Then he jumped the fence. \u00a0 Junior had a gun. \u00a0 He pointed it straight at one of my kids, right at his head.  My kid never even flinched and actually dared Junior to pull the trigger.  Meanwhile, I am trying to get the rest of the kids in the building, which was like herding cats.  They all wanted to see someone get killed. \u00a0 Did I mention all of these kids were Seriously Emotionally Behaviorally Disturbed?  Just in case you forgot, I thought that might be good to throw out there. \u00a0 None of them were too terribly bright, either.  I have a bunch of kids who will not get out of the line of fire.  Another who has a gun to his head, taunting the kid with his finger on the trigger.  I have no idea where my para ran off to.  Or the other teacher and her para.  Or the administrator who was supposed to be out there with us.  Good thing I wasn't the only fool.  Junior didn't have the gun loaded, so he and my freshman just got into and old fashioned fist fight.  And then Junior jumped the fence and was gone before an administrator finally arrived. \u00a0 Jane, who was pregnant with our first child, was none too happy about the prospect of me getting shot.  Neither was I.  But I had all this prep work to do, so I was often there until dark. \u00a0 A few weeks later, I testified at Junior's trial and he was promptly locked away in juvenile for a couple of years. \u00a0 It was the middle of October when the head of the outpost called me into her office.  She noticed that I didn't seem too happy.  She then said my old job was still open.  Would I like to go back?  I thought for a minute or two and said I just might. \u00a0 She dialed the number to the hospital, and I talked with the acting director.  Would they mind if I came back?  Would they be okay with that? \u00a0 \"OMG, YES!   Please  come back!  We would  love  to have you back!  We  need  you back!  When can you start?\"  It turns out that the hospital didn't close after all and were stocked to the gills with children and adolescents in need of therapeutic educational programming. \u00a0 At least I was wanted somewhere.  I had to finish the quarter, which was just a week.  I stopped by the hospital, got my old keys back and promptly pulled stuff off of shelves to prepare for my next and last week at the psychoed.  I could not believe how easy it was to just have so much stuff.  So I went back to the hospital, where I was wanted, needed and loved. \u00a0 As it turned out, the hospital did end up closing the next year, which is when I got my present job in Magnolia  County.  Which is why I was the way I was with that principal who was peddling a self-contained job.  That psychoed thing was still fairly fresh in my mind, and I was not interested in a repeat performance.  Again. \u00a0 I've stuck in this business despite some very bad experiences.  Hopefully I'm not scaring too many prospective prospects off!    But these are not the sort of things you will hear from college professors or the administrators trying to  lure  hire you into their EBD positions.  And any teachers who might have been through these sorts of trials are probably long gone; long since fled to somehwere that paid more for less stress, like the military. Told you things would get kind of gritty around here. The fact is, I was shoveled off, abandoned, left on my own and generally taken advantage of, not just by administrators but  by other teachers . That first job, I was assigned a mentor who was the department head.  She  never once  darkened my doorway.  She called me to her room more than once, but never observed and gave feedback.  No one did, except the administrator who evaluated me and promptly hung me out to dry. \u00a0 Student teaching, I was never given feedback by the teacher at that psychoed center.  I never saw her actually teach anything either. \u00a0 And the deal with the gun; Where was everyone  then?  Junior belonged to the other teacher who was stationed out in deep space with me.  Where was  She?  There are many wonderful colleagues out there, who have supported and inspired me along the way.  But there are quite a few who would just as likely shoot your back as leave it uncovered.  You look around your fox hole and discover there's no one else there! This is a tough business I've chosen\u2026or rather a tough business that chose me. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/06/12/part-2-a-profession-that-eats-its-young/", "title": "Part 2: A Profession That Eats Its\u00a0Young?"},
{"date": "2006/06/17", "body": "I had my interview, and it was quite the experience.\u00a0 I had no idea what to expect.\u00a0 All of my interviews thus far have been with principals, the head of departments or personnel directors.\u00a0 I might talk to several people but only one at a time. \u00a0 This one started off with me writing an essay consisting of two questions.\u00a0 The first asked what I would do the first month on the job, and the second question asked how I would support EBD teachers.\u00a0 I'm not going to retype my answers here, except to say that my 2 prior entries did figure into it.\u00a0 And thank goodness they did allow me to type my entries, because my handwriting is atrocious! \u00a0 I arrived a bit early (as recommended in all interview literature) and discovered that Big Boss was running the interview process.\u00a0 She then had me fill out the written portion of the test as described above.\u00a0 After writing up my essay, I gave it to the secretary and then waited another few minutes.\u00a0 I met what appeared to be another candidate for the job.\u00a0 The young lady had been teaching for 5 or so years with this last year self-contained EBD.\u00a0 It sounded to me like she might be looking to get herself promoted out of that position! \u00a0 I was next ushered into the conference room, and sat before Big Boss and 4 other people for a panel interview.\u00a0 Since Big Boss was at the top of my reference list, I felt comfortable enough interviewing in front of her.\u00a0 The panel consisted of 3 assistant principals (2 middle schools and one elementary school) and one EBD teacher.\u00a0 They had before them a multiple-page questionnaire and each took turns asking questions.\u00a0 I have no idea how long this lasted, but there were at least 20 questions.\u00a0 This interview bore a striking resemblance to what I would envision an oral exam to be like.\u00a0 They asked me what an FBA was, what a BIP was and what a rough outline of a training session for paras, bus drivers or teachers might look like in behavior management.\u00a0 The panel took turns asking questions and I answered them all.\u00a0 Fortunately, I had spent some time thinking about most of these issues.\u00a0 I think I did pretty well, but I'll know in a week how well I did.\u00a0 When asked what questions I had, I asked Big Boss what the size and scope she saw for this position. \u00a0 \"Big.\" She said, \"It's going to be huge.\u00a0 It's exciting because it is new, but the first thing will be to find a process of defining this thing down in manageable terms.\" \u00a0 That reflected a lot of my thinking.\u00a0 Or worrying, more like.\u00a0 I really do have a rising tide of emotion about all of this.\u00a0 Of course, if I don't get the position that solves that.\u00a0 I can stay being a teacher and continue with my already-full-plate of behavior issues.\u00a0 And there is a considerable amount of appeal in that outcome as I'm already comfortable with it and find it enjoyable much of the time.\u00a0 I worry that this new position might be too much for one person.\u00a0 Or just too much for me.\u00a0 And giving up my whole identity as a teacher.\u00a0 A fairly odd teacher of extremely exceptional students, but I was still a teacher.\u00a0 Giving that up is no easy thing.\u00a0 I have enjoyed being a teacher blogger and being read by other teacher bloggers.\u00a0 Will I continue to have time to blog?\u00a0 And if not about the daily drama, what will I write about? \u00a0 I'll continue to flesh all this out as things develop. \u00a0 Two other updates: \u2013 I attended N's funeral last weekend, and the small church was PACKED!\u00a0 This was my first real experience at an old-fashioned southern black funeral.\u00a0 Corretta Scott King had  nothing  on this little girl.\u00a0 It was loud and proud all the way, and I'm sure you could hear the singing miles down the road.\u00a0 The community really and truly helped support this family through a very difficult time.\u00a0 It will take me some time to get used to not going out there and working with her 3x a week. \u00a0 \u2013 My ESY student, Darius, is doing very well in his daycare setting.\u00a0 In fact, he does better than most of his peers, behaviorally.\u00a0 So I go 2x a week, do stuff with him and the rest of the 4 year-olds and basically have fun.\u00a0 I don't really have much to work with as far as data collection.\u00a0 I suppose I could do something on number of words spoken during 5 minute intervals.\u00a0 But basically he seems to be social and interacts with his peers and seems to be generally well-liked by them.\u00a0 Keeping him there was definitely the right move, but the ESY is of questionable value compared to what he is already getting. \u00a0 D.

\u00a0 It has been a long time since I was in a classroom of so many typical young kids.\u00a0 In fact, I don't remember  ever  being in a group like that. \u00a0 Unlike a regular preschool, this is a day care that happens to be run a lot like a preschool.\u00a0 Parents are dropping kids off and picking them up throughout the day, beginning as early as 6 a.m. and they can stay as late as 6 p.m.\u00a0 The children are typical, but it is easy to spot several who have varying degrees of exceptionalities.\u00a0 There's one who is probably mildly MR, and then there is one boy who is going to be referred to an EBD class in the future.\u00a0 And then the girl who is all over the place and someone will say is ADHD.\u00a0 These things just sort of shake out over time among so many kids.\u00a0 It's easy to see who is average and then there is one girl who is clearly above the rest of her peers. \u00a0 20 four year-olds is a lot of kids.\u00a0 The lead teacher is Ms. Margie who has been teaching for over 25 years.\u00a0 And her experience shows.\u00a0 She can command attention from all of the kids and engage them all with amazing skill.\u00a0 It really is a pleasure to watch her at work when she is at her best.\u00a0 The kids get unruly or loud and she is right there and redirects them back on to the task.\u00a0 That's not to say she's perfect.\u00a0 She was doing calendar during circle time the other day, and had the kids reciting how it was the 20th of  January. \u00a0  \u00a0 Ms. Margie's assistant is Ms. Sue, who is a lot less experienced and a lot less skilled.\u00a0 She often has problems controlling the kids and keeping them on task.\u00a0 Her method of discipline is yelling and threatening the kids, which is not very effective.\u00a0 By the time it is time for me to leave (@ 11) Ms. Su is already physically exhausted. \u00a0 Unfortunately, the class is divided between the two women.\u00a0 Ms. Margie takes a larger group, but Ms. Sue seems to draw the toughest kids, which happens to be most of the boys.\u00a0 So with the class divided into smaller groups, Ms. Sue has limited opportunity to collaborate with her lead teacher.\u00a0 They really have no chance to plan together so have to take it on the fly.\u00a0 The result is\u00a0 a lot of downtime and confusion despite have a relatively structured schedule.\u00a0 And the result of that is some pretty bad behaviors.\u00a0  \u00a0 Frequently, there is the little boy or girl who wants their mommy and is crying.\u00a0 While distressing, this is not so bad.\u00a0 Then we have one kid who pushes another, and then gets smacked in retaliation.\u00a0 That can get serious.\u00a0 So at anytime, there might be 3-4 kids crying.\u00a0 Then there are some that may be yelling.\u00a0 And then there is the defiance that 4 year-olds are prone to do. \u00a0And then Darius gets sick of it and has a meltdown. \u00a0 It is a loud, busy place, this day care.\u00a0 I see good interactions but also some not so good that would give me cause for pause in putting my own kids in daycare.\u00a0 Day care teachers and their assistants are the lowest trained and lowest paid people in the country.\u00a0 Supposedly, kids are our most valuable resource but if you look at the folks charged with their care on a daily basis, you would hardly know it.\u00a0 They do not have union benefits or representation.\u00a0 There is some state regulations on day care centers, but not much in the way of protecting and caring for their workers. \u00a0 The one Darius attends is probably one of the better ones.\u00a0 But it is still a tough place for the kids and a tough place to work.\u00a0 But it has been an educational experience to observe and participate in over the summer. dick\u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/06/21/a-few-comments-on-day-care/", "title": "A Few comments on Day\u00a0Care"},

{"date": "2006/02/07", "body": "When NCLB was first passed by a bipartisan majority vote, few had a full understanding of the impact it would have on education.\u00a0 The earlier reauthorization of the Elementary Secondary Education Act had many of the same provisions but one thing NCLB had that the earlier ESEA didn\u2019t have was teeth.\u00a0 Namely it was deeply hooked into funding as well as sanctions imposed on schools failing to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).\u00a0 The folks at AFT\u2019s  NCLBlog  correctly called this the biggest thing to hit education since Sputnik.\u00a0 Well not entirely correct.\u00a0 It was the biggest thing to hit education since the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1973, which created an entirely new sector of education, namely Special Education.\u00a0 Now known as the Individuals with Disability Education Act or IDEA, sweeping changes were made in the way that certain students are educated. \u00a0 NCLB is deeply entwined with IDEA, and there is no avoiding either one for school systems.\u00a0 When the regulations from NCLB began filtering down, State Superintendents generally were cautiously optimistic about most provisions except one.\u00a0\u00a0 There was one provision which threatened to sink the entire boat.\u00a0 Actually it was one section of one provision.\u00a0 Up until NCLB, special education had their procedures and regular ed. had theirs.\u00a0 The fear that Gerald Ford expressed of having two separate, parallel systems of education when he signed it had largely come to pass, despite movements towards inclusion and mainstreaming.\u00a0 IDEA \u201997 did add more emphasis on Least Restrictive Environments (LRE) but it wasn\u2019t until NCLB that this would come to a head.\u00a0 In all 50 states, the respective Superindents fired off an objection to one part of one provision.\u00a0 Namely the one on subgroups. \u00a0 NCLB requires that all schools meet AYP.\u00a0 This alone was not alarming until the education leaders saw that EACH subgroup had to also make AYP.\u00a0 Minority subgroups, while possibly troublesome were doable.\u00a0 Those students getting free and reduced lunches?\u00a0 Doable.\u00a0 But when they saw that special education students were in their own subgroup, this turned any hairs on an administrator\u2019s hair white that hadn\u2019t already fallen out or gotten pulled out.\u00a0 But it got worse. \u00a0 In order to make AYP, something like 97% of the students in each subgroup had to take the test.\u00a0 If a school had 4 Asian students and one was out the day of the test that could cost the school its goal of AYP.\u00a0 In the old days, schools encouraged special ed. students to stay home the day of the test or simply excluded their scores from the average when reporting test scores to the media or to a state\u2019s report card.\u00a0 Schools that included scores from special ed. students always had lower test averages.\u00a0 So in the high stakes game of influencing real estate values, this encouraged schools to cheat.\u00a0 Those that didn\u2019t were unfairly penalized for being honest. \u00a0 NCLB sought to correct this by singling out special ed. students as their own subgroup.\u00a0 Now administrators were caught in a bit of a bind.\u00a0 Each year, special education students are counted three times in FTE counts.\u00a0 These FTE counts influence how much federal funding a school receives.\u00a0 This is based upon the type and number of services each special ed. student receives.\u00a0 While the feds have never even come close to their pledge of funding 40% of special education, the money is still significant.\u00a0 Like regular education is now discovering with an under funded NCLB, every dime counts even when it isn\u2019t near enough. \u00a0 If a school system undercounts their special ed. students, they lose that FTE money.\u00a0 BUT, now those students MUST be counted towards AYP!\u00a0 Out of all the provisions of NCLB, this one is the most onerous for states.\u00a0 All 50 states have filed complaints about the special ed. subgroup.\u00a0 Sp. Ed. went from just being a pain-in-the-posterior, to being a serious issue, threatening to sink the whole outfit.\u00a0 Pay attention to how schools report their AYP.\u00a0 More often than not, they will report on making AYP for every subgroup except one.\u00a0 Yep.\u00a0 That onerous Sp. Ed. group is holding up the works.\u00a0 The proverbial poop in the punchbowl. \u00a0 During reauthorization, look for some serious adjustments to be made in this subgroup.\u00a0 Perhaps the bar will be lowered.\u00a0 Not as many students will have to be counted or more will be eligible for alternate assessment.\u00a0 I\u2019ll talk more about alternate assessment in a later post.\u00a0 But at the present time, NCLB allows 1% of the special Ed, students to be measured using some sort of alternate assessment as opposed to the regular statewide testing.\u00a0 That\u2019s just about enough to include all of my students plus a few more moderate students.\u00a0 Fact is, no one is sure what to do with us. \u00a0 President Bush recently spoke of an initiative to attract more math and science teachers.\u00a0 The AFT NCLBlog recently spoke to AFT endorsing the increase of pay for math and science teachers. Everyone is talking about increasing the number of these teachers without talking much about retaining the ones that we have.\u00a0 And not one word about the largest shortage of teachers in the country: special ed. teachers.\u00a0 School systems are pulling people off the street in order to put warm bodies in sp. ed. classrooms.\u00a0 And less than 50% of them last more than 3 years.\u00a0 Stretch the time out to 5 years, and the attrition rate is even more appalling and ghastly.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been in Magnolia  County for 6 years, and I\u2019m considered an old timer. \u00a0 I approach NCLB\u2019s ramifications with some measure of wry amusement.\u00a0 The  wonkish blogs  don\u2019t want to talk about us.\u00a0 Administrators don\u2019t want to deal with us.\u00a0 G.W. Bush doesn\u2019t want to talk about us.\u00a0 The teacher unions have moved on to bigger and better topics related to NCLB.\u00a0 Those of us in the Special Ed. community (parents, students and teachers) represent a problem.\u00a0 We\u2019re probably destined to be dealt with by powers-that-be by being put off to the side\u2026again.\u00a0 Right now, under NCLB, we count.\u00a0 We matter.\u00a0 But the opportunity to do something great is being squandered.\u00a0 Precise, data-driven teaching methods can benefit ALL students.\u00a0 Methods and techniques that reach the slowest learners also pay great dividends for those in the fattest part of the bell curve.\u00a0  \u00a0 I admire the intent of NCLB.\u00a0 It seems tailor-made for kids like ours.\u00a0 After all, a good number of kids who end up being left behind end up in special education.\u00a0 Regular ed. teachers grouse about the lack of input they had in crafting this legislation.\u00a0 But Sp. Ed. teachers had even less, even though it is OUR kids who are the ones bringing up the tail-end.\u00a0 Our kids are the ones dragging down the whole system, keeping the rest of the schools from reaching their precious AYP. \u00a0 We need to talk more about this.\u00a0 I appreciate AFT\u2019s NCLBlog and their more  conservative   wonkish  counterparts in attempting some real, meaningful dialogue concerning this issue.\u00a0 But, like NCLB itself, these are falling short and getting bogged down in some pretty childish exchanges.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be happy to help extend their well-developed ideas and thoughts when and if they decide to start having some. \u00a0 dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/", "http://www.eduwonk.com/", "http://educationwonk.blogspot.com/", "http://www.eduwonk.com/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/07/the-red-headed-step-children-of-nclb/", "title": "The Red Headed Step Children of\u00a0NCLB"},
{"date": "2006/02/08", "body": "02/07/2006 In my last entry, I talked about how Special Education has become a bit of a tar pit for schools trying to comply with NCLB.  The special ed. subgroup remains one of the most formidable obstacles for schools trying to make AYP. But there is another headache visited upon school administrators, courtesy of the existence of special education. Last year, at the annual assembly we have for teachers the week before school begins in the fall, the district superintendent stood on the stage flanked by school board members and the teacher of the year.  He declared that many of the schools made AYP.  The ones that didn\u2019t, he declared, made AYP in all subgroups except one.  Can you guess which one was the exception? He then went on to declare that the county had opened a new school.  Then he stated that they had hired 150 new teachers, and that, as of that day, every regular education vacancy had been filled.  Did you catch that?  Every  regular education  vacancy.   And therein lies the ongoing headache of administrators throughout the country.  Our administrators had managed to find and hire enough math and science teachers to fill those classrooms (or trailers) before school officially began.  I have no idea how Highly Qualified (HiQ) those teachers were or how many of them remained in the system once school started.  But what I do know is that they had not filled every special education vacancy.  In fact, there were still several vacancies the day school started and as those vacancies were eventually filled, something even more onerous occurred.  New vacancies opened up. At no point so far this school year, have all of the special education vacancies been filled.  Every time they get within one or two slots, new ones open up. They simply can not hire enough or retain enough special education teachers. But G.W. Bush said nothing about this in his State of the Union speech.   Amongst the excited chatter about hiring all these science and math teachers, no one is talking about it.  The union blogs, the conservative education blogs and even teacher blogs.  No one, except me. So far. One thing I do know, as I wait for my test scores to come in to tell me whether or not I am HiQ, is that no regular ed. teacher is anxious for my students to darken their doorways.  In fact I\u2019ve had more than one math teacher offer free tutoring once I told them that they might get one or more of my students if I failed to become HiQ. Being a parent offers me a bit of an inside track on how they are thinking.  Parents do talk, and parents of students with severe disabilities are an especially tight group.  When my wife, Jane, goes to parent support group meetings, she hears all about the teachers that the parents hate.  Fortunately, I\u2019m not one of them.  But every one of the teachers that parents dislike, without exception, are those with provisional certificates. I feel like I\u2019ve made a shift on you here.  I\u2019ve been talking about the shortage of special education teachers and suddenly I\u2019m talking about parents and what they think.  Who cares what parents think? Well, all of you should.  NCLB makes special provisions for parental involvement that still have not been fully realized, discussed and fleshed out.  But that day is coming.  And then regular ed. teachers will know what special ed. teachers already know; one onerous parent can ruin your day, your week, your year and possibly your entire career.  Now, remember that the parents are talking so they may actually hate you before even laying eyes on you. This does play mightily into the retention of many of teachers.  A middle or high school provisionally certified special education teacher has NO background in Special Ed.  A mother of a middle/high schooler, however, has at least 10 years worth of IEPs under her belt.  She may already know the director of special ed. on a first name basis.  She knows special education, knows the law and knows her child.  A provisionally certified Sp.Ed. teacher trying to use jargon and position to intimidate will likely find themselves totally mauled by Mama Bear. The IEP is a piece of mini-legislation, drafted between the school system and the parent and ratified by the IEP committee.  It falls on the caseload teacher to draft this and eventually write it all out.  The paperwork involved in this is pretty massive and takes quite a lot of specialized knowledge about special education law, the child and the services the school system offers.  Keeping up with numerous reports, assessments and data require a lot of administrative time.  Time a lot of teachers don\u2019t have.  The paperwork load has frequently been cited as one of the leading causes of stress and attrition among special education teachers.  IDEA 2004 sought to address this through a pilot study of 3 year IEPs.  Since Georgia is not one of the 15 states included, we don\u2019t even get to try out this terrible idea to demonstrate how bad it is.  Instead, I have 5 more pages added. Another factor cited as a reason for high attrition rates of Sp. Ed. teachers is lack of administrator support.  Special education, to the majority of principals, represents a pain-in-the-ass.  Those students make up the majority of the discipline problems, the majority of parent complaints, the majority of hiring headaches not to mention their dragging effect on making AYP.  They are the least likely to get scholarships, become good athletes or boost the school\u2019s image in any meaningful way.  Most principals lack any sort of special education experience themselves, so they lack any understanding of the law, the techniques or culture of special education.  Therefore, like my superintendent, they frequently find ways of simply working around the exceptional populations and their issues.  If it weren\u2019t for the law, they\u2019d have nothing to do with us.  This is not a very morale-boosting experience for most teachers.  Special education teachers are seen as lower class teachers in their own buildings.  Certainly this is true throughout the larger education establishment.  Take a look at all of the education blogs discussing special education issues.  When you find one, please let me know. The shortage of special education teachers is more massive than the shortage of math and science teachers combined.  Every year,  thousands  of fully funded special education positions go unfilled.  But the silence on this issue outside of the special education community is pretty deafening.  I have not read of any officials putting higher pay for special education teachers on the table for discussion.  AFT?  I\u2019m all ears!  My wonkish friends?  Helloo??! Oh well.  I\u2019ll just keep clanging and banging around here.  At the very least if you ever run across any media news on the huge Sp. Ed. shortfall, remember you read it here first! dick ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/08/a-word-or-two-on-retaining-sp-ed-teachers/", "title": "A Word or Two on Retaining Sp.

{"date": "2006/02/10", "body": "\u00a0 The power of blogging lies in a community of people, having similar interests weighing in on a single subject from different perspectives.\u00a0 As the information is generated, worked over and cooked a sort of cross pollination occurs where an idea becomes improved upon.\u00a0 This is more than just criticism, which can be part of the process.\u00a0 It is just giving differing point of views and contributing different perspectives.  \u00a0 NCLBlog  opened up a can of worms with their  post  on research.\u00a0 John basically points out how differing interests manipulate research claims and studies to suit their own purposes. Each side cites studies that support their claims while they refute the opposing studies for flawed methodology or being insignificant.  \u00a0 No kidding. \u00a0 Educational research, under the best of conditions, is difficult.\u00a0 The randomized group designs advocated by NCLB as the gold standard have their roots in the methods we use when testing the yield of various agricultural crops or the performance of animals.\u00a0 For instance, if I want to test the effectiveness of weed control measures, I randomly assign different plots of crops to the experimental or control conditions. Then, they all get treated the same otherwise as far as weather, fertilizer, hours of day light and other pests.\u00a0 The crops are monitored and observations are made throughout the growing season and a person might be able to see the result visually if the results are remarkable enough.\u00a0 But the telling evidence is in the yield, when the crops are harvested. \u00a0If there is a significant difference in yield in all the experimental plots as opposed to the control plots, then we might attribute it towards the independent variable, which in this case is weed control. \u00a0 The problem with using this method of research on students is that they are not plants, which are relatively easy to control.\u00a0 Plants don\u2019t ride home on a bus at the end of the day entering a myriad of different environments that can affect educational performance.\u00a0 They are not refugees from a hurricane, for instance.\u00a0 Another problem, and this is even more critical, is that the random assignment of students only yield results of sufficient statistical power if the groups are large.\u00a0 This is fine in a wheat field where one plant is pretty much like another.\u00a0 Each wheat plant only represents a handful of grain.\u00a0 But each individual student represents a life span much longer than that of any agricultural commodity and a potential resource to a family, neighborhood or community much greater than an entire field of wheat.\u00a0 With large groups, statistical significance is measured only in terms of the aggregate as if each student is a data point and might as well be a bushel of grain. \u00a0 I\u2019ll give one more flaw to this methodology, which is one of ethical consideration.\u00a0 Supposing I study a group of 200 students who are behind in reading, comparing some type of new reading instruction designed accelerate the reading abilities of fifth graders.\u00a0 Students are randomly assigned to two different groups.\u00a0 One group of 100 receives the new type of instruction by specially trained teachers.\u00a0 The other group is the control group and receives whatever instruction is regularly given.\u00a0 At the end of my study, I discover that my experimental group increased their reading ability by an entire standard deviation over the control group.\u00a0 Woohoo!\u00a0 High fives all around!\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Well, yes.\u00a0 And no.\u00a0 What happens to those 100 students randomly assigned to the control group as they head off to middle school? \u00a0 \u00a0 And this is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of NCLB? \u00a0 This is an often ignored flaw in educational research where groups are randomly assigned.\u00a0 In a pretest/post-test method, large spans of time elapse between tests.\u00a0 Through no fault of their own, the control group gets left\u2026behind.\u00a0 No one cares if an individual wheat plant is assigned to a condition that offers or denies a variable that might radically improve its yield.\u00a0 But for parents, each child represents an investment that is significant beyond anything that can be measured by statistics.\u00a0  \u00a0 This is not to say all group designs are unethical or useless.\u00a0 But the more statistical power a group study has, the less meaning it has for any given individual.\u00a0 This simply goes against the grain (oops, no pun intended!) of most teachers who know each student by name.\u00a0 None of us want to leave  any  of them behind.\u00a0 Just something to keep in mind during the debate over which study is or is not valid. \u00a0 dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/", "http://www.letsgetitright.org/blog/2006/02/dont_believe_the_hype.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/10/educational-researchthe-gold-standard/", "title": "Educational Research:The Gold\u00a0Standard?"},
{"date": "2006/02/14", "body": "There\u2019s a  student in  Maryland  named Bill  who has a restraining order to keep him out of school.  Hat tip to John L. at the  Teach Effectively!  blog for  following this one . Students with severe disabilities frequently have behavior issues of either aggression or self injury.  It is silly and ludicrous to suspend a student who has this level of disability, simply because the school wil not be able to credibly make a case that the behavior is not a manifestation of their disability.  IDEA currently requires a manifestation hearing for individuals with disabilities in order to suspend them for more than 10 days.  The purpose of this provision is to protect students like Bill and Leroy from a system that is largely ignorant of disabilities.  IDEA came into being  because  of situations like this.  Before the 1975 version of IDEA, school systems told parents of students with severe disabilities to keep their students at home.  The law helped get them in school, but then school administrators began suspending a disproportionate number of these students for behavior problems, or had them shipped elsewhere.  The effect was the same, basically excluding them because of their disability. IDEA \u201992 included a novel provision.  Before a student could be suspended in excess of 10 days, the school had to hold a manifestation hearing in order to determine whether or not the behaviors were a function of their disability.  This alone did not help a lot, since school officials were still able to put together manifestation committees that would simply vote that it was not a manifestation and they were free move the student out. IDEA \u201997 included a provision that required students going through the manifestation process to have a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) along with a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP).  However, congress never really said what an FBA should consist of or how it should be done.  So this has still left a lot of room for school systems to operate.  The primary purpose of the FBA is to determine what communicative function the behavior serves.  At the most basic level, all behavior offers either access to or escape from people, objects or circumstances. John L. correctly identified some concerns about Bill\u2019s case.  When the family goes to court, the first thing the judge is going to want to see is the IEP.  Every due process proceeding begins and ends with this document.  The judge will ask if there is one.  Then he/she will ask if it is being properly implemented.  Proper implementation would include the FBA and the BIP and all the data accompanied therein. The Supreme Court  recently made a ruling  where they decided that the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff.  In plain language, if Bill\u2019s parents take the school through due process, it is up to them to prove that the IEP is not properly implemented.  However, since the school system is the one seeking a restraining order, it seems the burden of proof would be on them.  The school would have to prove that they had an FBA that was properly done and that the BIP was properly implemented.  There\u2019s the problem. If the BIP was based on a properly done assessment, it should work IF it is implemented properly.  This is where the school ends up in hot water, because implementation requires some properly trained staff to pull it off.  Proof of implementation requires some form of data collection.  And by the sounds of it, Bill\u2019s school has absolutely no systematic data collection procedure, let alone a way to convey this information to parents. The frame of mind is one of keeping and maintaining the student in school.  His mother actually kept Leroy home after she thought he had a bad day.  This meant he missed every other day.  I had to convince her to keep sending her son to school so I could work with him.  His previous teacher wanted Leroy to stay at home, just like Bill\u2019s school would rather he didn\u2019t show up.  It took a lot of work to turn this parent around from some previous bad experiences. I want to say one more thing about Bill\u2019s case.  His family is fighting tooth and nail to keep him in his regular school, while the school is fighting to get him out.  It might be beneficial for Bill to go to the special school where there are some better trained staff, a better structured program and hopefully a better experience waiting for him there.  Having worked in such a setting, I can say it really is beneficial to have all the staff in the building pulling together in the same direction.  Students benefited from having a staff that understood and cared about this population of students.  In a regular school setting, there is not usually sufficient support for a student with Bill\u2019s issues.  In fact, the school does have its own issues.  While Bill\u2019s case may help address these, Bill may better be served in an environment with more competence and compassion. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/10/AR2006021001963.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/10/AR2006021001963.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/10/AR2006021001963.html", "http://johnl.edschool.virginia.edu/blogs/TeachEffectively/", "http://johnl.edschool.virginia.edu/blogs/TeachEffectively/2006/02/13/behavior-teaching-needed/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/14/AR2005111400690.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/14/31/", "title": "Blocking the School House\u00a0Door"},

{"date": "2006/02/15", "body": "Just saw  this article in  USA Today   and might as well pass a thought or two on it.\u00a0 Basically the article discusses how the FDA has decided to put a warning to ADHD medications, including Ritalin. Ritalin is probably the most coomonly prescribed drug for ADHD symptoms, although Concerta and Adderall are also popular.\u00a0 All of these drugs are stimulant medications in the same class as other \u00a0amphetamines.\u00a0 The FDA decided to do this after finding that 25 people dies form 1999 to 2003 while taking these drugs. That\u2019s \u00a025 out of at least 4 million who are presently taking these drugs.\u00a0 The FDA panel vote was close, narrowly deciding to issue the warning by a vote of 8-7. \u00a0 So should parents be overly concerned?\u00a0 Should they take their children off of these medications?\u00a0 Should parents of children with ADHD avoid them?\u00a0 This is a question Jane and I have labored over with our oldest son, who is 7.\u00a0 He has been diagnosed with PDD-NOS, which is on the autistic spectrum.\u00a0 Problems attending and hyperactivity are not uncommon with this population.\u00a0 So the question for us is: when do we decided to try putting him on drugs?\u00a0 His doctor has already said she\u2019s willing to go for it when we are.\u00a0 A psychiatrist, who did an evaluation on him last year thought he might have OCD and prescribed something for that.\u00a0 That prescription went unfilled. \u00a0 Giving a stimulant to a child with ADHD might seem like a recipe for disaster, making one envision the Tasmanian devil whirling around all twister-like and bouncing off of the walls and ceiling. But they often do work.\u00a0 The reason why an individual might be ADHD relates to how the brain seeks input from the environment.\u00a0 Some individuals like a lot more sensory input than others, because a brain in high arousal is happier.\u00a0 ADHD individuals tend to be thrill seekers, impulsive, busy bodies, and seemingly always looking for trouble.\u00a0 They are pathologically impulsive and often show poor judgment.\u00a0 ADHD, as a condition, is not without its own risks. \u00a0The risks of people dying from ADHD drugs must be weighed against the risks of ADHD itself.\u00a0 The reason why stimulants work, is because they stimulate the brain internally.\u00a0 If the brain is in a high state of arousal, the individual does not have to seek environmental sources of the sensory input and stimulation.\u00a0 In this way, the person is able to think more clearly and attend better. \u00a0 It is difficult to name any single factor that affects learning and instruction more than attention.\u00a0 A teacher can create the best lesson and deliver it flawlessly, but if the person is not attending to it, it is all for nothing.\u00a0 Having highly qualified teachers, new buildings and great resources mean nothing if the student is not attending to the lesson and to the task.\u00a0 And so, with our own son, we are paying close attention to  his  attention to tasks.\u00a0  \u00a0 A bigger problem with ADHD drugs than the possibility of death (since the possibility is relatively remote) is the over reliance on them.\u00a0 I\u2019m not just talking about how they are over prescribed, but once they are given, everyone considers the problem solved.\u00a0 YAY DRUGS!\u00a0 But this is not at all a responsible use of such medications.\u00a0 Once the child is attending to instruction, it is crucial to begin teaching the student how to interact with the environment and how to control impulses.\u00a0 A mixture of behavioral and cognitive interventions may be used to help and control outbursts.\u00a0 Once the behavioral repertoire is expanded and is more functional, the dosage can be decreased and eventually discontinued.\u00a0  That  should be the goal of using most psychoactive pharmaceuticals.\u00a0 However, this is not how they are treated most of the time.\u00a0 They are often used as a shortcut or a replacement for teaching behavioral skills to a child.\u00a0 Drugging them is a lot easier than exercising diligence in making sure the child learns how to behave properly. \u00a0 With my own son, diligence has been the biggest factor behind dealing with his behavior.\u00a0 Most \u201cregular\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d individuals can tolerate a certain amount of downtime or even neglect as far as supervising and teaching them.\u00a0 However, individuals with symptoms of ADHD require a lot more work, effort, creativity and patience on a regular basis.\u00a0 It\u2019s no wonder that teachers and parents look for some magic pill to save on their own personal physical and psychological wear and tear.\u00a0 It has not been easy working with Thomas.\u00a0 Even someone as steeped in behaviorism and behavioral training as his father frequently gets worn down!\u00a0  \u00a0 I\u2019ve been holding off for a couple of things before trying the medication option.\u00a0 First of all, I would rather the school keep some good data on what he is doing and how things are going.\u00a0 Since he does share a dedicated para with a couple other students, she could keep some decent data.\u00a0 The purpose is to establish a baseline and then we have something to shoot for.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to be convinced that  anything  is helping him if it isn\u2019t documented correctly.\u00a0 If we go the medication route, I\u2019d like it to be \u201cblind\u201d to the teachers.\u00a0 We might have to make up something, so that they might look for side effects, but I\u2019d like a fairly objective evaluation as to the effect that it has on his behavior and performance at school. \u00a0 I\u2019ve also been waiting for him to simply get older and bigger.\u00a0 I\u2019m not in favor of medications given at a very young age because the long-term effects are not always known.\u00a0 In fact, the Phenobarbital that he was given at 8 months of age for seizures is a likely culprit of many or all of the issues we are seeing today.\u00a0 I\u2019m not dead set against using medications, as long as they are truly needed and that the risks of what they are treating are greater than those of the medication\u2019s side effects.\u00a0 They must also be used in tandem with systematic and direct instruction, with the understanding that he will eventually be able to function without them. \u00a0 Dick \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-02-14-adhd_x.htm", "http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-02-14-adhd_x.htm"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/15/adhd-medications/", "title": "ADHD Medications"},
{"date": "2009/01/16", "body": "\n Here is a copy of a press release from  Govenor Sonny Perdue\u2019s office : \n \n \n \n \n Governor Perdue Announces Proposals to Transform Education and Improve Economic Environment Tuesday January 13th, 2009 \n ATLANTA\u2013 Governor Sonny Perdue discussed education, economic environment and transportation this morning at the Eggs & Issues Breakfast hosted by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce at the Georgia World Congress Center. \n \u201cDuring these times we continue to focus on government\u2019s core mission,\u201d said Governor Perdue.  \u201cNow more than ever we must make sure that we get out of government what we put into it.\u201d \n At the breakfast, the Governor announced three proposals to match the state\u2019s   educational spending with its desired outcome.  The first proposal recognizes the   important role of leadership at the school level.  Under the proposal, high school   principals who demonstrate improvement in graduation rate, SAT scores ,   and End of   Course Tests compared to their school\u2019s most recent 3-year average will be eligible for   a $10,000 performance bonus.    Principals could also qualify by leading a school that is   in the top 5 percent of high schools in the state in these three areas. \n The second proposal recognizes the role that quality teachers play in producing positive educational outcomes.  The proposal for teachers is based on the Master Teacher program and would allow exceptional teachers who are willing to serve as instructional leaders and mentors in their schools to be eligible to receive pay increases of ten to fifteen percent. \n In response to a shortage of math and science teachers and increased demand in these content areas, the Governor proposed taking a business-like approach to recruiting these teachers.  The Governor\u2019s proposal, based on recommendations by the Alliance of Education Agency Head\u2019s Math and Science Task Force, would start new fully-certified math and science teachers at the same salary as a fifth year teacher.  Teachers in these fields with less than five years experience would also be brought up to the fifth year pay level.  In an effort to encourage and reward elementary teachers who increase their competency in math and science, the Governor\u2019s proposal will also provide a $1,000 annual bonus to elementary teachers who hold a math or science endorsement.  The three proposals all call for the incentives to be available beginning in 2010-11 school year, which would be the Fiscal Year 2011 state budget. \n \u201cIt has long been one of the chief fallacies of government to focus on inputs, usually on how much you\u2019re spending, instead of outputs \u2013 on performance and achievement,\u201d said Governor Perdue. \n \n The Governor also proposed school board legislation to ensure that every student has   the benefit of responsible leadership at the school system level.  The legislation   standardize s   board ethics policies and board training, clarifies law delineating the roles   and responsibilities of superintendents and board members, creates minimum   qualifications for board candidates ,   and gives the state the ability to find responsible   citizens to serve on school boards when existing members fail to serve the interests of   their students. \u201cNever again, do I intend for the state to be handcuffed by our current law and powerless to help students who are being failed by the adults in their community,\u201d the Governor said.   \n Make a note of the part in bold above.  There is  a big elephant in the room . Can you spot it? \n Our beloved governor is referring to the critical teacher shortages in certain subject areas (math and science), promising bonuses for those who choose to move into or get certified in those areas. But he left one out. He  always  leaves this one area out in his pet incentive programs. In his Master Teacher Program (designed to be an alternative to National Board Certification)\u2026he left it out.  \n Just where does special education fit into all of this? Special education has been identified federally as one of those critical shortage areas and it is equally true in the state of Georgia as it is for the nation. The failure to mention or address this area is either blatant ignorance, flagrant incompetence out outright discrimination on the part of him and his educational advisors. In fact, he has introduced a measure that promises to make the shortage of special education teachers  worse! \n I just recently received an email from another special education teacher who was asking about the GACE because she was looking to migrate away from special education and into science. And this was composed and sent  before  our governor announced his plans to transform the education and fix the economy through incentives for math and science teachers. And I passed  my  GACE science last last year, so am in a good spot to migrate if I choose. By failing to address the special education teacher shortage, Gov. Perdue is promising to turn the disturbing migration of special education teachers out of the field into even more of a crisis. As it is, people are being nabbed off the street in order to fill empty positions. Now there is even more of an incentive for special education teachers to move out of their specialty area and create more openings that will go unfilled and result in more of the most disadvantaged students being underserved. \n A visit to Georgia\u2019s teacher recruitment website ( www.teachgeorgia.org ) shows where the shortage areas are. Yes, there are quite a few math and science openings. But special education  dominates  the vacancy list. Throw in speech language pathology, ESOL and a few of the other categories and special education as a field totally rules the teacher vacancy positions in the state of Georgia. Special education has ruled the vacancy list for the last 20 years. It will probably rule for the next 20 years, thanks to this governor and his incentive dis-incentive. \n I suppose someone might try to make the case that special education does not add economic value like math and science. To them, I would point out that special education students, as a group, represent the subgroup most likely to drag a school into \u201cNeeds Improvement\u201d status. The unemployment rate of this subgroup is well over 50%.  And current educational policy seems absolutely bent on marginalizing them (and their teachers) even more. So in a sense, having a large cadre of highly paid engineers is going to be necessary in order to bear the economic and social costs of carrying people who the current educational system chooses to leave behind. \n C\u2019mon, Governor! Are you addressing teacher shortages or not? \n This just further illustrates and underscores the pervasive culture of discrimination that seems to always be perpetrated against individuals with disabilities and those who serve them. \n Just to add one more bit of news along these lines, the waiting lists for those waiting for various medical or transition services has been totally frozen since the economic downturn. One of my former students who aged out last year is  still  on the waiting list. Which means he is pretty much just sitting around at home. The money should have been in place the second he graduated since he had been on the list since middle school. But once again, individuals with disabilities are shunted aside in favor of other priorities. They are at the bottom of the list, even in the best of economic times, and in today\u2019s climate they are totally abandoned. What kind of economic recovery is it when it is borne by those who are least able to carry the rest of us?  While we bail out auto executives we keep kids on a waiting list for needed services.  Not a very noble picture is it?

While these are not quite as high stakes as the CRCT for middle and elementary students or the graduation test, they are still big. They are supposed to make up 15% of the students grade. They can, under some circumstances, be used to graduate a student even when a section of the graduation test is not passed. Here are the courses with EOCTs: \n U.S. History \n Physical Science \n American Literature \n 9 th  grade literature \n Algebra \n Geometry \n Biology \n Economics \n It strikes me as a bit funny that there are so many courses with  no  EOCT. Plus, each of these courses will also have a final exam next week. So what is up with the EOCT? The EOCT is merely a practice for the graduation test. These are the courses covered by the GHSGT, and so students get a special practice test in order to assess their readiness for the graduation test \u2014 and the school\u2019s readiness for making AYP.\u00a0 Apparently, not much counts after you take the GHSGT.\u00a0 Why not an EOCT in chemistry, World History or the foriegn languages?\u00a0 If teaching and learning are the focus, why not teaching and learning in these other areas?\u00a0 Especially since the Highly Qualified requirement still apllies to teachers teaching these other courses.

He would have been better served to do as his successor did, which was to have a referendum on the flag, and limit the choices. But the flag issue was confined mostly to a few rural south Georgia counties.\u00a0 Barnes still lost the votes in the more affluent Atlanta suburbs and that had nothing to do with the flag.

I can\u2019t imagine that a county would NOT have this problem, and if you don\u2019t, please share with me how you avoid it! \n Basically we have a huge number of students with IEP\u2019s in our county who get all sorts of services such as speech, OT, PT, VI, DD/HH, APE and others I\u2019m probably missing.  From February on, teachers in the county are scheduling their annual IEP reviews and inviting parents and service providers to come to these meetings in accordance with the due process outlined in the IDEA.  The problem is that these itinerant service providers, wonderful as they are, can not be in two places at once.  They can either deliver services to a child OR attend an IEP, but not both.  In past years, they pretty much spent the last 2 months of the year going to annual IEP reviews and providing very few services to students. \n So here is a question for you parents: which would you rather do: have all of the people providing services at your child\u2019s IEP, or have them continue to provide services to all the students in the county? \n This is an eternal dilemma with regards to the law that is largely hidden from parents.  The due process  that is written into the law to protect parents and serve students often seem to work against each other.  The law says we have to serve students but it also says we have to conduct annual reviews and develop IEPs that include the parents and all service providers.    The problem is that itinerant service providers frequently have caseloads of 50  \u2013 100 students each or even more.  We only have two physical therapists and two adaptive PE teachers that serve all the schools in the county, so they simply can not be so many places at once and at no point are the service providers all in the same place at the same time.  So for my students, the IEP might be the only time that the itinerant service providers have a chance to meet and collaborate on a specific student.  But if they are there, they aren\u2019t providing services. \n Teachers, how would you feel about having all of your meetings after school in order to get all of the itinerant services to participate?  I bring that up, because it is the only way I can see of avoiding the conflict between providing services and attending the meetings. \n As a parent. going after school might be only slightly more convenient but there\u2019s still the issue of childcare for the student and his/her siblings.  If there has been sufficient communication throughout the year, having the itinerant service provider at the meeting might not be so crucial as long as a good written summary is provided. \n There is probably some way to streamline this process using some of the current technology in order to accommodate all of the diverse schedules.  Using the telephone to aet up a teleconference is one way of doing it.  Using web tools might also help provide access, especially if providers are at other schools thus cutting down on travel time and expense. \n Ideas? \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/annual-reviews-and-itinerant-teachers-the-bind-that-ties/", "title": "Annual Reviews and Itinerant Teachers: The Bind that\u00a0Ties"},
{"date": "2009/03/04", "body": "While the biggest part of this blog is involved with what I do for a living, there is also another part that is invested in me as a parent.\u00a0 It\u2019s the parent-teacher combo that gives a bit of a more unique flavor to this enterprise.\u00a0 It\u2019s also what helps my blog fall under the category of \u201cprotected speech.\u201d I have two boys, and it has definitely been a case of diverging paths here in our household.\u00a0 Today, my youngest (blogname Percy) had an IEP. I\u2019m almost ashamed to say I haven\u2019t been to any IEP\u2019s of his, but I do have my reasons.\u00a0 One was that I learned from experiences with my oldest that whenever I walk into an IEP it can precipitate a certain amount of wierdness.They can be long and arduous affairs, as everyone is double sure of crossing T\u2019s and dotting I\u2019s.\u00a0 So I\u2019ve stayed away and allowed his mother to handle these and for the most part they have gone pretty well.\u00a0 At least up until this point. Percy qualified under the SDD label: significantly developmentally delayed, which is the same label his older brother qualified under.\u00a0 When his older brother, Thomas, turned 7 they did an evaluation and he qualified under the Autism label.\u00a0 But no had started on Percy\u2019s evaluation which is sort of unusual considering that they aren\u2019t supposed to be any SDD 7 year-old kids as they are all supposed to be evaluated and go therough a new eligibity by then.\u00a0 But Percy did not follow a typical SDD trajectory.\u00a0 He did have a lot of shyness and social deficits when he started pre-K but by the time he was in kindergarten, it was obvious that these delays were very minor.\u00a0 The boy loved school, loved learning and had zero behavior problems.\u00a0 Academically, he took off and he has managed to make several friend at school as well as around our neighborhood.\u00a0 This year he was consultative, which means essentially no real services and he has done nothing but excel.\u00a0 He\u2019s reading a grade or two ahead, if anything.\u00a0 So, Jane and I were wondering just why he was in special education at all.\u00a0 It was obvious to me, that the boy didn\u2019t qualify unless it might be for gifted.\u00a0 We might have held off from doing anything until a psychological except there is some sort of policy at his school that kids with IEPs need to be in a co-teaching class.\u00a0 Jane and I didn\u2019t really want this as he did so well this year without it.\u00a0 Somehow, last year\u2019s case manager managed to keep him out of that setting but this year\u2019s case manager seemed determined to make sure he was in such a class for next year.\u00a0 I had a good mind to simpy ask for a re-evalution and put her through the rigors of going through the re-eval process but in the end we didcided it was time to pull the plug.\u00a0 So we requested he be withdrawn from services and as of today, he is IEP free.\u00a0 I think much of his earlier developmental lags might have just been from picking stuff up from his brother, but who knows?\u00a0 In anycase, he is exceptionally in his own way.\u00a0 He\u2019s definitely the kid you want in YOUR class and the kid you hope your kids want to hang around. And then there is Thomas who recently turned 10.\u00a0 While he is generally a good kid, he would drive you absolutely nuts if you were his teacher.\u00a0 Academically, he can be pretty sharp at least until things get too abstract.\u00a0 But socially and behaviorally he can be a handful.\u00a0 And he has inherited a total disdain for homework, which now drives his mother (and me) nuts.\u00a0 The boy can dig his heels in for hours\u2026or at least until I get home.\u00a0 At that point there is no more nonesense because I haven\u2019t the patience for it.\u00a0 I can get him to do it but it bugs me that so much of our interaction involves having to do this junk that I hated as a kid.\u00a0 Now most of my interactions with him are  negative  because I\u2019m having to correct, reprimand and generally get snarly on him.\u00a0 He might pick up on the fact that I\u2019m not into it, but I\u2019m not sure how he thinks not doing it until I get home will make things any better for him.\u00a0 Life is infinitely easier for him when he gets it done right away. I\u2019ll have to devote more blogspace to him and his drama later, but suffice it to say that he can generate enough of it for two people!\u00a0 But at least there will be one less yearly IEP to worry about.

{"date": "2009/03/02", "body": "\n No-school-today-snowstorm Edition Our GAA  is  was due TODAY, and I was chugging along at a pretty good clip, getting things done as time went on.  I was not saving everything until the last minute, because I realized how little time we actually have to do these things.  It is less than 8 weeks to do all 12 tasks.  So I had gotten a bunch of data and have been assembling it and putting it together.  My GAA student has been out the last couple of days, but I wasn\u2019t sweating it, because I thought I had everything I needed. \n But I was wrong. \n I had everything I needed right up until the very last task of the last standard.  And the pictures of what we did were GONE!  I searched every computer and jump drive I had, and they simply didn\u2019t exist.  No small task since I take hundreds of pictures of all of my students basically creating a sort of pictorial portfolio for each of them.  So now I\u2019m a bit against the wall.  I already know what the task is and have it set up so we can get it pretty quickly.  Hopefully he is recovered from his illness! \n But this is exactly the sort of thing that happens.  This student has been ill and absent more this year than any other time in his 3 year career with me.  But I have done well with it until now, because I didn\u2019t put it off.  And it still isn\u2019t a huge deal.  It\u2019s just a matter of some concern.  We\u2019ll make the final deadline, easy enough, unless things go viciously wrong. \n All-in-all, this whole GAA business isn\u2019t the total disaster that I sometimes paint it to be.  It does have numerous and serious problems, to be sure.  It is not very good for evaluating either students or teachers, but there are aspects of it that are okay.  For one thing, it has made us players as far as the standards go.  Prior to the GAA, our students (and us as teachers) were totally excluded from the regular curriculum.  We had a functional curriculum, which by and large served the needs of the students and their parents most of the time.  However, we were not really involved with the rest of the school\u2019s curriculum.  I was fine with that, and focused on my background in vocational instruction (when I taught agriculture) in the community-based program.  The shift in focus has allowed me to shift back to my more academic background (when I taught science) and ways to present and differentiate that better.  Fact is, in those areas I am possibly miles ahead of my regular peers because I am reaching for a much farther and harder target.  I\u2019ve had to learn how to present it smarter and in more creative ways because my students can not attend for more than a minute and they can not read a textbook or do a worksheet.  Studying about matter and Mexico and  Moby Dick  has been enjoyable and I\u2019ve had to stretch as a teacher in ways I would not necessarily have before the shift.  Ironically, it\u2019s because I teach everyone in the class according to the standards that I didn\u2019t have the pictures I needed to document the activity for my GAA.  On the day we did the activity, the GAA student wasn\u2019t there so I went ahead with the activity with the rest of my class.  So while I did it, I just didn\u2019t do it with this particular student and whenever we get back to school, we\u2019ll have a make up session. \n The shift has taken place during a time when community-based instruction has fallen almost totally off.  We used to go to the community nearly every day. Now it is once or twice a week.  Maybe.  So a lot of the void is filled in with academic content activities.  At least I\u2019m not pressured by the same time constraints as those in the regular classrooms who have to cover so much material in a relatively short period of time.  I can sit on one topic as long as I like or move on and come back to it later.  The freedom to do that is a good thing, since my students may take hundreds of trials in order to master one new skill. \n During the  Elluminate session  and more than once on this blog, I may have come down too hard on teaching academic content to these students.  It\u2019s not a bad thing for the students or the teachers, for the most part.  However, thanks to NCLB, the academic content is the  only  thing that counts.  We can make all sorts of noises about the importance of IEP goals and the need for transition, daily living and vocational goals, but NCLB has narrowed the focus to that one single area.  The schools are charged with providing all students access to the state mandated curriculum, regardless of disability or economic status.  The \u2018A\u2019 in FAPE has been clearly defined.  \u201cAppropriate\u201d is exactly what the regular education students are getting, so that is what the exceptional population gets, too.  The accommodations and modifications are designed to enhance access to the general education curriculum (and associated assessments)\u2013 and nothing else.  Until either the curriculum changes or the accountability changes (or both), those other areas of the IEP are not very relevant at all.  Courts have made it clear that NCLB  trumps IDEA.  For most students, this might not be a terrible thing in and of itself.  But for students with severe disabilities, it really does put us in a tough place as far as providing services for our students.  They don\u2019t really and truly don\u2019t fit into a \u201cregular\u201d academic setting (whatever that is) because they present more unique challenges.  Realistically, they are not going to have competitive employment, pay taxes or vote. They are not going to college, which is where every current education reform is trying to  force every student.  Colleges simply don\u2019t want everyone!  They want to be able to be somewhat selective, and my students are through the floor in that particular process.  But that doesn\u2019t mean that they have to be totally locked out of the curriculum. \n The students with more severe and profound disabilities have a lot to teach us, which I believe is their greatest asset and role.  They let us believe that we are teaching them, when in fact WE are the ones moved to greater character and knowledge.  Every teacher who teaches  any  subject at  any  grade level should do a rotation in a severe and profound classroom for at least 4 weeks.  Let them teach their subject and ply their craft to students with the most needs and the most limited personal resources and they will be able to better reach those who already come equipped  with a lot more knowledge.  Since that isn\u2019t going to happen any time soon, it makes some sense to wheel these kids into regular classrooms as a sort of mobile learning opportunity, like those  learning lab buses  that criss cross the country and stop at various schools so kids can go inside and experience a virtual environment with activities centered around a topic or theme. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/school_law/2008/02/7th_circuit_rules_against_scho.html", "http://www.c-span.org/schoolbus/about.asp"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/just-when-i-thought-i-was-finished/", "title": "Just When I Thought I was\u00a0Finished\u2026"},
{"date": "2009/04/02", "body": "Let\u2019s make a special note of  my standard disclaimer  since this post ight annoy a few people! \n I remember a few years ago I went to an autism conference where a parent advocate was talking about IEPs.  She described various methods she used in order to successfully advocate for her son and get him the services that she needed.  I wish I could remember her name, but it is probably better that I don\u2019t because right now I am am feeling very hostile toward these adversarial strong-arm tactics.  I\u2019ve been a victim of strong-arm tactics from both sides: those inflicted by the school system, and those inflicted by a parent.  At the moment, I\u2019m having issues with the stupid tactics parents are using.  The main one being the long, drawn-out, slow, painful, watching-paint-dry, line-by-line meeting. \n \u2013 \n We are getting more and more and more parents that are adopting this tactic in my county and it has some very real, very painful and very detrimental consequences. \n \u2013 \n I\u2019ve talked a bit before  about how the itinerant teachers are in a bind when it comes to having IEP meetings.  Feedback from other teachers around the country indicate that they help mediate the crush of meetings by having annual reviews throughout the year.  This makes some sense to me if there some meetings at the beginning of the year, and some at the end, instead of doing them all at the end.  However, given the nature of the educational beast (i.e. testing) there are end-of-the-year meetings that are unavoidable.  It becomes difficult to plan for a student\u2019s upcoming year if you don\u2019t know if they will be able to advance to the next grade and that depends pretty much on test scores.  Are you going to write an IEP for the 9th grade and high school or another year of 8th grade?  There\u2019s a big difference in the level of support needed.  Depending on the the graduation test or end-of-course tests, it might be the difference between graduating or doing another year in high school.  I suppose you could write an IEP anticipating a best-case or worst-case scenario, but you can expect to be holding some addendums later.  I prefer just having the one meeting. \n \u2013 \n L ike it or not, we are in IEP-Full-Tilt season.  And now we encounter several parents who arrive to an 8:00 a.m. IEP with a picnic basket for lunch and pizza coupons for dinner and possibly a cooler and snacks if they are feeling generous.  These folks take a day off work and fully expect and anticipate spending an entire day for an IEP.  I have major problems with this tactic, because it causes a hardship that radiates out beyond just the one school, parent and student.  But the problem is that most parents that do this don\u2019t care about the other students because they make it their sole business to advocate for their own.  This is all well and good.  The hard-core advocates are correct in that parents are the first and best knowlege-base when it comes to their own children.  No one will advocate like a parent (mothers in particular) and parents should be willing to go to the mat.  However, waiting until the day of the IEP to decide to become and Advocate Mom is not the best way to do it.  Advocacy is a continuous thing that demands diligence the entire year and not just on a single day during a single meeting.  Properly done, advocacy can actually make IEP meetings  less  traumatic.  I\u2019ll share a few ideas about that, but first I want to share why this is bugging me right now. \n \u2013 \n I t is our county policy that we need at least 3 people in order for an IEP to be legitimate.  LEA, parent, and case manager are a minimum along with a regular ed. teacher and then other service providers on top of that.  Of course, parents and teachers can invite many more participants.  I\u2019ve had meetings with nearly 20 people that included the nurse, cafeteria manager, someone from transportation, DFACS, a healthcare agency, and two sets of parents plus other teachers, administrators and therapists.  That was just an annual review, not a manifestation.  And we did go on for a couple hours on that one but it was only my second year at this level.  But while all of the teachers and therapists were at my longish meeting, there were NOT serving any other students.  They were not at any other meetings for any other students.  They were in that one meeting, mostly not saying or doing anything when other students in the county were being denied services.  There are no such thing as substitute OTs, PTs or SLPs.  These are highly skilled positions that you can\u2019t just grab someone off the street to do.  Would you want the just laid-off Microsoft programmer giving your son or daughter PT services while the PT is in an IEP meeting?  Substitue teachers  might  have a degree but they do not have specialized skills our kids need. \n \u2013 \n I n my case, my son is not going to get OT or speech services for the next couple of months because of IEP meetings.  The kids that I teach will get a reduced number of services because of IEP meetings.  And many of those same service providers will not be attending IEP meetings for my students because they will be attending one meeting that is sure to last all day.  I tried to schedule several of mine during the one day when most services were at my school.  That happens to be a day when Advocate Mom is having an IEP for her child at another school, so all of the itinerant services are going to be there and they will not be allowed to leave because Advocate Mom brought a lunch along and possibly an attorney.  No special occasion, it\u2019s just the way she decides to operate on a yearly basis. \n \u2013 \n I  need to be perfectly clear that I do not know who this particular Advocate Mom really is.  I did not ask because even though the   lives of my students (and my own) are being disrupted here, it isn\u2019t any of my business.  I do happen to know more than one Advocate Mom who does operate in this way and if I happen to get an opportunity I intend on sharing my concerns directly in a less public forum to whoever.  So indulge me in making some suggestions as parent and teacher so that you can have your say, your rights and your time while not wasting the time and efforts of others: \n \n \n Keep communication open all year.  Do NOT wait until the annual review to unload a bunch of issues that have been brewing for the last 7 months.  If you are concerned, you have a right to bring them up at the point you are concerned directly with the provider responsible.  If you make no headway, work your way up the chain of command as needed.  But communication is truly the key.  If everyone is open and transparent, there really is the possibility of everyone walking away happy. \n \n \n Submit proposed goals and other input ahead of time.  I strongly advocate that teachers share their proposals well in advance, and this also goes for parents.  If you have stuff you want included in the IEP, let it be known far enough in advance that it can be included in the draft presented at the meeting.  If you have independent evaluations and data from other providers, it can really help write a better draft that requires less niggling. \n \n \n Try to cut a deal before hand.  Yeah, I know that the IEP is supposed to be a committee process, but as a parent you have most of the cards.  Go ahead and play ahead of time and see if there are points that you can get agreement on before the meeting from the folks who you need to win over.  If you want para support for your son or daughter, try running it by the director of special ed. in advance.  Your case manager is likely to support your efforts, and he/she can help you make your case.  If you run into a dead-end, then at least you know ahead of time and can go ahead and pack the lunch and pizza.  But a lot of bargaining and discussion can take place ahead of time over the phone and with stakeholders.  It happens at schools among the staff all the time.  There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t be in on the preliminaries.  A few things to put on the table in advance: ESY, para support, major placement change, adding service hours, an evaluation request.  These are all things that may require extra forms, paperwork and consultation.  If I know you might want an evaluation we can actually start getting consents and screenings done ahead of time instead of waiting for the meeting. \n \n \n Request a draft of the IEP, copies of mastery records and data ahead of time.  I know teachers and service providers really grouse about doing this, but it really can save a lot of grief in the long run.  If they are not giving their stuff to you voluntarily, send a note in demanding it by a certain time, say 5 days or so before the meeting.  I suppose you could make the holding of the IEP contingent upon that condition.  If they refuse, you simply turn the tables\u2026go to the meeting and table it as soon as you get the stuff.  School systems will automaticaly table a meeting if you show up with an attorney without giving them advance notice.  You have the same right to NOT be surprised. \n \n \n Look for other ways and times to communicate.  Special Olympics can be a good time to touch base as well as other events that happen during the school year.  Some of it might involve volunteering.  Afterall, you don\u2019t have to be a nuisance ALL the time!;-)  Communication and being open is a real key to getting the best services possible for your student.  If I know you want a certain service or device in advance, I can hunt around and look into it.  I might find something better than what you wanted.  But if I\u2019m surprised by something at the annual review, I\u2019m going to have a more difficult time agreeing to it.  We all have a hard time agreeing to things we don\u2019t understand or are unprepared for. \n \n \n Be realistic.  \u201cRealistic\u201d is a very subjective thing, and I get that.  In fact, this concept of realism probably causes more conflict than anything else.  Yes, we have the technology to put your son or daughter inside of a space capsule and launch them into orbit around the moon and bring them back safely.  But when you\u2019re asking tax payers to foot the bill for your moon shot, we\u2019re going to have some problems.  And do you  really  want the school system building that rocket?  While school systems are capable of many things, I\u2019ve come to realize that the school system is not terribly capable of doing many things very well.  You\u2019ll get para support and ESY but the folks doing those things may not be as skilled and committed as you want.  It\u2019s a given that they will not be as committed as you, the parent.  So by \u201crealistic\u201d I think parents need to realize that they are much better equipped to deliver most of the skills their kids need themselves.  I only have 7 students, but they are the neediest students in the building!  On a good day, I can get 45 minutes with each individual student, and that includes changing diapers and feeding.  If you want your child mainstreamed, the ratio gets worse.  Para support involves a new level of devilry addressed next\u2026 \n \n \n Get the student involved (as appropriate).  With my SID/PID population, it is going to be somewhat negligible as it is with very young students.  However, by the time they are a middle schooler, most students should be writing some sort of \u201cFact Sheet\u201d indicating their own interests and their own understanding of their limitations and strengths.  I have been in many meetings where parent and school system are squared off and a very capable student is in the middle left saying absolutely nothing.  That student needs to be in the middle, but not as a spectator.  Which gets back to para support, because a para often becomes a sort of surrogate parent.  For the very young or the very impaired, this is often what is needed.  But as students age, that para support needs to be dimished and independence needs to be increased.  Same with testing accomodations.  The best example of a student self-advocating was one time when we were discussing testing accomodations and the teacher was ready to include extra time and a small setting \u201cjust in case he needed it.\u201d  The student shot back (quite forcefully) \u201cI just took the PSAT and had no problems with 100 other students for 3 hours.  I hink I\u2019ll be okay taking other tests without all that!\u201d  Okay, this fellow might be an exception but the point is, is that he was ready to shed the support and let it be known. \n \n \n Let My People Go!  It\u2019s not just something Moses said to Pharoah, it\u2019s good for the rest of us.  If you feel the need to have an IEP that lasts several hours, okay.  But please let the service providers go do what they get paid to do or at least attend some other parent\u2019s meeting.  I have 5 meetings on one day, and all 5 of those parents deserve a shot at talking to people who serve their children, just like you.  Allow those participants who need to leave after the first hour to do it, if you can.  I know no one likes the \u201crevolving door\u201d of many meetings with people coming and going, but this truly is the nature of this beast.  We simply have not mastered the ability to be several places at the same time.  It really is rare that a teacher or service provider can spare more than an hour for these things, but we do what we have to. \n \n \n Surprises are NOT anyones friend during the IEP process.  Time is also not a friend.  The whole \u201cwear them down by making everyone stay long\u201d might get you what you want but there are consequences which I\u2019ve outlined.  Okay, you don\u2019t give a crap about other students, the teachers, the service providers or anyone else but your own kid.  But the bad will you generate WILL trickle down to your student whether anyone intends for it to be so or not.  It\u2019s just human nature.  While I don\u2019t know exactly who Advocate Mom is, if I ever found out, I do not think I would be looking forward to ever teaching this child no matter how sweet he or she is.  Every one of my students deserve my time and attention and I resent stuff that gets in the way of that, even if it is a well-intentioned parent.  For my son, I expect the teachers and service providers to do their jobs to the best of their ability with a minimum of fuss.  If Jane and I have to fuss at the school, we will.  But by and large we\u2019ve found ourselves taking up more and more of an active role in the education of our children.  And we\u2019re trying to teach them how to take a more active role in  their own learning.

{"date": "2009/03/12", "body": "The steady and increasing drumbeat of  disability advocates  is zeroing in on the use of seclusion and restraints in the school system.  My friends over at  change.org are leading the charge  along with a  number of others,  if you check out their links. While this has been an issue for a few decades, I think I can safely say that it has begun to approach critical mass.  Changes are being made around the country, in the state of Georgia and in my own school system.  Keep in mind that corporal punishment was still pretty common in many Georgia districts until relatively recently. Before diving into the fray, let me give you a bit of my own personal history on the subject.  I\u2019ve already written abit of  my own old school background  on the subject of spanking.  My first real exposure to the practice in special education was when I was a para at the local psychoeducational center about 15 years ago.  Basically the guideline for time-out was when the student was hurting others or destroying property.  The same goes for restraint.  Basically, it makes sense to me that if a child of 9 is severely emotionally disturbed and is beating the crap out of another student (or teacher) that physical intervention is warranted.  If he/she is throwing a chair or gouging out their own eye, I\u2019m trying to wrap my mind around how I might help the child or others without the laying on of hands.  I already know the answer to that, which I\u2019ll share in a moment. But we did use restraint and seclusion using guidelines and training from the  Crisis Prevention Institute .  We also used life space interviews after a student got out of time out.  The procedures that we followed at the psychoed were, in my opinion, second to none.  But seclusion and restraint were NOt our methods of choice.  We relied an a very robust arsenal of positive behavioral supports, because you simply can not teach a classroom where everyone is in timeout.  It took a lot of personnel to moniter the rooms, as well as the risk of personal injury.  So in our class at the time, we had a point sheet/token economy, a level system, a group reward/contingency program, therapeutic rec/leisure and generally tried to make the climate as positive and rewarding as possible.  so when a student had to go to time out, they were really and truly missing out on something.  On top of that, I introduced a sort of \u201cpunch-out\u201d token economy that was more immediate.  The effect of that, was that I could take up the token card instead of ejecting the student while reinforcing everyone else.  So it was a time-out-in-place.  But the student always got reinforced when they were ready to rejoin the group/task.  By the end of that year, I rarely ever, ever had to put a kid in time-out or lay hands on them in our class.  However, the practice of restraint and seclusion did end up costing me personally and dearly that year. While I was being a para for a teacher of mostly middle school students. the teacher of the younger kids was having major problems with one of her 9 year-old students.  so the director made the decision to move me in that class to help deal with that student.  That lasted about 2 days.  He was a pretty wild kid, and I did end up having to hold him on the ground quite a lot.  He was small, but extraordinarily fast and strong which is why they decided a big male was needed to help handle things.  In hindsight, this was not necessarily the best thing.  And it turned out to be a very bad thing.  One day, after he had been particular trying, it was finally the end of the day and time for him to get on the bus to go home.  So we went out to the bus, but instead of getting on the bus, he took off like a shot through a crowded end-of-school parking lot and towards the very busy end-of-the-day-traffic street.  The teacher was in hot pursuit and so was I (we already had the rest of the kids on their buses).  She told me to call the police, which is what I should of done.  But I didn\u2019t.  To be perfectly honest, I had had it with this kid and was at the end of my rope.  I was going to get him.  While there was an element of danger for the kid with buses and cars, that might not have been the only reason I went after him.  I caught up to him and made a lunge to go for the final grab.  And that was it. I have no idea exactly what happened, but it was all over for me.  My knee somehow got terribly twisted and I went down hard and heavy.  It could have been the uneven grass we were on or the sudden swerve the kid took and me being too stupid and reckless.  At that moment, the true idiocy of my actions caught up and washed rght over me in a wave of pain.  And I would spend the next few hours in an emergency room.  Nothing was broken, but I had some  ligments that were badly torn.  That was it for my running career.  To this very day, that knee will sometimes bother me for wierd and strange reasons.  Losing weight definitely has helped keep me from limping and gimping around.  But it is a persistent reminder of the folly inherent within restraint practices.  At least by school teachers, no matter how young and fit. My next job was at a psychiatric hospital in a child and adolescent unit.  Even though it was the late 1990\u2019s it seemed like the 1980\u2019s sometimes the way it was run, especially in the area of behavior management.  When I arrived, there were lots of people who were experts on therapy and behavior but  none  of them were behaviorists.  The social workers were into family systems, the behavior specialist was actually specialized more with those who had been sexually abused and the doctor/psychiatrist was into psychoanalytical therapy while being supported by the MD\u2019s and nurses with lots of psychotropic medications.  seclusion and restraint was used quite regularly, but it is hard to imagine  not  using it with some of the severe behaviors that warranted being hospitalized.  I saw it all while I was there, but since it was a locked facility, I never had to chase anyone down.  Plus the health service technicians did all of the physical work.  And sometimes that meant a 5 point restraint system under a doctor\u2019s order.  While there was a token economy and level system in place, it was not used very well.  So I did use other contingencies that I had control over, like access to a computer lab.  The kids  loved  the computer lab and I had the best hardware and software money could buy at the time.  I had a $7,000 budget!  So I had resources to apply towards behavior and teaching.  If a kid acted up in my class, he/she was simply removed to time-out or more medication. But the big issue/movement in the 1990\u2019s was deinstitutionalization, which meant that the C&A unit was closed and I lost my job.  I\u2019ll have to write more sometime about the repercussions of that movement.  Suffice to say that the present movement towards not using seclusion and restraints is a direct result of  that  battle that was mostly won by the advocates.  Most of the cases that were served by a huge (and expensive) team of doctors, nurses, behavior specialists, recreation specialists, psycholigists and social workers are now being served by the school system and mostly one teacher and a para.  So the teachers are being held responsible for behaviors and clients that they are not trained to care for.  Is it any wonder that there is abuse and mistakes and serious consequences? When I first started here, most of the kids were fairly moderate.  We were community-based, which involved going into the community almost everyday to a job or community site.  My kids  loved  getting on the bus and getting off the school campus.  So did I and the paras.  The contingency was simply that if a kid acted up, he didn\u2019t get to go out that day.  And that was usually sufficient.  Today, the climate has changed.  Community-based instruction is quickly disappearing.  We go out maybe once or twice a week.  The shift has been toward academics and the Standards.  True, we try to work on life skills and weave the content with the skills but some standards and skills simply do not line up.  And the level of severity of the disabilities has become more acute.  Many of these students would have been under the care of a team of doctors, nurses, psychologists and specialists back in 1970\u2019s and \u201980\u2019s.  But those facilities went away the same time as the C&A unit.  Now it is all me. The schools are poorly equipped to deal with severe behavior probloems.  The state charges schools with the primary mission of educating students in a  curriculum  that is largely aimed at getting students into college.  Any other agenda is secondary to that primary mission of an academic education.  How effective a given school system is in that one single mission is up for discussion.  I agree that schools do need to focus on this one thing (and learn to do it well) while providing a safe and humane environment for all learners.  There should also be options for vocational and life skills, but that is another discussion.  The point is, is that when it comes to dealing with behaviors that result in the school becoming unsafe for students, there needs to be some options.  And right now, I see the only possible option is calling the police, which is what I should have done 15 years ago.  We were located right next to the police station at the time!  I do believe in teaching students with behavior problems, but I learned very early on that when a child is in the midst of a full meltdown or tantrum, there is no learning or teaching that is going on. Actually, there is one other option that might work.  That is to convert all of the time-out and seclusion rooms into places that lock from  the inside .  Then when a student is out of control and getting assaultive, the teachers can seclude themselves.  Or perhaps fixing the valium dispenser in the teacher\u2019s lounge would work. Seriously, I do support the work of those advocating for more and better humane treatment of students, generally speaking.  But just as there were adverse consequences to pushing everyone out of institutions  and into the community, there will be adverse consequences for making seclusion and restraint forbidden practices.  I hope that the movement results in a more positive climate within schools and classrooms, but I don\u2019t think it will result in the sort of programs envisioned by most people.  What made states move to deinstitutionalize was that they saw they could save a ton of money.  The result was a lot of mentally ill homeless people and many of them being served within jails and prisons.  Sure, many were better off in group homes.  Many weren\u2019t.  A 10 minute period in seclusion often allows the student to remain in school the rest of the day.  If the police are called, will the result be the same? I\u2019m going to go ahead and attach my seclusion/time-out procedure so that you can feel free to review it.  I\u2019m open to criticism about it if there is anything wrong with it.  Of course, if you are against seclusion/time-out under any and every circumstance then you won\u2019t like it no matter what the policy is!  But the alternative of having the student removed indefinitely, or having people hospitalized is not very attractive.  It would wonderful if everyone was extensively trained and supported, but that hasn\u2019t ever happened even in the most ideal of circumstances and conditions.  With serious budget constraints across the country, professional development is the first thing that gets tossed out the window, followed closely by para and behavioral support. when_to_use_the_time_out_room ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tash.org/index.html", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_district_wins_in_timeout_case_in_court", "http://nomoseclusion.blogspot.com/", "http://www.crisisprevention.com/", "https://specialed.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/when_to_use_the_time_out_room.pdf"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/03/12/the-seclusion-and-restraint-issue/", "title": "The Seclusion and Restraint\u00a0Issue"},

{"date": "2009/03/14", "body": "In my county or any other county for that matter when attending a job fair I just returned from our county\u2019s Teacher Job fair and it was a bit of a hoot.  First off, I was incredibly nervous going into this thing.  While I think most people are nervous about job interviews, I was a bit more nervous than most people, because I knew a lot of the people there i.e. the Supt. of HR, the director of Special ed. plus my own administrators at my own school plus countless other people in the system.  And the first question that I knew that would be asked was, \u201cWhat are  you  doing  here?!?\u201d  I knew this fair wasn\u2019t for me, but the system had no provision for voluntary transfers this year. So I was willing to do my own legwork, and this fair was a place where I thought I could have a chance to talk with many administrators in one shot. There really were a TON of people in attendance.  Keep in mind, this fair was only recruiting for secondary science, math and fully certified special education (I\u2019m in 2 out of 3 of those).  It was very narrowly focused, and yet it was still pretty packed at 10:30.  I debated about whether to go in or come back later but just went in, after taking a deep breath.  I walked across a drizzly parking lot and got in lines where people registered and got name tags. And this is the part where I\u2019m going to tell you what to do or not to do: 1. Get Certified.  This seems like a no-brainer, but there were still people showing up who were not certified and still hadn\u2019t even gone through the process.  You can begin by going to the  Georgia Standards Commission  website and learning about the process and applying. 2. Read the notice of what the district is looking for.  You can find out all about job fairs and recruitment at the  TeachGeorgia site .  This is a great resource for teacher job hunters in Georgia.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a few years ago, but I was registered on there and did get calls from administrators during the summer.\u00a0 A bonus tip is to have your profile link to your own web page/resume. 3. Bring your certificate/copies with you.  They were really checking and screening those today, so people who did not have theirs had to go to another line where a helpful person would help you pull it up and run a copy.  But that slows you down, and you\u2019ll look unprepared. 4. Bring multiple resume copies.  I think most people know and do this already, but it\u2019s too important NOT to mention. 5. Get and fill out an application beforehand.  Most school system applications can be obtained online, and many can be completed online.  Go ahead and fill one out and submit it, then have a copy to keep with you when you go to a job fair or interview. 6. Talk and network with other perspective job hunters.   While there might be some degree of competitiveness, there is also a possibility of some of these folks becoming your coworkers.  While I talked to a few nice opeople, I also met a couple of surly characters who had their game face on and were not interested in chatting. I found myself hoping that I would never have to work with them and had a thought about pointing them out to my HR contact.  However, I do have faith in the people doing the hiring and interviewing in the special education department that they will be able to sort out the nonhackers. And some people talk when they asre nervous and some would rather not.  For the latter group, I wonder why they are teachers.  I find talking helps lower the tension, but maybe that\u2019s just me. 7. Have work samples .  This tip alone is worth your time, and is your reward for reading this far.  It\u2019s my contribution to teacher innovation.  The light bulb went off in my head yesterday.  I basically put pictures on my mp4 player, as well as a short video I did, just to show and wow whoever I talked to about how I might use technology in a class.  While it wasn\u2019t exactly a powerpoint, it worked just like one.  Now I had a portable way to show off my stuff.  Trouble is, I never had a chance to use it. I was in the process of standing in the special ed. line waiting to be screened by my special ed. director, where I figured I was going to have to answer that question.  But the associate superintendent got to me first and that was the end of my job fair experience.  He said he was willing to work on some sort of transfer later once he knew where all the openings were.\u00a0 He seemed like he was willing to work with me, even though there was no provisions made for voluntary transfers this year. I can only hope, but without getting my hopes up too high.\u00a0 Last year, the principal had told me I would make an excellent coteacher in science.\u00a0 But that was a different principal who knew he was leaving and could say whatever he wanted.\u00a0 By the time I realized that there was not much of an intention to move me, it was too late to ask for a transfer or it would have been denied in any case.\u00a0 So this year, I am perfectly okay with staying if I have to but moving if I can.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got good people to work with, good people to work for.\u00a0 But there are other worlds to conquer and learn. I did a small poll of a few people at the job fair and I discovered that while there were a ton of teacher wannabes there, there are very, very, very few who are both willing and able to do SID/PID at any level, let alone at the high school.\u00a0 On some level I see why, but on another it is depressing.

{"date": "2008/09/03", "body": "It\u2019s amazing how this web 2.0 stuff brings people from all over the world together.  It seems as though I have gravitated toward Australian Youtube video bloggers as of late.  One of them is  AustDingo , who often posts things about autism.  He has two kids on the spectrum plus he has his own diagnosis.  But I ended up subscribing because of his off-the-wall humor and characters.  Even from half a world away I identify with a lot of what he goes through as a father and just getting on with his life. Recently, he got into hot water with his employer for making videos on YouTube as well as him talking about his own Autism.  For some odd reason, this company seemed to think that they owned him AND his autism or something.  He tried to comply with their wishes by removing any offending videos but they still sacked him.  You can get the story in the links below.  Also, these are nsfs (not safe for school).  Apparently Australians have a great love for certain descriptive four-lettered invectives: The Fat Australian: gives a good (but very salty) overview of the situation \n Austdingo 1:  In his own words Austdingo 2 : where he talks about how the company claims to sort of \u201cown\u201d his autism \nThis wrong on so many levels.  First, there\u2019s the whole sacking of someone for their own exercising of free speech.  I have no idea what sort of \u201cBill of Rights\u201d australians have, but always figured they had s love of liberty at least as much as Americans.  They certainly seem to like to express themselves in colorful ways.  And then, there\u2019s the claim that they were offended because he wore shirts with the company logo.  I never noticed at all.  Beer does feature in his videos but he\u2019s rarely made that big of a deal about it aside from drinking it, which is another hallmark of many Aussie videos.  It\u2019s singularly odd that they would go off for these infractions that seem fairly minor. Whatever their publicity problems caused by Austdingo\u2019s videos, they now have a much bigger disaster in the making if this thing goes viral.  And it does have some elements going for it: \u2013 It\u2019s a beer company that is well-known \u2013 The autism angle is very popular nowadays \u2013 It\u2019s a direct assault on free speech  and  disabilities at the same time. Austdingo is not a big player in the Youtube world (a fact he pokes fun at all the time) but that makes the \u201clittle guy vs big callous corporate entity\u201d all the more appealing.   This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of someone getting \u201c dooced \u201d for Youtube videos although I\u2019m sure it must have happened many times before.  Still, I think getting fired for posting Youtube videos should be called \u201cgetting dingo\u2019d.\u201d  It just has a nice ring to it. One confusing and vexing aspect was when dfer (D fer Dingo) explained how one of the reasons they gave was his use of a letter he had from a psychiatrist describing his diagnosis of autism.\u00a0 Apparently they went after him because they claimed some sort of rights to that letter, thus sort of trademarking his autism!\u00a0 That is just crazy. My heart and support goes out to Dfer, Tfer, Mfer and Trav who have had their fair share of struggles even without this.  They are a lovely family and you can go by and give Austdingo your support by just leaving a nice comment on one of his videos. And shame on Fosters.\u00a0 What they did is neither Australian or American. D.

{"date": "2009/02/22", "body": "I do make a lot of noise about those monkeys in Washington, and their simian counterparts in Atlanta.  Over the past few years, they have managed to screw up education in such a way that it will take decades to recover.  But change is on the way.  Hopefully. Ironically, the troop of baboons under our gold dome actually might get something right.  There are  3 separate bills working their way through the Georgia legislature  that are designed to help lower the drop-out rate while helping students succeed.  Some promising developments, and some not so much. \n HB 149 is basically a form of dual enrollment that allows juniors and seniors to work their way through college while finishing up the last two years of high school.  I do like this idea, as it will allow those students who are ready to move ahead to do so.  High school can be fun for a lot of students but a drag to others.  Getting out early plus getting college courses for free could be a big incentive for certain students. HB 400 involves having a grant program that would enable high schools to set up magnet or theme schools around high-demand vocational careers such as healthcare, agribusiness or science.  I have not seen a lot of specifics of this bill, and so while it looks nice it seems pretty vague.  Schools would have to opt in and apply for the grants and then establish the infrastructure to help train students in a vocational career.  Technical schools and colleges would also partner in this proposal, so it has some aspects of dual enrollment built in.  But both HB 149 and HB 400 will still be hamstrung by the requirements of the curriculum standards set by the GA DOE.  HB 215 would help correct this. \n HB 215  is the bill with the most promise and yet will face the stiffest opposition.  It represents a battle between the DOE and the legislature over what a H.S. diploma in Georgia will represent. \n My DOE readers, feel free to weigh in. \n Basically, Georgia used to have a multi-tiered diploma system.  There was a basic, general diploma, there was a vocational diploma and then there was a college prep diploma.  As one moved higher in the track, the requirements became more rigorous.  If one got a general diploma, it didn\u2019t automatically bar them from higher education but probably meant a two-year college before moving higher.  The general and vocational diplomas had fewer requirements so that more vocational electives could be taken.  However, the DOE recently abolished this system in favor of one diploma for every student\u2013 the college prep diploma.  The idea was that every student who graduates will be able to go to college.  The DOE has stated they don\u2019t want lesser diploma levels for anyone, but equally rigorous standards for all.  They also don\u2019t want all the work they invested into the new \u201cOne diploma for all\u201d approach to be undone. \n As I see it, the DOE was all wet when they came up with \u201cone size fits all.\u201d  It was a serious mistake and the legislature is right for trying to fix it.  The DOE could reverse themselves and fix it today, but they won\u2019t do it.  Therefore, we need to pass legislation in order to compel some common sense into the process.  Students with special needs automatically become the brown biscuits in the punch bowl, once again.  Because they are either locked out by the requirements, or drop out or simply are failed and left behind.  And the students that  I  teach are a particular case in point.  According to the newest DOE standards, a student with an IQ of less than 25 will get a college prep diploma (based on passing the GAA).  A student with a 75 IQ who can\u2019t pass the graduation test will get nothing.  The gifted student with a 140 IQ will get a college prep diploma which is the exact same diploma as my student with profound intellectual disabilities.  Am I the only one who sees the problem here?   How does this do anything but cheapen a college prep diploma?  Insisting everyone pass the same standard necessarily lowers the standards for the higher achievers and raises it out of reach for the lower achievers. \n My students participate in something known as Special Olympics.  The rules are modified as is the playing conditions and equipment so that my students can participate.  If they had to use the same equipment and rules as the regular Olympic athletes, just what chance would they have of succeeding?  Would they have a chance of even meeting a basic qualification of being in the Olympics?  No.  But if the DOE were running the sporting universe, every child would have to have an Olympic qualifying time or forget about sports altogether.  Which is what too many Georgia students do.  They know they aren\u2019t going to survive Algebra 2 and have no use for it, so they drop out.  It\u2019s the only way they can keep from losing.  The DOE counters this by saying that they can not support any legislation that waters down the curriculum.  But given the provision being made for students with severe disabilities, that is exactly what it amounts to.  The college prep diploma is totally watered down is now meaningless.  Which means a Georgia diploma is meaningless. \n HB 215 is a bill that corrects the serious error that the GA DOE made when they abandoned students with disabilities and those with non-college career goals and aspirations. Not everyone wants to go to a university.  We still need firefighters, police officers, paramedics, soldiers, electricians, carpenters, plumbers, daycare providers and truck drivers.  The DOE seems to be blinded to the fact that the employable skills of a Georgia HS graduate and the skills of a HS dropout are almost exactly the same!      The college prep curriculum leaves precious little room for taking any vocational courses because there are so many core requirements.  Even for students with severe disabilities, the community-based program has all but been totally decimated by the emphasis on the core curriculum requirements.  Much of this was pushed downwards from the feds with NCLB, but much of it is aggravated by our own state policies.  I notice this bill also re-implements the special education diploma track which at least makes the regular diploma look less ridiculous and makes it slightly more meaningful to those who earn one. So thanks to our legislature for bringing a bit of sanity back into educational policy.  Sometimes Georgia politics seem as straight as a dog\u2019s hind leg, but this is one educational bill that actually  deserves some support.  I hope that it can be passed and is able to comply with the onerous NCLB requirements. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/02/14/leghigh0214.html", "http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2009_10/search/hb215.htm"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/02/22/hb-215-restoring-some-sanity/", "title": "HB 215 \u2013 Restoring Some\u00a0Sanity"},
{"date": "2009/02/04", "body": "In my recent Christmas video , I sort of had a bit of fun at my director of special education\u2019s expense.  Hopefully, she still has her sense of humor.  Or perhaps the joke will be on ME!  Hahahahaha! \n That video itself was probably one of the best, most polished ones I\u2019ve ever made in the technical sense.  But the sarcasm in it might have been a bit much, so let\u2019s see if I can fix any mis perceptions that might exist plus shed some light on what little I know about the job of special education director and the person our county has doing it. \n In a small rural county, the director of special education is a lot more visible and knows the parents, teachers and students better than in a larger district.  Our district has been transitioning from small to large over the past 15 years or so.  So while she knows all of the teachers, she is not nearly as familiar with all of the students or their parents as she might have been starting out.  Also, the administrative overhead grows as the district grows.  While she has some assistance from other staff, there are still many things that only she can do and authorize and can not be delegated.  Mainly, she answers to the state DOE as well as to the county superintendent.  Anything that is required by the state, it is her job to make sure the entire county is in compliance.  And this is not a small job, nor is it fun.  At least  I  don\u2019t think it is fun! \n Consider that the U.S. Congress has teams of lawyers and staffers working to draft and reauthorize the IDEA.  Then, this gets passed down to the state, where the DOE adds more layers to the regulations.  By the time it gets to the county level, the requirements of the law have increased substantially.  And then the special education director has to figure out how she is going to get all of the various disciplines within special education to comply.  Most of the time, this translates into finding some way of getting teachers and education providers to comply and report.  That means more paperwork.  Our special ed director is and always has been very much pro-data which has added to the workload at times.  But if I think about it, most decisions  should  be data driven .  The problem is that there are hundreds of teachers in our county and not all of them are able or willing to comply with all the details the process requires.  The newest teachers have yet to learn all the finer points, and veteran teachers can be a bit rebellious sometimes or merely forgetful.  In any case, getting all of these educators to comply with the myriad of regulations required by the government can be like herding cats.  Which means more effort has be expended on accountability and thus more compliance-driven paperwork. \n Which leads to the next layer of responsibility which is managing all those teachers.  By and large, the building administrators can do a lot of it, but if there is some sort of problem (like a rogue blogger) she is expected to be on the front line.  She also helps support all of the teachers that need extra training.  And every year, when things change, EVERY teacher needs to be trained.  Even those of us who are already trained need to sometimes be trained again. \n One of the main sources of work for me is the level of collaboration necessary in order to serve my classroom of students with disabilities.  PT, OT, speech, VI,  HI, APE, transportation, the school nurse and the cafeteria all represent people that I have to interact with on a regular basis in order to do my job.  Now multiply that by a factor of about 100, and you might have some idea of what a special education director might have to typically deal with.  Except while my involvement is primarily at my own level, hers runs all the way up to the state department and all the way down to the lowest classification of employee.  Her involvement runs throughout the board office among all the areas of curriculum and administration. \n In a perfect world, the special ed director could busy herself planning, training, keeping up with all of the latest regulations and requirements and budgeting.  There is plenty enough there to keep a body busy all the time with just administering the extensive program that is special education.  However, it is not a perfect world.  We do have students that we have to deal with and each of those students have at least one parent.  The level of satisfaction of these parents is by-and-large pretty good in our county.  But it is not perfect.  There is just no pleasing some people no matter what you do. And teachers do make mistakes.  Some more than others. And who does an angry parent talk to if they have a serious complaint that they want action on?  It\u2019s usually the board office, and if the student has an IEP the point of contact is the special education director.  While she can successfully delegate some of the smaller fires to other people she still has to follow-up to make sure it is dealt with.  And then she takes the big fires that always take much longer than anyone ever plans.  Sometimes this involves having to testify in court, which involves a lot of time taken away from all the other things she needs to attend to. \n What this translates into is a constant stream of demands upon the time of this one single person, and I have only skimmed the surface of all the duties and obligations.  It is a huge, gigantic job that is mostly pretty thankless.  The special ed director is rarely thanked by parents, as she is no longer in the classroom.  While so much of her job revolves around helping students with special needs her involvement is indirect and behind the scenes.  Whenever the public is looking for people to give credit for in their child\u2019s education, it mostly goes to the teacher.  Administrators rarely get it, and those who sit in the central office rarely are recognized at all.  What\u2019s more, in the current times of budget constraints, the job is made all the more difficult as people are forever pointing fingers at trying to reduce administrative overhead.   Since no one sees what administrators do, it is easy to say that what they do is unimportant or less important. \n As teachers, it really does not fully sink in as what administrators really and truly do unless we expend some serious time and thought.  Often, they can diffuse a situation before it gets out of hand with a parent or the public.  They take care of the toughest of the discipline issues and some of the toughest decisions that have to be made.  Often, all we see is all of the paperwork that this person seems to be making us fill out and thus all of our own time that is being taken.  If I am having trouble getting something done within the district or even on a building level, many times the special ed director is the one that can get things done and moving along. \n Now I\u2019m going to get a bit specific here, and risk even more exposure to repercussions.  But this is part of my new resolution to be more positive.  I\u2019m not going to mention her by name but everyone who is local here will know exactly who I am thinking of in this post.  In my video, I was being vague on purpose because I wasn\u2019t intending to go after anyone in particular although I can see how it could be taken that way.  But now I\u2019m going to be much more specific just to make sure there\u2019s no confusion and everyone knows where I stand. \n I\u2019ve had dealings with our special education director with me as a teacher and then as a parent.  I can honestly say that I\u2019ve never seen anyone who works harder, with more dedication and under more stressful conditions than this woman.  I was acquainted with her when I was a para and she was an EBD teacher and she was hard enough working and talented back then doing one of the hardest teaching jobs that exists in special education.   Over the years, as parent and teacher I can say that I have not always agreed with everything she\u2019s done but I always felt I got a fair hearing.  As much as she already has going on, she always takes the time needed in order to listen to what people are saying.  Always.  She was perfectly willing to address and present to the local autism support group which can often be akin to walking into a den of momma bears.  She has totally supported local parent advocacy groups and their activities and events.  Her level of dedication and effort to special education is unmatched by anyone I\u2019ve ever met.  And I\u2019ve been around some hard working people! \n So while my video had a rather snarky tone to it, it was not meant to paint my own special ed director in a bad light.  It was more along the lines of \u201cWelcome to Life as a Special Education Teacher!\u201d  In this business, a sense of humor is pretty crucial to maintaining some semblance of sanity. \n \n \n On that note, y\u2019all can quite bugging her about the teacher who is blogging and making videos.  I did let her know about them fairly early on in the process and have not tried to hide any of these activities from her or anyone else.  However I\u2019m going to address the specifics of the video project in another post. Good luck to everyone else who is wrapping up GAA\u2019s \u2013 only about a month to go! \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/02/04/get-to-know-your-director-of-special-education/", "title": "Get to Know Your Director of Special\u00a0Education"},
{"date": "2008/09/16", "body": "We just had our training for GAA as the window for collecting data opened on Sept. 4th. \u00a0  There are not a lot of changes from last year which could be good or bad depending on how you see it. \u00a0  Short of it going away altogether, they might as well keep it the same. \u00a0 I figured I might blog my GAA experiences this year and share what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing it. \u00a0  It might help a few teachers who are just now experiencing it for the first time plus just give a forum for spleen venting if you need it. \u00a0 I\u2019m fortunate in only having one 11th grader this year, so it looks like a comparatively light load. \u00a0  However, the student I\u2019m doing GAA with has the most profound cognitive disabilities I\u2019ve ever had to try to assess.  \u00a0 So job #1 is looking at the student and assess what they can do. \u00a0  I actually started this process as soon as he wheeled into my room as a freshman. \u00a0  The earlier you can start, the better off you\u2019ll be. \u00a0  And if you comprehend nothing else I write, comprehend this: you can not start this task early enough. \u00a0  In fact, if you have not started collecting data as you read this, you are behind already. \u00a0  In fact, I\u2019ll just go ahead and say that no matter where you are in the process when you read this; if you\u2019re not done you\u2019re probably behind! \u00a0  I say this because every year I have seen teachers scramble to meet the deadlines set up by their local administrators. \u00a0  And those scramblers are stressed and making mistakes that they have to keep correcting which puts them even further behind. \u00a0 Something to keep in mind is this: there are many ways a Georgia Alternate Assessment can \u201cfail.\u201d \u00a0  None of those ways to fail have anything whatsoever to do with student achievement. \u00a0  This is the only assessment I\u2019ve ever seen where actual student achievement counts as nil in a final failure. \u00a0  It is all about the teacher who is completing the work. \u00a0  The student is really an accessory and a prop in this assessment. \u00a0  When you shift the focus off of actual student performance and on to your ability to deliver a finished and complete portfolio then the task is clearer and it might help lessen some of the frustration. \u00a0  I know this is not the party line or the bill of goods being peddled by Washington or Atlanta. \u00a0  However I\u2019m concerned about reality and the reality is that NCLB has been twisted beyond all recognition when dealing with kids with severe disabilities. \u00a0  The law never took our students into account when it was written. \u00a0 Back to the job at hand. \u00a0  \u00a0 Once you know how the student is going to respond, you have an array of choices as far how the student will respond to the tasks. \u00a0  \u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about standards for a minute. \u00a0  My kids all function at a level measured in  months  and they are expected to meet standards designed for students functioning at a 16-17 year-old level. \u00a0  As teachers, we have latitude as far as specific standards and strands to pick from and we are allowed to address prerequisite skills. \u00a0  This process of selecting standards and strands is one that should be pretty common nowadays as far as daily/weekly lesson plans anyway. \u00a0  We are being held increasingly accountable for those standards as SID teachers and that means planning and teaching to the standards. \u00a0 These are steps that should have been done already at the beginning of school. \u00a0  I\u2019ve had to totally retool my program from daily living skills and community-based instruction to being standards-based instruction. \u00a0  Relevancy does not really count anymore. \u00a0  If you can make it relevant than you are doing well, but that is not the focus as much as addressing regular education standards with age-appropriate materials. \u00a0  We are, in essence, teaching to the test here. \u00a0  When I make up my lesson plans, they are all aligned to standards found in the GAA blueprint. \u00a0  Given the fact that my students learn much slower than average and they need hundreds and maybe thousands of trials to show improvement or mastery, a handful of standards go a long way. \u00a0 The next step is to develop your strategy for completing the portfolio. \u00a0  You need to pick the standards, the tasks, the methods of documentation and opportunities to show generalization. \u00a0  The better you plan the smoother the process. \u00a0  When I made my plan for the semester last year, the units of study were aligned with my GAA topics, with the possibility of several units and standards so I wasn\u2019t tied to just one possible topic or task. \u00a0  This year, those units are being further aligned with specific standards and tasks in the GAA blueprint. \u00a0  \u00a0 Helping things along in the planning is a GAA planning sheet that should be done for each student. \u00a0  I\u2019ll see if I can put one up with this post. \u00a0  Having that sheet entirely completed will go along way in getting the portfolio complete. \u00a0  It was while working on mine that I came up with a formula for picking out my GAA tasks for the collection periods that is pretty universal for me. \u00a0 Collection period #1, Task #1: In collection period one, one task for any given standard involves listening, reading, watching and observing. \u00a0  Student participation is minimal at this point because mastery and proficiency are going to be demonstrated in collection period #2. \u00a0  We\u2019re just starting out, so the student may respond to the instruction, but the response is minimal. \u00a0  They may be reading a book, watching a movie, or perhaps interacting with an adaptation of a text or story. \u00a0 Collection period #1, Task #2 does involve a bit more involvement and deals with the vocabulary of the topic/subject. \u00a0  For this task, the student will match, identify and or speak and interact with the new words of whatever the topic is. The student can use an AAC device for this task in order to use the new words. \u00a0 Collection period #2 Task #1: Now the student needs to show more mastery and sophistication with the subject matter in order to show improvement. \u00a0  For many students with severe disabilities this is no small thing. \u00a0  My approach has been to go at this simultaneously from two different angles. \u00a0  One is to bring generalization into it and having the student perform the task in a less restrictive setting outside of the special education setting. \u00a0  It could be the cafeteria, another regular ed. Classroom, the administrative office or the community. I get custodians, lunchroom personnel, coaches and administrative assistants involved. \u00a0  The goal is to expand the educational universe beyond the special education classroom. \u00a0  The second approach is to ramp up my technology. \u00a0  While I may use some technology in the first collection period, I keep it as unsophisticated as possible. \u00a0  In collection period #2, the student will interact a lot more with the material. \u00a0  In science, we\u2019ll actually do some sort of experiment that applies what was read/discussed/talked about in collection period #1. \u00a0  \u00a0 In task #2 I allow the student to demonstrate some sort of mastery by doing a test, quiz or some other generalization exercise concerning the vocabulary we had in collection #1. \u00a0  Again, I\u2019ll pull out extra technology in order to get the student engaged with the material with less prompting and less help. \u00a0  \u00a0 The data collection generally matches the task. \u00a0  Captioned photos are the easiest to handle for me, as my students do not produce much in the way of products. \u00a0  Observation forms and interview forms are also good for the secondary tasks. \u00a0  Audio and video would be natural options for many of these tasks, however the state wants a detailed written script to go along with the audio or video in case the audio or video media does not work. \u00a0  In other words, audio and video involve at least twice as much work and we\u2019re generally discouraged from using it. \u00a0 So that is the GAA so far. \u00a0  I\u2019ll be keeping you updated as we go along. \u00a0  Here is the attached  gaa-planning-sheet Tags:  GAA ,  georgia alternate assessment ,  NCLB ", "outgoing_links": ["https://specialed.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/gaa-planning-sheet.doc"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2008/09/16/the-gaa-begins-tips-and-tricks/", "title": "The GAA Begins: Tips and\u00a0Tricks"},
{"date": "2009/02/22", "body": "PLN = Personal Learning Network and it is the latest buzz word buzzing around.  Or at least it\u2019s the latest thing I\u2019m running into when reading about teachers who are into technology and all the latest, greatest stuff. I\u2019m still trying to figure out what it is, exactly.  It\u2019s not exactly  cut and dried . Funnily enough, the concept is  older than  most of the technology that is spawning a lot of the conversation.  But there is some  good sites  helping  to guide  teachers on how to make one.  And David Warlick seems to have the  authoritative site on the subject . So do you have one?  Do you need one?   Patrick Woessner does a good job  of describing the current state of affairs in education.  Few people know what it is, let alone have one.  In a way, I do have one in the form of the folks in my blogroll and RSS feed.  But I feel like it\u2019s not very tightly knit.  I\u2019m beginning to see where Twitter might be helpful.  But again, there\u2019s that info overload, because of my various interests. I joined the Classroom 2.0 and there\u2019s some promise there.  I invite you all to look around and let me know what you think. View my page on  Classroom 2.0 What really got me thinking about this was a recent wave of comments from colleagues who have referenced the isolation involved in teaching students with severe disabilities.  Like our students, we are often in need of the greatest support but are segregated off from the greater teacher community.  We can join in extra curricular concerns (if we have time) but we rarely get to connect with others who also do what we do.  It\u2019s rare that there is more than one SID/PID teacher in the building and some districts may only have 3 in the whole system! So providing support and ways to get support becomes a real challenge but the technology is there if we want to use it. Oh well, back to work on finishing up the GAA!

{"date": "2009/02/25", "body": "I just finished an Elluminate session put on by our state DOE featuring Dr. Shawnee Wakeman from UNC Charlotte.  You can see a copy of that  session here .  I was good and quiet\u2026for at least the first half of it! I\u2019ve watched a few Elluminate recordings but this was my first live one.  Well, my second if you count the one from yesterday which I showed up late to.   It is definitely a cool medium but it also takes time to warm up to it.  It also takes more concentration than just listening to a podcast or watching a video because ideally you\u2019re supposed to react and participate.  So there are some definite chat aspects to it.    Sort of like Yahoo Chat with a Whiteboard and a lot less spam. One complaint I have with Elluminate or at least the rendition of it that I experienced is that I would\u2019ve liked to have seen profiles of other participants for reasons that I\u2019ll get into in a moment.   I did see and input my own profile into (including the URL to this blog).   But I don\u2019t think anyone else saw it. Dr. Wakeman  was the primary presenter and if you log in to get the Elluminate archived session, you will probably also get a copy of the power point.   Today was day 2 of a 2 part presentation and if I would have been able to make more of that one I might have had less to say in the first one!  I did manage to listen to a lot of it from the archive during my planning time (such that it is) and got up to speed.   I also poked around  her site  to look at some of the other work her and her colleagues are doing.    And I can\u2019t find the link to it, but some of the work regarding different levels of intentional communication sort of resonated with me.   A huge part of what we do with our students is trying to raise and harness the level and sophistication of that intentionality. I won\u2019t get into the entire presentation as there was a sizable portion at the beginning that went over and through me.  I still had a room full of kids as we had buses that were running late.   My paras are really good, but that late in the day everyone is just letting off steam.   And sometimes the kids can get loud and restless, too!   It was just difficult following along right then, which goes back to what I said about Elluminate requiring more sustained attention than I initially expected.   With the recorded version, you can always pause it and come back.  When it is \u201clive,\u201d if you snooze, you lose! Once the students and paras were all gone and after the cleaning lady had buffed my floor with her diesel-powered buffer (LOUD), I was able to tune in.   But I have to admit to taking more time to get turned on.  This is where having profiles would have helped fill in a few blanks, such as the grade and instructional level that people taught.  A lot of the material seemed to be pretty far above where my students live, and if it weren\u2019t for me deciding early on that I wanted to try to blog, I might have left early.  But I\u2019m glad I stuck around.  I thought Dr. Wakefield did a good job of hitting on some ideas for increasing the depth and breadth of knowledge during our instruction.  And she did actually get to me on a couple of points (although I didn\u2019t let her know it at the time) as far as continuing to do the same things over and over and over and over and over again. Yeah, guilty.  That\u2019s me.  I do have a kid who has been trying to identify his name from an array of 3 for 5 years.  And still he can\u2019t do it independently more than 30 percent of the time.  HOWEVER, we did (FINALLY) get him to identify the penny, nickel, quarter and dime.  After 5 years.  And he\u2019s counting to 5 after learning the numbers 1-5.  So here\u2019s the tough part; knowing when to quit.  It took him 5 years (at least) to master those few skills.  We\u2019re extending to numbers 6-10 and deepening to counting other things but I could have just as easily given up 2 years ago once he finished his GAA.  But I\u2019m stubborn like that. Is being stubborn an asset or a liability in this business?  It probably depends on the quality of judgement.  I\u2019m still working on that part of it. But as a high school teacher trying to do this with students who have severe and profound (mostly profound) cognitive disabilities there was still some distance between the expectation and what I see myself being able to do with a room full of students.  Dr. Wakeman did sort of address that, which is about where I piped in because it was the first I was able to really get turned on to her material.  I think if, as educators, we can succeed in jumping the enormous gap between a high school profound student and their grade level standard, doing it for the rest of the student population would be absolute gravy.  Once we landed people on the moon, flying to Califronia or even China didn\u2019t seem so difficult.  Same thing, here.  So my recommendation for future training would be to zero in on conquering that challenge: the distance between the most profound student and the highest grade-level standard.   So much of the conversation on aligning standards seems to be akin to getting to California from Georgia when my kids are trying to get to there from the moon!  Can they do it?  Yeah, maybe with the same amount of time, intensity and resources as an Apollo moon mission.  But no one is offering NASA-sized resources to my class at the moment.  Perhaps I\u2019m still thinking too small.  I\u2019m willing to try and think bigger and jump higher. Anyway, it was a worthwhile presentation that was done well. I did come away with some new insight and not all of it was guilt! Perhaps doing more with less would improve future presentations, but only if there are other loudmouths like me in the room.  It\u2019s the participatory potential of Elluminate that can make the house rock.  So thank you Dr. Wakeman, for virtually visiting us in Georgia! By the way, I had no idea what a  Dip Dog  was either.   So here you go ! Of course, I already had a lot of background in this material, thanks in large part to Dr. Toni Waylor-Bowen (she needs her own webpage) and her partner in crime at the time, Jessie Moreau.  Dr. Bowen was the moderator of this session and everyone needs to give her kudos for being such a good (and patient) sport to some of my snarkiness.  Regular readers know my feelings toward the GAA and she did a swell job of fielding my comments and questions.  I might invite her to do a podcast or some sort of interview type of thing in the future to address some of those issues.  As it was, we did sort of get into it toward the end of the Elluminate session which may or may not have made it more interesting.  I think we could have gone on for some additional time, but at 5:00 most of us were ready to go home.  Or use the bath.   TMI but at least more truthful for me! I think I might blog Dr. Bowen sometime separately later on, because she does have a good story, lots of experience and is totally willing to help and share. \nSo any and all, feel free to have at me in the comments!

{"date": "2009/02/11", "body": "The idea was, and still is, to develop a knowledge base for other SID/PID teachers to draw from and (hopefully) contribute to.   I\u2019m extending the level of collaboration beyond the district mainly because there are so few of us who do what it is I do.  And among those who are SID/PID teachers, there are not many with a lot of technical knowledge to produce the content and post it in a place where others can benefit from it. \n However, the open nature of the project has caused some concern for people on many levels, or at least so I\u2019ve been told.  So I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to welcome my new readers and clarify a few things in a way that will hopefully lower the anxiety level of everyone. \n Here is a copy of the permission slip  that I used in order to give parents an opportunity to participate in this project. From my standpoint, the parents of my students were partners in the project as far as I was concerned.  They were free to opt in and out at will.  However, I didn\u2019t seek necessary approval from those in higher authority.  I can sympathize and understand where there might be some concern from a liability standpoint.  It\u2019s the job of those people in the higher pay grades to worry about such things and I do appreciate the concerns that have worked their way through the system to my level.  From where I sit, it looked pretty straight forward: there was some teaching that needed to be done and I was in a position to do it.  So I did.  I never made what I was doing a secret.  In fact, I actively promoted my blog and my video channels in order to get the word out that this resource was available.  I invited input and feedback.  That\u2019s what this whole web 2.0 medium is all about.  It\u2019s about sharing knowledge and then improving on the knowledge that is shared.  The accountability of the system is built into the feedback. \n Unfortunately, those who are not natives to the new media have some issues with the lack of control over the flow of information.  There is a lot of fear concerning the unknown.  I can sympathize with that, but I\u2019m also concerned that there are so many educators that hide behind the curtain of ignorance in the name of such fear.  Healthy concern is prudent and it does help mitigate recklessness and poor judgment.  However we are engaging in a massive act of educational malpractice if we fail to become educated in the new learning mediums afforded to us through technology.  We need to know these tools and leverage them in order to better educate others. \n I have a blog.  I have a Youtube channel.  I have a Teachertube channel.  I also have a podcasting channel.  I have the power to broadcast my views and to editorialize as I please to pretty much anyone in the world.  And I do that quite a lot more than many people would like.  However, I also have the tools to extend my voice, my views and my knowledge beyond the walls of my classroom.  I can teach  beyond the boundaries of the school district\u2019s control and supervision.  And that could be a very scary thing to someone who is fixed on trying to manage the outflow of information. \n This brings up a lot of important issues that have never come up before.  How much of what I say is protected speech under the 1 st  amendment of our constitution?   How much of it is protected under civil rights legislation?  After all, much of what I\u2019m trying to do falls under the category of advocating for students with disabilities and those who care for them.  How much political speech am I allowed?  \n How should a school district respond to someone who is an employee and also a parent who is acting in both roles as well as a role of a non-sanctioned  reporter of sorts?  This is a really sticky situation because every teacher (and student!) has the opportunity and technological ability to become his or her own media outlet. \n I could do what a lot of other teachers do (and what I started out doing) which is blog anonymously.  Of course the risk is then that they would be found out.  My choice now is to be as open and transparent as possible in order avoid the risk of being accused of blindsiding my administration within the district.  My blog address has been part of my email signature file (and has probably been mostly ignored up until this point) since the beginning of school.  I have been very open about it without being obnoxiously promotional. \n My thought is that the school district has more control over me, as an employee, than they would have over me as simply an educated parent.  With things being out in the open, I have a vested interest in not rocking the boat too much.  I\u2019ve always known that administrators could be reading me and just assumed that they probably were.  In my profile, I clearly say that my views do not represent those of my employer and probably need to display that more prominently. \n I also knew that there were people within the GA DOE who were following my blog.  When I began there were very few special education blogs, and not a lot of educational blogs originating from Georgia.  It really got obvious when I saw training materials that used pseudonyms that had been lifted directly from some of the ones I used here during my anonymous blogging days.  Hey, I\u2019m glad I was inspiring someone there! \n I was also being read by people in the U.S. Senate.  Yep.  I even had a staffer from one VERY prominent U.S. Senator (who is not from Georgia) email me asking for some input on some pending special education/disability legislation. I begged off (politely) because I wanted to stay anonymous.   It was that email (and a few others) that made me eventually decide to stop being anonymous because while it afforded me a lot of freedom and safety it also limited me as far as being effective in truly helping others and making a difference.  I had to come out and be me instead of a pretend and imaginary person.  And I had to risk facing the music within my own community and school.  I had to step up and take responsibility for what I was writing and producing. \n Plus I wanted to produce more content that would make a bigger impact.  Which brings back to the video project.  That project had truly given me a new lease on my teaching life.  I was really approaching a state of burn out as a SID/PID teacher.   That project gave me new purpose and new meaning.  It was a marriage of my teaching background and expertise along with my technological knowledge along with my desire to get involved with the new media.  I got excited.  One of the first things I did was I wrote to the creators of Teachertube and asked them to establish a separate channel for special education.  And that is exactly what they did.  Since the day it started, I have been in the top 5 contributors of that channel. \n I saw adding content that showed actual students as a logical step in the progression of informing and educating outside of my classroom.  I even gave my evaluator copies of videos that I had shot in the closing days of the year so she could see me actually teach academic content instead of just watching me work with kids eating at lunch.  I shared what I was doing with my special ed director and with some of the folks in the technology department.  It is that enthusiasm that has carried me through a lot of the various issues of this year.  I was seeing something good happen. \n I\u2019ve been too busy to post or shoot much video but I always intended on getting back to it once I got the time.  However, I did not get permission from the parents for this year so I hadn\u2019t planned on shooting any new video with students.  Now the school district is in the midst of wrestling with what to do  about blogs and videos.  I removed the videos that contained any student images in the interest of not increasing the level of anxiety any more than already exists.  It was tough dropping out of that top 5 spot on Teachertube. \n I do intend on producing more content and posting it there eventually but it will be of a much safer nature. If other people want to get on board, they are more than welcome!   I\u2019m trying to participate in a larger community of learning, and I\u2019m not particularly interested in getting into some sort of political turf war.  Neither am I interested in the paranoid superstitions of people who don\u2019t understand 21 st  century learning.  I\u2019m just a guy who likes to teach using the tools of technology. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://specialed.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/ttpermission.pdf"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/02/11/the-video-project/", "title": "The Video Project"},
{"date": "2009/10/02", "body": "This just came up on my radar,  and I thought I would check it out. \n Before I even get into anything about  the report itself , I do want to mention that actually getting a copy of the report involves submitting your name, email and state.  I looked for any privacy notices regarding this information, but didn\u2019t see any.  So before even reading it, I resolved that I was going to mention this hoop that everyone must jump through.  I think it is needless and detrimental to the stated primary mission of the organization which is to help professionals and families of individuals with autism.  If you\u2019re going to release the report to the public, then release it.  If you\u2019re going to harvest information from people who want to see the information, then be explicit about that. \n Having said that, I went ahead and submitted my information, trusting that I wouldn\u2019t be spammed into oblivion.  I then download all 3 of the options and began reading. For those of us who have actually read scientific studies and literature on the subject of autism, the results are not too surprising.  It is long overdue, where an scientifically authoritative group came out and said what needed to be said about various treatments for autism.  So it is no surprise to me that almost all of the 11 established treatments are behavioral in nature, simply because behavioral treatments lend themselves particularly well to the rigors of scientific study. \n \n The 11 Established Treatments are: Antecedent \n Package; Behavioral Package; Comprehensive \n Behavioral Treatment for Young Children; Joint \n Attention Intervention; Modeling; Naturalistic \n Teaching Strategies; Peer Training Package; Pivotal \n Response Treatment; Schedules; Self-management; \n and Story-based Intervention Package. \n The most interesting findings, for me, were the 5 \u201cunestablished treatments\u201d for which there was no sound or effective evidence of efficacy. \n 1. Academic intervetions \n 2. Auditory integration training \n 3. Facilitated communication \n 4. Gluten free- casein free diet \n 5. Sensory intergrative package \n While the report did not identify any of the interventions as ineffective or harmful, they stopped just short of calling the GFCF diet harmful, and cited studies where the results show potentially harmful side-effects. \n About 22 treatments were in the \u201cEmerging Treament\u201d category, which suggests that there is some evidence that suggest benefit, but these lack sufficient evidence to meet the  level of being established. \n   \n The following treatments have been identified as falling into the Emerging \n level of evidence: \n \n \u25d6  Augmentative and Alternative Communication Device {14 studies} \n \u25d6  Cognitive Behavioral Intervention Package {3 studies} \n \u25d6  Developmental Relationship-based Treatment {7 studies} \n \u25d6  Exercise {4 studies} \n \u25d6  Exposure Package {4 studies} \n \u25d6  Imitation-based Interaction {6 studies} \n \u25d6  Initiation Training {7 studies} \n \u25d6  Language Training (Production) {13 studies} \n \u25d6  Language Training (Production & Understanding) {7 studies} \n \u25d6  Massage/Touch Therapy {2 studies} \n \u25d6  Multi-component Package {10 studies} \n \u25d6  Music Therapy {6 studies} \n \u25d6  Peer-mediated Instructional Arrangement {11 studies} \n \u25d6  Picture Exchange Communication System {13 studies} \n \u25d6  Reductive Package {33 studies} \n \u25d6  Scripting {6 studies} \n \u25d6  Sign Instruction {11 studies} \n \u25d6  Social Communication Intervention {5 studies} \n \u25d6  Social Skills Package {16 studies} \n \u25d6  Structured Teaching {4 studies} \n \u25d6  Technology-based Treatment {19 studies} \n \u25d6  Theory of Mind Training {4 studies} \n \n \n I do recommend looking at the site and reading the full report before taking any actions.  As teachers, we really should be familiar with this research and be prepared to discuss it with parents.  I imagine that quite a few parents might find fault with this report, especially when it comes to the GFCF diet.  Also, there is no mention of chelation, hippotherapy, secretin, glowing crystals, shamans, voodoo, vitamin B12, megavitamins, biomedical extracts or other assorted suppliments and interventions.  Parents are going to do what parents are going to do, whatever the scientific community says, regardless.  But at least this update offers a degree of hope for those parents who are just entering the autism spectrum world.  Until this report came out, there were NO treatments that were judged established or even efficacious.  So the prognosis for today\u2019s children is much better today than it was a decade ago when I became a parent.

{"date": "2009/10/25", "body": "This is going to sound awfully whiny, and there might be some SID/PID teachers who have more of a reason to complain than I do. But I don\u2019t think any are in my county. I feel swamped. I think I have always felt swamped in some fashion or form but this year it hit particularly hard with 3 new students and 2 new paras. Nine SID/PID students is simply too many for this level of disability. I\u2019m trying to keep track of 9 diets, 9 medical conditions, 9 bathroom schedules (gotta keep track of when everyone has a BM!) 9 parents, 9 IEPS, 9 academic programs across all subjects and all 4 grade levels. While all my paras have talents in their own way, they are not charged with keeping track of everyone all at the same time. Sure, that\u2019s why I get paid the big bucks, but where is the limit? I am totally crashing up against it. I forget stuff like jackets, snacks, medications, and a variety of other little niggling things. I used to like talking to parents and related service providers, but I find I have less time and patience for the various nitpicking requests. \u201cCan you brush his teeth?\u201d \u201cCan you make sure her shirt is tucked in?\u201d \u201cCan we make sure he uses his communication device at lunch?\u201d \u201cCan you make sure he stays on the GFCF diet in the school cafeteria?\u201d \u201cCan you make sure he uses his picture schedule?\u201d If I had a sane class size, these would be just part of the job and everyone would get the special treatment we\u2019re supposed to give him or her. I felt full at 7 students but we were able to do some cool things. This year, it feels more like just survival, and not sustainable. I do have to give credit in that several other teachers and paras have chipped in and helped when they could. My parents have generally been supportive. My paras are generally competent. The thing is, is that I feel like we are past the point where adding more paras will do us any good. Adding another adult helper is simply one more person that I have to keep track of and manage all day long. Some may hate me saying this, but we are a school/nursing home hybrid. We do what they do in a nursing home plus I have to do what 4-5 other teachers do, albeit on a different and much abbreviated level. The shift to the regular academic curriculum on top of the daily living skills curriculum adds a level of incredulity to a mission that was already seen as bordering on futility. Most of the real stakeholders know all of this already. I\u2019ve voiced a lot of concerns to those in positions to help and ease our plight, but they are not listening or at least they are not responding. Either they are unwilling or unable to do anything. And since some students were allowed to jump across the zone into my class where another parent was not allowed to go to a different zone to in order to escape my overcrowding. So indicators are pretty much pointing to some sort of willful hostility or  ignorance   at the county system level .  The core problem is that each of my students have so many pressing needs, some which need to be met in order to maintain their health and their lives! I feel personally responsible for each and every one of them, and don\u2019t have it in me to say \u201cToo bad\u201d and not try my best. I\u2019ve known many teachers who were willing to simply let things slide or simply do the bare minimum or less. This particular position sometimes attracts those characters. But I can\u2019t do that, as I am blessed and cursed with a moral conscience that does not allow it. So every time I fail to meet a given need, or forget something or don\u2019t get to something, it is seen as a demoralizing failure on my part. I don\u2019t think my standards are too high, but with this many kids, the toll has been substantial. In the grand scheme of things, forgetting to send a jacket home or keep up with who had a BM when is comparatively minor, but this sort of thing has been happening more and more this year. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. But I\u2019m trying to noodle it out and basically chalk it up to the fact that I am trying to do the best that I can under the present circumstances. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a perfectionist, but I do have high standards for myself. I expect mistakes and expect to learn from them. Is feeling down about neglecting some of my students perfectionism? I think that is what it is; I feel like all of my students suffer from neglect at least at some point during the day. I can not sit all of them around a table and have them physically within arms reach. When they are being positioned and changed, those not needing positioning are hanging loose. When teaching those who are less disabled, I can barely include those who are more involved because  they all  need intense instruction! Horace\u2019s Compromise (or at least the dilemma described therein) has officially arrived in my classroom.

{"date": "2009/10/03", "body": "My goal is to finish my entire GAA before Christmas. It\u2019s a lofty goal, but it is totally possible. In order to have any realistic shot at it, though, I need to have all of collection #1 finished before the end of this month. So how am I doing? I\u2019m over half finished, but I\u2019m being reminded as to why it is a serious mistake to wait on data collection for these things.  Murphy  likes to set up camp right in the middle of one\u2019s plans. The more urgent, the more likely things will go wrong. In this case, it happens to be the flu. The same thing happened last year with one of my students. He missed more school while I was working on GAA activities than in the previous 2 years combined! And so it is this year as I have a student who has been out a couple of weeks due to the flu. Plus we had a flood day, and who knows what other natural disasters, delays and issues will crop up? This is why a body has to ruthlessly hack, chop, fight and claw through this process with as much speed and efficiency as practical. Stuff happens, and the longer things are put off, the more stress that will visit later. I\u2019ve written my basic outline on a planning sheet, and am busy checking off as I go. The lesson plans feed into the GAA tasks and follow the outline I\u2019ve mapped out. Next month, while waiting for the 3 week lag to pass before laying into collection #2, I\u2019ll do some alternative activities that also fit the GAA plan. so in a sense, I\u2019ll have a parallel portfolio of other tasks to use in the future, if necessary. With my present numbers and the severity of my students, it is difficult to do anything outside of a couple of tasks per day. Every student needs changing, every one needs feeding and most of them need to be positioned/repositioned throughout the day. Plus I have 2 new paras to train and an old para who came back after it took 8 years to get rid of her. So it is a major challenge just to keep the fires out. So when it comes to nailing down a given GAA task, it is best to plan on doing the same task multiple times. It\u2019s unlikely that all students will be there for a single take, and it is also unlikely that you\u2019ll get a decent or usable collection on the very first trial. so I generally schedule 2-3 tasks over 2-3 days in order to have multiple opportunities to get it. I\u2019m also an opportunist when it comes to grabbing data and using resources. This is another reason to get all over a basic collection. Sometimes, something better comes along and you have a chance to jump on it. For instance, I was doing some listening/speaking/viewing activities with the Gotalk with a student, when the SLP came in. I quickly got her to work with my GAA students on the required task, and got pictures and data to go along with it. Things just clicked into place. I like to get a variety of people involved, including OT\u2019s, APE teachers, and other therapists. The idea is to incorporate a lot of diversity into the mix so there are several options and pieces of evidence to choose from. It also looks good on the final product, because it illustrates that this isn\u2019t just a one-time deal and reflects superior teaching practices. If you are all stressed about just getting the thing done, you may miss these opportunities because of sheer stress. What the knobs who are pushing for \u201caccountability\u201d fail to see is that no one performs at their best if they are overly stressed. This assessment is not assessing students, it is assessing teachers. So get it it done quickly and then keep improving it as time passes. With increased revisions, it does get better, but you can not revise and improve what you have not already finished! I find that having a time line and calendar helps. It keeps me focused on daily goals and tasks rather than being overwhelmed by this big, huge thing hanging over me. It\u2019s easier to make progress when it isn\u2019t looming so large. That being said,  it   is   looming large! And having a student absent fir a long period of time does derail my little calendar. At first, I wanted to hold everyone up, so we could all move through together. But I couldn\u2019t wait forever, so I tried to do some of the easier tasks that were most differentiated across participants, which for me is the ELA speaking/listening tasks. Science and social studies seem to lend themselves to more group work, but I\u2019m not waiting anymore. We\u2019re going to go ahead and plant our plants and move on. And remember as Murphy is fond of saying: As bad as things may seem at the moment, they can always get worse, and they probably will.\u00a0 So you might as well enjoy the moment! \n Hopefully, the rest of you teachers are progressing along!

{"date": "2009/10/25", "body": "One of the most common questions I am asked is \u201cHow do you grade the students you teach?\u201d I mean, they don\u2019t do any paper and pencil activities, they don\u2019t produce anything and there are no permanent products. At the high school, every other student is producing something in the way of writing or projects or test scores. Oh\u2026TEST SCORES which have become the gold standard in this country! Don\u2019t get me started\u2026 I do progress reports and have some sort of program data on most of my students, except for the very lowest ones, especially since discrete trial lends itself to accumulating data. But it does not translate well into the sort of letter/percentage grade that schools make teachers give high school students. A student may not be doing a single task independently during any trials and in any setting this would be viewed as a total failure. In my classroom, I look at level of support, and usually we have a mixture of trials requiring verbal, gesture, partial physical or full physical prompts. I suppose I could assign a score to each part of the prompting hierarchy and arrive at a more empirical figure. But when it comes to high school academic standards, no figure I could come up with would have any sort of validity. None. So when I do the report card, I take a wild guess according to effort, progress, and where we are in relation to goals. And most parents don\u2019t have a problem with their teachers doing this as long as that grade is an \u2018A\u2019 or a \u2018B\u2019. As long as their child is making honor roll, they aren\u2019t going to complain. However I have over the years raised the ire of more than a couple of parents when they come from the middle school. For their entire school career of getting letter/percentage grades, they have been getting mostly 90\u2019s the entire way through. Other teachers I have taught beside did exactly this, giving every student a 95 or 96. This is one of those  Horace\u2019s Compromise   things, where there is a tacit agreement that \u201cgood enough is good enough\u201d and we demand and deliver as little as possible. For other students, it is mostly between student and teacher: You deliver the minimum amount required to meet certain expectations, and you are rewarded accord to meeting the minimal criteria. If you want an \u2018A\u2019 you know the minimal performance required to get there. For students with severe disabilities, it is between teacher and parent: \u201cGive my child an \u2018A\u2019 and I won\u2019t ask for any justification.\u201d So in a sense, I am severely disrupting that tacit little agreement when a student comes home with a 78 or a \u2018C\u2019. Now we have a problem. The problem that I have is this: does a child who is uncooperative, disruptive, belligerent, violent, and otherwise assaulting themselves or other people legitimately belong on the honor roll? And what if, even in simple discrete trial tasks they are uncooperative? I\u2019m not going to fail anyone on account of their disability, but neither can I justify elevating that into \u201chonor\u201d status. And it\u2019s not like any of my parents are gong to take advantage of their child\u2019s exam exemption to keep them at home! So here\u2019s, generally, how I arrive at a grade: A = 90-100 \u2013 The student is totally trying and is making progress. It\u2019s a bit relative, and with 9 kids, I have a sample size that allows me to judge who is the best and who is not. I might have given 1 \u2018A\u2019 this marking period. By the end of the year, I will have more. It means the student is making real attempts at completing things independently. B = 80-89 \u2013 Most of my students are working in this area, which means that we still have some problems that we\u2019re working on, but we\u2019re still making some progress. I leave room to show improvement, so during the 1 st   marking period all grades are lower. I\u2019m looking at the data and how much prompting and support is needed.  C = 70-79 \u2013 Here, we have many issues that we need to address, and many students will start here, especially if they come from summer break wild and off the chain. I have to work twice as hard to get them into the routine as the \u2018B\u2019 group. Freshman typically seem to end up here, as they are well below their classmates. Remember, this is ongoing. A student can totally move up by Christmas and still get their B and make semester honor roll if everything is going like it should be. But if a student is physically capable of pushing a button or pointing to a card and refuses or throws the material, we have some issues to work on. You should not be on the honor roll if you are refusing to do things independently when it is well within your capability. It represents a significant gap between potential and actual achievement. A person can\u2019t give what they don\u2019t have, and I take that into account. But if you\u2019re slacking, do not expect a break. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019. In our school, there are no \u2018D\u2019s and I\u2019ve never given one anyway. Yeah, we ALL need improvement and my kids don\u2019t need to be labeled as \u201cpoor\u201d. The \u2018C\u2019 smacks over achiever parents hard enough as it is! Failure is not an option here. And it wouldn\u2019t make any difference, anyway. If the kid is on the honor roll for 4 years, they will still stay 3 more. If they fail, they still come back. Conventional \u201cpromotion\u201d doesn\u2019t really exist compared to typical peers. However, I have promoted kids to the Moderate class, but that was mostly because they were misplaced in the first place. In a sense, my grades are a reflection of what we do at school, but it can also be a reflection of what is going on at home, which is probably what alarms so many parents. In a typical, nondisabled classroom, we know that parents have a lot to do with how their kids do in school by providing guidance, structure and motivation. many students will not do any homework, unless a parent insists and prods and cajoles and bribes or whatever it is they have to do. Trust me, I know how much of an ordeal this is! Homework should be something students can do on their own with a minimum of assistance. For my students, it is a bit different, because they don\u2019t have any homework that a student could do at home independently. I suppose I could do what many of the teachers of my two boys do and assign projects that demand parent involvement, like large intricate craft projects. Then I\u2019d have something to grade! But then I suspect I\u2019d get even more grief when I gave a lower grade than expected! However, parents do have a lot to do with encouraging their children to do things independently, like feeding themselves or playing with toys or pulling up their pants. I see this more with feeding that anything else, as I\u2019ve had occasion to socialize with other parents who have children with disabilities. I\u2019ve irked more than one parent when at one of these events I got on top of them for spoon feeding a child who I knew was capable of feeding himself. Here you demand that we put this as a goal on the \nIEP and work on it at school, and you are not doing this at home! Don\u2019t demand a goal on tooth brushing on the IEP if you are not going to do it home. So I have students who come to me and have no physical reason why they can not perform a given task. It\u2019s not necessarily the student\u2019s fault, but it reflects some ground that we will have to cover that should have been done previously. No honor roll grades, there. But that doesn\u2019t mean that will always be the case, and hopefully we\u2019ll get to the point we should have started. Assessment for this population isn\u2019t a matter of simply taking a test. You can\u2019t just give them a pencil and paper and say \u201cHere do this worksheet, answer these questions.\u201d NONE of them are even verbal, so a verbal assessment is out. Most have limited mobility and serious motor issues, so manipulative assessment is out. And I\u2019m not going to say a lot about a severely truncated attention span or limited perseverance. That\u2019s not to say we can\u2019t measure progress, but it translates very poorly into a report card A-B-C-F format. So I send home daily notes to parents in their notebooks. They are informed  every day   not just during quarterly report card periods. I\u2019m more transparent than any other teacher in the building and possibly in the entire county! I have a blog! I have a video channel!  Grading is  never   a precise science, as there is a bit of an art to it. Most teachers of students with severe disabilities do neither, and just give the kid an \u2018A\u2019 whether it is earned or not. And that is fine for them, as long as we all agree that the grades on the report card don\u2019t mean anything unless they open up Harvard to students with IQ\u2019s in the single digits. But I\u2019m trying to communicate at least a little bit with the hideous system that I\u2019m forced to use, and convey some degree of meaning to something that isn\u2019t terribly meaningful in the first place.  As a parent, when we went through school, grades were also used as a motivational tool. Study and work hard, get good grades and get rewards and honors and a good job. None of that motivational stuff applies to this population . Even if they comprehended the difference, quantitatively, between 78% and 98%, or an \u2018A\u2019 and a \u2018B\u2019 , why would they care? This actually applies almost universally  to all students with disabilities.  The graduation rate in my high school for students with disabilities is 30%. The employment rate for students with disabilities in my county is about 10%, with most of those being part-time or less. Which means that over 90% of students with disabilities emerge from high school with few quality prospects. Those in the population that I teach are not even at that level, and have a waiting list waiting for them when they leave my program. So in the grandest scheme of things those 1 st   quarter grades are not terribly relevant. I want to say one more thing about grades, and this goes to everyone regardless of whether the student has a disability and cuts across grade levels and even that first college midterm. Mainly, that those first marking period grades should be intentionally more stringent than any others. That means that a student (and the parents) should expect the grades to be lower than \u201ctypical\u201d for that child. This represents the first period of a new grade level/year with newer and higher expectations. If the student is already exceeding the standards in all areas, what is the use of continuing to go? Many students, when grades are a motivational, will go into \u201cearly retirement\u201d if they think they have already got it in their back pocket. It also doesn\u2019t give any indication of relative strengths in weaknesses especially when using marks like our elementary schools i.e. C,S,U,N or 1,2,3 or faces or stars. As teachers, we need to allow for room for growth. So as parents, we need to take a relative view of the marks coming out after the first marking period and not be too judgmental toward the the student or his/her teacher and those marks. It\u2019s merely a guidepost and a relative indicator of where that student is at a given time.

{"date": "2009/11/09", "body": "I always intended this blog to be mostly informative and supportive for parents and other teachers that do what I do.\u00a0 In the earliest days, it was also a place to vent my spleen mostly about NCLB and the GAA.\u00a0 Those things are still vent worthy and I\u2019m overdue for a vent.\u00a0 But today I\u2019m throwing up yet another lament. The \u201cWhining\u201d\u2018 post resonated with many readers, probably because there is an epidemic of this sort of pain running through the field.\u00a0 To be honest, I hated that post, which is why I tried to bury it immediately behind a more informative (and longer) post.\u00a0 But I needed to write it and needed to post it.\u00a0 Just this one needs to be written and posted. Perhaps I have a \u201cfan\u201d at the central office or in administration who read my post and decided that perhaps I needed to have something to  really  whine about.\u00a0 Perhaps the Almighty, in His great wisdom is making sure I don\u2019t miss the signs.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been known to be a bit slow on the uptake.\u00a0 Before relating the present woes, indulge me in a story from my past\u2026 I was teaching science at a private boarding school in the early \u201990\u2019s, teaching science.\u00a0 I lived at the school, which was handy since I went over a year without a car.\u00a0 The hours were long, as we had duties at night and on some weekends in addition to teaching.\u00a0 And the pay was less than what paras make in public schools.\u00a0 But it was a good place to start out.\u00a0 But during my 3rd year, as I was working on my Master\u2019s I was deciding whether or not I should leave and look for something else.\u00a0 That summer, we had torrential rains which flooded the apartments where I was staying.\u00a0 Natural disaster, right?\u00a0 4 months later, in a totally different dorm, a pipe broke and the place flooded  again.  A few months later, lightening struck and destroyed a bunch of my electronics.\u00a0 It, along with deteriorating politics there, was a neon sing to me that read \u201cGET OUT!\u201d So now, I begin to tally the score for this year.\u00a0 Three years ago, I aksed to move into co-teaching.\u00a0 I was denied.\u00a0 Two years ago, I asked again, even taking and passing the science test to be certified and HQ so I could coteach.\u00a0 Again denied.\u00a0 Last year, I asked to transfer within the district.\u00a0 Denied AGAIN.\u00a0 Apparently I\u2019m meant to stay.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 As we began the year, one of my best paras was moved off and replaced against both of our wishes.\u00a0 That cost me as well as the students she bonded with.\u00a0 Then I was hit by the numbers while being understaffed, hence the \u201cwhining\u201d post. Today, I learned that there was a reduction in force, a RIF.\u00a0 Our school lost two para positions.\u00a0 Two paras were transferred to a middle school.\u00a0 And they took one of mine to replace one of those that were transferred.\u00a0 They picked one of my best, and put her in with less disabled kids and informed me I would be doing what I was struggling to do before with substantially less help.\u00a0 We are now an accident or an incident waiting to happen. Now I have to finish letters drafted a few months ago and at least document the peril we now face so whenever whatever happens, does, no one can say they were not warned.\u00a0 Meanwhile, me and my ever-decreasing brave band of paras will hunker down and attempt to hold an ever-expanding line.

{"date": "2009/11/15", "body": "I also, on occasion, teach adult Sunday school.  Last weekend I taught part 1 of 2 on 2 Chronicles 20.  I had no idea at that time how appropriate this lesson would become in the week ahead.  My brave band of paras and I bravely stand against a horde of responsibilities and insensitive bureaucrats and administrators who seem bent on crushing us. Well\u2026.maybe not so brave. For the past week, I have not even wanted to go to sleep, because I knew that as soon as I closed my eyes, I would awake to a new day of being crushed.  And so it was, as some of my paras were out for all sorts of reasons and I had substitutes who courageously tried to soldier on with me.  But by Friday, my back was positively aching from all the extra lifting. In 2 Chronicles 20, the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat, is threatened by not 1, not 2 but 3 separate armies who have joined together against him.  He gathered the people and  cried out : \u201cO Lord, God of our fathers, are you not God in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. In your hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand you. 7 Did you not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend? 8 And they have lived in it and have built for you in it a sanctuary for your name, saying, 9 \u2018If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before you\u2014for your name is in this house\u2014and cry out to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.\u2019 10 And now behold, the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and whom they avoided and did not destroy\u2014 11 behold, they reward us by coming to drive us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.  12 O our God, will you not execute judgment on them? For we are powerless against this great horde that is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you.\u201d That last verse totally resonated with me and where we are.  I was told not to send any letters to parents until they are approved.  Therefore I\u2019m giving up on that, although those letters do chronicle past and current problems.  No, I will call or talk to parents in person.  It\u2019s time for some  parent involvement .  Trouble is, the school doesn\u2019t  really  like such involvement.  But outside of that, I must not fret, worry and sweat it.  I was told that nothing would change unless something bad happens.  But it\u2019s my job to ensure that nothing does happen.   And we will hold the line.  Fortunately, Jehoshaphat was not left dangling and neither are we, for a the spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel: 15 And he said, \u201cListen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: Thus says the Lord to you, \u2018Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed at this great horde, for the battle is not yours but God\u2019s. 16 Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, east of the wilderness of Jeruel. 17 You will not need to fight in this battle. Stand firm, hold your position, and see the salvation of the Lord on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.\u2019 Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed.  Tomorrow go out against them, and the Lord will be with you.\u201d And so it turns out that not a shot was fired from Judah in anger.  The invading armies turned on each other and wiped themselves out!  It took 3 days for the people of Judah to carry the plunder from the enemy camps. So tomorrow, I\u2019m going to face the horde and trust that God is with us.

{"date": "2009/11/16", "body": "One good piece of news is that I think I have GAA collection #1 finished! WooHoo! Or at least that\u2019s what I think. Now I have to compile it and organize it and get it all onto a recognizable portfolio from the formless mass of files and pictures I currently have. That will take a lot of work, and I may have to go back and pick up a couple of things, but other than a few pick-ups, I feel like I got it. I actually had to totally redo the science from the planned experiment since the early freeze and heavy rains killed most of the plants I had going. Another advantage of pushing strong early is that I had (and still have) options for revision and improvement without crashing the deadline. This is good, because I have a few other deadlines that will get me. A couple weeks ago, our dept. head sent out an email asking if anyone would want to host a student teacher. One would think I might jump all over that, and just a year or two earlier I would have. But many of the feelings that generated the earlier whine posts have dampened my enthusiasm for bringing someone new into the business. I\u2019ve worked with a few paras and other people who are somewhere in the pipeline toward becoming a special educator, but my recent state of mind has put a dark cloud over whatever recruitment efforts I might engage in. In years past, the hope was to bring other competent and passionate people in, in order to raise the bar of professionalism and minimize the sort of shock many new SID/PID teachers encounter when they are hired off the street from another field or with NO teaching experience. They have no idea what to do with these students. Recruitment got more serious as I was wanting to move on and find a replacement so that I could. Then despair set in as I realized there was no replacement and that those who make such decisions have never had any intentions of letting me teach anything else, anywhere else, no matter what I did. So the idea of infecting someone brand new with that sort of cynicism wouldn\u2019t be my first choice. Plus, what are the odds that someone who was student teaching would even  want  to be in this setting with these students? Last job fair I attended, I informally polled the job applicants who were standing in my vicinity. Guess how many had any interest at all in SID/PID at the high school level? How about NONE \u2013 Zero. In fact, several were trying to escape self-contained settings. So imagine my shock and awe when I learned that the student teacher was  very  interested in this population! And so, she\u2019ll be spending most of here time here with us. I\u2019m not going to blog her, but I immediately think of  Ms. Ris , who often blogs about mentoring student teachers. I can not even remember the last time I encountered a special education student teacher as they are often hired first, before they even finish a master\u2019s program. That\u2019s essentially what happened to me almost 20 years ago. What I will blog, tho, is that having someone new in the room can have collateral effects all around. For my part, it does give me more of a purpose in life beyond my own fuzzy, murky, smokey uncertain future. Here\u2019s someone interesting in learning the craft, and I find I do have a thing or two to teach. And the act of passing it on also helps me reflect and learn myself. A body naturally processes and thinks more about the content when they are teaching it, and in this case the content is  teaching!  This blog provides a great deal of reflective space for me, but this is a different level. Even my video channel was an effort to pass my ideas and knowledge on. I think it is just part of every teacher\u2019s DNA to want to pass on what they know. But it isn\u2019t just me. The paras also can feel that sense, because they also have a chance to share what they know. And it goes without saying that I could never do what I do without them. So there\u2019s this  building  dynamic going on, which puts us less at a defensive posture and back on the initiative. And that is exactly where we needed to be after being swamped and feeling overwhelmed by circumstances beyond our control while it seemed no one was hearing us or cared. In the final analysis, it\u2019s the students who ultimately benefit from the newer and more positive energy. Part of the reason for the earlier posts was to just get some stuff off of me and out into the air as well as just process it and noodle it out. Plus I know several other folks who could relate. In the interest of fairness, I also need to mention a couple of gains this year that some folks have kindly pointed out to me: \u2013 The paras and I have a duty-free lunch for the first time in 10 years.\u00a0 That is a big miracle.\u00a0 Of course, stuff still happens with the kids I teach, but it is still a milestone, similar to the planning period that I acquired a few years ago.\u00a0 Speaking of which\u2026. \u2013 I do have a planning period.\u00a0 It is only fair to mention it so it doesn\u2019t sound like I\u2019m totally trapped all day long.\u00a0 Just most of the day;-)\u00a0 Lunch time isn\u2019t the most convenient time, and I do help get the kids through the line and help all those involved in the feeding. \u2013 Other helpers are around.\u00a0 Other teachers and paras have pitched in and supported us through some of the toughest and stickiest times.\u00a0 Feeding time is HUGE and a lot of other teachers and paras outside of my own private little band are involved in this effort. As far as the battle for trying to get more help in the form of another para or another teacher in the room, it is pretty much over.\u00a0 No relief is coming in the foreseeable future, so it\u2019s time to move off of that.\u00a0 Generally, when I fight I try to make my first blow the strongest and most direct possible.\u00a0 I am not a fan of long protracted struggles especially when I am on the losing end.\u00a0 So I do what I can with whatever resources I have remaining instead of wasting time and effort battling a brick wall.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to need all the energy I have to do what needs to be done. And I\u2019m going to have to dig deeper than ever before.\u00a0 So perhaps now is a good time to channel a couple of my favorite movie scenes: I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolfes and shattered shields, when the age of men comes crushing down! But it is not this day! THIS DAY WE FIGHT!

{"date": "2009/11/23", "body": "One of the reasons for my frustration, is that I am forever looking to advance my students along.\u00a0 The current economic and political realities seem bent on thwarting those efforts, and I suspect every teacher feels this way.\u00a0 We want to keep moving forward, but get bogged down by forces beyond our control. But we still do it and we succeed in spite of public policies, like NCLB.\u00a0 And so it is, I\u2019m blogging the student teacher I said I wouldn\u2019t blog about.\u00a0 Well, this is noteworthy and deserves to be published and promoted! I have several students who have profound intellectual disabilities, meaning they rely almost totally on caregivers to meet their needs.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the reasons why the adult:student ratio is so critical.\u00a0 If there isn\u2019t an adult around to meet a need, it is not going to be met.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 However, any move in the direction of independence is a monumental one, considering that these students are all in high school.\u00a0 If they have not learned something by now, it isn\u2019t likely they will, especially since the adult/student ratio is cut in half as soon as they exit middle school. But having a capable and motivated adult can really help move things along.\u00a0 In this case, the student teacher has been working with one of my students who has PID as well as being mostly physically disabled. She has to be fed, like most of my students.\u00a0 She can move her hands and arms, but just doesn\u2019t very much.\u00a0 Until now.\u00a0 We started off teaching communication skills, geting her to push a Big Mac switch in order to say \u201cmore\u201d meaning she wanted more food.\u00a0 She quickly caught on to this, as eating is highly reinforcing to her. However, this student did not stop there.\u00a0 At some point the food wasn\u2019t coming fast enough so she grabbed the teacher\u2019s hand and brought it up to her mouth.\u00a0 This was HUGE!\u00a0 We hadn\u2019t seen this before, but then we never had time to look.\u00a0 Feeding time is something we generally do as quick as we can to get it over with, like any other task we have to do.\u00a0 However, we made a break through, past the communication exercise.\u00a0 I showed the student teacher how to hold the spoon and help facilitate more engagement and learning in the feeding and within a couple fo days, the girl was beginning to feed herself.\u00a0 It is still a very sloppy process, but we are off and running! It\u2019s been awhile since we had a breakthrough like that in our room.\u00a0 It looks downright miraculous.\u00a0 It\u2019s mostly good teaching involving consistency and persistence.\u00a0 And it is also a good shot in the arm for all of us, morale-wise.\u00a0 It will be interesting to see if we can sustain it over the course of the year, even after this student teacher leaves. Here\u2019s the thing: This is a gigantic leap forward for this one student.\u00a0 Feeding herself with the spoon.\u00a0 It is monumental, significant and practical.\u00a0 But it is not even a blip on the NCLB radar screen.\u00a0 It carries NO weight to anyone outside of this girl\u2019s life.\u00a0 It does not improve a test score, does not improve the graduation rate or any other measure devised to measure \u201caccountability.\u201d\u00a0 It is not something I could use to become one of  Georgia\u2019s Master Teachers .\u00a0 The resounding message from the outside is that what we do doesn\u2019t matter, when in reality, what we do  totally  matters! But I have no idea how on earth to convey that to the people who make decisions about our staffing.\u00a0 Those folks never darken my door and they miss these miraculous victories.\u00a0 Having key people in the key spots matters, but I don\u2019t get to choose who is in my room with my kids.\u00a0 Sometimes I am very fortunate.\u00a0 Sometimes, less so. Anyway, I simply had to blog it and make whatever political hay I can out of it.\u00a0 Unfortunately, these things do not happen every day and few times do they happen in such short amounts of time.\u00a0 It\u2019s also good for a new teacher to get this boost very early in her career as\u00a0 those are the memories that sustain us over the longer and leaner times.

{"date": "2009/07/06", "body": "For the first month of summer, I was reading and learning and generally focused on my teacher-self.  But for July, it\u2019s about being the Dad.  I mean, I never stop being a parent, but I\u2019m simply blogging it more now.  And I recently  got an email from someone who is doing some similar things as Jane and I, and wondering if it\u2019s the right thing.  So let\u2019s see if I can set her (and your) mind at ease. My experience is that among all the best things to do with someone who has autism, is to travel.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever had a kid with ASD who didn\u2019t ride well in a car or bus.  Once you get to where you are going, it might be a different story altogather, but generally my experience is that they like to ride.  I spent many, many a long night when Thomas was a baby just riding him in the car until he fell asleep.  He has always liked to ride.  I have kids that I teach who will raise a huge fuss until we get on the bus to go somewhere.  Kids that will do nothing else, but when they see the bus, they are totally ready to go. As I said, once they get somewhere, it is a different story.  My son Thomas, like many with ASD, likes things to stay consistent and the same\u2026sort of.  He also likes a certain degree of novelty, which going for a ride symbolizes.  When he gets in the car, it means something new and exciting.  So where are some places to go? The park is a fairly easy choice, and has the virtue of being free.  Thomas loves the swings and will sometimes go on the slide and climb some the equipment.  He\u2019s also getting more social, so likes playing and running around with other kids.  Even tho it\u2019s with mostly younger kids, he generally has a good time. Movies are iffy.  The first movie we saw was  Finding Nemo  which went over fairly well, except it was so loud.  The next time we went to a theater, he refused to go into the place as it was so loud.  The following outing was  Polar Express  which he definitely liked and loves the DVD to this day.  So it\u2019s hit and miss on those and this brings up something important.  Just because something works once doesn\u2019t mean it will always work and just because something doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t later. Jane bought season tickets to the  Georgia Aquarium , the  Coke museum ,  the Zoo , the  High Museum  and  the Botanical Gardens .  I know that the first time he went to each of those places, Thomas had issues of some sort.  Sometimes he wasn\u2019t into it, sometimes he didn\u2019t pay attention and sometimes just  wanted to get the heck out of there.  But he eventually warmed up to all of these, and found things to like.  One thing that I think helped was that after the first exposure, he was given a choice.  He could go with his mother to one of these fun places or stay home with  his dad and do stuff at home or in the garden.  Most of the time he chooses to go with his mother. Restricted interests are one of the cardinal features of ASD, but over time and with persistence, those interests can be expanded.  I\u2019m blogging live from a hotel somewhere in Illinois, as Thomas and I are going up to visit my parents.  He is in for some new experiences, and he\u2019s off to fine start.  All the way up, he was pretty insistent that he wanted and cheeseburger and fries for dinner.  I offered and teased with other choices, but that is wat he wanted and what he was stuck on, tho.  I was fine with that, generally, as we  are  on vacation, afterall.  But next to our hotel there was a Chinese buffet.  I offered that as a choice and surprised me by accepting that as a good choice.  Suddenly he was feeling adventurous. His fist plate was noodles, onion rings and an eggroll I put on his plate.  His second plate he got even more adventurous with some dishes having sweet and sour sauce which he later described as \u201camazing!\u201d  It was a breakthrough of sorts.  He decided that trying new things was pretty neat.  So we\u2019ll see how the rest of the trip goes. Sometimes you never can tell what our kids will pick up or what they are attending to.  While Thomas often misses obvious things (like we don\u2019t barge in on people in the toilet stall at rest area bathrooms) he picks up on other things like the friendly waiter at the Chinese restaurant who wanted to help him learn how to use chopsticks. So what do you do if you\u2019re a parent who wants to enrich your child but he/she doesn\u2019t seem interested?  I say continue to introduce various novel experiences and then make subsequent visits something that is more optional.  After visiting several places of interest, offer choices.  You might be surprised when they choose something that they previously didn\u2019t have a lot of interest in.  And then be prepared for them to fix and glom onto new things that you never expected.  For Thomas, this happened when he went to the Georgia Aquarium and saw the Titanic exhibit.  At first he didn\u2019t really like it that much.  Then he liked it.  Then he  really  liked it.  Then he  really, really really  liked it, that is he got obsessed with everything Titanic.  He can tell you what time it went down, who the captain was, how many drowned and how many survived as well as the fate of the two sister ships.  And he continues to obsess on it.  You never can tell. The splinterizing of attention and skills is another cardinal characteristic of ASD that is both fascinating and frustrating.  It\u2019s basically an adventure for the rest of us who don\u2019t think or learn that way.

{"date": "2009/07/02", "body": "I\u2019ve been on summer break for about a month.  In less than a month, I\u2019ll be heading back.  I know that sounds crazy to you folks that just got out of school a week ago!  I\u2019m sure that in a decade or so, the feds will require all schools to run on the same calendar. So I\u2019m getting my mind wrapped around the idea of doing a 10th year with the SID/PID classroom.  Not an easy thing, and for several weeks, I was headlong into denial/escape mode.  Basically, I\u2019ve been doing quite a lot of reading this past month.  All of these books have been extensively reviewed, and they should be widely read.  Here they are, with my short take: Disrupting Class:How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns.   By Clayton Christensen Curtis Johnson and Mocheal B. Horn. Most of the books that I\u2019ve been reading make the case that our method of education is outmoded and outdated.  It has not essentially changed in 60-100 years.  But now technology is making change possible, but in order for real change to occur it\u2019s going to happen through the backdoor, which the authors describe as being deployed disruptively.  Most change happens in areas of nonconsumption or where existing programs or technologies are not getting to.  In education, that means drop-outs, or students that need to make up credit or have been kicked out of school or students who need courses not offered by their schools.  This is primarily looking at making online education more universally available which is happening as several states have  virtual schools, including Georgia .  The authors do a good job of describing a process that is already underway.  It\u2019s a wothwhile read, but I can see it becoming really dated in a few years as online education becomes more ubiquitous. The Global Achievement Gap   by  Tony Wagner  \u2013 In this book, the author describes how far behind U.S. schools are compared to other schools in the world, and how students are not being taught the skills they need in the modern world.  Basically, the current system isn\u2019t training kids for work, or for college or for basic U.S. citizenship.  After he get through describing the shortcomings of the best schools in the country, you begin to wonder, \u201cWhat are public schools even good for?\u201d  It is deeply disturbing in a lot of ways and gives a lot of food for thought.   According to Wagner, the skills needed are the seven suvival skills.  The seven survival skills are critical thinking and problem solving; collaboration across networks and leading by influence; agility and adaptability; initiative and entrepreneurship; effective oral and written communication; accessing and analyzing information; and curiosity and imagination.  Copies of this book are going to some influential people I know.  Two Million Minutes   by Bob Compton.  Okay, this isn\u2019t a book, it\u2019s a documentary.  Yes, I actually ordered the D VD after watching the  Youtube videos .  He made a documentary following 2 students from the U.S., India and China and compared their educational practices, attitudes and habits.  Like Tony Wagner, Compton points out that there are serious problems with U.S. education compared to just two of our biggest competitors.  While Compton\u2019s videos are disturbing they do not go into the source of our ills as much as Wagner\u2019s book.  While the DVD might be a worthwhile purchase for a school district, I think Compton\u2019s Youtube channel gets the message across handily enough for most individuals.  You could send it to your legislator! Why Don\u2019t Students Like School?  by  Daniel Willingham .  I\u2019m about half way through this book, and Willingham chops and cuts and slices and dices through a lot of cherished beliefs teachers have about learning styles and learning modalities.  As a cognative scientist, his specialty is learning and memory.  His basic premise is that 21st century skills like problem-solving and critical thinking are fine, but students actually need to have content to think about and background knowledge to draw from in solving problems.  Students don\u2019t like school, mostly because humans are designed and setup to  not think  or at least keep thinking to a minimum.  It takes a lot of work and effort to think, so teachers have to devise strategies to make thinking less burdensome and less painful.  Out of all the materials I\u2019ve looked at and read so far, Willingham\u2019s  book has the widest  application for teachers, parents and even students.  Unlike the above books/movies, Willingham\u2019s book does have relevance for the kids that I\u2019ll be teaching, no matter who they are or what age or grade level.  Basically, cognitive scientists have done a lot of research on how we remember things and how we go about applying the knowledge we learn.  So until I picked this book up, I was looking more at broader policies that will change how education is done, but this will influence how I look at teaching and learning on a day-to-day level.  I\u2019m already working on an online course that I might try to offer in the fall using this book, thus applying all of the concepts I\u2019ve been reading about.  Take a look at  his videos  for some quick learning.  His video on merit pay alone is worth the time. I also spent a considerable amount of time attending various webinars on the  Web 2.0  comunity.  These are good ways to get some knowledge without burning up a lot of time or having to travel.   Steve Hargodon  is into all sorts of nifty collaborative efforts, including the recently held  EduBloggercon .  My goal is to be able to make one of those one day.  I also want to get a video up to contribute to the  PBS Frontline project  they have going on.  And in it, I\u2019m going to document a conversation I had with a couple of administrators last fall about my educational videos. So the first part of my summer was devoted to a lot of thinking about education, technology and learning and most of it doesn\u2019t apply much to the job I\u2019m getting ready to mark a decade of doing.  But my mind is shifting a bit back.  Plus, my oldest son and I are gearing up for an adventure together traveling across several states together next week.  I might blog that a bit.  Once we get back from our trip, the preparations for school starts in earnest as I\u2019ll have less than 10 days before preplanning! Stay Cool!

{"date": "2009/07/15", "body": "We\u2019re returning to Georgia, Thomas and I, from our vacation with my folks.\u00a0 We had a real good time visiting with relatives, swimming, going to the county fair and visiting assorted local attractions in the area.\u00a0 We stayed busy and Thomas was happy, for the most part.\u00a0 Most of my relatives have gotten around to dealing with him on his own terms, and he made it very easy by being very good and well-behaved, meaning that he didn\u2019t get into too much trouble. But that was not always the case.\u00a0 When he was younger, he did have a penchant for getting into things.\u00a0 Christmas gatherings were always a chore, because he was forever getting into the tree, presents, decorations as well as all the other bric-a-brac that people have in their homes.\u00a0 We nearly gave up having a tree of our own.\u00a0 However, getting to the point we are at now involved a lot of work, firmness, diligence and consistency.\u00a0 And most of that was from Jane, although this is one area where I was involved in being more of a stone wall in standing firm and expecting good behavior. But there are things that will never change, no matter how well Thomas does.\u00a0 He is a curious person and will always have to be supervised to some extent.\u00a0 And parents can simply not rely on anyone else to do it as well.\u00a0 We\u2019re not just the first line, we\u2019re most often the  only  line.\u00a0 Other relatives often allow their kids to run amok and get into everything and they expect everyone else to watch their kids.\u00a0 Not so with Jane and I.\u00a0 That\u2019s not to say Thomas\u2019 grandparents wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t watch him, because they are all competent.\u00a0 1:1, Thomas is a very good child.\u00a0 But in a large gathering like a family reunion we have seen the wheels fall off, behaviorally.\u00a0 And this can often make large family gatherings very stressful. My preference is to keep the events very small, simple, intimate and low stress.\u00a0 Outdoor venues seem to work well for us, especially if there is sufficient space for Thomas to withdraw from the crowd and excitement if he has the need.\u00a0 If all else fails, I\u2019ll go ahead and take him out or somewhere to get away, even if it means just sitting in the car for a bit.\u00a0 The thing is that if he is experiencing stress, so am I.\u00a0 He likes being around people for the most part, but he does get overwhelmed sometimes.\u00a0 This is true of all of us at different times.\u00a0 Sometimes, as a parent I don\u2019t often have a chance to talk to people for very long if I\u2019m responsible for watching him because he will wander off and go his own way.\u00a0 I jus like to know where he\u2019s going in case he decides he might want to take a hike on the street! Thomas is always wary of meeting new people and don\u2019t always do well with a lot of hugging that happens when family member greet each other.\u00a0 But by the end of the week, he was fairly happy to give his grandma a hug which did help make her day.\u00a0 He got used to other family members and we had a lot good experiences which will make for some good memories. I\u2019m rambling a bit here, just thinking about the past week and all the neat things we did together.\u00a0 It was only at the end that he started to get somewhat homesick for his mom and brother, and was ready to go back home.\u00a0 Overall, it was great to get away with just the two of us.

{"date": "2009/07/22", "body": "Believe it or not, the start of school is just around the corner.\u00a0 We are scheduled to begin preplanning next week, but that may change in light of the  latest actions of our beloved governor .\u00a0 According to the link, we may be looking at a reduction in work (and pay) for 3 days and it is extremely likely that at least some of those days will come at the expense of preplanning. No doubt, this economy is a giant crap sandwich and everybody is going to have to take a bite.\u00a0 However, preplanning is about the worst possible sacrifice we could make.\u00a0 As it is, I was staring in the face of a massive shortage of time to get ready.\u00a0 In fact, in my building we are now looking at a perfect storm of chaos the likes of which we have never seen before. It started last year, when the school board decided everyone was going to be on a block schedule.\u00a0 Not a huge deal for me, but it was and will still entail a considerable about of time retooling and retraining all of us.\u00a0 This would be part of preplanning.\u00a0 Next, our building is the oldest high school in the county and was supposed to be undergoing major rennovations over the summer.\u00a0 That meant thet my paras and I spent days and days packing up all of our stuff into boxes and labeliling all our shelves and cabinets and moving these things to storage.\u00a0 Then, in reaction to the budget woes, the school cut para preplanning to one day, which is the day of our open house.\u00a0 So now I am looking at having to reassemble my classrooom and all of our stuff by myself.\u00a0 And then there is an annoying email informing us to NOT come in early because the construction crews are not finished yet. In addition to training on the block schedule, there has to be at least one school-wide meeting lasting several hours, a department meeting lasting hours and a district-wide special-ed meeting lasting half a day. Basically, we\u2019re totally screwed all around. So now I\u2019m noodling how to respond to all of this.\u00a0 First off, that email about the construction not being finished; I\u2019m going to go in anyway to pick up my mail and to see how deeply my classroom area is affected.\u00a0 If it\u2019s not, I need to get started because it took 4 of us several days to pack and I haven\u2019t the time to spare.\u00a0 Next week will be a bust regardless.\u00a0 One silver lining might be that if the board decides to take a day or two off the top, I can still go in without having to worry about the inane meetings. Heaven help the new teachers who are going through their new teacher orientation this week.\u00a0 Orientation is SO crucial to them in getting to know the school, colleagues, administrators, procedures and just getting ready for the kids.\u00a0 Truncating that transition for them will be costly down the road even more than for the rest of us who have been through past openings and have some semblance of an idea of what is involved. There are some ways that some aspects of preplanning could be streamlined: \u2013 New teachers need to be introduced.\u00a0 Have each make a short video bio and post it on our intranet so we don\u2019t need a meeting to see it.\u00a0 Now that I think about it, ALL teachers could do that, and it would benefit everyone in knowing each other throughout the year. \u2013 Replace meetings with video presentations.\u00a0 Last year our superintendent did that, and it worked very well, except the principal still called us all together to watch it.\u00a0 We need to be in our rooms working, instead of waiting for a video to start.\u00a0 The principal did one video last year, and I thought it worked well.\u00a0\u00a0  There\u2019s no reason for taking up a lot of face time if we are not expected to interact.\u00a0 In other words, administrators rarely want to field many questions during a faculty meeting and such questions could be fielded online in the open for future reference. -Get memos and notices out electonically and early.\u00a0 We always have to submit a syllabus, information and course descriptions.\u00a0 Many of these could be done collaborative on the intranet (Sharepoint). Special educators also have a huge stack of files to go through for new students, and get assorted medical and emergency plans ready for them.\u00a0 Our paperwork machinery is already ginning out new forms and data collection precedures even while I\u2019m writing.\u00a0 Just finding a place for all the paperwork and forms is a chore! So what it really means is that teachers will be doing what we alaways have been doing; donating a ton of time to the service of our students.\u00a0 It\u2019s just going to be especially intense this fall.

{"date": "2009/07/20", "body": "I was asked by  another blogger  about my thoughts concerning being a special educator with disabilities. At first, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have anything to say about the subject since I don\u2019t don\u2019t have any identified disabilities. At least not a physical disability beyond severe myopia although some might argue that I have some sort of emotional or behavior disorder! But over the years, I have known various teachers who had disabilities of various sorts and most had gotten along pretty well. One of the earliest persons I met in the business was a para who had a visual impairment. He was quite successful at his job, working with students with moderate and severe disabilities in an elementary school. While I only briefly met him, he was highly thought of by his fellow teachers and paras and was well-liked by the kids. I also knew a teacher who slipped and fell and broke his hip. He had several complications which put him in a wheelchair (and several medications) for over a year. He got pretty good at getting around in the wheelchair. He taught students with mild disabilities in co-teaching and resource settings in the high school so his capacity to teach was less severely impacted. However, before the end of his second year in the wheelchair, he did resign because the medications he was on were having an impact on his overall health. Something we don\u2019t often think about is short-term disabilities, when a teacher becomes injured. In fact this happened to me way back when I was a para, and I twisted up my knee while chasing a kid. I was on crutches for several weeks, and so was limited in the things I could do. But since this was toward the end of the year, we had the kids pretty much into a routine. So while it was a royal pain trying to get around, I was still able to work with the middle school students at the psychoed center albeit in a more limited capacity.  I learned how much more work is involved doing simple things with a physical disability.  I was going to grad school at the time at Georgia State, and it was a lot of work just getting from the subway to class!  By the time I got there in the heat of May, I was drenched in sweat.  Any one of us could become disabled through accident or illness at anytime so it just makes good sense being compassionate toward those with differing abilities and exceptionalities.\u00a0 We\u2019re almost all destined to be on that list at least once. And then there is a teacher who I\u2019ve known for a few years who has mild CP. She went to college and became certified as an elementary teacher. Just getting through college was a victory, but once out, she discovered that getting a job would be more difficult. There was a lot of prejudice against her as a teacher because of her disability. In fact one administrator she interviewed with told her that she had no business teaching or even being around children. I can only imagine how hurtful that must have been. However, this lady had the pluck to continue trying to find a job and landed in our county where a principal gave her a chance. And she was successful. The obstacles she encountered, as well as a lot of the prejudice and discrimination just made her more determined to prove her detractors wrong and be more successful. She is now a media specialist at one of the elementary schools in our county. She is married and has a son about the same age as my youngest. Her CP presented challenges to her all along the way, but she persevered and met all of them. Things we take for granted like driving or even changing a diaper were things she had to deal with and learn how to do. She is respected and admired by everyone who knows her, not just on account of having such an indomitable spirit, but also on account of her kindness and bigheartedness. So for people with disabilities who are considering teaching as a career, I would encourage it for several reasons. First of all, we really do need more diversity in teaching all around. While there are many groups under represented on the faculty of any school, those who have disabilities have to be the most underrepresented group of all. Is it because teaching is so demanding? That\u2019s possible, as it can be physically and emotionally taxing. However I think a lot of it is simply part of a larger culture of discrimination against people with disabilities. Just because a person has limitations, we often think of them being less than a whole or capable person. This is a tragedy, I think, because we can learn a lot by being around people who have overcome their limitations in order to improve themselves and the rest of us. As far as my particular position, it would be very difficult or impossible to do if I had to be in a wheelchair. There is a great deal of lifting involved and while I have capable paras, it would be tremendously unfair to ask them to do all the grunt work that I was unable to do. I do believe there needs to be a certain level of physical fitness required to be in a SID/PID room, but that threshold is relatively low. One needs to be able to lift at least 50 pounds, be able to get on the floor and get up again with relative ease. Other than that, it is mostly mental/emotional. Basically, if a body is able and willing to change the poopy diapers of a young adult, everything else is gravy. The biggest obstacle, in my experience, is a  willingness   to do it more than ability for most otherwise capable people. I see this especially with guys who were first hired to coach football. If I had to chose between the young guy who coaches football and the young lady who wasn\u2019t as physically strong, I\u2019d pick the lady every time. Someone, no matter how physically fit, who has a poor attitude is all but worthless. And that\u2019s the take-home message here. Attitude is much more important and critical to success than any physical characteristic and limitation, no matter what field you get into. One can often deal learn to compensate for a physical disability but compensation for a poor attitude just means everyone else has to do more work and put up with it.

{"date": "2009/07/30", "body": "No, not yet.  But I have made waves before and know that the day will come (and might be overdue) when I have to do it again. In 2000, I can into this county as some one with some experience in special education, but none with the severe and profound disabilities.  I had worked with mostly LD and EBD settings, albeit very restrictive in a psychoed and state hospital.  But what I lacked in experience, I more than made up for with the fire in my belly from just recently having my oldest son diagnosed with PDD-NOS at the age of 18 months.\u00a0 I had some extra motivation that needed an outlet, and fighting injustice was just the thing. The situation I walked into was pretty appalling.  We were getting students with more and more severe disabilities, but there was no changing area.  We had one student who we had to catheterize and change and we did it on a computer table in our little office area.  The school nurse was prohibited from helping us with catheterizations. There were no accessible drinking fountains.  The conditions we were working in showed me that there was a very clear pattern of discrimination, exclusion and prejudice.  So I amazed and shocked my new administration by detailing several of these injustices in writing, listing all of them as recipients and then filing it with the county special education director as a list of section 504 violations.  Looking back it was an extremely  audacious thing for me, a new hire, to do. The special education director did come out to the high school to meet with us in order to rectify several of the issues. While she was amused at my boldness, she was supportive and worked with us to address my grievances.   Not all of them were addressed right away.  Some of them were never resolved.  But we made gradual headway and progress. The administration seemed to be genuinely interested in meeting the needs of our students. NCLB has not been good to students with severe disabilities.  In fact, it has totally thrown all of us under the bus.  Sure, there is lip service toward ensuring that all children have a quality education delivered by highly qualified teachers.  But with the constant drumbeat of accountability and test scores, these students and their teachers are totally marginalized and alienated.  It is all about college preparation.  What does someone with an IQ of less than 20 have to do with a college prep curriculum and diploma?  And what does that say to those who really work hard to get one if they just give one to these kids by virtue if their GAA and staying until 22?  Administrators all over the country, faced with tough economic choices are following their keenest business instinct; getting \u201cthe most bang for the buck.\u201d  That means test scores.  That means NOT my program.  That means disproportionate overcrowding. Consider this: The state sets various limits on class sizes for various grades, as well as disability categories.  The limit for a PID class is 5, with at least one para.  For a regular high school class it has been around 30.  This means 1 student with severe disabilities is about equal in support to 6 regular education students.  So what if I have 8 in my class?  An administrator might see this as still being a small class.  Numerically, it is.  But support-wise, it is equal to increasing a regular class to 48!  Even under the toughest of economic times, I do not know of a single  regular teacher who is expected to be with 48 kids for one class period, much less being with all of them all day long all year long.  Even with extra para support, there is a limit to how many one teacher can handle, no matter the level of experience or competence. Numbers alone never give an accurate picture of anything.  IQ is not a measure of character, worth or how much dignity a person deserves.  And yet, this is the climate that is driving more and more decisions that routinely leave those who most need support and care into situations that are rife with neglect and abuse.

I didn\u2019t happen to see any of the other SID/PID teachers but did manage to see a few EX SID/PID teachers. So many changes in leadership!  All the way up and down the chain, there are gobs of changes, which means breaking in an entirely new cadre of people.  Most of the new folks aren\u2019t really new so much as promoted from the teaching ranks.

Today, the building was officially open for all the teachers to come in and begin getting ready.\u00a0\u00a0 We have over 130 teachers in this building and I don\u2019t think I saw more than a dozen.\u00a0 This seems incredibly odd to me.\u00a0 All week long, the middle and elementary schools have had hordes of activity around them as they busy themselves with various preparations.\u00a0 What is up with my school?\u00a0 Where was everyone?\u00a0 Granted, none of us are getting paid for this time but this is true across the entire system.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if there is some lack of ethos at the high school level, or maybe it is just in our building.\u00a0 I\u2019ve often wondered at the differences between middle grades and high school communities and am very, very keen to find out one day soon.\u00a0 One day.\u00a0 But not today. I did take pictures and shoot video and i may eventually post some sort of vlog showing my progress. The cosmetic work has mostly been done, for now except for doing stuff to the walls.\u00a0 If I have a weakness (I do have many), arts and crafts are chief among them.\u00a0 I\u2019m lousy at bulletin boards and making decorations.\u00a0 I actually favor a blank wall.\u00a0 If I do happen to make a bulletin board, it will stay up FOREVER!\u00a0 Seriously, at my last job that I did for 4 years I put up a board in the computer lab that never changed.\u00a0 EVER.\u00a0 It just sort of faded.\u00a0 The only reason I changed classroom boards was because they moved me to a different classroom.\u00a0 Fortunately I have paras that are talented in that area.\u00a0 Or I hope I have paras that are talented in that area. Mentally, I shift from dread, to anger, to anticipation to grim determination in regards to the coming year.\u00a0 There\u2019s always some sense of hope going into a new school year but a lot of that has been diminished for me.\u00a0 I still feel the remnants of last year\u2019s betrayal, which flairs up every time I see other people advance, move on and do other things while I\u2019m still stuck.\u00a0\u00a0 So it\u00a0 is that I gear up and get my room and my head together for year 10 in the SID/PID room.

{"date": "2009/03/28", "body": "No, I am not teaching Latin in my classroom, although we have had brief lessons on Spanish and Irish as part of our social studies dealing with other countries.  My students will probably have no occasion to visit Ireland or Mexico, but neither will they use Algebra, Geometry, Statistics or a study on matter or plant tropisms.  But we study them anyway as part of our regular curriculum instead of life skills.  It\u2019s a NCLB thing.  And it\u2019s fun. No, this is about my son, Thomas, and his own adventures.  My wife, Jane, got the idea before Christmas of perhaps homeschooling our boys and giving them a more classical education.  She was mainly thinking of doing this with my youngest, Percy, who is at that age where he is keen to learn almost anything.   Thomas, OTOH, is more of a challenge.  He rather dislikes school and homework and schoolwork and all the stuff that goes with it.  Which is to say, he is a lot like his father.  But that in no way means that he dislikes learning. This was recently demonstrated when Jane bought the student and teacher editions of S ong School Latin  as she was looking at classical education materials.  In the end, she decided to make this material available to the boys and supplement what they were learning in school.  So she is homeschooling in a way, just not in a conventional way.  And she spends a lot of time with Percy, teaching and working with him.  But it was Thomas who picked up on this particular subject.  In the space of about 2 months, he has memorized the book and the CD that goes with it.  He can translate any of the 100 words contained therein.  And he did it without writing in the workbook.  He read the workbook, but the CDs with the chants and songs were what really helped crystallize it for him.  And he did it all pretty much for the fun of it. There are 30 lessons, each supposedly good for about a week.  He did the whole course in less than 60 days.  And he knows how to use the words properly in the correct context.  All without being explicitly taught by a live teacher. The difference, of course, is motivation.  The boy is intrinsically motivated to learn language and languages.  Even though he didn\u2019t talk until he was 3, he was reading well before that.  And he has always gravitated toward other languages and cultures.  He\u2019s currently a bit obsessed with Japanese and always eating with chopsticks.  We haven\u2019t said much about this obsession as it does have a side benefit of slowing down his eating so he is not inhaling his food as much.  He hasn\u2019t mastered the shovel-method of using chopsticks and we haven\u2019t really taught him just because we\u2019re okay with slowing him down.  If he\u2019s hungry enough, he will grab a spoon or fork after laboring with the chopsticks for awhile.  The chopsticks, for him, make good, cheap and functional reinforcers! But back to the Latin, it has been an education for me to witness the power of simple motivation.  So often teachers and parents try to drill content into a kids\u2019 head when altering the presentation can make all the difference.  Making it fun seems to make all the difference, and Latin itself has side benefits in the way of new vocabulary and grammar.  It is not something that most kids would just glom onto and I\u2019d bet that if the school system made in mandatory, Thomas would not have touched it with a 10 foot pole.  But since it is just for fun and is totally outside of what is going on in school, he\u2019s more inclined to just go for it. Compared to Percy, Thomas is a total challenge in the classroom setting.  Learning how to reach and engage students like him is  what the profession is all about.  Watching the boy learn a year\u2019s worth if Latin in 60 days has been quite an education.  But he still can\u2019t tie his own shoes. He still hasn\u2019t learn how to dry himself after taking a shower. This really is the challenge of high functioning autism/aspergers.  They can be absolutely brilliant in so many instances but nearly hopelessly helpless in some of the most basic aspects of life!

{"date": "2009/04/12", "body": "This post brings together a few things I\u2019ve been reading and thinking about lately as I contemplate what I want to do when I grow up.\u00a0 As much as I want to get out of the business of self-contained teaching, my current position is the one single position that is clearly the most secure and recession proof of any other position in the building with the possible exception of the SLP.\u00a0 And mine (blogname Ms. Cleo) is retiring at the end of the year. I\u2019ve been reading  Disrupting Class  by Clayton Christian  and it has been an eye-opening read as I see many of the things he discusses in this book.\u00a0  Georgia Virtual Academy / Georgia Virtual School  anyone?\u00a0 You can visit  Christian\u2019s blog here.  Here\u2019s an interview: Basically, if you follow his reasoning and his predictions, most course work will be offered online by 2020, and it will be a lot more student centric.\u00a0 The technology will enable more differentiation and learner flexibility.\u00a0 Many rural districts in the country are already utilizing the new technologies for AP courses or those courses that can not be offered because there are no HQ teachers around.\u00a0 Imagine being able to take an exotic foreign language or a high level math or science course and not having to worry about there not being a teacher around to teach it.\u00a0 Basically, most core courses can be taught (to the test) in this fashion.\u00a0 This modality would enable a teacher to actually teacher more students and give them more individual attention as needed because they wouldn\u2019t have to do all the work involved with planning content delivery or assessment.\u00a0 That means a need for less teachers, which means less of a shortage. Except for that one area.\u00a0 You know the one.\u00a0 I\u2019 ve already talked about  how forces are conspiring to make it even more of a shortage area.\u00a0 You can see Georgia shortage areas  here .\u00a0 It\u2019s a bit dated, but most of those still apply.\u00a0 Interestingly, as the Georgia Legislature is set to pass the legislation offering a raise for math and science teachers, the answer is right there in front of those folks.\u00a0  This boston.com article  puts it right there in the last sentence: Tofig said a rising number of students are taking advanced math and science classes through Georgia Virtual Schools, which offers classes online. But what bout those needing more help and assistance?\u00a0 What about those who can not learn as well independently?\u00a0 What about those who need specialized instruction based on diagnostic assessments?\u00a0 That requires a higher level of expertise and a more personal level of interaction akin to what you might get from a doctor or mechanic.\u00a0 Or one would hope.\u00a0 Special education teachers, in addition to getting a short shrift from our governor and legislature are also getting it from another direction.\u00a0 Districts, who are trying to staff their special education positions in the face of the shortage are grabbing people off the street and issuing provisional certificates good for 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0 So kids who need the most expert help will be getting services by the least qualified people.\u00a0 This is the sad state of special education in Georgia. Of course, the virtual school option is totally unavailable to the kids I teach.\u00a0 My kids and I may be the very last holdouts when the last of the factory-style schools close their doors.\u00a0 Nothing like job security!\u00a0 And yet there will always be a shortage for SID/PID self-contained.\u00a0 Even when they pull people off the street. You can also feel free to tell  Ms. Jenny what you think .\u00a0 She\u2019s a fellow GA Sp.Ed. teacher who has a poll up about the requirements to teach special education in Georgia.\u00a0 She also has material available for those of you teaching students with more moderate disabilities.

{"date": "2009/08/04", "body": "And this is a trend that I hope continues as the year goes on. Fortunately it looks like my new paras are fairly sharp and are rapidly catching on to a new routine and are taking up some of the slack that I inevitably leave in a wake of growing responsibilities. Advocating for my paras is sometimes even more difficult that advocating for my students. Since my students are so dependent on adult support, it\u2019s practically the same thing, anyway. Today we were all better prepared and met the various challenges head-on. And we did see a few new challenges that didn\u2019t show up yesterday, but we\u2019re all dealing without the wheels falling off. I\u2019m encouraged by the students settling in to what little structure and routine we presently have in place. I was actually able to have a bit of structured class/group time with the kids today. However, 8 is way, way too many to group with this population. The fact is, is that with a population of SID/PID students you have to be in close physical proximity to effectively teach anything. I have to be able to reach out and touch every person I am working with. Yes, having para support is helpful but the teacher needs to be able to physically touch, prompt and otherwise hold attention. My limit is 3 in a group. I have seriously tried and tried working with groups of 4 or more, but with the sort of intense instruction we do, it just does not work well. 3 + me = 4 and that seems to be the perfect setup. Anyone extra becomes a 5 th  and 6 th  (and 7 th  and 8 th ) wheel. Last year, with 7 students, I had 2 groups of 3 and tried to work the 7 th  wherever he/she fit. Often someone was absent, so it was workable much of the time. The 3 paras would do 1:1 work with whoever I wasn\u2019t working with or they could combine up so everyone in the room was engaged on some level. This is the way it should be, but when numbers swell so far past the available adults it breaks everything down and no one gets any productive time! I would say that the behaviors today were probably more challenging on some levels than yesterday. However was able to spend more time probing around and trying to determine the function of these behaviors today. The way to determine function is to try different things in order to elicit the behavior. Mostly eliciting it under various conditions, such as demand, attention or alone conditions. So in the case of someone who is kicking (not an issue in my room at the moment), it means getting kicked a lot more by trying to cause it. Once the cause is found, a program is determined to to replace the behavior or reinforce something else, like attention or compliance. I\u2019m keeping it all simple for the sake of saying that I do have numerous and fresh battle wounds today to show for my behavioral combat. Applied Behavior Analysis isn\u2019t truly applied unless the investigator has sacrificed some of his/her own hide for the cause. If there isn\u2019t blood and bruises, you\u2019re probably not doing it right. Things will also get easier as I get my legs under me and leave the laziness of summer behind me. I was sore and exhausted yesterday. Today isn\u2019t the same sort of soreness or the sensation of being so bone weary. Yes, I\u2019m tired, but I can still think and move without wincing. So those of you who haven\u2019t started your school year yet, I hope this will serve as a bit of encouragement. Yes, the first day can be a crusher but it does get better.

{"date": "2009/04/17", "body": "It\u2019s that time of the year when Georgia elementary schools are going all out for the annual  criterion referenced competency test  (CRCT). Both of my boys will be subjected to it this next week, and both schools are totally ramping up for this. \n \n \u2013 Every core subject has been \tgiving practice CRCT tests for the past month \n \n \n \u2013 Letters are sent home (more than \tone) urging parents to make sure the kids are well-rested and \twell-fed on test day. \n \n \n \u2013 Rewards are offered after each \ttest is finished \n \n \n \u2013 Rewards are offered at the end \tof the week after ALL tests are finished. \n \n \n \n The high school bands are going to \tthe elementary schools on the Friday before test week in order to \tperform for a CRCT pep rally. \n \n \n Review sessions and tutoring are \tgiven after school \n \n \n Evening seminars are given to help \tparents and students deal with test anxiety. \n \n \n Numerous workbooks and study \tguides are sold for each grade and subject area. \n \n \n \n So what\u2019s at stake? \n \n \u2013 AYP \u2013 whether a school is seen \tas successful or failing \n \n \n \u2013 Real estate values \n \n \n \u2013 Teacher contracts \n \n \n \u2013 Administrator jobs \n \n \n \u2013 Whether or not a student moves \tto the next grade \n \n \n In the future, there may be some \tbonus money at stake for teachers and administrators. \n \n \n In Georgia, this CRCT business actually started  before  NCLB hit the scene, thanks to the beloved former Governor Roy Barnes\u2019 A+ reform program. Yes, Barnes actually was in front of the high stakes testing movement and continues to advocate for NCLB through his  co-chairing the Aspen Institute  . Yes, this is the guy who has, and continues to lead the charge into high stakes testing. Based on those actions, he became so unpopular that he was overthrown in his re-election bid and swept republicans into power in Georgia for the first time since reconstruction. And now he is thinking about  running again.  Egad. It is true that our current beloved Republican governor has proven to be even more unfriendly and twice as inept when it comes to public education but I find it hard to believe that people could be so stupid as to bring the former weasel back. Sure, the old weasel looks less evil than the current one, but why not try to find someone who is NOT looking to pillage education? \n Back to the test\u2026 \n There are still a lot of doubts about the CRCT. \n If you look at the first list, you\u2019ll find that actually teaching new skills is not on there.  If it\u2019s not on the test, it isn\u2019t going to get much time and hasn\u2019t for at least a month.  During test week, EVERYTHING becomes subordinated to those tests.  No field trips.  No activities.  No homework (YAY!).  Even the school calendar is subordinate to the tests as spring break must be early enough so that there is enough time to take the test and get the results back before the end of the year.  This is what the school has been working for all year.  If you think they have been working toward delivering a good education, you are mistaken unless you equate scoring well on a test as a good education.  And our students are getting better at taking tests.  They may not be able to count change or get along with others, but they can sure take a test. \n If you look at my second list, you\u2019ll see that student learning is NOT at stake.  The test is supposed to be a measure of learning, but is not learning itself, per se.  Not much learning or instruction will be taking place during testing week.  But at least the high school band will get in some extra performance time during the CRCT pep rally, which is nice. \n My youngest, who just recently had his last IEP ever, will do fine on his tests.  He\u2019s the sort who will just do well no matter what else happens because he\u2019s just the sort of kid who loves learning.  My oldest, OTOH, will have some issues.  First there is the radical change in schedule that happens during testing week.  For individuals with autism, schedules provide a safe routine whereas surprises and inconsistency breed anxiety.  They\u2019ll do some preparation to minimize this, but at least the first day there is always some extra nervousness.  He gets tested in a small group and is allowed as much time as he wants.  The small group might help, but he won\u2019t need extended time.  He either gets it or he doesn\u2019t and he\u2019s not going to labor over one problem for any length of time.  What might happen is that he\u2019ll get distracted.  One of the most difficult and costly tasks is transferring an answer from the test booklet to the answer sheet bubbles.  It\u2019s too easy to get off track.  I can\u2019t remember if marking in the test booklet is an option for him, but it should be.  The other problem is the fact that an open test booklet contains several problems/questions at the same time.  Getting lost and skipping questions is also a danger.  This is why I would be curious as to how he would do with the computerized version.  I know some offer it for make-up sessions but for some kids this might actually be a preferred accommodation.  It\u2019s more difficult to skip a question or get off track transferring answers.  And generally computers present one question at a time.  One added bonus is that results would be instantaneous. \n For parents and teachers across the country, high stakes testing is just the way the political wind is currently blowing, but I know I\u2019m not the only one who is hoping for a change.  While some testing and assessment is necessary, I think the stakes involved encourage all sorts of ways to try to game the system or even outright cheat.  Entire local economies are held hostage to these tests, which I think is quite a lot to put on the backs of our school children on a single day or a single week.  It just seems like priorities have gotten off track and the kids are paying for it, much like they will foot the bill for the current fiscal crisis. \n What\u2019s the wackiest thing you\u2019ve seen surrounding these tests? \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/ci_testing.aspx?PageReq=CI_TESTING_CRCT", "http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/no-child-left-behind/about-commission/secretary-tommy-g-thompson-governor-roy-e", "http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/03/29/barnes0329.html", "http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/04/13/crct0413.html"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/crct-fever/", "title": "CRCT Fever"},
{"date": "2009/04/30", "body": "IEP season is in full swing and indeed we\u2019re but a few weeks from it being all over. This year, I have not had any LEA duties since our department head has taken over those duties full time. I\u2019m exceedingly thankful but I don\u2019t regret the experience and knowledge previous years and scores of meetings have lent me. However I did have a middle school that needed a high school representative and have been busy trying to get their meetings scheduled. Whenever I speak to an itinerant teacher or therapist about this particular school and IEP meetings, they roll their eyes. They (the middle school) seem to have some problems in this area, so I\u2019m blogging it to help them and anyone else who cares to look into it. The Problem Scheduling an IEP is a lot like herding cats. Everyone is everywhere and it seems like no two people are headed in the same direction. The primary responsibility for scheduling an IEP should fall on the case manager, who should be in regular contact with parents through progress reports and other avenues anyway. I remember my first try at being a special ed. teacher, I was told that I had to talk to my parents. I didn\u2019t want to, and soon learned that if I didn\u2019t contact them, they would be contacting me, and not necessarily under the most ideal of circumstances! The students I teach are very involved and get many services from many people. An IEP involves bringing all of these people together on the same day at the same time, when there are many, many other meetings and people competing for their time. But it is sometimes the only time a parent gets to see and talk to everyone. How can we get all of these people together who are all running amok at this time of year? A month or so in advance 1. Set Options and limit them.  This part is done by our department head. Basically she designates a given week when we (each caseload manager) are supposed to hold our meetings. Having an online calendar accessible to everyone has been a great help, because several caseloads can occupy each week. So now it can be a bit of a free for all, but now at least there is a time frame to work from and each teacher has a guideline within to work. Of course manifestations and eligibilities can wreak havoc, but we\u2019re talking about annual reviews, here. They happen annually so we know when they should take place. Annually. 2. Talk to the Parents.  There\u2019s some disagreement as to who you should talk to first, but I start with the parents. I let them know what week we\u2019re doing annual reviews and get a feel for their own feelings. I want to know how they feel about attending, when the best time of day for them and what their concerns are. Basically we begin the process  I\u2019ve written about before. 3. Talk to other service providers.  Get a feel for their limitations and preferences and any issues they might have. I\u2019m just trying to get a general feeling here and I let them know the general time frame I have to work with. 4. Set up the time.  Notice that I haven\u2019t set a specific time up until now. Sometimes the planets align and service providers and parents all have a common time when they can meet. Hallelujah! But most of the time, this is not going to happen. So my first point of contact is the parent. I get them to committ to a time from the best possible options and try to nail them down. Hard. By that, I mean to say that I make it easy for a parent to say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to be able to make it.\u201d without guilt while I also press them to commit and make their yes mean yes. I do this by reassuring them that we can talk before the meeting or after the meeting anytime about any issues. Once they sign that they are or are not attending, I set it in the calendar. This should be done about a month out, if possible. I don\u2019t know many teachers who are doing this, but it is best practice for annual reviews. At this point, I try to get as many service providers as possible on board, but if some can\u2019t make it, that is the nature of this beast. Within 1 week of the meeting 5. Keep in touch!  That especially means parents, but also everyone you have invited to the meeting Service providers need time to input their portion of the IEP and compile notes, grades and reports. Reminding everyone is good practice but reminding parents also helps cover yourself later as part of the due process. 6. Draft the IEP.  You need to have this draft done several days in advance of the IEP whether other service providers have their portion completed or not. This will help you move things along as part of due process. 7. Send home some forms and the draft.  I try to do this 3 or more days in advance. There are a lot of forms that can be done in advance, like the bus/transportation forms, consent for evaluation, and any surveys that might be due. This will speed things up and they are part of due process. Have extra forms at the meeting, in case the parent forgets, but anything done ahead will help in keeping the communication line alive and active. When someone wants to change the date and time of the meeting. Someone better have a good reason that is burnished in gold. Fact is, at our school with  hundreds   of annual reviews taking place, we do not have room to niggle about with the foolishness of small inconveniences. If that person is a parent, I\u2019m not going to move at the last minute unless I\u2019m dying. Even then, you can roll me up in a wheelchair because when we are a week out, we are going forward at the appointed time. If the parent wants to reschedule, I\u2019m going to try to make it an  individual   conference, after the fact. The reason why I can do this and get away with it is because I have a draft of the IEP I can send home a few days in advance and the parent can rewrite any portion that they see fit ahead of time. We can do so many things in advance that the actual IEP is merely a ratification of several turns and rounds of negotiations and discussions. Note that this only works if parent contact is an ongoing thing. The most important thing is to include parents from the beginning and give them adequate time and opportunity for input. Leaving parents out has dire consequences. What\u2019s happening at the middle school, is that these meetings are being scheduled without following the above steps. Consequently, they are constantly being rescheduled and canceled at the last minute. Parents end up jerking the process because they are not being empowered enough at the earliest stage of the review process. The other thing that is happening is that case managers are not getting the things done on time, so they simply reschedule. For a busy itinerant, who may have  hundreds   of meetings, this is simply untenable. It ends up being a nightmare for everyone involved and a backlog of make-up meetings accumulates and the end of the year turns into a snake pit of frantic hell. Do not let this happen! Teachers who have gone through this more than once have no excuse. It is a violation of our own professional code of conduct as well as our contract by not having the thing written on the appointed day. By starting the process early and collaborating with everyone involved, you can make the process relatively easier on everyone. As a parent, I like to know the general time line, even if we are a month out. Right now, we have less than a month of school left, and we have not heard a word from my son\u2019s case manager about his annual review. I\u2019ve tried and tried over the years to get his various teachers and case managers to draft stuff in advance, but it never happens. I totally understand procrastination but I\u2019ve managed to simply move my own deadlines up so \u201clast minute\u201d for me is 2 days before the meeting. Having a draft a few days ahead would really help streamline the process plus lessen whatever anxiety Jane* and I might have about it. Having a scheduled date well in advance helps us keep the calendar clear and helps to keep us from feeling jerked around. It makes it less likely that  we\u2019ll   be the jerks. A smooth process requires advanced planning. Sure, things happen and come up, but it is easier making provision for such things with advanced notice and preparation.

{"date": "2009/08/12", "body": "I hate them.  On just about every level, I really and totally dislike them. First off, as a teacher of the population that I teach, school pictures are a HUGE hassle.  And I mean HUGE!  It always involves going to a different part of the school and waiting.  My kids do not wait well, especially in a large, open area with lots of bright and flashing lights and noise.  And that\u2019s even if the place is wheelchair accessible.  Umm\u2026I already keel-hauled those folks on that issue.  But feel free glom on. Getting a good pose comes naturally to many of my students.  Some of them are able to always smile and sit perfectly still.  Actually, that\u2019s not true at all.  Very few manage to do that in this environment.  Part of it is my fault for not really preparing them for this ordeal, but we only had a couple days notice.  I do have kids that are naturally smile-ee, but they do not hold a pose worth a flip.  They move, fidget and turn their heads to look around at everyone and everything.  And then I have a few who are VERY unhappy. Hollering, jumping and head-thumping mad.  It\u2019s for these that I get paid the big bucks to work my wizardry.  I first prep the professional camera people. \u201cGet ready\u2026.you\u2019re going to have to be REAL quick!\u201d And to their credit, they usually manage to pull off a decent shot, with the help of some candy, gum and calming words.  And so it was that we survived this ordeal for a third of my class.  Those in wheelchairs will be doing it next month. As a teacher, it is also a royal pain.  It\u2019s not like I could leave my kids hanging out alone while I sit for the picture.  So I came back during my lunch/planning time.  I should have jumped, screamed and thumped more.  Unlike the slick and quick work employed on my students, I was suddenly confronted with someone who wanted to be very particular and artsy.  I just wanted a quick shot for the yearbook and get out of there.  My photographer had other ideas\u2026 \u201cLook here\u2026turn your head\u2026tilt it to the side\u2026.bring your back up straight\u2026\u2026shoulders forward,\u2026 head tilt\u2026.look here\u2026chest up\u2026chin down\u2026head tilt\u2026.look here\u2026\u201d What\u2019s up with the head tilt?  Why does looking like a confused dog look attractive?  Anyway, I finally got my glamour shot.  For years, I was able to recycle my first year\u2019s picture for my I.D. but they quit doing that so now you can see how little hair I have left. As a parent, I find school pictures to be an enormous pain.  Jane doesn\u2019t quite see it that way, I don\u2019t think.  Basically, they shot a picture in front of a plain background and sell $7 worth of copies for $65.  It\u2019s an enormous racket!  The schools gets a cut of this, of course which is why they actually do it twice a year in the younger grades.  One of those times, you get to preview the picture before you buy it.  The other time, you pay before you can see it.  THAT is an unholy racket!  Fortunately, the boys take after their mother in the looks department and take good pictures so we don\u2019t have many duds.  But I\u2019m against the whole principle of spending ginormous amounts of money on something you can\u2019t see beforehand. The parents of my students rarely buy the pictures that are taken.  First off, it really is a lot of money for families struggling to buy diapers and pull-ups every week.  Also, not all of the pictures turn out very good.  Sometimes, something mediocre is the best we can do.  My students simply have not mastered the head tilt.

{"date": "2009/08/03", "body": "School officially began and I am almost too wiped out and crushed to write.\u00a0 At the same time, I am feeling almosted to crushed NOT to write! I\u2019ve found myself in the awkward position of trying to explain to administrators as to why experience and attitude are equally important in teaching students with severe disabilities.\u00a0 While it is important no matter what you teach, there can be some dire consequences for NOT having some background with this population.\u00a0 And if there is a poor attitude, such as a prejudice against kids with disabilities, no amount of knowledge or background will help.\u00a0 We had a case a couple of years ago where a teacher and para got canned because of abuse charges, and they were both competent and experienced.\u00a0 But they didn\u2019t really like most of the students, and took it out on them with some rather foolish misconduct. It takes at least a year for me to get a para up to full speed, and at least another year before I can consider them fully skilled.\u00a0 Some take longer and some can learn a bit quicker, but it really does take a full year to learn all of the ropes involved in opening school, teaching the GAA, doing all of the Special Olympic events and enduring me through all of my IEPs.\u00a0 For the past several years, it has been almost impossible for me to keep a fully qualified team intact.\u00a0 Sometimes it is because staff members move on, but most often it is because the administration sees a sharp para and they take them away for AYP/political/unkown reasons.\u00a0 This infuriates me, especially when I have an oppressive class load like I do this year.\u00a0 It is basically a case of discrimination based upon disability, considering my students less worthy of highly qualified people rather than the more general population.\u00a0 And I am not putting up with that any more.\u00a0 Next time that happens, there WILL be a letter sent to the office of civil rights.\u00a0 The culture of discrimination ends today. So just what does the learning curve involve for a new para?\u00a0 First, knowing the kids and their names and the nature of each ones disability.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to know whaen someone is just having a behavioral issue and when someone is having an autistic issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to know who has seizures.\u00a0 You have to know things dealing with mobility, physical therapy, communication, feeding, toileting, and allergies.\u00a0 And the preceding list are all things that have to be known simply to get the students through breakfast!!\u00a0 The learning curve is extraordinarily steep, detailed and challenging.\u00a0 Feed them something they are allergic to can result in DEATH!\u00a0 But most of my students have no way of telling us if something is bothering them or what it is.\u00a0 The best way is by knowing them, and it takes time to do that.\u00a0 With regular high school kids, they can tell you all about their summer, what they are allergic to, what they like and dislike, what positions or noises or things make them uncomfortable.\u00a0 Many of my kids just scream, holler and hit their faces or bang their heads, and we have to figure it out.\u00a0 Knowing them over a period of time helps take some of the guesswork out it. \u00a0 And then there\u2019s the work involved in getting to know the new students.\u00a0 It\u2019s difficult for me to quickly get to know a couple of new students if I\u2019m also helping new staff get to know the other 6 as well as the new ones. The first day of school is stressful for all students and teachers.\u00a0 Many express themselves in various ways by talking about it.\u00a0 Some might act out behaviorally.\u00a0 Some might just poop their pants all day long.\u00a0 Which leads to the next extraordinary facet of my setting.\u00a0 It is totally and utterly\u00a0 physical. By 10:30, my shirt was soaked with sweat, even though the thermometer in my room read 68 degrees.\u00a0 I felt really bad for the poor kids I was changing as sweat was dripping from me on to them.\u00a0 I tried keeping it wiped off and soldiered on.\u00a0 It was all about lifting, undressing, dressing lifting some more, positioning in a wedge, stander or on the floor and getting the next one, followed by repositioning.\u00a0 I found myself channeling the days on the farm stacking hay under a hot tin roof! Some folks are a bit surprised that I, as a teacher, change diapers instead of just letting the paras do it all.\u00a0 But I totally believe in leading from the front.\u00a0 Besides, if I have a couple of students that are demanding all of my time for whatever reason, changing might be the most quality time I spend with some!\u00a0 It is a very sad fact that even with only 7 or 8 students that it is often difficult to find a sufficient amount of time to spend with any individual students.\u00a0 So today was spent teaching the 2 (out of three) new paras some of the ropes while also trying to decipher and figure out the new behaviors from the old students and all of the behaviors from my new students.\u00a0 By the end of the day, I was sore and exhausted.\u00a0 I spent too much time laying around this summer! I do think my new para team will work well once everyone gets up to speed. \u00a0 I also have faith that my students will adjust and be fun to work with, each in their own way.\u00a0 But it is always such a long and steep climb to get to that point!\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s difficult explaining this to someone who does not exist in the world where I\u2019ve been living over the past 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0  But those who are making these decisions need to know that their seemingly haphazard decisions have consequences.

{"date": "2009/08/10", "body": "I think I\u2019ll talk about students with wheelchairs for a bit because that is foremost on my mind at the moment. First off, I had a student get a brand new one today.\u00a0 The Wheelchair Man, the physical therapist and his mother all came to our noisy, crowded classroom in order to be a part of this event.\u00a0 This is his second new chair with me, as each student can get a new chair, paid for by Medicaid, once every 3 years.\u00a0 Once the student leaves the school system, it goes down to about once every 7 years.\u00a0 It makes some sense, since school aged kids are growing and will grow out of their chairs. Most of my students have custom-made chairs.\u00a0 This is one reason why it takes several months between the time an intitial request is made and the time it finally arrives.\u00a0 First Medicaid has to approve the funding which can take a couple of months.\u00a0 Then measurements are taken and then the thing can finally be ordered.\u00a0 Basically if you start the process in May, you might see the chair by Christmas.\u00a0 Welcome to public healthcare. Customizations include having a seat and back that best supports each unique student.\u00a0 It also may include custom tilt, brakes and even a custom drive train.\u00a0 I know of some students who have chairs that can be driven and steered with only one hand!\u00a0 And then there are the electic wheelchairs which are an entirely different category and issue. So what is the deal with students in wheelchairs?\u00a0 Well, for one thing there is the issue of physical space.\u00a0 They take up a lot of it and they need a lot to move and turn.\u00a0 There\u2019s also the accessibility issue of getting around on ramps and elevators.\u00a0 At one time when we had enough adults, we would often ride the Atlanta rapid transit system, and it was a major deal trying to find elevators and places to sit/park the chairs and then tried to negotiate the CNN Center.\u00a0 But that was when I had only 2 chairs. Now I have many more.\u00a0 And when only one student can drive his chair independently, that means an adult has to push.\u00a0 And in the event of a fire drill, we simply do not have enough adults to move all of our students where they need to be.\u00a0 Just going to the cafeteria becomes a major ordeal!\u00a0 Our community time is pretty much a thing of the past because we need enough people to cover and lift and move students during any emergency.\u00a0 I\u2019m tempted to stop by a nursing home just to get a feel for the logistics! Over the years, I\u2019ve learned how to make basic repairs and adjustments to most of the chairs.\u00a0 Wheelchair Man comes to our county about once per month, and that is not enough time to service all of the chairs in the county.\u00a0 And if the brakes are loose or a belt comes undone, I have allen wrenches and other tools available to make repairs.\u00a0 Chair mechanic is just one more hat I wear. Sitting in the same spot, even if it is a custom chair, can get really uncomfortable after a couple of hours.\u00a0 As a result, we try to move everyone out and about every couple of hours.\u00a0 Usually around 10:00 we\u2019re full into diaper changing and then positioning students in standers, wedges, mats and tumble form devices.\u00a0 It takes about 45 minutes to get everyone changed and positioned and it is VERY physically demanding.\u00a0 I\u2019m usually ready for a break after everyone is in place!\u00a0 Once students are positioned, we can work with them on the mat or wherever they are to massage and stretch and just help them relax.\u00a0 After 30-45 minutes, we\u2019re getting back in the chairs and read for lunch. Transporting a wheelchair is not an easy thing.\u00a0 Many of the parents have a van with a lift but several do not.\u00a0 The lift van requires a lot of fuss and bother getting the chair strapped and positioned securely.\u00a0 Those without a lift usually have to break down the chair by removing the seat and back rest and then fold it.\u00a0 This is not an easy task and is also hard on the chair.\u00a0 Plus the student has to be transferred in and out of the chair.\u00a0 As a result, parents of my students don\u2019t come to many open houses or curriculum nights or other events the school hosts.\u00a0 It is simply too enormous of an undertaking.\u00a0 They shop and buy groceries and take care of other business while the student is at school, hence the major custodial role the school plays.\u00a0 Teachers and school personnel really hate it that schools are mostly in the position of being tax funded daycares, but that is a huge part of what keeps the doors open.We provide safe and engaging places for the kids while parent work or do other activities vital to life. The special ed. buses are all equipped with a wheelchair lift.\u00a0 While they may be a bit shorter than other route buses, they are still quite large.\u00a0 I drove these for community outings for about 7 years, and often the lift would malfunction resulting in either manually getting a kid off or us not being able to go.\u00a0 One time we had to back a bus up so that a deployed lift fit into the emergency door of a second bus, so a kid could get down and off!\u00a0 It was a real pain when the lift was stuck on the open position and we were out in the community. I\u2019m getting yet one more student in a wheelchair.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m going to have room for everyone to lay down, stretch out or move around very much.\u00a0 I arranged my room to create more spaces than every for this purpose, but we\u2019re still going to be short! Thank you for enduring my rambling on about this topic.\u00a0 I\u2019m so tired, I\u2019m lucky to be half coherent at all!

{"date": "2009/08/18", "body": "This article by Jay Matthews  from the Washington Post does a good job of summarizing just exactly why the special education field is so litigious and combative. Even when a parent does all of the right things, follows all of the procedures and attempts to work with the school system to best meet the needs of their children, the school system still finds a way to screw parents and neglect the student. So now everyone has to get a lawyer, which helps drive up the cost of education even higher. \nEven though I\u2019m employed by the school system, I do see part of my job as advocating and helping to protect parents from a system that would otherwise trample them to smithereens. Now with a tough economy and declining revenues, school systems are having to set their priorities more rigidly, and we are reminded as to why the IDEA, ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are all needed. It\u2019s needed to protect the rights of those who otherwise would be left behind. In our  Soviet-Style education system, Our educational system is essentially a Soviet-style government-run monopoly that could only be loved by the likes of Lenin and Stalin. the educational needs of individual students are subverted in order to accommodate the priorities of the larger state community. The national government curriculum that is being developed is not being designed with the needs of my students in mind. If your son or daughter does not fall within the \u201caverage\u201d range, it\u2019s not being developed with them in mind either. Basically, the more nationalized, homogenized and standardized the educational system gets, the less tolerant it is toward individual needs and differences. \nSo while the lawyers go back and forth, Miguel either remains in his public school, and falls further and further behind. Or his family goes destitute in an effort to privately finance the education that he so desperately needs, while the school system continues to tax its citizens for an education that is not meeting the needs of its most needy citizens. \nThere are things I don\u2019t understand about Miguel\u2019s case. First of all, his mother was able to get an independent evaluation (several of them, actually) and the school system seemed to reject all of them. In light of a recent supreme court ruling, it seems as though the school system is clearly in the wrong because they are refusing to identify Miguel as Learning Disabled, despite clear and overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This case seems to mirror that case identically ( Forrest Grove School District v T.A. 2009 ) or at least up to the stage where Miguel begins attending a private school. I thought the school system had their own team of lawyers?  How can they be so ignorant? Basically, the school system attempts to keep the gate shut by refusing to identify individuals has having learning disabilities at all. This is happening all over the country more and more as Response To Intervention (RTI) begins to be more widely and irresponsibly used to deny and delay services. Second, even after an individual is identified, the school system often drags its feet on actually serving the student. And finally, often when services are provided, it is often executed very poorly by individuals who may or may not be highly qualified. Or in some cases, the conditions under which services are delivered make such services ineffective such as in an area that is overcrowded. The only thing I can recommend to parents is to push back against the tide that threatens to roll over your children. Institutions can be extremely insensitive until you are willing and able to inflict some substantial pain upon them, usually in the form of monetary damages. While I work for such an institution, my primary concern is for the student and his/her needs, not the needs of collective machinery at the board office or even the administrative office in the building where I work. I believe my fellow teachers who work with the students every day feel the same way. I do feel mostly supported by my peers and the parents of my students. But by administrators and legislators? Not so much. My students fall outside of the margins of the masses and the many and as a result so do I. My needs are foreign and intrusive because my students are regarded as foreign and intrusive. So this year, I am pushing back more. I dislike having to be combative, ornery, whiny and demanding. However, NOT doing so results in nothing happening except an already poor situation deteriorating even further. Somewhere, I have to draw the line and attempt to hold it. \nOn a more positive note, I have had the opportunity to speak to several classes of regular education teachers and students regarding many of the noises they hear from my students and classroom. It has been extremely positively received. I find myself more and more impressed by the \u201cregular\u201d kids after speaking to them and addressing their concerns and questions. Prior to visiting, there were a lot of complaints from teachers to administrators about the loudness of my group. Hopefully as the year goes on, we can minimize that loudness as the students (both mine and the rest of the school) adjust to a new schedule and new people.

{"date": "2008/10/02", "body": "\u00a0When you all went through your Georgia alternate Assessment (GAA) training, you may have encountered a slide that looked something like this: \n What is a prerequisite skill \n \n In order for an instructional task to align as a prerequisite skill, it must address the specific aspects of the element. \n \n In the case of this standard/element, the prerequisite skill would have to somehow address the concept of variables or missing values. \n Although mathematical symbols are often associated with algebra,  it is not necessary  to be able to use or identify them in order to be able to solve for a variable. \n \n \n For most students with significant cognitive disabilities, it may never be meaningful, purposeful, or attainable to solve higher grade-level algebraic equations that require the understanding of mathematical symbols.  \n But they can do Algebra \n \n The bold, italicized part is what I\u2019d like to direct your attention to.\u00a0 You can see the  full Power Point here , and this happens to be from slide #20.\u00a0 And that last statement is pretty funny just by itself.\u00a0 \u201cBut they can do Algebra.\u201d\u00a0 B.F. Skinner  taught pigeons to play ping pong , so it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that most students with severe cognative disabilities could learn a bit of algebra.\u00a0 But even Skinner realized that teaching pigeons to do tricks like this wasn\u2019t particularly useful.\u00a0\u00a0If teaching these kids to do Algebra is not purposeful or meaningful, just exactly why are we spending ungodly amounts of money\u00a0trying to do it and then showing that we did it?\u00a0 At least the pigeons are entertaining!\u00a0 \u00a0 Kids aren\u2019t pigeons and when it takes hundreds and possibly thousands of trials to teach the simplest of tasks, it stands to reason that the best use of limited time and resources would be spent on teaching tasks that are purposeful, meaningful and attainable.\u00a0 But that is our government at work. So I have developed a bit of a template for choosing tasks for the GAA, and once I got in the groove, it made the experience a lot less traumatic for me and the students.\u00a0 What it involved was looking at how I was going to show improvement between collection period #1 and collection period #2.\u00a0 Since the entire GAA lasts less than 6 months (plus there\u2019s a lot of breaks in between) there is little chance that a student will master a grade level task in that amount of time, especially at the high school level.\u00a0 Progress might occur, but I have students that still can not recognize their name or their own face after 15+ years of instruction.\u00a0 Let\u2019s be realistic. Fortunately there are many ways to show progress, and by employing a simple strategy you can do it and still keep most of your hair. \u2013 Decreasing the prompt level: getting the student to accomplish a task more independently is progress.\u00a0 In collection period #1, the bar is set relatively low.\u00a0 you are introducing the standard, topic, and prerequisite skill to them.\u00a0 This task will not necessarily differ from\u00a0how their peers are introduced to a new topic. You are going to present something to them or have them read it.\u00a0 Since our kids can\u2019t read, you can read it to them.\u00a0 Or you can show a video, movie or presentation on the topic.\u00a0 The interaction the student has with the topic will look pretty minimal.\u00a0 Like their regular peers, they are vessels being passively filed with knowledge and wisdom.\u00a0 You could show a student the movie  Tom Sawyer   and document the student watching it.\u00a0 Note the student\u2019s attention level, interest, mood and any reactions they make to the movie or story.\u00a0 Maybe get them to point to the screen.\u00a0 Take pictures.\u00a0 This is task one. Task two might be looking at flashcards or working with the vocabulary of the topic.\u00a0 Almost everey subject involves new vocabulary, so this is an easy one.\u00a0 You can put the new words on a voice output device and have them practice \u201csaying\u201d the words.\u00a0 Include lots of prompting and document that prompting level.\u00a0 At this initial stage, there should be lots of it.\u00a0 Take notes and take pictures. I do use mostly pictures, but occasionally go into audio and video to document what\u00a0I do.\u00a0 I take  tons  of pictures and video.\u00a0 In order to document a single task with a series\u00a0of 4-5 pictures, I will take  hundreds of shots\u2026of each student.\u00a0 Even students not taking the GAA are going to get in on the photo shoot.\u00a0 While GAA spurs me on to do this, I make it worth my while by puting together big slide show productions for parents and\u00a0these are\u00a0video presentations my kids really like watching.\u00a0 But the point is, is that you really need to have a ton of documentation in order to pick and choose the best.\u00a0 Often, I\u2019ll do video, sound and photos at the exact same time and then pick which one I like best later.\u00a0 The point is that you want the flexibility that comes with having choices.\u00a0 My first year, I didn\u2019t have enough choices for my evidence and the only ones I had were lousy.\u00a0 So now I start collecting early and I collect all the time with the goal of getting the right sort of documentation that looks the best. Collection period #1 is a set up for collection period #2.\u00a0 I know exactly what we\u2019re doing for collection period #2 before I even finish #1.\u00a0 In the first period, the bar is intentionally low and more realistically mirrors the experience they would get in a typical classroom.\u00a0 I deliberately keep things low tech and the involvement low with high prompting levels and rates.\u00a0 In collection period #2, it\u2019s time to pull out all the stops and get that student interacting with the material as much as possible in the best way possible.\u00a0 This is where I bring out all of my high tech adaptive technology.\u00a0 Now the student can read independently using his/her switches.\u00a0 They can read an adaptation of stories and textbook using a switch and having the material on a power point.\u00a0 The student might even be able to  present a power point to a class!\u00a0 I\u2019ll use my voice output devices and Intellikeys and whatever else I can get to bring the student more fully into the content.\u00a0 This second collection period is also when I generalize outside of my classroom and into the general ed. setting and into the comunity.\u00a0 Get them listening and speaking with other people nd you have this part of the GAA covered.\u00a0 So a task for this period involves reading more indepently, speaking with others and doing more manipulating.\u00a0 A second task will involve some sort of test or quiz for mastery.\u00a0 This can be identifying characters, elements, figures, historical people or whatever from an array of 2 or three.\u00a0 Again, I\u2019ll use some technology like a switch to enable the student to complete this as independently as possible.\u00a0 If you work on this on an ongoing basis for the rest of the semester, you can really make things less painful for you later on.\u00a0 That is,  DO NOT procrastinate! \u00a0 You can wait on filling out entry sheets, but you need to be collecting something pretty much every single day from now until Thanksgiving.\u00a0 Then between Thanksgiving and Christmas, you are just putting the portfolios together.\u00a0  Keep a planning sheet on each child  and check off each task/subject as you complete it.\u00a0 A lot of the training you get regarding the GAA is all about the regulations and format of it, without getting into details on how exactly you\u2019re going to make this work.\u00a0 That\u2019s because the people who come up with this stuff\u00a0don\u2019t really know.\u00a0 All they know is that they can do Algebra.\u00a0  gaa-blank-planning-sheet \u00a0 I already have the ELA tasks pretty well nailed down, and have a good start on my math tasks.\u00a0 For science I want to do states of matter, but how to you graphically represent \u201cgas\u201d?\u00a0 Boardmaker doesn\u2019t have anything so I\u2019m going to have to either make up my own or find a different standard.\u00a0 Any ideas? Good luck! D.

{"date": "2008/10/07", "body": "I was trying to catch up on some blog reading and checked in with one of  my favorites  today (I don\u2019t visit as often as I ought).  I followed  her link  to the  PETA website , and sure enough there was that abominable billboard, trying to connect dairy with autism.  Once again, those who are peddling fear, misinformation and general ignorance are on the make at the expense of those who have children who are autistic.  The exploitation of autism for personal or political gain knows no bounds, does it?  Whether you\u2019re an aging centerfold model looking for more attention and money or an organization looking to further a political agenda, autism is like an over ripe golden apple just waiting to be exploited and harvested. A good deal of my outrage on this particular issue is personal.  You see, I was raised on a dairy farm.  Any kid who was raised on a dairy farm would laugh hysterically at the mere suggestion that dairy cattle are not treated ethically or humanely.  These animals have to be among the most humanely and ethically treated creatures in the entire world!  They are pampered to excess by their owners!  Any proper dairyman (or woman) will tell you that the production of milk is as much of a state of mind as it is proper nutrition for the animal. They need to feel comfortable in order to produce the most milk.  That means they have to be happy, non stressed and healthy.  A happy contented cow is a major milk producing cow. This is in contrast to the lives of those who are actually milking and caring for the cows.  Happiness, contentment and lack of stress are not prerequisites for being able to milk a cow.  My siblings and I  hated  milking cows.  And yet, we were expected to do it.  There is no such thing as a 5 day-a-week cow.  It was 365 days/year.  We couldn\u2019t go on long vacations or travel more than 4hours from home as a family because we had to be back home to take care of the bloody cattle.  Those cattle  ruled  over us!  Everything we did was in service to  their  needs!  So this crap about not treating them ethically is total rubbish.  Chickens and pigs, yeah I might partially understand that.  Perhaps even beef cattle.  But not dairy cattle.  PETA is off their rocker.  But that\u2019s not where the personal side of this story ends.  Oh no, there is more. About 16 years after I milked my last cow, I became a father to a boy on the autistic spectrum.  He was all kinds of colicky and never really breast fed due to a stint in the NICU.  Since his mother had a mild milk allergy, she figured his crankiness and reflux was due to him having a milk allergy.  We never tested him for it, it was just sort of assumed.  So he got the lactose-free formula and then when he started drinking \u201cmilk\u201d he was drinking soy milk.  All this occurred mostly before we even knew he was on the autistic spectrum.  And for years, we never really questioned it. Fast forward to 3 months ago.  Jane decided to test Thomas for allergies because he complained about stomach ache and headaches at school.  Those symptoms mostly disappeared once school was out, but Jane still went ahead with the tests.  By the time the test results came back, Thomas didn\u2019t really exhibit any physical symptoms of whatever was bugging him a couple months earlier.  But the results were kind of shocking.  The tests did show an extremely mild reaction to milk.  However there was one thing that he was so allergic to, that it was absolutely and literally off the chart.  Yep, that would be SOY!  So, we are on a soy-free diet and he does drink regular milk but not without protesting sometimes. And he is still autistic.  He was before any of the diets and he\u2019s remained so after whatever diet/fad we\u2019ve tried.  He\u2019s on the somewhat mild side of the spectrum (or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m hopeful of) but he is still himself.  He does not need to be cured as much as he needs to be self-assured that he is okay.  He needs to know that he is safe, that he can eat things without worrying whether or not whatever he eats is going to poison him.  Paranoia is an extremely contagious condition, and unfortunately I know of no vaccine against it other than a good healthy dose of skepticism. Even that isn\u2019t going to make you immune to fear, guilt, shame, worry, insecurity and other assorted neurotic psychopathologies that organizations like PETA are trying to introduce.  Let\u2019s face it; you don\u2019t advertise without the hope that your message goes viral.  PETA was trying to introduce a pathogenic virus into the consciousness of those who saw their billboard in order to infect the population with fear, shame and guilt by using autism as a primary vector.  This is more dangerous and costly than West Nile or Bird Flu because it preys on the fear mongering already sown by other infectious agents who want to depict autism as a horrible death sentence.\u00a0 Fortunately it was taken down but probabl not without already infecting a large segment of the New Jersey population. I do wish the CDC would do something about the contagion that seems to grip and handicap any meaningful discussion of autism and those who have it. D.

{"date": "2009/08/20", "body": "I just had a local teacher email me asking for some hints on doing a GAA with a student with profound disabilities.  Is it possible?  Yes it is, and I\u2019ve done it more than once, each time successfully.  I could get a potato through the GAA and show progress. It\u2019s a bit of a charade, but it\u2019s possible to get anyone through the GAA as long as you have an open mind!  Even if the student is in a coma, they can do a GAA and show progress.  I know it\u2019s stupid, but as long as we\u2019re all willing to wink and carry on and follow the rules, I\u2019m willing to try to keep my outrage to a minimum.  Just don\u2019t change the rules.   At this point, you\u2019ll have to look at the academic standards for the student\u2019s grade level from the  2009-2010 blueprint .  I just scrolled down to the 7 th  grade standards and they are not too far off from what I do at the high school.  So I\u2019ll give you a basic setup on some possible tasks:   ELA #1 \u2013 Reading comprehension: I think every grade has some sort of reading comprehension.  At the high school, we have specific areas, like American literature, nonfiction or poetry.  Basically, I pick a book or story that has some support with it, or that it will be easy to make things for.  During the first collection period, I read the story to the student and have him point to some of the pictures.  Take pictures of him pointing, or (better yet) of you holding his hands pointing.  You want to keep the baseline very low at this point.  Of course, if he can point independently, sure go with that.  But for someone who is seriously profound you will be hand-over-hand.  Get pictures of this.  The second task involves watching a movie to TV show of the story.  Same rules apply, where I get pictures of the student watching and perhaps being physically prompted to touch the screen.  Keep it all pretty simple and low tech.  Remember, this is a baseline and you\u2019ll have to show progress from this point.   ELA #2 \u2013 listening, speaking, viewing \u2013 I think everyone has this one, too.  I have one task that involves a basic scripted conversation: \u201cHi\u201d, \u201cHow are you\u201d I\u2019m fine\u201d and \u201cGoodbye.\u201d  This is pretty basic and can be done with a step-by-step single switch or a Gotalk 4+ or similar device.  This is the one time where you might try to use audio or video, because the conversation is already scripted and programmed.  But I stick to captioned photographs, because I like that medium of data collection and it has always worked for me.  The second task could be a different way of giving information or answering questions.  I like something like requesting food, because that opens me up to generalization later.  We can start at the school cafeteria (or home or hospital) and then expand to ordering at a restaurant during that second collection period thus showing progress and generalization.  I\u2019m always thinking of how to increase the level of independence, sophistication or achievement in order to show progress.  Actual achievement is the variable that I have the least amount of control and certainty over, so I program progress into it by increasing independence and sophistication using technology.  Collection period #1 is very low tech and very simple.  Collection period #2 gets very technologically sophisticated and fancy.   Algebra \u2013 I usually use modeling addition, but we\u2019re still on QCC standards at the high school, so you\u2019ll have something different.  But the basic template is the same.  Pick two tasks that demonstrate the same concept and keep it very simple for the first collection period, and use hand-over-hand.  During the second collection, you can hook a switch to a laptop and do all sorts of cool things.  As long as the student can hit the switch (with or without your help) they can show progress.   Geometry \u2013 I\u2019m all about doing stuff with shapes.  Again, collection period one involves drawing hand-over-hand and pointing to shapes hand-over-hand.  The second collection period involved using a computer and a switch to do some different things more independently.  Getting the student to become a switch user is a big key, here.   Social studies \u2013 This used to be difficult for me, until they opened up all the standards.  Looking at the 7 th  grade blueprint, you have some nice options.  We picked Mexico and did a ton of activities surrounding that place and culture.  Collection period #1 involved just looking at books and video, where collection #2 involved doing activities and accessing material using the computer and technology.  We actually had so much fun, that we sort of went \u201caround the world\u201d and did a mess of countries and cultures, and talked about food, music and traditions.    Science \u2013 I\u2019ve done both biology and physical science tasks and the key is finding sufficient things to support what you\u2019ll do in the second collection period and two separate tasks.  Again, one task could involve reading a book or watching a video while the other involved actually doing something with some material.  For biology, we planted some seeds, and this was the activity for collection period #1.  Collection period 2 involved watering, measuring and perhaps comparing two different plants or similar plants under different conditions.  Timing it tricky with live plants as if you start too late, your plants might catch the frost!  Start too early, and your administrator might have issues with the dating of the material compared to the rest of your subjects.  You\u2019ll have to watch the 3 week window.   A lot of things I\u2019ve said might not make any sense to you right now, but hopefully you\u2019ll get some basic GAA training that will flesh this process out for you.  There\u2019s a bunch of niggling rules and details I\u2019m skipping over, but my experience is that planning and designing the tasks is the hardest part.  Once that is done, the other stuff fits in and things can be adjusted.   At this point in time, look for whatever it is you think you might want to use for your reading comprehension.  See what other grade-level teachers are using.  Then, see if you can find an adaptation of it, such as a graphic novel.  Also, if there is a movie of it, you\u2019ll have a nice package.  For instance,  Frankenstein  has many adaptations.  If you go to the  Significant Disability GA DOE Website , and scroll way down, you\u2019ll find a whole unit of activities that uses this story. Hope this helps!\r\n I It\u2019s a bit of a charade, but it\u2019s possible to gehrough the GAA as long as you have an open mind!  Even if the student is in a coma, they can do a GAA and show progress.  I know it\u2019s stupid, but as long as we\u2019re all willing to wink and carry on and follow the rules, I\u2019m willing to try to keep my outrage to a minimum.

{"date": "2008/10/03", "body": "Okay, I suppose its about time I weigh in on the big election race, since that is one of the biggest stories around the nation and around the world.\u00a0 I am sure there is considerable buzz and excitement within the disability/special education community concerning Sarah Palin\u2019s candidacy for Vice President.\u00a0 One of the very first things she noted in her acceptance speech was that she will be an advocate for families of children with special needs.\u00a0 And this is a very positive thing in her favor, indeed. But I want to talk for a few seconds about how the candidates have been handling education issues, in general.\u00a0 That is to say, they have absolutely NOT been handling it at all.\u00a0 Obama was the first to bring it up at the tail end of his debate with John McCain last Tuesday, and basically it was about funding NCLB.\u00a0 The primary position of his party has been one of saying that the main problem of NCLB is funding.\u00a0 I certainly do agree that this business of passing unfunded mandates is an extremely nasty habit in Washington, and education is the most frequent recipient of this shabby treatment.\u00a0 In fact, if you fail to pony up and comply, they\u2019ll take away what little funding you already get from the feds.\u00a0 Neither party has  ever seriously considered fully funding IDEA, and this is something that has been on the books for 35 years.\u00a0 Why would NCLB get any better treatment?\u00a0 However, the problems with NCLB go much deeper than just money.\u00a0 It lacks fundamental fairness and undermines IDEA by forcing a one-size-fits-all approach to education.\u00a0 It buttresses a factory-style education system developed to produce factory workers.\u00a0 What is the future of factory workers in America in the 21st century?\u00a0 Anyway, neither presidential candidate has bothered much with education as an issue.\u00a0  Edin08  has been a dismal failure as far as raising awareness of education issues in this campaign.\u00a0 An opportunity to\u00a0 lay out new ground and \u201cbuild a bridge to the future\u201d has been squandered.\u00a0 If you\u2019re concerned about education, you\u2019re going to have to hold your nose in this election.\u00a0 I will say for my part, the senate election is actually a bigger one for me, because I\u2019m going to see to it that  Saxby Chambliss will not be voting to reauthorize  NCLB. So back to Ms. Palin\u2026 When\u00a0I first heard about John McCain\u2019s pick for VP, I was as shocked as everyone else.\u00a0 I figured Romney or even Huckabee would be more natural choices.\u00a0 Who was this woman?\u00a0 so like everyone else, I went and searched for whatever I could find out about her.\u00a0 The fact that her youngest son had Down syndrome was one of the earliest bits of interesting information to come out about her.\u00a0 Not long after that, there was all the stuff about the state trooper scandal, her oldest daughter\u2019s pregnancy and all that.\u00a0 I watched her announcement speech and she seemed pretty\u2026well awfully pretty!\u00a0 She also seemed very confident and well-poised.\u00a0 As a former Huckabeesupporter, I was actually happy with the choice on a lot of levels.\u00a0 Her speech at the convention was truly electrifying in a lot of ways.\u00a0 But after that speech, a couple of things bothered me.\u00a0 First off, John McCain was with her every single time she was out on the campaign trail.\u00a0 It was like he was some sort of guardian angel for her or something.\u00a0 She never did or said anything without him being right there, and I saw that as him having to hold her hand.\u00a0 It was just an embarrassing display of paternalism or condescension or maybe even sexism.\u00a0 Heck if I know.\u00a0 I actually suspected that while she might be cute and poised, she might also be kind of dumb, like many other beauty pageant contestants.\u00a0 The stereotype is there for a reason.\u00a0 Heaven knows, I would rather look at her than Joe Biden the next 4 years, but not if she\u2019s going to be incompetent.\u00a0 The interviews she had with Katie Couric and Charlie Gibson were partially journalistic hack jobs.\u00a0 Bush Doctrine?\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure I even agree with how that is being pinned on GW.\u00a0 And it is perfectly reasonable that intelligent people can say that it is possible for the earth to cool and warm regardless of what people do i.e global warming.\u00a0 The passport question was dumb at the outset.\u00a0 While the questions about foreign policy were sort of on target, no questions like that were  ever asked by the media about Obama\u2019s experienced.\u00a0 And then when Palin couldn\u2019t give exact answers on McCain\u2019s record of asking for more regulations, Couric just kept dogging her on it over and over.\u00a0 Having said all that, Palin\u2019s repertoire of answers have been narrow, at best.\u00a0 She talks about energy, she talks about giving power back to the people, she talks about being a hockey mom.\u00a0 She talks about being a maverick and\u00a0she talks about reforming Washington.\u00a0 Those are her talking points.\u00a0 In light of that, her mention of education in the debate was a breath of fresh air from the usual agenda and script.\u00a0 She did bring up some hostility toward NCLB, which you\u2019ll notice Biden simply said was underfunded.\u00a0 I give Palin high marks for not calling it \u201c George Bush\u2019s  No  child Left Behind .\u201d\u00a0 She\u2019s the only one on the ticket of either party who didn\u2019t vote for it.\u00a0 That alone gets some support from me.\u00a0 But at the same time, she was too vague about what she might do and Trig isn\u2019t old enough yet for her to know much about how IDEA has been gutted and disemboweled by NCLB.\u00a0 I thought she held her own in the debate okay, but I would really like to see her more on her own before the election.\u00a0 Sure she might be an advocate for the special needs community, but she\u2019s not going to be much of an advocate if she\u2019s seen as being dumb and incompetent.\u00a0 She really hasn\u2019t proven much to me and I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s proven enough to get my vote.\u00a0 I\u2019ve swung to third party candidates more than once before in order to escape having to make such a stinky choice.\u00a0 If Obama could make a spirited effort to address education beyond just spending more money, he could still get my vote.\u00a0 But I think it was the federalization of our schools that has gotten us in this mess in the first place.\u00a0 Obama is not going to lessen federal involvement and regulation because he has consistently chosen MORE regulation and federal management. I think I\u2019m going to hear someone say something about bank regulation and the need for more and how our current financial crisis was caused by the lack of oversight.\u00a0 Let\u2019s nip that right now.\u00a0\u00a0There was actually TOO MUCH oversight in the form of of the  Community Reinvestment Act , that actually rewarded banks for making these bad loans.\u00a0 Mainly, it was more regulation and interference by Washington that  caused this crisis  in the first place.\u00a0 Regulation by the feds in order to combat one form of abuse resulted in an abuse of a far more serious nature.\u00a0 D.

{"date": "2008/10/13", "body": "I have been bashing No Child Left Behind pretty much nonstop for the last 3 years. \u00a0  Most educators hate it with a flamey white hot passion. \u00a0  NCLB has done some very bad things for education, teaching and students.  \u00a0 I will return to my regularly scheduled  \u00a0 NCLB bashing right after this little break. So what are some good things that have happened since the passage of NCLB? \u00a0  Let me list them\u2026. 1. Okay! \u00a0  Thanks for stopping by and don\u2019t forget to drop a comment in the box! \u00a0 \u00a0 Okay, seriously, there are a couple of things that I would consider improvements under NCLB. First, because of the new emphasis on a standards-based curriculum, schools seem a bit more streamlined in their mission and focus. \u00a0  By that, I mean in the past schools seemed a bit lost in their mission and seemed focused on mitigating various social ills and inequalities. \u00a0  The mission was so diffused that they couldn\u2019t do  anything  right. \u00a0  Schools are still expected to accomplish more things, but now that emphasis is codified within state standards. \u00a0  This does have some very real consequences within special education, especially the goals and objectives, but that is an entirely different post. Another benefit that I am going to have to allow is the fact that many students within \u201cthe golden band\u201d have benefitted. \u00a0  That is, those students who were just below the line in proficiency. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In fact, we have seen some students who were further behind catch up faster than expected within this year\u2019s 9 th  grade class. \u00a0  Every 9 th  grader with a mild disability is in a regular class, and most of those classes are co-taught. \u00a0  This is good for the co-teaching even though co-teaching is an expensive proposition. \u00a0  This is the one big area where funding could do a lot of good. \u00a0  Within my own class, this focus on academics has pretty much taken me off the hook for a lot of the stuff we used to have to do. \u00a0  Technically, as a teacher, this is a positive thing. \u00a0  As a parent, this would not be a very good thing. \u00a0  However, remember the focus is on the state standards. \u00a0  We can not justify spending time and money on things that are not focused on the standards. \u00a0  Communication has become a more critical area and as we try to get our students to respond and adaptive technology has been stressed more. \u00a0  Schools could use more monetary help in this area, too. \u00a0  Specific grants towards adaptive technology research as well as developing more open source solutions would benefit schools and parents who are all under budget restrictions. \u00a0  But in the meantime, toileting, feeding and social skills are fading from the table because they are not standards-based. \u00a0  The school\u2019s mission is to deliver the state-mandated curriculum, and since NCLB trumps IDEA, that is where teachers are going to be spending most of their time. I have had to develop my sense of humor, and in that respect NCLB has enriched me. \u00a0  I sit with my little groups studying American literature, algebra, geometry and all manner of social studies and science. \u00a0  \u00a0 The few brave teachers who darken my door walk in, look and then shake their heads in amazement before walking out. \u00a0  I am taking thousands of photos of us doing this stuff, and it is pretty crazy. \u00a0  I manage to bring things down to their level but am thinking about simply abandoning all the prerequisites and just get pictures of them doing some calculus, Latin and AP economics along with some physics. \u00a0  Why not? \u00a0  I\u2019ve had to stretch my concept of \u201cteaching\u201d and \u201clearning\u201d in order to make the curriculum fit with my kids. \u00a0  Again, a wry sense of humor does not hurt, because if you take any of this too seriously, it will depress you beyond words. \u00a0  My creativity has been tested and over time I think I\u2019m getting more clever about how to work the system and have some fun with it at the same time. \u00a0  As you can see, many of the \u201cgood\u201d things are rather mixed and half of them are as personal benefits that may or may not have anything to do with student achievement. \u00a0  \u201cStudent achievement\u201d is more than simply one test score, and I\u2019ve been challenged this year with finding creative ways to measure and track it unlike the federal government who has no interest in creativity. \u00a0 Tags:  NCLB ,  No Child Left Behind ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/a-few-nice-words-about-nclb/", "title": "A Few NICE Words About\u00a0NCLB"},
{"date": "2008/10/17", "body": "This year, I have probably the best para team that I\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had many good paras, but the ones this year are 100% competent, educated and looking forward to becoming teachers on their own.\u00a0 The trouble has been that I haven\u2019t truly been utilizing them to their fullest potential and have not really challenged them enough.\u00a0 This is a real common weakness among teachers who would rather work together as colleagues (or even work alone) rather than supervise and evaluate.\u00a0 As teachers, we would just as soon have our paras just know what to do and do it without having to be told.\u00a0 Telling someone who we regard as a colleague what to do is an awkward thing.\u00a0 But from a para perspective, the situation is even more awkward. On one hand, we like our paras to take initiative.\u00a0 But on the other hand, we like them to have good judgement.\u00a0 \u201cGood Judgement\u201d means doing things the way WE would do them, which involves a higher degree of mind reading than you might think.\u00a0 Mind reading is definitely on a higher pay grade than that of most paras.\u00a0 Sometimes you can click just right, which I\u2019ve been able to do with some over the years, or at least come close to it.\u00a0 Other times, it can be a long battle which neither the para nor\u00a0 the teacher really want to fight.\u00a0 I see more passive-aggressive battles between teachers and paras than anywhere else.\u00a0 These three people that I have are pretty good but vastly underutilized.\u00a0 I needed to find some why to see if I could better utilize them and take advantage of their abilities.\u00a0 I also wanted to see what those abilities were.\u00a0 I also wondered how possible it would be to assess thei competentce.\u00a0So, I designed a bit of a competition between them. At first, it seemed like a good idea.\u00a0 But then after I had mapped it out, it seemed a bit crazy and stupid.\u00a0 so I just threw it out to them to see what they thought.\u00a0 To my surprise they bought into it.\u00a0 Or at least they seemed to.\u00a0 I have two paras who are pretty competetive.\u00a0 Coach#3 (no surprise there) and my other new para who I\u2019ll just call Georgianne.\u00a0 I\u2019d call her Georgia, but that might get too confusing since that\u2019s the state we live in.\u00a0 And she is a Bulldog fan, so it fits.\u00a0 Georgianne is VERY competitive and seems pretty driven.\u00a0 The other two will not be given any slack.\u00a0 The third, Patience, has been with me for a few years and is the most experienced.\u00a0 She\u2019s also not as competetive but is up for the challenge if she\u2019ll take it on. Basically, each pra has a student they work with independently, while I work with another small group.\u00a0 I outlined 5 basic skills on which I would assess each of those students. 1. Tell me \u201chow many\u201d using a Gotalk if I show them a certain number of objects (1-4) 2.\u00a0 Point to a number 1-9 3. Correctly answer \u201cWhat is your name\u201d by pointing to their own face on a Gotalk. 4. Point to a correct shape (circle, square, triangle, star). 5. Draw a circle, square or circle. \u00a0Plus they each would have to be able to answer 5 yes-no questions.\u00a0\u00a0 I already told them the questions, so it\u2019s no secret.\u00a0 No need to make this harder than it already is.\u00a0 The students really are pretty evenly matched.\u00a0 However, in order to compensate for this, each para will be trying to teach a set of three pictures/words to 2 of my other students.\u00a0 Each para has three pictures, so if I say \u201cpoint to the kite\u201d the student\u00a0will point to the correct picture from an array of three.\u00a0 So I\u2019ll see if any of the paras succeed in teaching either or both of these students how to identify their pictures. Part of the design of this is to stretch the paras but it also hopefully will\u00a0get them to interact\u00a0with two students they are less likely to engage with on a more regular basis in instructional tasks.\u00a0\u00a0 It gives them a challenge to shoot for, and it is pretty easily measured.\u00a0 These are pretty much all discrete trial tasks.\u00a0 The fact of the matter is that my time for interacting with each of these students seems really limited and so I\u2019m expanding their instructional time by giving the paras a more explicit direction in which to travel. I haven\u2019t promised the winner anything except bragging rights, as of yet.\u00a0 I think I could manage to put $20 on the line easily enough, tho.\u00a0 Any ideas what else would be a worthwhile thing to offer the winner of such a contest? It\u2019s as much of a study as a contest, and I\u2019ll be there to help each of them however I can.\u00a0 Getting them to more fully committ to the outcome might help shake loose some additional questions and issues.\u00a0 I primarily do group work, plus deal with the most profound students plus all the other things we have to do with toiletting and feeding. \u00a0 It will be interesting to see how this thing works.\u00a0 Is it crazy?\u00a0 Too compettitive?\u00a0 It does have the virtue of being novel, and I\u2019m not sure I would have tried it with a different group of paras than the ones I have this year.\u00a0 It just so happens that I have 3 who\u00a0I think can handle it and they think they can handle it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll just have to see.

{"date": "2009/08/27", "body": "There\u2019s a huge push in Georgia and around the country relating to parent involvement, and right this minute  there is one going on in the metro Atlanta  area sponsored by  WSB-TV  and  Bethere.org .  And there is a lot of research that indicates that parent involvement is one of the key elements of a good education as well as well adjusted kids in general, that you can find at the BeThere website. In my county, there are a couple of theme schools (elementary and middle) as well as a high school academy that have parental involvement as the central focus.  Parents sign an agreement that they will volunteer for a number of hours as well as adhere to a list of rules and guidelines.  In exchange, the school promises to deliver a better education and better outcomes based largely on the increased parent involvement. I agree that parental involvement is a crucial element in education.  In fact, I believe parent involvement is more important than the teacher, the principal or the school district in determining academic outcomes.  If you could get rid of the entire educational apparatus and replace it with involved parents for every child, there wouldn\u2019t be an educational crisis in this country. I have a couple of family members who have been home schooling their children, and these kids are absolutely awesome and brilliant.  Of course the parents are awesome and brilliant, too, but these kids are as socially adjusted, confident and creative as anyone you would ever meet anywhere else.  A well-educated and motivated parent can do things that a school system simply can not do. And with the leaps in technology, the gap between what public schools can offer versus what someone educated at home can get is approaching zero.  Throw in some community theater, music, sports and clubs and you\u2019ve got everything pretty much covered.  Homeschooling is the ultimate in parent involvement as it involves dedication and commitment far beyond what any of the local theme schools demand, which is why it isn\u2019t for everyone. We\u2019ve kicked the home school idea around our house.  Jane has been to some home school expos and has a number of friends who are homeschooling their kids.  And my youngest would do really well with it, but he\u2019ll do well no matter where he goes to school.  But my oldest is a big question mark.  Right now he\u2019s getting OT and sppech/language services through the school system via his IEP.  There\u2019s a good resource on home schooling and special needs found at the  Home Schooling Legal Defense Association .  I may hit on that more later. But I do want to speak concerning those of us who are not home schooling and are being asked to be involved.  It\u2019s difficult for responsible parents to NOT be involved, so this movement does strike me as a bit bothersome and condescending.  We all do know parents who aren\u2019t very involved, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any ad campaign having much of an effect on people who are unable or unwilling to be involved.  We do need to face a very real, if unpleasant to educators, fact: the public school system has as a primary function a custodial role; a safe, secure place to keep kids so that parents can go to work or just get a break.  We are paid to babysit as much as educate. There, I said it. Public schools exist, in large part, because parents  don\u2019t want  kids running amok all day.  A few months off in the summer are about all most parents can stand.  They  love  seeing the bus pull up in the fall!  And while many kids won\u2019t admit it, they like having a place to go.  they get fed and looked after and if all goes well they might get an education.  But in any case, they are in a relatively safe, clean, environmentally-controlled place.  Parents can go about their business during the day without having to worry about their kids.  And if they do worry, they have a myriad of people to blame and complain to including the school board, the superintendent, the principal and right down to the teacher.  There are ample opportunities for parents to raise a fuss and be heard.  Plenty of involvement there! Which brings up another aspect of this parental involvement business.  Fact is, schools want parents involved as long as it\u2019s the system calling the shots.  As long as parents volunteer to raise money, schools like parents.  When parents start wanting a voice in how the money is spent, then there may some problems.  In special education, the school system is negatively reinforced for having parents who are not involved.  If a parent isn\u2019t present, an IEP can be done in a much shorter amount of time.  If a parent  is  involved and brings an advocate or attorney, then we\u2019re looking at  hours.  Some parents are in the office a lot, advocating for their child or complaining about something or other.  Some are calling their board representative all the time.  They are already involved quite a bit!  But this is not the sort of involvement the districts involved in the \u201cBe There\u201d campaign are looking for, I suspect. They are looking for parents to be involved with helping their child comply and succeed with the requirements put forth by the state.  They want parents who will help their child (as well as maybe others) with homework, teaching math and literacy and fundraising.  I\u2019m not saying this is a bad thing, but I am saying that any campaign seeking involvement from parents might want to consider all the ways parents are involved, including those who get involved by suing the school system!  I think parent involvement is good when there is good communication and trust between a school and the parents.  In such a system, though, a campaign like \u201cBe There\u201d wouldn\u2019t be necessary. I have a mix in my class. Just by the nature of severe and multiple disabilities, it demands heavy parental involvement.  There\u2019s just no getting around it when a student demands total care and supervision 24/7.  I totally get that, which is why I try not to make a lot of demands on the parents.  They are all doing the best they can.  Most have been pretty supportive over the years, and I think I have a decent relationship with all of them.  After several years, a body tends to develop a sort of trust relationship as my classroom becomes a second home of a sort.  A very CROWDED home, at the moment, but we do the best we can with what we have. What do you think?  Are there some parents who are  too  involved?  Are schools  really  that interested in a reciprocal partnership with parents?

{"date": "2008/10/26", "body": "A typical Sunday ritual for me is to work on lesson plans for the next week.\u00a0 I suspect this is true for many teachers. It helps me re-orient to where I\u2019m heading and what I need to do to get ready for whatever is coming up after doing my best to NOT think about school for the past 48 or so hours. I have struggled with lesson plans for the past 8+ years, but I finally have something that kind of works for me.\u00a0 Unfortunately, I\u2019m not in synch with all the other teachers in my building.\u00a0 What else is new? Basically, the principal wants everyone to turn in lesson plans every week.\u00a0 At first, I had major problems with this, but I quickly realized it is not that big of a deal.\u00a0 Like I say, it helps orient me to the upcoming tasks.\u00a0 However, he is insisting that everyone in the building conform to one lesson plan template.\u00a0 That is a problem for me.\u00a0 The template takes up two pages and there are vast stretches of real estate that do not apply to me and my students.\u00a0 I can get everything I need on one page per subject.\u00a0 I teach the 4 basic subjects (ELA, maths, science, social studies) plus everything else they are going to ever need.\u00a0 And their needs are considerable.\u00a0 At least this seems to be the expectation that I have as a self-contained teacher.\u00a0 With my own template, I stretch that to 6 subjects/plans to more closely align with the GAA.\u00a0 With the template, I\u2019m only doing the basic 4.\u00a0 So the universal template matches a theory (a very flawed one, IMO) but not the practice, at least in my case. I tried the template for 3 weeks.\u00a0 It depressed me, because it includes spaces for remediation, homework, modifications, adaptations, activating strategies, assessment methods, enrichment, and a materials list that is totally inadequate for me.\u00a0 It felt like having to write 4 IEP\u2019s every single week.\u00a0 I really, really wish my kids could do things the way the other kids in the high school do them.\u00a0 I wish I could teach them all the same way with only a few (or many) accomodations and modifications.\u00a0 But there is nothing that I do academically that is  NOT  some sort of modifaction!\u00a0 It is 100% remedial! The template simply reinforces my feeling of being totally separated from the rest of the school in terms of its mission and improvement plan.\u00a0 I\u2019m not raising test scores or increasing the graduation rate. Ironically, I was involved in adapting the universal template a bit to help other teachers be able to use it.\u00a0 It necessarily involved hacking the template and then making a minor adjustment so that the 2 pages could be in a single document.\u00a0 I kept it true to the original format and with some help from a tech person in the building managed to put it back together.\u00a0 Teachers still can\u2019t change the color, font or anything else on it.\u00a0 I disliked it but decided to give it a try.\u00a0 There was some discussion of the lesson plan when it was being developed, so the case was made that it was made with our input.\u00a0 While that is somewhat true, I feel like there should ahve been a follow-up after everyone had a chance to use the thing for a few weeks.\u00a0 The universal template was in a beta stage, at best, when we were told all of us had to use it. One problem that I have (and it would exist no matter what I was teaching) is the utility of a uniform lesson plan template for every teacher.\u00a0 I feel like this is simply taking us further down the road of conformity and stripping away more individuality and creativity.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure why having everyone use the same lesson plan is important.\u00a0 Are we still in a factory model where we are turning out machines that must conform to all the same standards with very small tolerance for deviation?\u00a0 Is it critical for the English teacher to use the exact same lesson plan template as the vocational agriculture teacher?\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Are the administrators who are doing the evaluating incapable of recognizing the presence or absence of the essential elements of the plan?\u00a0 I\u2019m just askin\u2019!\u00a0 Our economy is moving in the opposite direction as our schools, or so it seems to me.\u00a0 Never in my relatively short life span have I seen a time where creativity held such a big premium in the work force.\u00a0 With the emphasis on originality and the creation of new knowledge and content going on, schools are quickly becoming dated institutions.\u00a0 Things like this just reinforce the stone age within which the age of low tolerance for diversity is set.\u00a0 And low tolerance for diversity is the nursery of discrimination.\u00a0 As if me and my students need more of  that! Is anyone else out there who deals with a population like this required to use a uniform lesson plan template?\u00a0 How do you manage/cope? Actually, I\u2019m interested in hearing how all teachers feel about lesson plan templates.\u00a0 Are they good?\u00a0 Or are you indifferent?\u00a0 Or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I\u2019ll attach my own template so you can look at it and then I\u2019ll attach one of the new templates so you can see it.\u00a0 Note that my own plan covers all 6 topics while the new template covers just one.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t like all the wasted space of the new one.

I have a student who has just had a psychological\u00a0evaluation done.\u00a0 In our county, that means hold an IEP meeting.\u00a0 His eligibility isn\u2019t changing, so I have no idea why we have to hold an IEP.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like the IEP committee has the authority to overturn the Central Eligibility Committee, which basically works like some sort of communist politburo when it comes to eligibilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I may turn this into an opportunity to rework and update my IEP series.\u00a0 I\u2019m feeling more of an urge to contribute and expand the knowledge base in this area for both teachers and parents.\u00a0 And while the original series continues to be the most widely read group of articles I\u2019ve ever written, there are a few changes form years ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have enough to do, because I do have more than enough on my plate.\u00a0 It\u2019s that I need the variety and connection offered by the interweb spaces.\n I sort of joke about packing the kids full of sugar, but this time of year there are all sorts of people popping out of the woodwork wanting to feed my students.\u00a0 And we\u2019re not talking broccoli and carrots, it is usually full-on junk.\u00a0 Cupcakes, candy of every sort, ice cream, chips and whatever.\u00a0 No other program in high school is supposed to have a party but mine seems to be the exception.\u00a0 The school community enjoys venting their holiday spirit on the kids, which is nice but really disruptive in a lot of ways. \n The holidays are tough on everyone but especially with students with varying degrees of disabilities.\u00a0 The various flashy Christmas lights and colors really appeal to most people, but to those with sensory and attention deficits, it can easily become overwhelming.\u00a0\u00a0 Our room is pretty heavily decorated for the season, which gives us a variety of Christmas props to use for communication lessons.\u00a0 However all the pageantry is so distracting that there is very little focusing going on.\u00a0 Not that there is that much, even in the best of circumstances!\u00a0 But in addition to the food and the decorations is the constant stream and parade of people who want to come to our room.\u00a0 All. The. Time.\u00a0 While other rooms have their doors closed during instructional time and keep outside disruptions to a minimum, it seems like everyone feels they have a license to walk into our room.\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s to use our kitchen, sometimes to use our bathroom.\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s just walking in from the outside or out from the inside. Even though there is an entrance door leading into the hallway right next to our room, they want to come in here. \n I sometimes think I come off being a scrooge about wanting to lessen the impact of the holidays on our kids and trying to stick to something resembling a normal schedule and routine.\u00a0 But stick a fok in it, we are not getting anywhere for the rest of the week.\u00a0 They are done.\u00a0 We are done.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t have the stamina anymore to fight it! \n As far as my own boys, Thomas and Percy, they are all excited about the holidays.\u00a0 They are looking forward to seeing their grandma (and her cat) when she comes up.\u00a0 We have traditonally minimized the involvement with Santa by exchanging and opening gifts on Christmas Eve.\u00a0 Us adults actually have a shot at sleeping in whilst the boys play with their new toys!\u00a0 And they seem totally okay with it and there just isn\u2019t a whole lot of discussion about it so we\u2019re not out scrooging Christmas for other kids who are into the Santa Claus tradition.\u00a0 Percy\u2019s birthday is also during the break a few days after Christmas which also diverts a lot of attention away from whatever Santa issues might crop up.\u00a0 Getting gifts for them is relatively easy..at least if we get them whatever they want!\u00a0 Percy is fairly easy going and like cars, trucks and musical stuff.\u00a0 He\u2019s thinking Guitar Hero.\u00a0 I\u2019m thinking *I* might like Guitar Hero!LOL!\u00a0 Thomas will like anything having to do with trains, specifically the Thomas the Train franchise.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at trying to expand his interests a bit this year with something like lincoln logs or legos or something along those lines.\u00a0 He like computer games, too, but I haven\u2019t found one that hits the spot, yet. \n As for Jane, she\u2019s pretty easy, too.\u00a0 The other day she was complaining about how hard it was to clean the kitchen floor after all of us had been baking so I\u2019m getting her a brand new mop and mop bucket. \n Just kidding!

{"date": "2008/10/30", "body": "I am currently at war with my school over a really silly, stupid issue. \u00a0  But it does go to a core culture of discrimination against people who have disabilities that is pervasive all through society. \u00a0  I\u2019ll put off blogging the current battle for a bit but go ahead and blog one that took place during my first year with an administration long gone. \u00a0 In 2000, I was part of a room with 2 other teachers and 6 paras. \u00a0  It was a huge operation, but I saw even then how the students and teachers were marginalized to the remote outskirts of school life and culture. \u00a0  A room that was well-suited for teaching the most severely autistic students (i.e. no windows, mirrors and noise) was taken and given to the next door vocational teacher. \u00a0  We were told that this was temporary until they got industrial certification. \u00a0  That was 8 years ago and it was never given back. \u00a0  \u00a0 While the health occupations room next door had a fully equipped handicapped accessible bathroom, our students had to go all the way to the other end of the building to use a special restroom by the gym. \u00a0  The closest wheelchair accessible drinking fountain was on the opposite side of the building from the gym through another set of double doors. \u00a0  By the time a wheelchair student went through all that to get a drink, he would need another one by the time he/she got back! \u00a0  \u00a0 Then we got a student who needed to be changed and catheterized 2x and the only place we had was our little computer room on a computer table. \u00a0  The administration at the time wanted the school nurse to have no part in catherizing this student. \u00a0 It was an appalling situation. \u00a0  I had fire in my gut from just having my own son diagnosed with a form of autism. \u00a0  So it was that I filed a  section 504  complaint against the entire administration listing how they were seemingly and actively discriminating against these students. \u00a0  And this was done without the considerable knowledge of disabilities and the law that I have today. \u00a0  But it did get everyone\u2019s attention. \u00a0  We ended up meeting with the county special education director to address the complaints. \u00a0  Notably missing from that meeting were the principal and associate principal who were the ones who I had the biggest beef with. \u00a0  The principal retired and the associate didn\u2019t talk to me for a year. \u00a0  And that was only after one of my students kicked in the shin. \u00a0  We ended up making peace once she darkened my door and saw what I was doing and who I was doing it with. \u00a0  She was a lot more supportive then. \u00a0 I wish I could say that I was totally victorious in that war. \u00a0  I had to wage this war for several years. \u00a0  We got a changing table and a place to catheterize and change our student\u20266 months after I filed the complaint. \u00a0  The nurse was available to use whenever I needed simply because I forced the issue and defied administrative directives not to get the nurse involved. \u00a0  \u00a0 The room that was taken was never returned, but we no longer require the space. \u00a0  They remodeled our restroom 3 years later when a parent finally raised a ruckus with considerable support from me. \u00a0  Accessible drinking fountains were installed about the same time. \u00a0 My reputation for being willing to fight became widely known and I found I didn\u2019t have to do it is as much. \u00a0  But I also think I became somewhat complacent. \u00a0  I was willing to compromise and avoid rocking the boat. \u00a0  There is something to be said for being politically skilled in order to get what you want. \u00a0  \u00a0 At heart, I am generally an avoider when it comes to conflict. \u00a0  However, if I am forced to fight, I fight to win. \u00a0  And once my ire gets ignited to the boiling point, I appeal to the William T. Sherman school of thought. \u00a0  Basically, if I\u2019m going to war, I\u2019m going make conflict with me so unpleasant that you won\u2019t want to do it again very soon. \u00a0  \u00a0 And it has been too long since I\u2019ve gone after the culture of discrimination. There really is a rampant culture of discrimination that exists in the larger culture as well as the school culture. \u00a0  Sometimes government regulations help but often times they hurt. \u00a0  No Child Left Behind put special emphasis on students with disabilities, however it also stigmatized those students and the teachers who teach them. \u00a0  If you look at the movement towards paying teachers on the basis of student test scores, this inherently creates a hostile atmosphere against every student who has a disability that slows them down. \u00a0  And teaching the students that I teach who do not take the standardized tests pretty much means that I can not apply for  Georgia\u2019s Master Teacher program . \u00a0  It is no wonder that students that are slower sense the culture of hostility and drop out. \u00a0  It is also no wonder that many of the teachers who teach special education follow suit and move on to other fields thus resulting in the highest turnover rate among any group in teaching. \u00a0  \u00a0 If there is a problem or a need, it seems to only get addressed when it affects the regular education population. \u00a0  If you are a special education teacher, you are the one who is going to be moved, marginalized, and put off. \u00a0  Your classroom will be the most uncomfortable, your supply budget will be the smallest, your computer will be the oldest, your equipment will barely function. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  If there is a spare closet, basement, trailer or dungeon, that is where you will be teaching. \u00a0  It will be somewhere that is unsuitable for the regular kids and yet perfectly fine for you. \u00a0  \u00a0 Those of you who have been teaching special education for any length of time know of what I speak. \u00a0  It happens pretty much all the time, and everywhere I\u2019ve taught, special education has been relegated to the fringe, outskirts and outposts. \u00a0  \u00a0 So when I consider this pervasive culture of repression it becomes pretty obvious to me that total integration is the only solution. \u00a0  The only way to gain equal rights is to be in-your-face militant about it because otherwise people will be all content in their little comfort zones. \u00a0  Yes, my students are disruptive. \u00a0  So are all the other students. \u00a0  But I am sick and tired of us being pushed to the back of the bus every time a disability is inconvenient. \u00a0  Anyone can teach a \u201cnormal\u201d student who is always compliant. \u00a0  They often learn in spite of what teachers do. \u00a0  But it\u2019s the exceptional students who demand more expertise and skill. \u00a0  Those are the students who need to make the most gains and who need the most attention. \u00a0  The problem is not that my students can\u2019t learn. \u00a0  The problem is that no one wants to put forth the resources (money) needed to pay someone to teach them the way they need to be taught. \u00a0  In order to make any sort of gain, they need 1:1 intensive teaching. \u00a0  And no public school is going to pay for 30 hrs/week of 1:1 instruction for a student with severe disabilities who will only make minimal gains with that sort of dedicated effort. \u00a0 So what\u2019s the use of total integration? \u00a0  It\u2019s to help educate the rest of the school population about disabilities and tolerance. \u00a0  Right now, our non-integration serves to sustain the current climate where discrimination and oppression are the norm.

This came up as I was fixing my RSS feed application, which is Thunderbird.  I love that I can use it on my Linux machines as well as my Windows machines.

{"date": "2008/12/23", "body": "This is just how it is\u2026 I\u2019ll give you an example of just how and why NCLB is so absurd disastrous for my students. Every single day of the school year, our students get off the bus and go through our back door straight into our classroom.\u00a0 Every single day.\u00a0 This door does not automatically lock when it is shut, which is why many other teachers end up coming in through our room.\u00a0 If you push it, it will lock and can not be opened from the outside.\u00a0 It has been that way forever. I have a student who has been with me just shy of forever.\u00a0 This is year #5 for him with at least 2 more to go.\u00a0 He is also (somewhat arguably) my most capable student.\u00a0 \u201cCapable\u201d being extremely relative in a SID/PID classroom.\u00a0 Each and every morning for the past 5 years, this student has done the same, exact thing.\u00a0 He runs to the door and pushes it shut, thus locking himself out.\u00a0 Each and every single morning, without exception.\u00a0 5 x 180 days = 900 trials and the boy still has not learned to simply open the door.\u00a0 This is a very basic and functional thing but he still does not get it.\u00a0 This is where teaching these kids are; it takes about 1000 trials to teach a single basic skill, even if it is highly relevant.\u00a0 Sometimes less, many times more. It\u2019s not that these kids can not learn.\u00a0 They can and they do!\u00a0 But they do not learn at the pace (or for the price) of everyone else.\u00a0 They never will, short of a brain transplant because the brain wiring is simply not there.\u00a0 It is simply a biological fact of reality.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean we give up, but could we please get over the fact that algebra and world geography might be relevant and practical for these kids on  any  level?!? These kids  could  learn algebra, sure.\u00a0 But no one wants to provide the resources necessary to do it.\u00a0 It would take 40 hours per week of 1:1 instruction in order to get them to the most basic concepts.\u00a0 Who is going to pay for that kind of service to teach something that is irrelevant to a lot of \u201cnormal\u201d people and totally useless to the ones being taught?\u00a0 No one.\u00a0 No one is going to pay for any more than the basic level of care and instruction!\u00a0 I have 7 kids who are 1:1 students and there are 4 adults here.\u00a0 Combined with the administrative paperwork, I am swamped and overwhlemed as these kids can not toilet or feed themselves!\u00a0 This takes a huge swath of time out of our day.\u00a0 Plus the attention and endurance of these students is quite a bit less than 8 hours per day.\u00a0 It is closer to 25 minutes per day, but I do push for more and there are numerous tears shed and gnashing of teeth because of it throughout the day in my room. But why are we banging our heads so hard on this?\u00a0 Is it just because it is a nice campaign slogan?\u00a0 Is it because we are so bound by political correctness that we are immune to seeing some semblance of reality? I\u2019m hoping the new administration can bring some sanity to the situation but I am not overly optimistic.\u00a0 In his speech introducing his nominee for secretary of education, President elect Obama said: \n We need a new vision for a 21st century education system \u2013 one where we aren\u2019t just supporting existing schools, but spurring innovation; where we\u2019re not just investing more money, but demanding more reform; where parents take responsibility for their children\u2019s success; where we\u2019re recruiting, retaining, and rewarding an army of new teachers; where we hold our schools, teachers and government accountable for results;  and where we expect all our children not only to graduate high school, but to graduate college and get a good paying job. \n So now  every  student is going to be required to take on a college prep curriculum.\u00a0 Just where does that leave a whole lot of students who are in special education?\u00a0 Not much different than now.\u00a0 Not much of a change, if you ask me.\u00a0 This is the exact same rhetoric that spawned NickelBee (NCLB) and everything that went along with it.\u00a0 George Bush could have delivered this exact same speech and if it were delivered by Joe Biden, I would seriously be wondering if it were lifted from 2000! 2009 is going to be real interesting.

When the department head read off the assignments for this fall, my name was read off and a collective groan went up from the entire department.\u00a0 They all knew that I really wanted out. But it appears that I will be doing a 10th year in the SID/PID program.\u00a0 This despite, the  words of the supt. of HR back in March .\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 He lied. Calling the guy a liar seems like a strong attack, but I don\u2019t see what else I could call it.\u00a0 I even emailed a follow up a month ago with my resume, certifications and a transcript showing all the things I was qualified to teach.\u00a0 And it all amounted to zilch.\u00a0 He never intended to work with me, and neither did the principal.\u00a0 There was no follow-up and I now believe there was never any intention of follow-up. I had a long and rather heated discussion with another administrator over this.\u00a0 apparently the reasoning for me being put back into the spot I\u2019ve been trying to get out of was the fact that there is no one else who can do it who is qualified.\u00a0 Not that anyone looked very hard, but people who are HQ in the adapted curriculum are few and far between.\u00a0 And those willing to stay in that field are even fewer. Gosh, I wonder why THAT is?!?! Could it be that the administration would rather burn someone out and toss them away rather that try to retain them?\u00a0 If they spent nearly as much effort on retention as they do on recruitment, they wouldn\u2019t  have  to fly clear to India to find people to fill spots vacated by people already qualified and experienced! The predicament is that I\u2019m a victim of my own success.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t miss a single day of work this past year.\u00a0 I have  never  been late to work in all the 9 years I\u2019ve been here.\u00a0 I did all the right things and did them better than anyone else.\u00a0 And the reward for my competence is to keep me in a position when I made it absolutely clear that I wanted to try something else. \u201cWe just want to do what is best for the kids.\u201d So do I, which is why I do give them my best, but my best is getting to be less and less.\u00a0 But apparently it is still better than anyone else is willing or able to give.\u00a0 So I\u2019m stuck until I become as incompetent as a certain other fellow I worked with who had to be carried out on a stretcher because he had a nervous breakdown.\u00a0 Sheesh. I\u2019ve watched as other good (and some bad) SID/PID teachers in other schools were allowed to transfer and move.\u00a0 It makes me wonder what I\u2019ve done wrong. Or what I need to do wrong.\u00a0 After watching the turnover in so many other schools, I never dreamed it would be so difficult to extricate myself from this position at this school. It is like the proverbial  tarbaby .\u00a0 I thought that by working harder I could earn my way out, when instead it has made me more irreplacable!\u00a0 Now I\u2019m feeling more like  Andy Dufresne  when he discovers that the warden will never let him out because he knows too much or maybe more like his friend Red who keeps getting rejected by the parole board. But I think I\u2019m more like Andy, in that I do have hope. \u201cHope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies .\u201d And I do have a couple of plans up my sleeve.\u00a0 One of which involves a bit more schooling to pursue my interests, which mainly involve education and technology.\u00a0 And then another little thing that I\u2019ve kind of ducked and dodged away over the years.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll get into that later this fall.\u00a0 You\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be a major thrill ride if it happens. And finally, in addition to pursuing my interests in technology through classes and attending  Classroom 2.0  webinars, I\u2019m thinking about starting some sort of technology or video club.\u00a0 Part of what gets to me is the isolation of this particular position in regards to the overall improvement plan of the school.\u00a0 I spend a lot of time thinking about things like 21st century learning and using advanced technology and I can not use any of it in my classroom with my students.\u00a0 The technology head of the county won\u2019t listen to me because I have no real application of thing like social networks or wikis outside of what I try to do with other faculty members.\u00a0 And honestly, most of them just don\u2019t get it.\u00a0 While they\u2019re all on Facebook, they haven\u2019t tried to leverage the technology to reach their students or to collaborate with each other.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t have students to try out my ideas on.\u00a0 So a club might provide a sort of venue/sandbox to try some things while supporting the larger mission of the school.\u00a0 Thing is, I have no experience with starting and running a club like this.\u00a0 So that will be a major adventure, and perhaps a source of some meaningful change. So hang on to your butts.\u00a0 There is a wild ride ahead!\u00a0 I just need to spend a big part of the summer licking my wounds and recharging.\u00a0 I\u2019ll still blog things that come up on my mind as they come over the summer, but a whole lot will be spent just learning, thinking and pondering my fate.

{"date": "2009/06/08", "body": "This is my staff development of the summer, which is a two day class covering a piece of software by  Promethean  called ActivInspire.  ActivIsnpire is the latest software that is utilized with the Promethean Activboard. I\u2019ll write a bit more about the whiteboard itself in a minute, but the class itself was mostly about using the ActiveInspire software. The software is a really nifty package, filled with a lot of tools and features that a teacher can use to present content from the front of the class. There are some good drawing tools as well as some good interactive lessons. It is graphically and visually rich which may or may not work with my students. My SID/PID students, that is. Let\u2019s face it: my kids are the ultimate in testing for relevance and flexibility and accessibility. I explored around and there are a variety of activities appropriate for k-12. But it might be difficult to bridge the huge gap between where my kids are (never more than 36 months) to where NCLB is requiring (no less than 14 years) so it might be difficult to actually use it. The good news is that it looks like this would work with my   Wimote setup . But this is also the depressing thing. Our school district is ordering tons of the active whiteboards at no less that $2000 each. I can do the exact same thing for less than $100. So can you, and you can do it easily and painlessly by checking out the folks at  Penteractive .  The Promethean pens, which don\u2019t even contain a battery, cost over $100!   ( See Mark\u2019s comment below )  My IR pen was about $8. The Wii setup might be somewhat inferior to the Promethean whiteboard. But how inferior is it? Is it 20 times worse? And I\u2019m not convinced that the Wiimote solution is inferior at all. Consider that the Promethean board can not be used as a dry erase board or anything else whereas the Wiimote can work on  any   flat surface. So why aren\u2019t more schools using this inexpensive and versatile technology? The only thing I can guess is because it looks too geeky. But it\u2019s really not even as difficult as the Promethean board. In fact, it is actually tons easier because there isn\u2019t anything that needs to be bolted or installed on the wall. Penteractive is actually offering support for their kits and at much less than the other commercial products. If you are looking for an interactive whiteboard, I highly recommend investing in the Wiimote setup. At the very least, it costs so little that it is worth it just to try it out. What you may discover is that you don\u2019t have a lot of use for a whiteboard or that you need more training or that you need more or better software to take full advantage of it. If the technology changes (and it will) the schools are not out $thousands$ per classroom but only hundreds tops. With the availability of the hardware and software, it just looks irresponsible sinking money into technology that will be obsolete in a short amount of time. Supposing the whiteboard technology is replaced by 1:1 netbooks or smartphones, or it gets abandoned for some reason. The bluetooth and the wiimote can still be used for other things. What happens to an obsolete or broken Promethean board? Could they be used for something else? How easy will it be to dispose of or recycle them? We are often so anxious to move the new technology into classrooms we give no thought to what happens when it is time to upgrade, replace and move the stuff out.  At the least, the Wiimote offers multitouch for less than  a single pen from Promethean  $100 and offers more versatility. Having said all of that, the ActivInspire software is pretty good and worth a look.  Promethean offers a lot of good support for it and there is lots of premade materials being generated by other teachers all the time.  My advice is to invest in the software, but not the boards which are large, bulky and expensive.  For what they are charging you could get a lot more interactivity and interest from the full Wiifit game, laptop plus projector and still have money leftover.

{"date": "2009/06/12", "body": "For my second day of Activinspire/Activboard training, I was involved in trying to complete a project. Of course this was supposed to be aligned to the state standards, and this is where I had some problems. I\u2019m concentrating on math because those standards are  SO far away from anything my students can do. They simply are no where near doing anything with coordinate geometry or algebra. So I downloaded a few flipcharts from  Promethean\u2019s extensive library  and began to modify an activity with shapes.  My kids need a whole lot more that just some objects/pictures to move around, so the first thing I did was associate some sounds with it so they could do some sound matching along with the shapes. It\u2019s a lot of work and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to use very much of it in whatever setting I happen to be in this fall. One thing that I wanted to mention about the software is that it is platform independent, as there is Linux support for the Activinspire software.  Kudos to the Promethean team for making that extraordinary effort toward making this available to a wider audience.  It\u2019s exceedingly rare for commercial educational software vendors to support Linux. And thanks to Mark and Beth for clearing up the over-priced pen controversy in comments to my last post.  I did make corrections to reflect the updaterd information.  While it does make the price of the hardware upkeep a bit less onerous there\u2019s still a large gulf, and the serious monetary outlay causes some unintended consequences that I\u2019ll outline in a minute. The best part of the day was probably the end when we got to see what other teachers were doing and ideas they had. I\u2019m a total believer in getting teachers to share and collaborate more,but that might just be me, since I often feel so isolated in my own little space.  Seeing what others were doing gave me ideas as to what I might try down the road.  It looked to me like every teacher universally liked the Activboard and ActivInspire software.  But that may change through no fault of Promethean or our own technology department. I was talking with an elementary teacher from another county yesterday who has been teaching kindergarten for the last 4 years and taught other elementary grades in previous years.  She\u2019s a great and dedicated teacher whose student test scores are consistently higher than many of her peers, as she amazingly seems to get most of her students reading within the 1 year she has them without doing any test prep.  She simply teaches her kids, the kids learn and the byproduct is that they pass the test.  She is also one of the most technophobic teachers I\u2019ve ever met. Her school bought Activboards and is requiring every single one of the teachers to integrate the Activboard into every single lesson plan and to put the actual plan on a flipchart.  Egad.  I can not think of a surer to way kill enthusiasm and motivation than to require teachers (or anyone else) to do something.  The Activboard is one tool among many, and is not always the best tool for every job, all the time, for every student.  Technology offers a way to customize an educational experience toward individual learner needs, but school systems seem determined to force uniformity, conformity and homogenization upon every person in the building! In order for technology to be leveraged correctly, it needs to be  so transparent, in that it can go unnoticed in favor of the learning that is actually taking place.  Chalkboards were  the major marvel and innovation of 1801 , and the model of one board, one teacher and a roomful of students looking on has been mostly unchanged since then.  The technology is less important than actual student engagement.  And engagement alone isn\u2019t going to allow for substantial learning as much as an environment that is rich in feedback and reinforcement.  This is why kids are so easily hooked by technology (especially video games) because the feedback is immediate and individualized.  It allows for learning to take place much faster and more efficiently than raising your hand and waiting for the teacher to come around and look at your work. This is why I advocate schools using lower cost solutions, because when they invest so heavily in hardware they have to justify the huge expense. By making its use mandatory and universal, they suck the fun out of it, and begin killing innovation and creativity which are exactly what active boards are supposed to inspire! We also did get a chance to see and try a student response system,  ActiVote .  Many of our schools are getting a set of these.  While they do offer a degree of participation and interactivity, it functions alot like the  Buzztime (formerly NTN) system  I first saw in various Atlanta pubs around 1990 where you could play trivia synchronously with other players around the country. Basically a multiple choice question is posted and kids vote on on it using their little egg-shaped clicker.  Collective results are then shown on the screen.  The next step, is the  ActivExpression  hardware, which allows short answer responses and thus more open-ended questions.  This represents a significant improvement, but I\u2019m wondering at what cost. I like the increased focus on interactivity brought by the Promethean technology, but dislike the large cost to schools and the way schools often decide to implement it.  I admit I have a large bias towards open-source software and low cost \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d hardware solutions.  But Promethean makes the technology more accessible to technologically-challenged teachers through extensive support and making the hardware fairly easy to use.  There is a bit of trade-off between the cost of the material and the amount of training required to use a tool.  In my opinion, schools should invest more in the training of teachers than the technology hardware that they will use.  In other words, teaching teachers to use lower cost tools often costs more than teaching them to use more expensive tools.  But since schools always spend more on recruitment than retention, ease-of-use becomes the more expedient bet.

{"date": "2009/06/25", "body": "Earlier this week, the SCOTUS made a ruling concerning special education and private tuition reimbursement.\u00a0 you can get a quick summary from the  Washington Post here .\u00a0 You can also get a  summary from the SCOTUS blog  and read up on it in  a couple   of posts from Jim Gerle\u2019s Law blog .\u00a0 He\u2019s also got a link to the pdf file of the decision slip. I first want to correct the first line of the washington Post article: P arents of children with disabilities may seek reimbursement for private school tuition even if they have never sent their children to public schools , the Supreme Court ruled yesterday in a decision with wide-ranging implications for Washington area school systems. That is not necessarily the case.\u00a0 Basically, this case involved a student who was entering high school and his parents were concerned about the student\u2019s lack of academic success.\u00a0 So they made a referral for services.\u00a0 The school counselor did some testing and found that the student was not eligible for services.\u00a0 As such, no IEP was written.\u00a0 The parents were still concerned during the student\u2019s 10th grade year but the student was still not deemed eligible for services according to school testing.\u00a0 So the parents eventually obtained a diagnosis for learning disabilities and ADHD.\u00a0 They withdrew him from his high school and placed him in a private school that specialized in providing services for students with LD and ADHD.\u00a0 It was during this time that they began filing for due process against the school for failing to provide FAPE, and sought reimbursement for the private school tuition. The student finished his junior year at the private school and graduated from there the following year in 2004.\u00a0 Yeah, this case has been dragging on for  six years!  And for most of that time, the student was pressing the case forward since the parental rights trnasferred to him at 18. The school argued that the law provides for the reimbursement for students who have already been served in special education for at  least one year .\u00a0 But this student was  never  served in special education.\u00a0 The WaPo article leads the reader to believe that the student never attended the public school, but in fact he did for most of his school career.\u00a0 But he never received special education services and never had an IEP.\u00a0 One major argument given by the prevailing side in this case was the fact that a school district could easily avoid all special education costs by simply not identifying students, which clearly flies in the face of the intent of the IDEA. The school district argued that having to reimburse tuition for students who never had received services and whose parents unilaterally put their child in a private school would place an undo burden on the system financially.\u00a0 Private schools serving special ed. students are not cheap.\u00a0 This one attended by this student was a  residential  school, so we could easily be talking over $100,000 for this one student.\u00a0 So, yeah, the district is going to fight! Will this result in bankrupting school budgets?\u00a0 I doubt it.\u00a0 Remember that by the time this thing settled, the student was probably graduated from  college!  The time and persistence in getting through all the legal proceedings routinely takes several years.\u00a0 By the time this case got only to district court level, the student was already done with school.\u00a0 But the school does have a case that parents might be more aggressive about pursuing their rights.\u00a0 Given the time it takes to get resolution on a case like this, a parent needs to start early in order to be assured of getting their child needed services.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it is sometimes necessary to be an attack dog on a school system because the culture of discrimination and prejudice runs so deep and is so pervasive.\u00a0 Don\u2019t believe me?\u00a0 Look at the  Atlanta Journal Constitution blog on the subject  and read the comments.\u00a0 Students with disabilities are routinely scapegoated in the comments, whether or not that is actually the topic on this blog.\u00a0 They actually got off kind of light, here. Another reason why the impact of this is going to be somewhat minimal is the simple matter of there not being very many private schools who are willing to take and cater to students with special needs.\u00a0 Georgia already has a law that offers a $10,000 voucher/scholarship for any student that wants one and very few ever take advantage of it.\u00a0 And you can simply forget about  any  of my students ever being included in anything like that.\u00a0 The impact on my students and their parents because of this ruling is ZILCH because there is not a private school anywhere that is going to take them, even if parents wanted to take advantage of any scholarship.\u00a0 And no private school would house a student through their 22nd birthday. You\u2019ll hear a lot of noise from both sides of this issue, but I think it\u2019s mostly a zero-sum game.\u00a0 Parents aren\u2019t going to be able to get tuition reimbursements whenever they want.\u00a0 Even if they did get a favorable decision, it would likely be several years and several thousands of dollars after their child started a private school.\u00a0 A parent would need the means to afford the tuition well  in advance  of challenging a school district.\u00a0 The district still has the upper hand, but with stakes a bit higher they have more of a reason to work with parents instead of blowing them off. The RTI and POI procedures, if they are followed and implimented correctly will also head-off a lot of these sort of challenges.\u00a0 These procedures were not widely implimented in 2003, if at all, so there is already a procedural safeguard with documentation that is built-in to the process.\u00a0 Today, there would be more than just one test and a one-time procedure for getting additional help.\u00a0 IF it is implimented.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big \u201cif.\u201d I encourage anyone interested in special education law to read the case, as it isn\u2019t often a special education case makes it in front of the Supremes.\u00a0 I\u2019m betting against this being a big decision that changes the game, but I could be wrong.

{"date": "2009/06/25", "body": "YES!\u00a0 You read that right!\u00a0 No Child Left Behind is officially coming to an end! The long nightmare is over ! Well, okay.\u00a0 Not exactly, but it is a start, I suppose.\u00a0 However, I do not forsee any substantial changes coming along anytime soon.\u00a0 In fact, the Obama administration has pretty much come out and said that they are just going to be looking to change the name, dispite some of the promises he made while campaigning.\u00a0 So as far as the feds go, it is still business as usual.\u00a0 And it is still going to be the same in the state of Georgia, too.\u00a0 Even when the  state legislature tried to make room for some choice  within a district,  the rules imposed by the DOE pretty much make it impossible  to happen, for good or ill.\u00a0 Basically, the Georgia DOE has proven itself to be more and more of an enemy to public education that anything coming out of Washington!\u00a0 I\u2019m repeatedly amazed at how they manage to bungle up legislation passed by our elected officials, or  block legislation   designed to fix their blunders. And pretty much all of it is hostile towards individuals with disabilities as well as the rest of the student population.\u00a0 When our students increasingly demand a costumized education, the state and the feds are doing everything they can to homogenize it. When the world cries out for creativity and innovation, the educational system forces conformity and uniformity. The rebranding of NCLB is simply repainting the same rundown shack and giving it a new name.\u00a0 According to the WaPo article above, it is almost literally window dressing as the red schoolhouse is replaced by pictures hung in the windows of the building of children doing various activities. At any rate, it is still lovely seeing the crowning jewel of the GW Bush legacy added to the ash heap of history.\u00a0 Even so, the stench of its consquences still remains as a sort of toxic haze choking off any meaningful education inovation and reform. Before moving on to other topics, I do want to elaborate just a bit on my contempt for NCLB. In 2002, I was actually an advocate for this legislation or at least a large part of it.\u00a0 I wanted highly qualified teachers and accountability.\u00a0 I wanted all students to learn and I was all for using research-based instructional methods and materials.\u00a0 I never believed that more money was the answer, so as a tax payer, I thought it was a good idea to make funding contingent on getting some results.\u00a0 But I never really dreamed that my SID/PID students would be caught up in this.\u00a0 And then I started seeing how NCLB was being implimented and it became harder and harder to defend this law.\u00a0 Basically, it turned our national curriculum into \u201cTest Prep.\u201d\u00a0 Basic bench marks and minimum requirements suddenly became some sort of gold standard, and mediocrity became the ultimate goal.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen antything wipe out and destroy student creativity and and teacher innovation more effectively than this law. So while many of the things that I wanted while supporting NCLB were noble, it was a serious error putting such an important task into the hands of the federal government.\u00a0 I was very wrong, and over time that wrong-ness has been reinforced every single time our own state DOE interprets this terrible law and makes it an even more hideous monstrosity.\u00a0 The ideals espoused by the people peddling this law and the actual execution of it are very, very far apart.\u00a0 As a former supporter of this law (and the president who wants to take credit for it) there is a very, very deep sense of betrayal.\u00a0 When it became obvious that this thing was stripping autonomy away from local school systems and causing a collapse of creative and independent thought in favor of the Test Culture, it should have been scrapped or at least something new developed to take its place.\u00a0 But we have nothing to show for it, an imminent meltdown in 2013 when every school fails to make the 100% AYP mark, and an entire generation that has been left behind while the rest of the world is learning how to think creatively, independently, competetively, globally and collaboratively.\u00a0 And there is no plan on what to do next. Many of you probably saw the light long before I did, and I want to apologize to you for my slowness.\u00a0 I know there were people who saw much further down the road than I did, and I should have listened more carefully.\u00a0 I do feel a bit of guilt for starting out on the wrong side of this issue.\u00a0 But I\u2019m speaking now.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a few ideas: 1. First, I believe that every single person involved in the architecture of NCLB should be dismuissed, and placed far away from any influence in educational policy.\u00a0 Put them in a SID/PID classroom. 2. Second, a new strategy should be develped from scratch.\u00a0 That means we need to start on it right away.\u00a0 But the conversation should be as inclusive as possible.\u00a0 The capacity for involvement are much greater today than they were in 2000.\u00a0 Let\u2019s use those tools. 3. No plan should be set in stone.\u00a0 We need to be mindful of changing conditions.\u00a0 NCLB was written and implimented for the 1990\u2019s educational syatem.\u00a0 The world is changing and the capacity of teachning and learning are also changing.\u00a0 And they will change again.\u00a0 Flexibility needs to be built in. 4. Start removing the teeth from NCLB now, so that the damage becomes less and less so that by 2013, the impact will be minimal. 5. Make student motivation part of the converation when discussing student performance. Those are just a few of my ideas.\u00a0 Feel free to make up your own, put them in a comment or better yet, send them to your favorite (or least favorite) legislator or governmental entity.

In 1968, a teacher named  Jane Elliott  began an experiment/exercise in the community of Riceville, Iowa.\u00a0 She took white 3rd grade children and taught them about discrimination using a technique that is not without controversy.\u00a0  You can see it here .\u00a0 It was the famous blue eye- brown eye lesson, where each group gets a taste of being either the oppressed minority or the oppressor for the day.\u00a0 I actually grew up just an hour or so away from Riceville, and that section of the country was pretty racist back then and many remnants still remain to this day.\u00a0 Discrimination happens everywhere in many forms, as I\u2019ve learned in my life and again lately.\u00a0 Within minutes, the kids fell into their respective role of either the dominant culture or the one being dominated.\u00a0 And the next day when the roles were switched, some kids were anxious to settle some scores from the day before. So now I feel like it\u2019s my turn to wear the collar because a different group finds themselves in power.\u00a0 I think we are going to have a lot on our plate, as a nation. Too much to worry about petty differences.\u00a0 I\u2019m willing to give the new guy a chance to prove he\u2019s not a divider.\u00a0 But now it comes to me that the last guy our country elected said exactly the\u00a0 same thing.\u00a0\u00a0 Forgive me for being too skeptical to believe all the hype.

{"date": "2008/11/07", "body": "The way NCLB is currently structured and the way schools are really pushing and driving, now is the time to straighten out the transition-to-work emphasis, especially for those students who are older than 18.\u00a0 I currently have 2 that should have/could have graduated at 18, but they are being served in the public school system in my classroom.\u00a0 Is the focus on academics the best thing for them at this age?\u00a0 Certainly not for my students or those with more moderate intellectual disabilities.\u00a0 The unemployment rate for students with disabilities runs 80-90%, and this is because school systems are ill-equipped for this task.\u00a0 Public high schools are being pushed and pressured to offered a curriculum that prepares  all  students for college.\u00a0 The large vocational programs that were in place in the 1970\u2019s and \u201980\u2019s are now long gone and are largely replaced by more academic space or by computer labs.\u00a0 \u00a0 So on top of the demands for offering the regular education curriculum for all of my students, I am also having to try to offer some sort of meaningful job/employment services and skills.\u00a0 These skills are not aligned with the basic core academic standards that I am supposed to be using in order to teach.\u00a0 The daily living skills are also not aligned to core standards.\u00a0 And yet, when I submit lesson plans, they must include the state academic standards and must somehow align.\u00a0 This is the basic problem that NCLB brings to the local school system.\u00a0 We are not doing that good of a job in the core mission of academics and we are also tasked with teaching some sort of meaningful vocational skills.\u00a0 \u00a0 The problem is that the least restrictive environment for a 16 year-old is not the same as it is for a 20 year-old.\u00a0 And yet, that is exactly how it works in our school system.\u00a0 Regular students are either working or going to further their education while students with severe disabilities have no other choice but to remain in the same building, in the same classrooms with the same teachers until they age out at 21+ years of age.\u00a0 Other students have moved on while those with severe disabilities are stuck.\u00a0 And for all of my training and background I simply do not have the resources to offer everything to everyone all the time.\u00a0 When NCLB first started impacting those of us who taught this population, there was a lot of talk about aligning our goals with the standards.\u00a0 We were to just take what we were already doing and find some way to make it fit into the regular curriculum.\u00a0 Some things work more natural than others.\u00a0 For instance, speaking and communicating\u00a0are part of almost every task we do and that easily aligns.\u00a0 We can count things that approach an algebra standard.\u00a0 However, when we get into the real meat and guts of a high school academic curriculum, very little fits into what a student with severe disabilities\u00a0does in the real world and\u00a0in real life.\u00a0 Geometry, American literature, physical science and world cultures are not very relevant to them.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t learn it or that we can not teach them.\u00a0 But when a skill has to be taught 500-1500 times in order to be mastered, is that the best use of our time?\u00a0 To be sure, teaching the core content takes alot of creativity and is sometimes even fun.\u00a0 It does, in fact, reflect just what their peers are doing, only\u00a0at a more basic level. \u00a0 However, at the age of 18, that is no longer true.\u00a0 Their peers or  not  still in high school.\u00a0 They have moved on, and so it is that the students with severe disabilities should also move on.\u00a0 The present academically focused atmosphere of NCLB arguably serves its purpose but there gets to be a point where is becomes an even more serious impediment and liability.\u00a0 Students need to be preparing for work outside of school.\u00a0 They need to get outside of the bell schedule, outside of class changes and out of their desks.\u00a0 They need to be in a seperate place where the focus is solely on transitioning to work.\u00a0 The regular high school is  not  trhe least restrictive environment for students who are 19-21+.\u00a0 They need to be in a place better suited to train them towards goals that will better serve them outside of the constraints of NCLB.\u00a0 A student could opt to continue to work towards the regular credentials, of course, but there should also be another option besides spending the entire 7-8 years after middle school in one building, in one room.\u00a0 This simply turns high school SID/PID rooms into yet another version of institutionalization.\u00a0 No other population of student gets handled and treated this way. \u00a0 To that end, we do need to do a better job of including our students in the regular education setting, even if it is for a modified period of time.\u00a0 At the present time, the opportunity for discimination is entirely too rampant.\u00a0 I have voiced concern about  mainstreaming and inclusion before .\u00a0 But after waking up to some issues with being discriminated against, I realize that the only way to combat it is to always be around and in everyone\u2019s face.\u00a0 Plus, for my part, if they won\u2019t let me get away from SID/PID than perhaps I can gain access to the regular education classroom by getting my students placed there.\u00a0 Suddenly I become a more critical part of the landscape as teachers scramble trying to figure out what to do with these kids. \u00a0 So two things need to happen: 1.) Make a final drive towards full inclusion 2.) Establish a place for those who graduate from high school to be served until they are aged out, where the emphasis is vocational skills rather than the core standards mandated by NCLB. \u00a0 It\u2019s really going to be up to parents to make demands toward this, though.\u00a0 I\u2019m speaking as both teacher and parent but know that as an employee of the school system my voice can more easily be squelched.\u00a0 Plus this might not be something other parents want, so I\u2019m curious about that.\u00a0 Should we more fully include those with severe and profound disabilities?\u00a0 \u00a0 I will say to you parents that the regular school system is simply too poorly equipped to offer your student the vocational training that he/she really and truly needs.\u00a0 The mission of the school system is to educate students according to the state curriculum standards.\u00a0 That will always come first, and everything else is extra, regardless of what is put on the IEP.\u00a0 We can write lovely goals and a lovely transition plan but that neither compels nor empowers us to carry out those plans.\u00a0 The IEP is pretty much toothless in areas that do not align with NCLB.\u00a0 If it does not address the state curriculum, I\u2019m going to have a hard time carrying it out because the law clearly mandates what I\u2019m required to do \u2014 teach to the standards.\u00a0 And I do not have sufficient time to even do that very well.\u00a0 So guess what happens to those goals, objectives and transition plans?\u00a0 They are being sidelined. \u00a0 Under IDEA, all students are entitled to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE)\u00a0 However, NCLB has totally changed the definition of \u201cappropriate.\u201d\u00a0 It is all about the state mandated\u00a0curriculum and meeting standards of performance\u00a0mandated by the federal government.\u00a0 So you may want your child to learn some functional skills like tying his/her shoe, going to the bathroom, do some sorting, assembling or other vocational/life skill\u00a0tasks.\u00a0 However we at the school are under serious constraints of time and resources.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to do my best for the students that I have, and their parents\u00a0but this is not the same business that it was when I started or even 2 years ago.\u00a0 The shift has been focused and radical.\u00a0 \u00a0 Tags:  inclusion ,  mainstreaming ,  NCLB ,  No Child Left Behind ,  severe disabilities ,  Special Education ,  transition ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/we-need-a-better-transition-program/", "title": "We Need a Better Transition\u00a0Program"},
{"date": "2008/11/15", "body": "Our local school system is presently considering a new calendar for the 2009-2010 school year.  The school system is the largest employer in our county and that calendar can affect a lot of things for good or ill.  Many other activities and events within the community revolve around the school activities.  Every parent and teacher has a stake in this decision and it may turn out to be a point of major contention.  These decisions will also have a significant impact on students with disabilities and their families.  Here\u2019s a run down of our choices and the issues around them including pros and cons (at least as I see it). Calendar #1 \u2013 The current balanced calendar :  This is called a balanced calendar because the summer break is much shorter that what other school systems have.  It is not \u201cyear-round\u201d school by any stretch, but it does balance the year out a bit better.  We start in late July (and are among the earliest schools to start in the country) and end around memorial day.  In addition to the normal holiday and spring breaks, we also get a week-long break in October and another week-long break in February.  We also get a full week for Thanksgiving and the semester ends at the Christmas break that lasts two weeks.  The advantage of this system is having those breaks throughout the year.  The fall break is especially nice as most schools do not have this week off.  That means one can get great travel deals and travel in general is less of a hassle.  The shorter summer also means that regression is less of an issue.  It is still an issue, but it is less than if we were off for an extra month.  For me, this is my choice because after a few weeks I feel the itch to get back to teaching.  I like my breaks more often and shorter.  That is my own personal bias. For students with disabilities, a shorter break is actually better.  Extended school year is still offered, but it is less of an issue with a 6 week summer.  There are more frequent disruptions, though, throughout the year.  This is a mixed bag depending on your point of view.  For my son, he really enjoys his breaks but if they are too long we can get more behavior problems.  He also get a certain amount of fatigue after being in school several weeks straight without a break which also results in behavior problems.  In general, the shorter, more frequent breaks work for us.  When we first did this calendar, a lot of parents complained about finding childcare.  However, they did manage to make the adjustment and I think most employees ans students like this calendar.  The state does not, though.  The state of Georgia feels rushed with our early start to score tests.  Students who did not pass their standardized tests (CRCT) can take a make-up test during the summer, but there is a real rush to score them in time for the start of the new year.  Many of these students will be relying on those scores to advance to middle or high school.  Many businesses also do not like the short summer as they believe it shortens the tourist season and decreases spending and hurts the economy.  That argument, to me, is totally weak as the spending/traveling economy is balanced out over the year instead of all crammed in the summer.  Shorter breaks might even help the Georgia economy as families may choose to travel within Georgia since longer breaks afford more time to travel out of state than shorter ones. Option # 2 \u2013 Mid-August Start Date : This calendar starts a week after the calendar above and eliminates the October and February breaks.  It also provides a few more 3-day weekends.  The advantage to this calendar is that the summer is a week longer and there is less disruption caused by week-long breaks.  Scattering more 3-day weekends helps make up for the loss of the longer breaks.  For students with disabilities, this might not be a bad calendar as it is does minimize disruptions to the routine while providing frequent breaks.  It does stretch the summer out an extra week, which may seem like an eternity to many parents of these youngsters!  This would probably be my second choice among the four choices.   I do really like the fall break and I like the shorter summer, which this calendar works against, but it is the least radical departure of what we\u2019re doing now.  The state like this one better than my first choice for the reasons listed above. Calendar #3 \u2013 Start after labor Day :  Out of all the calendars, this is the one I would hate the most, and yet this is the model most school systems in the country use.  The idea is to have a longer, more traditional summer.  School would not start until the Tuesday after Labor Day.  The week-long breaks would be gone and there would be fewer 3-day weekends.  Thanksgiving would be a 3 days instead of all week.  Second semester would not start until the end of January and school would not end until  mid-June!  That means no breaks for 3 entire months at the end of the year, when we need them the most!  For students with disabilities, the regression factor and fatigue factor become more major issues with this calendar.  Extended school year would have to be offered more and for a longer period of time.  On the plus side, students attending summer school might get more of a break and teachers might be able to take summer classes.  For me, I prefer a \u201cstart early, end early\u201d school year.  I have done the \u201cend in mid-June\u201d school year before, and was totally spent and exhausted at the end of it.  While I\u2019m tired at the end of May now, I couldn\u2019t imagine dragging along for weeks after Memorial Day.  And that\u2019s if you don\u2019t have any snow days to make up!  Thanks but no thanks. Option #4 \u2013 4 Day Week : Out of all the option proposed, this one is the most radical, innovative and intriguing.  Basically, it would involve attending school Tuesday-Friday for a minimum of one hour longer than the current school day.  The school year would be 160 days instead of 180 days but students would actually have more \u201cseat time.\u201d \u201cSeat time.\u201d  That terminology is a huge red flag for me. The advantages are numerous.  First, there is the cost savings just from running buses less often and the cafeteria serving lunches less often.  Teacher inservices and workdays would be done on Mondays and involve less schedule disruptions.  Students and teachers could do their shopping, banking and other personal business on those days.  And I\u2019ve even thought to myself that a 4 day work week might be pretty nice.  However, the reality is not the same as the idea.  If kids are in school until 4:30, many will be getting on and off the buses in the dark much of the year.  By 4:00, many of these kids will be feeling some serious hunger pains from the ever-more-meager lunch portions.  And that means most of use teachers will not be leaving until way, way later as we need more daily planning for a longer day. For students with disabilities, the longer day would be devastating.  Fatigue is a constant factor anyway, and that last hour is not going to amount to a full hour\u2019s worth of added learning.  Learning is not like factory work, and neither is teaching,  The law of diminishing returns will set in and it will amount to a net loss in the long run.  For my kids with sever disabilities, we\u2019d be seriously looking at having nap time or something.  We\u2019d also be looking at more feeding and changing requirements due to the extra time.  If this were a factory or another type of work setting, I\u2019d do it in a second.  But not for teaching that requires so much out-of-teaching time in order to prepare.  Class time with the students makes up a fraction of the time required to do the job correctly.  So those Mondays would hardly be time off.  They would be mostly unpaid work days.  Nice idea and nice concept, the 4 day work week.  But I don\u2019t see it working for me or my kids. So what we have now looks the best for me and my students.  There is a lot of economic and political pressure being brought to bear to get our school district to change.\u00a0 I can see change eventually coming, but not until the concept of \u201cseat time\u201d changes.

{"date": "2008/11/30", "body": "Anyone reading me for any amount of time on the subject of autism knows that I am the last person to capriciously recommend any sort of dietary intervention with the intention of curing autism.\u00a0 Special diets can be time consuming and expensive and represent one more additional hardship on a family already challenged by the behaviors posed by children with significant developmental delays.\u00a0 The evidence supporting dietary intervention for autism is anecdotal, at best.\u00a0 The entire concept of \u201cautism recovery\u201d is suspect.\u00a0 When we tried the diet several years ago, it failed in many ways with no discernible results.\u00a0 Rather than look at it as a failure, we simply moved on.\u00a0 Or at least I and the kids did, more or less. A couple months ago, the dietary bit came up again as Jane* tested Thomas* for allergies.\u00a0 The result was a bit shocking.\u00a0 For the past 8 years we\u2019ve been giving him soy milk for a suspected dairy allergy.\u00a0 The tests came back and showed him totally off the chart for SOY allergies while showing very little reaction to dairy foods.\u00a0 So that began changing things as soy is in  everything  that is processed.\u00a0 Anything with vegetable fat contains soy and everything looking to boost protein which is most things.\u00a0 So we have been reading labels quite a lot.\u00a0 He also has a bit of an allergy to eggs as does our youngest son.\u00a0 I could be, but I\u2019m not suffering from any illness or discomfort so have never bothered to test. Then we recently got tests back for Jane.\u00a0 She is also allergic to soy (and has been drinking soy milk for years) in addition to wheat (and anything wheat-like), eggs and cane sugar.\u00a0 Highly allergic.\u00a0 So now we are going to have to be dieting.\u00a0 Funnily enough, I have already been on a diet to lose weight last year that totally avoided all of those foods.\u00a0 I also don\u2019t mind eating the same thing everyday, which the boys are fine with but it drives Jane nuts.\u00a0 She likes a lot of variety in her diet and has always been the most challenging person in the family to cook for because she easily tires of foods, even several served in a rotation.\u00a0 Notable exceptions include things with lots of wheat and sugar. The difference between our efforts now and years ago is that we have a definite medical diagnosis that is easily arrived at with a blood test.\u00a0 This is different that trying to use diet to work on something like autism.\u00a0 Certainly, allergies (and autism) are ubiquitous enough to overlap. Relieving allergic symptoms and reactions can certainly improve the symptoms and disposition of any person, autistic or not.\u00a0 The proscribed treatment is eliminating the offending foods for 6 weeks or so and then reintroducing those foods to see what happens.\u00a0 It is a classic A-B single subject experimental design and a body could do endless reversals in order to establish a functional relationship between the symptoms and the food.\u00a0 This is jusy good science.\u00a0 Assuming we can control the diet completely, it isn\u2019t that hard to see if anything happens physically. Anyway, the key to working this type of diet is to focus more on the things you can have, rather than trying to always substitute for things you can\u2019t have.\u00a0 I think this is where so many people and families get into trouble and it was our downfall.\u00a0 Gluten-free bread is massively expensive on the order of $6-9 a pound.\u00a0 The flours are also 4-6x more expensive than what a person typically pulls off the shelf.\u00a0 But not every diet in the world revolves around wheat.\u00a0 In fact, before Columbus, the indigenous Americans lived very well on things that did not contain wheat, soy, eggs, milk or cane sugar.\u00a0 The primary meso American diet was based on corn and different bean proteins.\u00a0 Tomatoes, potatoes and squash were all native foods.\u00a0 So it is there where I have done some research and drawn some inspiration The Asian diet was based on rice, but soy was a more major source of protein. Here is a recipe for some tasty cookies that satisfy the dietary requirements listed above. Feel free to adapt and substitute as you see fit. Dry ingredients: \n\u2013 1 c masa harina (corn flour) \n\u2013 1/2 cup potato flakes \n\u2013 1/2 cup oatmeal ( There\u2019s some controversy about the gluten free-ness of oats  but Jane\u2019s tests showed she was good for oats) \n\u2013 1 tsp baking soda \n\u2013 1/2 tsp salt \n\u2013 1 1/2 c dried fruit and/or nuts (I have a bag that I mix up that contain raisins, craisins, walnuts, pecans, almonds and a few other things) \n\u2013 2-3 Tbsp milled flax seed Wet Ingrediants \n\u2013 2 eggs (Their equivalent in our case, Ener-G) \n\u2013 1/4-1/2 cup of oil \n\u2013 1 c light corn syrup \n\u2013 1 tsp vanilla Mix each up separately and then all together.\u00a0 Add more potato flakes if it is too runny. Spoon on to a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes.\u00a0 It makes about 1 1/2 to 2 dozen. Here\u2019s a video of me and the whole process: I made this thing out of my head from scratch and it came out pretty good the first time!\u00a0 So the video was shot making a second batch.\u00a0 The oil was a bit excessive so I ended up adding potato flakes off camera to thicken the batter.\u00a0 It\u2019s basically like an oatmeal raisin cookie and is supper delish.\u00a0 The corn flour and flax seeds added a real novel depth to the taste, but that could be just me. I made up a dry mix for pancakes which we tried tonight and they turned out really well.\u00a0 In fact they went too well and the batch is almost gone already! *Jane and Thomas are blognames that I used in my anonymous blogging days and just continue to use today.

{"date": "2008/11/18", "body": "Today, one of the assistant principals came in and handed me an envelope that contained a survey from  Questar   .   For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, Questar is the company responsible for scoring the Georgia Alternate Assessment (GAA).  He wanted to know when I could have it done, and I told him maybe Friday.  He said he needed it by tomorrow.  Thing is, our GAA\u2019s are also due tomorrow!  This looked like just one more piece of worthless paperwork associated with the GAA, which already has dubious value. I opened it up and looked at it, and suddenly it became a bit more of a cathartic exercise that I thought.  I was able to fully vent my spleen upon those vile people who were intimately connected to this process that has so vexed me these past few years.  Much of it was a Likert-type scale asking how I felt my students had benefitted from the GAA process, with 1 being the least and 4 being the most.  That whole section was pretty much a \u20181\u2019.  Another section asked about administrative support.  That scored about a \u20182\u2019.  They did give us leave time the first year, but we\u2019re getting no extra time this year to do this stuff.  We\u2019re on our own and the schedule is tighter than ever with shorter deadlines.  Administrative support amounts to 1/2 day of training, some ink cartridges, some card stock and a few meetings and deadlines.  No regular education teachers are collecting the data at our school, which was one item scored on the survey. Somewhere they got the idea that the GAA was supposed to revolutionize our teaching and the acheivement of our students.  Actually, it has made some changes.  The daily living skills and vocational skills are pretty much crowded out because they do not support any academic standards at the 11th grade level.  Those goals are no longer a significant part of the IEP.  In fact, there seems to be a full scale charge away from any vocational skills in the high school curriculum at all.  While some of the content of my teaching has been more diversified, the relevance has mostly disappeared.  Eleventh grade college prep standards mean very little to students who have IQ\u2019s in the single digits.  They asked how the GAA contributed towards greater student acheivement and learning.  I was able to express to them that the GAA has NOTHING to do with student acheivement, learning or comprehension.  There are many ways to fail the GAA by making it uinscorable.  None of those ways have anything to do with student acheivement.  Actual student acheivement is the LEAST prominent metric in the scoring of this \u201cassessment.\u201d  It is all about meeting NCLB\u2019s mandates without having to have any actual substance.   It\u2019s more of a test of a teacher\u2019s endurance and gamesmanship than actual teaching. One section did ask what benefits, if any, I had realized from participating in the GAA: \n It has made me more politically aware and active in working toward the repeal of NCLB.  It has also motivated me to research and consider other career options. \n So instead of taking a day or two to complete the survey, it took me about 20 minutes to pound it out.  It felt pretty good to get some of that out to those people.  It would be nice to know any meaningful results from this survey.  Since we\u2019re right in the midst of the first collection period, I can imagine lots of Georgia teachers taking this opportunity to express their displeasure.  I\u2019m not sure if every teacher doing a GAA had to do a survey (I don\u2019t think so) but rest assured, I was very candid and sharp in my remarks and comments. I don\u2019t blame Questar for their abominable assessment.  They are simply providing a service that states need in order to comply with an abominable federal law.  My students happen to be nonstandard students and there is no reasonable way to standardize them.  Therefore, this unreasonable insult will have to do until control of education can be rescued from the federal lunatics and returned to the state asylum where it belongs.

{"date": "2006/02/20", "body": "The discovery of a brand spankin\u2019 new teacher starting new blog is kind of exciting to me.  I might have said it before, but I need to say it here, is that I have kind of a burn for new teachers.  Relatively fresh, idealistic and energetic, these folks represent the future of our profession. Kacie  is one of a rare group who comes to special education from a traditional teacher preparation program.  I have no idea of the quality of Illinois  State\u2019s program but it sounds rigorous enough by her own account.  I\u2019m not surprised that she was scooped up as soon as she graduated from college.  A far cry from what I experienced back in the day as a December graduate in Agriculture Education.  I languished in the gulag of substitute teaching for the remainder of the school term.  Today, the majority of positions my school system fills in special education is filled by people undergoing alternative certification or are still in the process.  I have met exactly one new hire in our school system who has completed a traditional teacher prep program for special education.  And she is mighty good. So the first thing I\u2019d say to Kacie is that she is one of a pretty elite group of folks who come on the job who has some idea of what she\u2019s supposed to be doing.  I\u2019ve met many, many who walk into the classroom for the first time as a new hire who have not the faintest idea of what is going on.  Many who have absolutely no prior teaching experience.  The flow of teachers often runs from special education into regular education and rarely in reverse.  We often get social studies and P.E. teachers who park themselves in a special ed. class until there\u2019s an opening in their field. As a teacher starting in the middle of the year, Kacie has to hit the ground running.  This is daunting for any teacher, but with special ed. there are other things going on, like annual reviews.  These really get cooking in the spring and are a lot of work even for experienced teachers.  There may also be some of the high stakes testing going on, as well as other assessments that have to happen right before the IEP. At the beginning of the school year, new teachers have a chance to get some orientation as to who they are working with, who they are working for and where it is they are working.  She has none of this.  However, it does sound like she has some friends around who can provide valuable support. In one way, starting in the middle is good.  She only has 90 days of school left before summer.  By the time she starts back in the fall, she will have a much better idea of what is expected and what is likely to happen.  The end of school seems to always be rougher than the beginning as far as student behavior.  If she makes it through this and she\u2019ll be in good stead the next year. Advice?  Remember that the first year is a shakedown year for all teachers.  The good news is that kids generally like younger teachers.  The bad news is that they don\u2019t always respect them.  They have to exercise twice the diligence to keep the classroom running smoothly. Let\u2019s talk about the teaching assistant or paraeducator for a minute.  Odds are, this person is older and might have been around the system longer.  This makes her a good resource and a valuable asset.  However, don\u2019t make the mistake of being too collegial with her.  Whose butt is on the line?  Who is the administration going to go after if something goes wrong?  Who do the parents want to talk to or complain to?  Not the assistant.  The teacher is responsible for everything that goes on in that room.  Younger or not, the teacher must take the lead and take charge.  And this often requires taking a directive approach.  Meaning giving explicit instructions and making plans for her.  Evaluate and supervise as much as can be spared.  Give the sort of good feedback that was given during student teaching.  Most paras like well-established routines and expectations.  They benefit from a similar structure and routine as the students.  Most teachers are given little or no instruction on how to supervise paras.  With a little investment, it is easy to cultivate a good one.  A good assistant  can be invaluable.  But a bad one will be as much of a hindrance as a help. Another missing aspect of the teacher prep curriculum is dealing with parents.  I remember my own supervising teacher telling me, \u201cYou think the kids are bad?  Wait until you meet the parents!\u201d  He was right.  But after becoming a parent I gained a whole new insight into the special education system.  It\u2019s helpful to understand that no matter how hard it is to teach a room full of kids, being the parent of one 24/7 is harder.  They carry the full weight of that child\u2019s future on them.  Many went from dealing with the medical system to early intervention and finally the school.  There a host of emotional issues bound up in their children.  If the children are young like Kacie\u2019s, the parents (mostly mothers) may be experiencing marital discord, divorce, financial stress, social isolation, depression, exhaustion and anger.  Teachers think the educational red tape is tough to deal with, because it is.  But it is nothing compared to medical, insurance, Medicaid and social security red tape.  Being confrontational towards a parent is about the worst mistake a teacher can make.  A properly motivated parent with nothing but time on her hands can make life hell on earth.  Which is why my job is pretty secure.  Since I have 2 children with IEPs, the last thing the school wants is for me to get motivated with time on my hands.   So teachers need to go out of their way to be cordial with these important people.  Teachers come and go, but the parents are stuck for good. All good teachers make mistakes, and we are often our own toughest critics.  Many, many young teachers lose sleep over what they should or should not have done in a given situation.  While I think the self reflection can be beneficial, the fear and anxiety can result in burnout.  The average lifespan for a special education teacher is about 3 years.  So this becomes a race for endurance as much as for excellence. Reflective teachers can beat burnout by continuing to grow.  For me this has involved going back to school.  It also means helping and mentoring other teachers and paras along the way.  Finally, I am always looking outward as well as inward.  While most teachers become frustrated with change, change is inevitable.  It\u2019s going to happen.  Kacie is learning this the hard way as she gets rid of her most challenging student only to have 2 new ones put into her classroom.  Her competence is going to be continually challenged and she is going to have to grow.  But if she can hang tough, confidence will come with the increased experience. My wife, Jane, often goes to parent support meetings and the parents spend a lot of time talking about the teachers their children have.  They generally fall into two distinct camps:  Those that are very dissatisfied and those that are pretty happy.  My goal is to have parents that are very happy.  Besides seeing a student make a big breakthrough, turning a parent from unhappy to happy is probably one of my biggest and best confidence boosters. dick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://spaces.msn.com/kpointer/blog/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/02/20/new-teachers/", "title": "New Teachers"},
{"date": "2006/08/15", "body": "I don\u2019t cover a lot of things as a parent because, because it is harder for me to spot drama there. That\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t have episodes, because we do. All the time.  Thomas and Percy are typical siblings in many ways. They do fuss, argue, fight and tease each other as 7 and 4 year-olds might be prone to do. Percy might be described as the more \u201ctypical\u201d of the two, because he is relatively trouble-free and compliant. I think he\u2019ll be dropped from special education within a year or so. Thomas is a different sort altogether. He requires constant diligence. I\u2019m talking ALL. THE. TIME. He needs to be watched almost every single moment of his waking hours. And that is not small thing when he gets up at 5:30 most mornings. He mostly gets into things. He has always had a thing for getting into the refrigerator. He likes to look over the pantry when it isn\u2019t locked. But by far, his biggest thing is water. Water, water everywhere! He\u2019ll spend gobs of time in the bathroom playing in the sink, washing his wooden trains. Wood and water don\u2019t go so well together. In any case, he\u2019ll also get into the soap, toothpaste, shampoo or whatever he gets his hands on and makes a huge, gigantic mess. Stuff is everywhere!  The other day during Sunday school, he snuck out and into the bathroom, getting the front of his shirt all wet. In church, i was about ready to take him outside, which I have had to do the last couple of Sundays. In fact, it has been intense with Thomas all summer long.  He has tested positive for strep throat several times this summer. Jane has begun correlating his more difficult behaviors with possible infection and she has been right several times. The maddening thing about this, is that he has no other apparent symptoms! Jane started taking him in to the doctor last year when his behavior was getting too bad and the strep screen was positive almost every time. He would undergo a 10 day course of antibiotics and be okay for a bit, but a few weeks later it was all back again. It was absolutely crazy, because he didn\u2019t complain of a sore throat, he had no fever and only occasionally had swollen adenoids. I was beginning to suspect that maybe the screening was all fouled up. They did some cultures, and these showed up  normal.   I also admit to wondering if Jane and the pediatrician were both going loony. I have never heard of asymptomatic strep whose only marker was increased behavior difficulty. This is not the sort of antecedent most behaviorists look for when doing a proper analysis. But there appeared to be some correlation, nonetheless. Jane took Thomas to an ENT to discuss the possibility of having Thomas\u2019 tonsils removed. The ENT did not recommend this and is the one who gave Jane the name to pin on this anomaly:  PANDAS . I had never heard of it, either. Apparently there is something to it and the  NIMH is looking into this  apparent OCD/autism/strep connection. I\u2019m still skeptical, but not as much as if I hadn\u2019t witnessed this sort of thing with my own eyes. Thomas has been diagnosed and treated for strep at least 3 times in the last 9 weeks. Percy had it once, Jane had it once and I probably had it once back in June. Back when I did my bus physical in July, I had them do a screen on me and it turned out negative. The ENT seems to think Thomas is some sort of carrier but isn\u2019t certain exactly what to make of it. Thomas tested all normal yesterday, so at least we have a NORMAL result on something! As if autism didn\u2019t have enough baggage attached, with digestive disorders, neurological disorders, immunity disorders, allergies\u2026there seems to be some sort of other mystery illness to tack on to the list. Like all the others it seems to defy explanation and reason. Like the other things, it is difficult to see and identify. Like the other things, there are correlations and links that are not clear. Like the other things, there is no simple treatment or preventative.\u00a0 I\u2019ve just learned about the existence of PANDAS and am already sick of it! This is probably another reason why I blog infrequently about stuff with the boys. It\u2019s harder to be a half-way objective observer/commenter/participant when it\u2019s your own child. There are feelings attached to everything I do, but with the boys it is sometimes too near to be able to focus. I know other parent bloggers who do it a lot better than I do so I prefer to let them tell that side of the story while I focus on the little universe of those with severe and profound disabilities and those of us caring for them. Being their teacher is sometimes difficult, but being their parent would be infinitely more challenging. So being a teacher allows me some semblance of detachment from the parent life, although neither teacher-life nor parent-life are ever far from me. 8-17-2010 update: Here\u2019s a video of a doctor talking about PANDAS: ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PANDAS", "http://intramural.nimh.nih.gov/pdn/web.htm"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/08/15/pandas-muddying-the-waters-of-autism/", "title": "PANDAS: Muddying the Waters of\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "2006/08/11", "body": "I\u2019m coming back to  this series  because of something I saw related to the FBA today that bugged me in a major way. We stopped in during our community time to see Bella,  who you might remember from last year .  Bella has a different teacher at the psychoed center this year.  She apparently had a hard summer, and I noticed she had some new fresh scratches on her face.  She is not riding the bus because of behaviors there.  Last year she put her head through the window.  She also has issues related to aggression, cursing, compliance and staying in the classroom. Her old teacher from last year is actually functioning as the psyhoed behavior specialist, which is amazing.  She is fairly competent in managing her own students, but had no idea what a FBA was.  I asked to see Bella\u2019s FBA and it was a 7 line abomination that did not include any of the behaviors listed above including the self-injurious behaviors.  The behavior intervention plan was not much better.  In addition, none of the behavioral goals included any of the above targets, except for the cursing.  I was hoping to find something useful to jog my memory from last year.  The Present Level of Performance included the list of behaviors that Bella had exhibited while at the psychoed last year. So, let\u2019s talk about this FBA and ex/tend from my previous treatment when discussing the BIP. IDEA 1997 says that if the student has behaviors that impede his/her ability to learn or the learning of others.   As far as I know, IDEA 2004 does not change, alter or clarify that in any way.  Clarification would be helpful as there are no guidelines for  exactly how  to do it.  So I\u2019ll tell how *I* do it. The first step is to identify the target behaviors and to define them such that there would be no confusion as to what an observer is looking at when they see them.  For instance, self-injurious behavior would be defined as striking, scratching, pinching or poking self with sufficient force as to cause bruising, bleeding or injury. The next step is to assess duration, severity and frequency of the behavior as well as to assess context and consequences of a target.  One way to do that is to use a checklist assessment or two, such as the FAST or the MAST, which are screening tools that can help identify the function of a behavior.  Along with this, tracking the target behaviors with some sort of data collection system is essential for identifying the intent of the behaviors.  Interviews with parents and other teachers are also essential features of a thorough and meaningful assessment.  Reading past records, IEP\u2019s and psychologicals can also produce some meaningful data.  This also must include any and all medical data which can yield critical information.   Once all of this data is gathered, it is possible to begin writing the FBA.  A proper FBA will include a description of the student and the reason why they have a BIP and an FBA.  The Behaviors are listed and defined and then relevant background is presented.  I\u2019ll usually included medical information in this introduction. Then I briefly describe the methods used for assessments.  This includes what instruments are used, procedures for observations, what other materials were gathered and who was interviewed.  The background and method lay the groundwork when it comes time to do a new FBA.  A person can follow a similar method and merely add to the background as needed.  The method also provides sufficient credibility to the process which would be crucial if courts have to get involved. Next, I write about the results of the evaluation, going into sufficient detail as to present the data and information in a manner that would guide a reader to a logical conclusion as to the function.  I\u2019ll include a sample data sheet, scores from assessments, and any graphs and charts here.  I\u2019m also going to reveal the apparent function of the behavior here and do it so explicitly that no one can miss it in underlined, bold type e.g. When Bella wishes to gain access to attention she will engage in self-injurious behavior such as scratching her face until she bleeds.   Finally, I write a discussion section which includes any recommendations for intervention and any concerns about the FBA.  For instance, many behaviors may be multiply controlled and require different handling depending on the context or function.  If there was any key information I was unable to include, I would state that here.   Basically, I\u2019m following a format that is not altogether unlike a research article.  Using this background/intro-method-results-discussion format gives me enough structure without being overly stifling.  Again, this is me the writer talking.  But as a parent, it would be much easier and much more interesting reading a thorough treatment of my child\u2019s behavior than some stupid form with blanks filled in.  My FBA\u2019s become useful tools for teachers, parents and anyone who deals with a student who has behavior challenges. Neurologists and doctors have looked at and used my FBAs to make recommendations. It is very much like a sort of psychological, but more useful for looking at day-to-day behavior challenges. A bad FBA is not worth the paper it is printed on and is a complete waste of time and space.  I\u2019m amazed more of these have not been challenged by court systems.  But again, while the law says schools have to do them, they gave no guidance HOW to do it. So I may be spending some time at the psychoed educating them.  But first I\u2019m going to see if I can speak with our new county behavior intervention specialist.  Afterall, that is part of what she was hired for! dick \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/08/11/iep-process-functional-behavior-assessments/", "title": "IEP Process: Functional Behavior\u00a0Assessments"},
{"date": "2006/08/16", "body": "One of the things I promised when I started this blog was that it would be gritty, and contain the real life drama of being a teacher in a severe and profound classroom (in more ways than one) as well as being a parent.  I\u2019ve been very light on the parent bit.  Too light. So time for some gritty heaviness. Yesterday, I introduced you to the idea of PANDAS and some of Thomas\u2019 difficulties.  For once, Jane is actually just as skeptical as me about this business.  None of these conditions (PANDAS, autism, PDD-NOS, ADHD) have any sort of test a body can give.  Every one is identified by some sort of shopping list of symptoms and behavioral characteristics.  We are infinitely frustrated by this.  It\u2019s not like spina bifida or Down syndrome, where there is this definite physical marker or genetic thing.  Autism and everything about it is like some sort of phantom whose outline you can just barely make out in the mist.  You know its there.  Or do you?  We don\u2019t know where it comes from, where it is or where it will be in the  future.   Something  is there\u2026or is it?   What  is it?  Is it just bad behavior?  Is my son just being a stubborn and obstinate shit that needs to be disciplined into submission? His teacher called yesterday.  Thomas is in regular 1 st  grade with support from a para.  His teacher is actually pretty competent if not extremely empathetic.  Her son, who is in 3 rd  grade, is identical in a lot of ways to Thomas, with the autism/PDD-NOS diagnosis.  Her husband teacher MoID kids down the hall from me, so I there is a bit more of a connection than simply casual.  Thomas is exhibiting a lot of wildness, immaturity, and generally disruptive behavior.  Like at home, he requires constant, diligent supervision at all times.  He\u2019ll wander out of the room, get in the faces of other kids, hug the littlest ones around the neck, yell loudly, exhibit defiance\u2026pretty much a uniform constellation of behavior problems. Jane was the one who talked to the teacher, so she laid it all on me when I got home.  And then she asked, \u201cWhat should we do?  Any suggestions?\u201d  I\u2019m a behaviorist.  This is supposed to be my thing.   My area of expertise. However, before I can think like a behaviorist, I have to process as a father.  And that is an energy and time consuming thing.  We\u2019re constantly having to adjust to new behaviors and new demands.  I think any parent has to do this to some extent.  There\u2019s always some new thing on the horizon, some new developmental/emotional/behavioral issue.  But it usually isn\u2019t quite so bizarre and different.  Like now Thomas want to smash and smush things.  glue sticks, toothpaste, chapstick, crayons, bar soap\u2026all smashed and crumbled.  His impulsive behaviors are becoming more compulsive and  not  doing them can lead to tantrums and meltdowns. It is a lot to take in and deal with. One of the difficulties I\u2019m having is wrapping my mind around the concept of compulsions.  I get what a compulsive behavior is, but how to handle it as a behaviorist becomes tricky.  From a cognitive perspective, compulsions are driven by a false or irrational belief that something bad may happen if a person does not engage in a certain behavior or set of behaviors.  But this is unsatisfactory from a behavioral perspective.  I can\u2019t just assume anything regarding motivation.  I\u2019m going to have to noodle this out some more in order to determine function although it is looking a lot like automatic reinforcement.  Thomas has a lot of marbles but he is very concrete in his thinking, so a cognitive approach will be challenging. An instance of this is when his teacher was talking to another student.  \u201cI know you can do this!  All you need to do is push yourself harder, and you can do a lot better!\u201d Thomas overheard this, and promptly went up behind the poor boy and gave him a hard push. He was just trying to help! At least I\u2019m not contending with a lot of head banging and self-injurious behaviors.  At least we have had an opportunity to mainstream, which I\u2019m not sure is going to be able to be maintained.  Right now he is fully included, with OT and speech therapy.  We\u2019re trying to hold on to as much of a regular environment as possible for him, but as he gets older and bigger (he already weighs over 70 pounds!) it will be more difficult especially if we see more aggression. dick \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/08/16/129/", "title": "Phantom Menace"},
{"date": "2006/08/22", "body": "Last week, Jane was searching for stuff about autism and a certain combination of words (two, to be exact) and my blog popped up as the #1 result!  That was a bit surprising and startling to her.  It was news to me, too. However, while doing another search, this blog came up again as the #1 response.  So I figured since people were looking here, I might as well provide something useful.  My search involved emergency procedures for children with severe disabilities.  I was looking for something specific because I had to write some sort of evacuation plan for our class and include it in a folder used for substitutes.  We sort of knew what to do, but we were seriously winging it.  My own search did show up one promising link but I apologize for not being able to find it again!  So I\u2019ll give you what I have. Basically, a fire or tornado drill is not the same for my students as it is for the rest of the school.  It demands more effort and diligence on the part of the teachers and paras, but a substitute should be able to follow it since all my paras are experienced and I think all will go well if I\u2019m not there.  I HOPE that\u2019s the case! The following is an example of an Individual Emergency Plan which has the initials IEP, ironically enough.  But I\u2019ll just refer to it as the plan to avoid confusion.  For some students, an individual plan may be very necessary depending on certain behavioral or medical issues.  In the case of students in wheelchairs, lifting and pushing are important.  In the event of a fire drill or evacuation, wheelchairs generally follow after all other students are evacuated, simply because they can slow things down for everyone.  Since my classroom has its own door to the outside, that isn\u2019t a major issue for us. So without further delay, what follows in a sample Individual emergency Plan that I put in my substitute folder.  Hopefully, it will never need to be used in an actual emergency! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Individual Emergency Evacuation Plan Name: G eneric \u201cThe Student\u201d Dalton Age: 16 Disability:  Cerbral Palsy, Profound intellectual disability Equipment:  Wheelchair Fire Drill Procedure \n A teacher or paraeducator will \tmove assist moving the student out of the room, exiting out the back \tdoor  after  other ambulatory (walking) children have \talready exited. \n Special precautions should be \ttaken when going down a curb.

{"date": "2006/08/18", "body": "The last couple of posts have been a bit on the depressing side, and that is where I\u2019ve been with this mess.  However, I\u2019ve managed to process things and become a bit more proactive.  Actually, I\u2019m more inclined to wait things out, but his teacher, his para and Jane are all beside themselves to figure out what to do.  And it  is  my area of interest, afterall. So I dialed into the county IEP data base and looked at his IEP from last year.  We did not develop a behavior intervention plan, because he appeared to be doing well enough last year.  However, last year was not easy the whole time and it dawned on me that we should still do a BIP for a couple more years beyond whatever his improvement, just to be safe.  While there was no BIP last year, the one from the previous year was still available.  I printed this out and looked it over.  The targets of getting out of his seat and being off  task were there and defined and then there was a very large list of interventions listed from a positive support model to antecedent and response prompting to consequences.  I should know, because I\u2019m the one that wrote it.  I wrote it because there are so few other behaviorists in the county, and none that I know of at his school. This is not to say there are not competent teachers at this school, because there are some very good ones.  In fact most of them are excellent.  But none are behaviorally oriented and since a BIP is by definition a behaviorally oriented document, it stands to reason that a behaviorist would be better off writing it.  But I will say something else about about competence, which I covered in  Parking it in Special Ed .   In that post, I was a bit unfair to a fellow blogger, but my son\u2019s present case manager is a case in point.  She has done Title I reading but otherwise hasn\u2019t taught special education in her entire life.  Last year she had a special needs student in her class and demonstrated nothing short of incompetence with her.  So I am not counting on this person for any constructive help.  The only reason she wanted this job, is because she wanted a consultative-type job where she didn\u2019t have her own class.  It was a good deal for the administration, because they figured she\u2019ll do less damage here.  Plus, this teacher is on her last year before retirement.  Get the picture? So I wrote a brief note, attaching the BIP and asked for more information as far as the types of behavior, whether or not we needed more targets and interventions they have tried as well as some from the list they might want to try.  I also asked if there were any interventions for which they needed more training or support.  It was a very brief 7 point sheet, but Jane made me soften it up a bit and make it less formal.  She\u2019s a bit better with the emotional/social stuff than I am and since these are all women with limited behavioral background (and less background with me) they needed more indirect handling than I\u2019m prone to.  I come off as being abrupt sometimes because I don\u2019t see a lot of value in small talk.  I\u2019m like a guided missile when I\u2019m striving for a solution to a problem and hate being bothered by various niceties that society seems to need and demand.  Could we just get to the POINT?!? So, yeah, Thomas comes by his social ills honestly!LOL! I\u2019m thinking that once the teachers and para look at the BIP list, they may get some ideas and be able to take things from there.  At the same time, I\u2019m still going to look for a specific list of target behaviors so that we can take a stab at some data collection.  Again, I may have to train his para since she has been at this only since last year, but it seems like she might actually be more competent than her (soon-to-retire) supervisor.  And training paras is one of my  other  areas of interest!  I just need to find the time to do it. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/08/18/supporting-thomas/", "title": "Supporting Thomas"},

She apparently had a hard summer, and I noticed she had some new fresh scratches on her face.  She is not riding the bus because of behaviors there.  Last year she put her head through the window.  She also has issues related to aggression, cursing, compliance and staying in the classroom. Her old teacher from last year is actually functioning as the psyhoed behavior specialist, which is amazing.  She is fairly competent in managing her own students, but had no idea what a FBA was.  I asked to see Bella\u2019s FBA and it was a 7 line abomination that did not include any of the behaviors listed above including the self-injurious behaviors.  The behavior intervention plan was not much better.  In addition, none of the behavioral goals included any of the above targets, except for the cursing.  I was hoping to find something useful to jog my memory from last year.  The Present Level of Performance included the list of behaviors that Bella had exhibited while at the psychoed last year. So, let\u2019s talk about this FBA and ex/tend from my previous treatment when discussing the BIP. IDEA 1997 says that if the student has behaviors that impede his/her ability to learn or the learning of others.   As far as I know, IDEA 2004 does not change, alter or clarify that in any way.  Clarification would be helpful as there are no guidelines for  exactly how  to do it.  So I\u2019ll tell how *I* do it. The first step is to identify the target behaviors and to define them such that there would be no confusion as to what an observer is looking at when they see them.  For instance, self-injurious behavior would be defined as striking, scratching, pinching or poking self with sufficient force as to cause bruising, bleeding or injury. The next step is to assess duration, severity and frequency of the behavior as well as to assess context and consequences of a target.  One way to do that is to use a checklist assessment or two, such as the FAST or the MAST, which are screening tools that can help identify the function of a behavior.  Along with this, tracking the target behaviors with some sort of data collection system is essential for identifying the intent of the behaviors.  Interviews with parents and other teachers are also essential features of a thorough and meaningful assessment.  Reading past records, IEP\u2019s and psychologicals can also produce some meaningful data.  This also must include any and all medical data which can yield critical information.   Once all of this data is gathered, it is possible to begin writing the FBA.  A proper FBA will include a description of the student and the reason why they have a BIP and an FBA.  The Behaviors are listed and defined and then relevant background is presented.  I\u2019ll usually included medical information in this introduction. Then I briefly describe the methods used for assessments.  This includes what instruments are used, procedures for observations, what other materials were gathered and who was interviewed.  The background and method lay the groundwork when it comes time to do a new FBA.  A person can follow a similar method and merely add to the background as needed.  The method also provides sufficient credibility to the process which would be crucial if courts have to get involved. Next, I write about the results of the evaluation, going into sufficient detail as to present the data and information in a manner that would guide a reader to a logical conclusion as to the function.  I\u2019ll include a sample data sheet, scores from assessments, and any graphs and charts here.  I\u2019m also going to reveal the apparent function of the behavior here and do it so explicitly that no one can miss it in underlined, bold type e.g. When Bella wishes to gain access to attention she will engage in self-injurious behavior such as scratching her face until she bleeds.   Finally, I write a discussion section which includes any recommendations for intervention and any concerns about the FBA.  For instance, many behaviors may be multiply controlled and require different handling depending on the context or function.  If there was any key information I was unable to include, I would state that here.   Basically, I\u2019m following a format that is not altogether unlike a research article.  Using this background/intro-method-results-discussion format gives me enough structure without being overly stifling.  Again, this is me the writer talking.  But as a parent, it would be much easier and much more interesting reading a thorough treatment of my child\u2019s behavior than some stupid form with blanks filled in.  My FBA\u2019s become useful tools for teachers, parents and anyone who deals with a student who has behavior challenges. Neurologists and doctors have looked at and used my FBAs to make recommendations. It is very much like a sort of psychological, but more useful for looking at day-to-day behavior challenges. A bad FBA is not worth the paper it is printed on and is a complete waste of time and space.  I\u2019m amazed more of these have not been challenged by court systems.  But again, while the law says schools have to do them, they gave no guidance HOW to do it. So I may be spending some time at the psychoed educating them.  But first I\u2019m going to see if I can speak with our new county behavior intervention specialist.  Afterall, that is part of what she was hired for! dick \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/08/22/iep-process-functional-behavior-assessments-2/", "title": "IEP Process: Functional Behavior\u00a0Assessments"},
{"date": "2009/12/05", "body": "And yet again, another reason to knock this bugger off as soon as possible: I caught some sort of bug and missed a day right on the home stretch of collection period #1. While I have had most of it collected for weeks, I still need to assemble all of the pieces and fill out the entry sheets. Honestly, annual reviews are a lot easier than this bugger! One of the things that make this particularly onerous is that at the end of each year, everything that was done is supposed to be destroyed and gotten rid of. Which means reinventing and retyping things over and over again redundantly and repeatedly each year. Yes, I know; that\u2019s the point. If the students were actually doing it and it was actually based on student achievement, this would not be an issue at all. But since it has nothing to do with actual student achievement, it has to be treated as a yearly teacher assessment. Which means we have to destroy the previous year\u2019s work so that it doesn\u2019t skew the results of the current year. Given that the students and tasks change from year-to-year but the teacher doesn\u2019t (well sometimes), there is only one reason to destroy all the material from previous years: it isn\u2019t the student who is being evaluated and assessed. So I\u2019m sifting through several thousand pictures using  Picasa . It is a great (free) program for going through large batches of photos. I then assemble 4-6 pictures on a single power point slide for each piece of evidence and then fill in captions off to the side in a narrative form, addressing all of the things that we\u2019re supposed to address on each piece of evidence. Portions of this text will also used on the entry sheets. I\u2019m trying to minimize the repeated redundancy as much as possible. Invariably, I find holes where I need a bit more evidence. I really prefer that most tasks are done across a number of days so I can have photos showing progression (or no progression) and differing settings. Some parts of a task, such as watching a movie, are only just so exciting. Having multiple viewings or multiple dimensions of a task can help ad a bit of variety to the photo spread. So I\u2019ve had to pick up a few pieces here and there. At present I also have a conundrum on a couple of areas. My two hardest are algebra and social studies. Algebra is difficult to make relevant in any capacity for my students. I understand that jobs and college require it. Got it. But my students are not going to either, and have little concept of quantity, numbers and one-to-one correspondence let alone the symbolic and abstract concepts in algebra. And I know what some apologists are thinking: we can do the prereqisites as long as we can link to the standards and that is what we do. But it still isn\u2019t relevant. With social studies, it\u2019s a different dilemma. We have a lot of good choices in that subject area, provided a body is really creative. Last year, I had a para who was marvelously crafty and creative and helped kick that whole subject up a notch for the students. You would think it would be easy to replicate that same thing, even if she isn\u2019t here. But it isn\u2019t, given the numbers and students that I have this year. I\u2019ve never been that craftsy, and prefer to cede a lot of that to the paras and I\u2019ve always had at least one who would and could do it. But not so much this year. The student teacher brings in good energy and vibes, but she is only here 3 days a week for a few weeks. So I\u2019m going back to the old standby, which is under economics: money identification and properties. I\u2019m still going to try to finish Mexico, just so I have the option of using it if I like it better. OH! But one thing did kind of fall into my lap. I had used some Halloween activities and materials for the listening/speaking/viewing tasks and was wondering what collection #2\u2019s activities were going to be. I really needed some Christmas theme but going out to the community, which is my normal home run generalization activity, simply can not take place with the numbers we have. However the interior design teacher next door is doing holiday-related decorations and invited us over. WooHoo! I\u2019m saved! I hope. We\u2019ll see. But I am spending a lot of late nights at the school trying to hammer this thing out and get collection #1 finished before my  Wednesday  Tuesday deadline. It\u2019s just one more stupid stressor among many that we all have to deal with and somehow we manage to pull it off each and every year. I\u2019ll do it again this year and wonder how the heck I ever managed to do it. By the time the break comes, I am totally spent and ready for it!  I got spoiled last year with only the one student, but this year I have 2.  And middle school teachers who have ALL of your students to do, I feel your pain!  I was sitting there last night at 7:30 wondering how you guys manage this every year.

{"date": "2009/12/18", "body": "Well guess what? My GAA is NOT totally finished! In fact, I haven\u2019t started on #2 at all! So, there you go, I can be as much of a procrastinator as anyone else. And the holiday mindset has been long set around these parts. Here at the high school, Wednesday and Thursday were days of final exams. And last week was  end of course tests (EOCT) . So the schedule has been altered for quite some time. For my students, only the last couple of days have been more difficult. They simply do not do well when the schedule is severely altered. They get cranky, they get irritable, loud and sometimes even aggressive. The schedule and routine functions as a source of security for them (and the rest of us, too!) and they rely on that consistency to keep them oriented to time, since they can not really read a clock. So when the exam schedule calls for running the periods backwards or altering lunch time, it throws them and they let their displeasure and anxiety be known. I wasn\u2019t going to blog this next bit, but I think I will at the risk of offending some of the local folks. The topic is rather soft, but my treatment of it is not. The last couple of days of school, it is common for people to like to throw little parties and such. In elementary school, the teachers do manage to turn it into a theme day and that seems to work most of the time, but still runs the risk of upsetting the schedule for the students. I have no objections to the holiday-themed days with and for students. We did a great one in here last year when we studied Mexico and had a fiesta. No, my beef has been when the teachers decide to throw a potluck luncheon as a small group or department. For most departments, this is probably perfectly fine. And for most teachers, it is probably worry and drama-free. But for me and my brave little band of paras and students, it represents yet another source of stress. My students need someone to feed them or at least help them feed themselves. They need someone to wipe their mouths, change them and wipe their bottoms. It\u2019s just what we do. But when free food appears, a lot of that gets thrown out the window. We rely on a lot of outside help to feed during lunch and during every single potluck this year, much of that help has evaporated. The reason for this is that it is a potluck and not everyone brings food or enough of it. So there is a rush at the beginning of the lunch period when people are knocking down the proverbial barnyard gate, trying to waddle up to the trough in order to get their fair share. Which means 2 things: 1.) my kids are short changed 2.) My staff is short-changed. During the feeding frenzy there is much gobbling, grunting and chomping in some nice quiet room whilst the 3 or 4 of us try to feed the 9 kids who are all STARVING \u2013 or at least they act like it. And this gets my mood seething and dark, as ?I feel like we are abandoned. By the the time we are finished feeding all the kids, the lunch period is nearly over. And my paras can forget about getting much to eat as the bones tend to be picked clean across the building or wherever the potluck is. There is no way to even participate without leaving the kids with someone\u2026and those people are already at the trough. This is why I am coming to despise the potluck parties in our department. We\u2019ve tried to have them in our kitchen, but the same problems are still there and exacerbated by the traffic and disruption as people are tending their food, heating, stirring, mixing, and serving. Since we somehow end up eating with the kids during these things, it sort of sucks a lot of the fellowship out of it. I have students who have issues with adults talking among themselves and ignoring them which isn\u2019t uncommon among any students/children. Mine just get more active and vocal about it. But we are a very small part of the department, so I would not deprive others of the joy they get out of it. I\u2019m just pointing out that it isn\u2019t the greatest deal for us. The department party this evening, though, should be a better occasion to relax. So, I probably come off as a bit of a scrooge about a lot of the holiday hoopla but it\u2019s because my kids left behind in so many of the cases. That\u2019s not to say that people do not do extra ordinary things. Yesterday, some of my students were able to watch a show put on by the drama students as part of their final exam. Of course some of my kids wanted to take to the stage themselves! I kept a few of those students out so the actors would at least have a shot at hearing their own cues and passing their finals. But it was nice that we were thought of, and I hope the drama students enjoyed having us as an audience. And the teacher who volunteered to host us for Christmas activities kept the invitation open but I wasn\u2019t able to make it work out. But it was a nice invitation, nonetheless. As the day wore on (and it wore on forever!) I pulled  a page from Erin\u2019s book  and got out  my Qchord  and we played some Christmas songs. I had a few bells and tambourines and had a few of the kids joined in the playing of the music while one of them just danced to it. This got everyone in the mood for lunch, which was a bit of a mess since the cafeteria was in shut-down mode. even the custodians were coming through early, trying to get all the trash cans done. I mentioned to the one in our room that she might want to wait on us until the very last. We still had a mitt ful of students and they all had to have their diapers changed one last time before going home. And having a pile of poopy diapers sitting around for 2 weeks is not something I would like to contemplate. But I think I got all the required tasks completed, and although tired I am feeling okay with where we\u2019ll pick up next semester. As for my two boys, they are both handling the holidays extremely well. Of course, Thomas is totally ready for school to be finished but is really doing well during these last few weeks. Not having to fight over the homework is the biggest and most welcome improvement. Percy has always done well, but the stress has gotten to him just a bit and he has had problems with strep and asthmatic conditions. But overall, we\u2019re doing pretty well with the holiday stress and basically trying to avoid it as much as possible. As Thomas would say, We\u2019re \u201clooking forward to some luxurious R & R!\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.empowerpeoplechangelives.com/2009/12/course-of-challenge.html", "http://www.qchord.net/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/12/18/last-day-before-break-edition/", "title": "Last Day Before Break\u00a0Edition"},
{"date": "2010/08/11", "body": "The purpose of this blog is mainly to be informational with occasional sprinkles of\u00a0inspirational. \u00a0I just needed to say that up front in order to help stay focused. \u00a0I relate my own story in hopes that others can learn and benefit from my triumphs and occasional\u2026or many mistakes. Last Friday, my two boys got on their buses and went off to school. \u00a0This is not new to them, because they have both been through the first day of school drill before. \u00a0What was totally different this year, was the fact that when they got home from their first day of school, Daddy was there. \u00a0It was then that it really sort of hit all of us that we are on a different road. \u00a0They are used to getting off the bus and not having their dad home for a few more hours. \u00a0It has been very surreal, as the boys have NEVER known a time when I was not working. \u00a0They are used to me being around during breaks, of course. \u00a0But the climate is definitely different, now. So while I continue to search and interview, I am also taking stock of things and trying to think of some other alternative plan or strategy. \u00a0If my name is plugged into your favorite search engine, this blog comes up pretty readily. \u00a0I sometimes wonder if this might be what is scaring some administrators off. \u00a0I ran into this a bit in my old school. \u00a0The first administration seemed to be largely supportive, but when things turned over, the new administrators were decidedly more nervous. \u00a0This reached a fever pitch here in Georgia in 2009 when  a teacher was asked to resign over a Facebook entry\u00a0and then she later sued the district . \u00a0Basically the advice our teacher advocacy group was giving teachers was, \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d \u00a0That meant stay well away from all social media as much as possible. \u00a0But now, most districts and the Georgia Department of Education all have their own Facebook sites. \u00a0But that does not mean that administrators are going to simply overlook a person\u2019s space that is giving information that is also out of their control. \u00a0And this blog has had its share of political content, although I have gone to great lengths to protect former and potential employers by never posting any names and not mentioning specifics but speaking more in generalities based on a body of experiences. Thing is, I don\u2019t know. \u00a0It could be the blog. \u00a0It could be something I have no idea about. \u00a0It is as if something is out there that says \u201cIf we hire this guy, we are in a world of trouble! \u00a0Better to hire someone else or even leave the\u00a0position\u00a0vacant!\u201d SO\u2026all that is to say that I am still unemployed. \u00a0I have another check or two, and then we are into an emergency fund I built up the last few years. \u00a0However, one medical bill can pretty much sink any sized savings or nest egg. \u00a0So there is a considerable amount of soul searching involved here regarding what I want to do or what I should do. \u00a0I suspect that my old position will be open again in a few months, just based on what I know about the position/person combination. SO I am a bit anxious about what life is going to choose for me next. \u00a0Things can still happen, of course\u2026good things! \u00a0I\u2019m just trying to think about ways that I might be able to tilt them in a more favorable direction as well as try not to get too discouraged. On a positive note, after the year I had last year, I really have enjoyed the extended summer break. \u00a0Seriously, I did not really miss the preplanning and all the fuss my former/future colleagues have been going through getting things ready. \u00a0Usually after about 3 weeks of summer laziness, I get antsy and am ready to get back into it. \u00a0It is only now that I am feeling that tug to get back. \u00a0I had an interview today, in fact, and watching the kids in the halls and going in the office and the hustle and bustle, I could feel myself being mentally pulled back. \u00a0I felt it\u2026I wanted back in. \u00a0As for this particular interview, they heard exactly what they needed to hear, for good or ill, as it seemed much shorter than my previous ones. \u00a0Since the long interview isn\u2019t as positive as I once thought it was, maybe the short one is a better sign.

{"date": "2010/08/15", "body": "Every parent or teacher has them; those moments where a lesson chooses its own time and you simply have to capitalize on the opportunity presented to take advantage of it. Being not employed has presented a lot of those moments for my kids that would not be there otherwise.\u00a0 We\u2019ve actually had some pretty remarkable conversations about budgeting, money and what is involved in getting a job, keeping a job and the types of job a person can do and the amount of money a person makes at a given job. My oldest is in the 5th grade, and each passing year brings a bit more anxiety about his future.\u00a0 He is remarkably intelligent in so many ways, and yet has not learned to tie his own shoes or use the mustard without drowning his hot dog.\u00a0 It is a mixture of fear and amazement.\u00a0 I suppose this is true of all parents, but for those of us with someone who is exceptional it is even more so.\u00a0 We wonder if our kids will be able to live independently without setting fire to their apartment, or if they will be able to hold a job or safely drive a car. So today, my oldest insisted that I needed to get a job tomorrow in order that we might be able to travel again and put an end to all this talk about not having enough money to do things.\u00a0 He opened his almanac and was looking up the richest men in the world, and had a host of suggestions for me, including working for Microsoft and Walmart. This lead to a discussion of getting skills necessary to get a job.\u00a0 When he suggested working for Ford Motor Company, I explained about how I might need to be trained as a mechanic to be able to afford to take care of him and the rest of the family.\u00a0 His younger brother chimed in at the prospect of working for various fast food places.\u00a0 While these are certainly prospects, I explained that they might not be the best prospects and explained how wages were linked to qualifications and skills which were linked to doing well in school. I can tell that both boys are in deep thought about the job issue and have concerns about it.\u00a0 Last week, my youngest postulated about what it might be like living under a bridge somewhere!\u00a0 I explained that because we had been wise with our money when we had plenty, we would be okay for awhile while looking for a job, which led to a discussion about saving money and why we do it and how to do it. And one reason why we are okay (not great, but okay) at the moment was because of the lessons my own parents taught me about money and debt while growing up on the farm.\u00a0 We never had a lot, and my parents made it clear that it took a lot of work to make money and not to take it for granted.\u00a0 I remember when being about the age of my own kids we did not always have the latest toys, clothes or things.\u00a0 Most people would have regarded us as poor, but I never thought we were.\u00a0 I knew other people who were more poor and a few who were pretty well off.\u00a0 Where I grew up, school teachers were regarded as among the well-off! So as a family we\u2019re learning a few things and hopefully the best lessons will hang around for awhile while we move on.\u00a0 And hopefully we\u2019ll move on before things get so bad we\u2019re contemplating a move under the bridge!

{"date": "2010/08/30", "body": "I know in the last post I made coming back sound pretty bad.  And it was very seriously difficult coming back after having tried the most radical move I could to escape.  The first couple of days, I did have a familiar dizziness and anxiety left over from last year.  However, that has really dialed down as I get back into things.  But I have made some changes in my approach and attitude that make a world of difference.  It will all be good, no matter what the future. When the new teacher came, she was not sure what to do so she let the paras take a lead.  This is actually a good thing, because it helped the paraprofessionals form a more cohesive and competent team.  When I walked in, they already had several things underway, and were doing all of the changing, positioning and feeding.  It made me realize how much I needed to delegate down that I did not do last year.  I tried to do everything last year, and it was frustrating me. I also started the year last year loaded for bear even before the first student walked in.  And then got more angry as the year went on!  I\u2019m not doing that this year.  Yes, there are a lot of things to be angry and insulted about.  But I can\u2019t do anything about the caseload or class size.  So, I just do what I can as I go along, one day, one student, one task at a time. A saying I hear a lot is \u201cFailure is not an option.\u201d   Interesting history behind that quote.  It popped into my mind as I was working with a student on trying to see if he could read some words or be taught to read words.  I was asked ab out what I was doing and why.  He already did his GAA last year, so as far as accountability and academic standards, he could be counted as done.  However, I simply had an innate desire to see what I could do with this student.  I did it for the fun of it.  A truly astounding concept in today\u2019s educational climate, isn\u2019t it?  What sort of teacher does  anything  in the classroom for the fun of it, if it is not going to be on the almighty test?   Especially when the likelihood of failure is pretty high. Me. I figured I had little to lose by working with this student, who enjoyed what I was doing with him, and it was worth a shot.  The results are still inconclusive as to whether he was reading any of the words, such is the nature of working with nonverbal students.  I\u2019m talking words like go, up, more, down, come, and get.  He can understand somewhat if you tell him to \u2018get down\u2019 from his chair, so these should not be too far out of reach if he is able to discriminate  between the words.  Anyway, failure is a total option in this exercise, but it is still worth doing.  I can still learn a thing or two by doing it, which makes it only a failure in a conventional sense. These are just the rambles of a teacher who is messing around and teaching\u2026sometimes just for the fun of it!

A week ago, I got a call from one of my paras\u2026.one of my former paras\u2026saying that they could not find the switches and AAC devices. \u00a0This is a very big deal since ALL of those students are nonverbal and all acces to any curriculum relies on switches and devices and such. \u00a0I remembered packing them up but not exactly where I had put them. They said they would keep looking. \u00a02 days ago, they called again, saying they still had no idea where they were.\u00a0I made trek in and sure enough, the devices were in the storage closet where I left them. \u00a0The kids were all there and some sort of seemed to recognize me. \u00a0It was a bit\u00a0weird\u00a0being there everyone was okay, and I began the process of trying to help a rather shell shocked and overwhelmed teacher what there was there for the each student. \u00a0This was not a new teacher, she is a veteran, but very new to this particular population. \u00a0No one walks in knowing just what to do. \u00a0And then the new speech teacher, who did look young and new, walked in and I began talking to her a bit about the kids and how speech had worked in the past. \u00a0All in all, it was me simply slipping into the old familiar role. \u00a0But after an hour, I was able to walk out and go home to wrestle with ideas on how to market myself better. The next afternoon, the call came. \u00a0I finally got an offer for a job\ufeff. \u00a0Not just an offer, but it would be fair to say that I was cajoled and woo\u2019ed. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if \u201cbeg\u201d would be too strong of a word or not. \u00a0But I was asked to come in. \u00a0Real soon. \u00a0And so, tomorrow is my first day of work in my new job! \u00a0Actually it is only a temporary longterm sub job. \u00a0 But it is a job, right? \u00a0Got my foot in the door! Thing is\u2026.this is the same exact door I walked out of just 3 months ago. \u00a0Yes, meet the new boss! \u00a0Same as the old boss! \u00a0I have my old job back. \u00a0It would not be an understatement for me to say I have VERY mixed feelings about this. \u00a0I left to find something else. \u00a0And I am still searching. \u00a0Suffice it to say that God obviously thinks I have something yet to discover in this particular spot, with these particular students. \u00a0It looks like we will be together again, for good or ill. \u00a0So let\u2019s see what we can do. The odds are the same as last year\u2026in fact the job is even more daunting if that is even even possible, than when I left. \u00a0So, I\u2019m rolling up the sleeves and  working on getting psyched  to go in show \u2019em how it\u2019s done.

{"date": "2010/05/26", "body": "When writing the following\u00a0goodbye letter, I was totally and unexpectedly ambushed by the emotion that bubbled through.\u00a0 It is just now, during the final days and hours of school that it has started to hit me that I will not be coming back her with these kids.\u00a0 And I have spent a lot of time in this room with these kids.\u00a0 I am still busy and still working to get all the end-of-year stuff done, but it is creeping in\u2026it\u2019s almost over. I\u2019ve been ready for the end for so long, I did not expect the leaving to reach out and snag my emotions like that.\u00a0 But it did and it might yet get me some more before it\u2019s all over. But here it is\u2026me saying good bye: \u00a0 \n Dear Parents of\u00a0 My Students, \n There is this rumor going around that I will not return to Newton High School next school year.\u00a0 In fact it is not a rumor at all, but it is true.\u00a0 \u00a0I resigned my position effective the end of the year and am applying for other positions both inside and outside of the county for next year. \n The last 10 years have been a wonderful adventure and journey of learning about your children and your families and working together to meet the needs of this unique population.\u00a0 I have professionally and personally grown so much and have been taught so much by these students.\u00a0 In many ways, the students here teach everyone else the true meaning of compassion, caring, understanding, cooperation, patience, perseverance and integrity because they demand so much more than any other students.\u00a0 \n During the past year, despite many challenges, each and every student in my program made progress and improved from where they started.\u00a0 It has been an honor and privilege to be a small part of that.\u00a0 \n No matter where I end up, I will continue to be an advocate for all of our children, regardless of disability.\u00a0 I have to admit the emotional aspect of leaving comes as a bit of a surprise to me. There is a bond with each student that has passed through this room and for the first time in 10 years, I won\u2019t be back to carry on. \n I want to thank you all for your support over the past years as it does take a full team working together.\u00a0 I know a little about the challenges of raising a child with exceptional needs as my own son has a diagnosis of autism.\u00a0 I have looked upon each of you with so much admiration and respect for what you do each and every day.\u00a0 I get paid for it, you do not.\u00a0 I wish everyone well and really am praying, as you are, that the district finds a good teacher to improve on the work we\u2019ve already started. \n Thank you and God bless, \n Daniel Dage \n Serving Students with severe disabilities \n specialed.wordpress.com \n \u201cInspire Greatness\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/saying-goodbye/", "title": "Saying Goodbye"},
{"date": "2010/05/24", "body": "I have been teaching individuals with severe disabilities in this school for the past 10 years.  So just what does 10 years look like?  Well, here is is, by the numbers\u2026. 0 \u2013 (as in zero) = number of times all of my paras have shown up on time.  It is also the number of times all of my students have chosen to take advantage of their exam exemption and not come the last day of school.  It is also the number of times I have eaten with other teachers in the faculty eating area because I had a duty-free lunch.  This is also the number of other teachers in my system who have taught this population for 10 consecutive years.  And finally, this is the number of times I arrived late to school this year.     I am usually here 30-45 minutes before start time. 1- This is the number of students I have seen go the whole distance from grade 9 until they aged out.  Several have transferred, and a few have died before finishing.  I have also had one student who needed to be catheterized 2x daily.  This is also the number of days I have missed school this year. 2 \u2013 The number of administrators who have actually come in to my room and watched me teach in the classroom in 10 years.  Most observations took place in the lunch room while feeding.  And some\u2026I have no idea when they occurred! 3 \u2013 This is the number of students who have come through who have had to be tube fed in 10 years.  It is also the number of SID/PID teachers we had here during my first 3 years here.  3 teachers and 7 paras at one point (year 3 , I think). 4 \u2013 Number of principals I have seen come and go in 10 years.  They don\u2019t seem to stick around very long here!  This is also the number of times I have had to take a test in order to be highly qualified either in my subject or a new one. 5 \u2013 Number of times I have been absent in the last 10 years.  My youngest was born over a Christmas break!  The credit for this goes mostly to Jane who tends the boys when they are sick.  This is also the smallest caseload I have ever had in 10 years. 6 \u2013 This is the number of times the bus broke down during CBI trips and left us stranded on the side of a road or parking lot somewhere.  This is also the legal class size limit in Georgia for a class serving students with profound disabilities. 7 \u2013 This is the largest number of paras I have had to supervise in a single year.  It is also the number of years I drove a bus for community-based trips. 8 \u2013 This is the number of years I was under or at the legal class size limit.  Last year I had 7. 9 \u2013 My largest class/caseload size which is this year with the addition of 2 more PID students. 10- The largest number of adults serving this program at this school.  We had maybe 16 students and only 3 wheelchairs back then, but several behavior/medical issues.  7 paras and 3 teachers. Okay, maybe next time I\u2019ll go into higher numbers when exploring the last 10 years in this setting with these students.

{"date": "2010/05/01", "body": "Perhaps\u00a0 10 years is too long in this particular setting. It has been awhile since I updated this blog.  I have been busy, and the business is reaching a feverish pitch as annual reviews blend in with end of year checklists and tasks and re-evaluations and on top of that, my own campaign to find another job. All of this adds up to more stress on top of a job that has been stressful all year long with all sorts of issues.  But I have always met all of the challenges and dealt with them.  Every year, I somehow make it through and marvel at how I ever did it. Not everyone can handle the stress that is involved with serving individuals with severe disabilities.  But most teachers I know do not cite the students as the biggest stressors.  Lack of administrative support and the huge burden of paperwork rank among the top reasons educators leave the field of special education. I have not talked about a former colleague of mine lately, although he does occasionally keep in touch.  The stress on him was so heavy that he had a nervous breakdown and was carried out on a stretcher\u2026more than once.  I remember thinking those few years ago that I did not want things to get that bad.  And maybe then it was that I began to look around at other options. My first 6 years of teaching here, I drove the bus for our community outings, and so each year I had to get a bus physical.  It wasn\u2019t much of a physical, but it was at least blood pressure, pulse and weight.  And none of those numbers fluctuated very much.  I was generally healthy.  However I did smoke.  Smoking, besides all the health and social costs is also expensive and addicting.  It was the fact that I was tired of being an addict that I finally quit a couple years ago.  And then my weight ballooned so badly it was impacting my knees.  So I began a diet and exercise program and managed to get the weight under control.  All of these measures helped buy me more time and hopefully extended my shelf life. But the load and stress this year has finally taken its toll.  I was feeling a bit dizzy the last couple of days and had the school nurse take my blood pressure.  And sure enough it was high.  Not ER high, but a source of major concern nonetheless.\u00a0 The paras got a bit worried and called the nurse to check me again in the afternoon, and by then I was back in my normal range.\u00a0 I half-joked that they were overly concerned because if something happened to me, they might actually have to do some work!\u00a0 Ha ha! So I am wondering: Are there a number of other teachers out there stressing more than usual this year?  Has it taken a toll health-wise?  I know I have a number of areas where I can improve my life style, mainly getting more sleep and laying off the caffeine.  Those two alone can probably get me back in the normal range if I can also reduce some stress.  Hopefully I can survive the next couple of weeks when all my annual reviews are done and I have less overhead\u2026.hopefully.  They always like to pile on more and more at the end and so much of it seems needless. I do want to write more, and that is one way to vent off a bit.  And I also want to do a little series about the past ten years \u201cby the numbers.\u201d But I need to make it through the next couple of weeks without having to be carted off in a gurney!

{"date": "2011/09/09", "body": "As part of my  previous article on homework , I did read an  older article from 1999  that could have been written today.\u00a0 But I did not use or source it because it seemed a bit old and dated.\u00a0 However it does introduce one cause of the homework epidemic that I did not give adequate attention to. For sure the accountability movement and testing climate have driven much of the homework given, there is one other notable factor driving homework and the problems associated with it. Namely a certain demographic of parents.\u00a0 That\u2019s right, there are parents who are demanding homework for their kids.\u00a0 If there is no homework, the parents assume it is a poor school or that their student is not learning anything.\u00a0 To be sure, I would not advocate *no* homework, but would strive to cut the current load in half, at least.\u00a0 But some parents are convinced the more homework will somehow give their children a competitive edge and parents who fuss and complain about there not being enough homework tend to be competitive overachievers. I would guess that very few of these are parents of students with disabilities.\u00a0 Those of us that have to deal with issues of poor attention, sensory issues, cognitive deficits and and any sort of behavior issues are clamoring for more homework.\u00a0 In fact, I would argue that for students with disabilities, less is more.\u00a0 Since they may languish longer in the acquisition stage, the amounts need to be bite-sized until some level of competence is achieved to where they can do it independently. One other thing that I need to reiterate, based on my latest experiences with homework, is that sometimes even 4th grade math becomes too difficult to teach our own kids.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t multiply 2-by-2-digit numbers.\u00a0 I can.\u00a0 But the way it is  taught now is entirely different and totally confusing  and non-intuitive to those of us who learned to do this over 20 years ago. I know that the more mathematically inclined may be able to make complete sense of this but it took me several passes to figure this out for my gifted 4th grader.\u00a0 I eventually got the idea, but even after I did and we were able to show our work and get the right answer, it still was not the way his teacher wanted it.

{"date": "2011/09/01", "body": "Once again, I am back in my old room as a substitute and meeting a new teacher for my old students and a few new ones. It\u2019s just like riding a bike\u2026it just becomes a natural extension of you as you know what to do instinctively. And so it is with this population of students. I kind of amazed myself with how quickly I was able to bond with the new students. A bit more about my status later. But first I want to talk about a podcast that aired recently on the  Future of Education website .  You can listen to it too! I bought  Bob Compton\u2019s   2 Million Minutes documentary , and he made a lot of astute observations about the education systems in India, China and the U.S. In his latest documentary, he teams up with  Dr. Tony Wagner  ( The Global Achievement Gap ) whose book I have read and even gave a few copies away to administrators. The  Finland Phenomenon  explores the education system in Finland, often regarded as the top system in the world. Compton and Wagner wanted to find out more about the Finnish educational system and why it is as good as it is. I have not yet seen this film but do plan on seeing it and reviewing it. But I wanted to talk a bit about some things Compton said in this podcast. He talked a bit about barriers to true and genuine innovation and I was struck by his description of how large organizations try to kill or squash innovation. Basically, if there is someone who starts to excel, it makes the rest of the organization look bad or at the very least exposes mediocrity. And since no one wants to feel bad, the out-lier is attacked and either put in their place or ostracized almost out of existence. This is just the organization striving for self-preservation. People don\u2019t like change and innovation has a habit of forcing change upon people. This is also discussed in the book about  educational disruption  in education that I read a couple years ago about the time I was also reading Tony Wagner\u2019s book. So\u2026could that be the answer to the question I am too embarrassed to ask or talk much about? During my tenure teaching individuals with severe disabilities I was innovating and shaping things way beyond what anyone else was doing at the time. \n I had an active Moodle site that was a repository of knowledge to help other teachers who teach students with severe disabilities. \n I had an active blog, informing other teachers, future teachers, policiy makers and parents the effects of certain government policies on the classroom \n I recorded and posted scores of videos on Teachertube, sharing best practices in how to use different types of technology in the classroom \n I experimented with many different types of technology including mp4 players, open source programs and various switches and AAC devices \n I encouraged the faculty to use the collaboration software that the county had purchased in order to collaborate and share their ideas and thoughts rather than burdening the email system. \n We experimented with research-based interventions such as electronic social stories and video modeling to teach new behaviors. \n I tried to get school leaders to use technology to reach or teach the staff asynchronously in order to afford greater flexibility with staff development and to leverage the technology to build capacity for more staff development options and offerings. \n Participated and attended staff development activities such as Future of Education webinars, and subscribed to various educational podcasts, even experimenting with my own podcasting site. \n These efforts were not always greeted with open arms. Sometimes there was active opposition to some of the ideas but most of the time efforts to reform practice was met with a polite smile and then people continued to do what they were used to doing. I was clearly out in front of most of my colleagues when it came to technology and ideas for building capacity especially in regards to staff development using multimedia and social collaboration. And these activities are STILL regarded with a great deal of resistance and suspicion from many people who make decisions about education. Being an innovator is often very politically risky and I have to admit to being often very naive when it comes to politics. My thought is that the needs of the students should be greater than the need for any particular political vendetta. We might disagree about certain policies, but in the end we are charged with the trust of caring and educating all students. I\u2019m a bit lost as to what to do about whatever it is that keeps me from getting back into the classroom full-time and need to look at all other options. Surely some of these skills must translate into something else that is useful to someone.

{"date": "2013/07/11", "body": "I have finally finished my first year teaching for the largest charter school in Georgia, which also happens to be part of a larger company that is the largest online K-12 school in the U.S. And it has been quite an adventure on so many levels! This past year, I was a special education teacher, co-teaching algebra 1 to mostly 9 th  grade students. This alone would have been a challenge for me in any setting, since math is not exactly my best subject. Unfortunately, this is true of most special educators as most teachers who have a talent for math end up teaching it regularly. And those with a talent for both math and teaching are even more rare than those with the temperament for teaching special education. So I would have been breathing rarified air in any case, but the fact that I was doing it in an online environment made it even moreso. The first question I always get is \u201cHow do you teach special education in an online environment?\u201d Sometimes it is more generic, as in \u201cHow does online teaching work?\u201d It involves some of the same skills and routines as regular teaching, but the environment is totally different and it involves some new skills in communication and technology. Most of the same things that hold true for online learning apply to online teaching. There is a steep learning curve, more work spread over more hours. While there is some flexibility and environmental benefits, it is not easier or less rigorous than teaching in a regular brick and mortar (B&M) setting. If someone is considering teaching in an online environment there are some things they need to know. Now I can share a few things that I learned over the past year. The first and biggest adjustment I had to make was realizing that my school never sleeps. Ever. I think the closest thing my school came to taking a break was on Christmas and New Years and maybe the 4 th  of July. That does not mean that we as teachers don\u2019t have breaks, but it does mean that the company is a constant task gin and taking vacations, taking time off and otherwise being unplugged results in a backlog of things that will be waiting for you when you plug back in. If you are the sort that likes a tidy desk with all things completed at the end of the day you will be in a constant state of stress and frustration. And I was one of those people who enjoyed some sense of completion and closure. This was doable and possible when teaching in a B&M setting with individuals with severe and profound disabilities, because I worked diligently during the day and could have most things done when I went home, even if I had to stay for a few extra hours. During IEP season, I might be there as late as 7 or 8 at night but when I went home it was done and there were few things carrying forward to the next day. This is not even remotely possible in this environment. People take advantage of the flexibility, and so a teacher or administrator with young kids might wait until their kids were asleep to delve into the their major work tasks. So if I decide to check my email at 10 at night, I might find a dozen new things to do, many of which might be due by noon the next day. My peers in the B&M setting are currently on their summer break, and have been for a couple of months. I get one month off, but there is some assumption that I will plug in and check my email and complete some tasks during that time. This assumption is a bit grating, as I am used to work being work and time off being time off. I still have some things to learn about managing the time and finding balance. So just what ARE these tasks? Public education has become an endeavor that is data driven, and so much of what I do involves inputting, tracking and doing things with that data much more so that my friends in the B&M environment. Being a special education teacher adds an additional layer of compliancy that is not present anywhere else. In this setting, whatever the maximum caseload size is, you can count on having it. In the B&M setting, spring is typically \u201cIEP season.\u201d However, within my setting, with a caseload of the maximum 26, it is year round with assorted amendments that have to take place constantly. Last year, the state did a sort of sumo belly flop on our department, trying to use special ed. issues to close the school and revoke our charter. This resulted in us having to work diligently until the wee hours of the morning over the course of several months in order to meet the various state-mandated deadlines, changing our IEPs into state-mandated language. It was an oppressive, stressful environment that made me wonder why I was here and what I had gotten myself into. My day starts off with a commute of just a few feet to fire up my laptop, during which time I might go get something to eat and perhaps even take a showers. Note to perspective online teachers: taking a shower more than once a week will make you feel better! If I wait until 8 to wake up and log in, I do have the flexibility to sneak a shower in later in the day. We do have live class sessions, which most teachers enjoy as this is where the most direct interaction occurs with the students. My first one was not until 9, so the first hour of my workday was checking my email and kmail and responding while making out my task list for the day. This list was in a notebook, and usually things carried over from one day to the next and the closest I got to a clean desk was scratching off each thing I completed as I went through the day. Math had more sessions than any other subject, which was 4 times a week 9-10, and then 3 times a week 1-2. There were also weekly school meetings, weekly trainings and weekly special ed department meetings as well as other weekly staff meetings with math and high school and high school special education. Each of these meetings were opportunities to get some more tasks and work to add to our list. If I paint a picture of a lot of administrative work, that is because it is the lion\u2019s share of what we do. The academic classes on the high school level are huge. I co-taught in a section of 160-180 students. Most of the work that students do is independent and fairly self-directed, which is a huge adjustment for most of them. This is why the learning coach is such a critical component of the online learning equation. Up to this point, it might look like a bleak picture. Perhaps I can make it a little darker by pointing out that we do get paid substantially less than our B&M peers. The benefits are fairly competitive, but you will pay as they do take a huge chunk out of ones paycheck. So to summarize: longer hours, less time off and less pay. You still want to do this? We attract a lot of women with young children who want to spend more time at home with their kids and see this flexibility as a way of doing that. However once in, many realize that this is not necessarily working out like they had hoped. A lot of time is spent in meetings and on the telephone and kids and pets (and perhaps spouses) have an uncanny knack of knowing just when to make lots of noise to get mommy\u2019s attention. So the demands can seem fairly constant, now with children and job both crowding in often at the same time. I\u2019m fortunate to have a wife who can take care of the kids while I work, and kids old enough to know to stay out of the office when I am busy. But that is not to say that y parents, students and fellow teachers will never hear the sound of baritone practice, video games or other loud sounds in the background. Haha\u2026Let me reward those of you who got this far with a few rewards! Aside from the benefits of saving on wardrobe and commuting, there are other benefits. But these two things are not unsubstantial. Everyday is pajama day if you want, though I would caution that getting showered and dressed might help to differentiate work time from not-work time which is something every home-worker has to struggle with. It is otherwise easy to get in the pit of all the time being work time. But even wearing jeans, shorts, no shoes or whatever I might want to be \u201cwork clothes\u201d is a big benefit. In my former B&M school, the principal would reward teachers with \u201cJeans Day\u201d or perhaps would sell tickets to wear jeans to raise money for some cause or club. Our kids go to live events wearing shirts saying \u201cI love going to school everyday in my pajamas!\u201d and teachers have something similar about teaching in their pajamas. Not having to drive everyday is also a big benefit, as the morning and evening commutes in larger cities are considered a major stressor for most people. I don\u2019t have to be out there worrying about getting hit by another car or what the weather is going to be. Of course that precludes snow days for me, but it lends to a more consistent schedule for the school. The next biggest benefit as a teacher is not having to spend all the time we usually would spend managing behavior. This is a huge attraction for parents, students and teachers as the dangers and risks associated with being in a crowded classroom disappear when you are in your own house. A school shooting for our school would have to involve driving to every county in the state, visiting 12,000+ separate homes. We do take measures to keep the kids safe from cyberbullying but even these risks are greatly diminished when kids are not herded up and crowded into close proximity every day. Most fights in schools nowadays seem to spawn from something someone posted on Facebook and Twitter in a high tech variant of typical he-said she-said drama. Teachers can see and monitor every singe thing said in their classrooms and can simply turn off or disable chat on an individual or a class-wide basis. We encourage and model appropriate online behavior in these settings and it is a boon for many who are otherwise socially awkward. Not having to deal with behaviors like this makes it infinitely easier to deal with students 1:1, even in our huge classroom settings. And it makes it much easier to talk to kids who are already comfortable communicating digitally. It makes it easier to like them. And I do like ALL of my students and their parents and families. In fact, I adore them. In group face-to-face settings, kids often put on a false face, trying to look cool or not wanting others to see their weaknesses. So they hide behind a false front. They can easily do this digitally, too, but all kids have a need to connect on a personal level. The words are pixels on a screen but the feelings and emotions behind them are very real and kids have become more and more adept at projecting and expressing those using technology. In B&M they often project badness in groups but teachers have to go 1:1 in order to get under that tough layer. I get to do this every day, all the time. With both parents AND students. And this is, by far, the most satisfying part of my job. Touching kids is something every teacher lives for, and our kids thrive on the individual attention. And I thrive better as a teacher when I can do more of that. When I am feeling overwhelmed by my task list, I go to the kids and parents that need my help and it lifts us both. And they all are grateful and I have gotten SO much great and positive feedback that I never got in the B&M setting from those I have had the pleasure of working with this past year. It\u2019s not about the pay, the vacations, the benefits or the flexibility. It\u2019s about the connections and relationships. Being a bit of a misfit teacher, my students and I readily connect on a unique level that would not be possible in any other setting. There is a need for more online teachers all the time as the waiting list for our school seems to get longer ever year, especially in high school. You think you have what it takes? \u2013 You need to have a good work ethic that you can self-manage \u2013 You need to be flexible because the only constant here is change, and often with little or no notice \u2013 You need to be comfortable with technology as it is ALL done with the computer. Major tools for use include Outlook, Word, Excel, Powerpoint as well as some other tools. You can get a feel for the live environment by attending one of Steve  Hargadon\u2019s Future of Education  sessions live or recorded in  Blackboard Collaborate . \u2013 Communicate using all modalities. Chat, writing, live and over the telephone are all ways to get the message out. Like I said in the post about students, there is a steep learning curve. Its even steeper for teacher because you will have to be able to help families navigate a foreign system while it is still somewhat foreign to you! We do have live face-to-face conferences, workshops and professional development activities about every other month where you get to put faces to the voices and emails. New teachers meet for several days at the beginning of the year for orientation and training. I\u2019ll be looking over comments for anything I might have missed, but will be back at work on Monday 7/16!\u00a0 So even if it never gets read, at least it is getting my head back around toward getting back to what is important.

{"date": "2013/01/07", "body": "At my job, tensions and stress are running high as we try to do everything perfectly for a state organization that has all but declared war on us. Having failed at the ballot box, they are trying to accomplish administratively what they could not get done politically. At least this is how it feels. The level of compliancy required of our special education department surpasses anything done in any other school in the state. And we have 66 days to get all 1000 IEPs perfect. In my  previous writings  regarding  goals and objectives , my experiences were with those students who were k-8 or those with more severe disabilities. Since changing to a more inclusive environment that makes up the vast majority of those receiving services in high school, my eyes have been opened. There are some glaring problems and inconsistencies in the process that extend far beyond my particular school or the students I serve. With students who have severe disabilities, or in a self-contained setting the caseloads were relatively modest and I was their main teacher for most of the day. This made collecting data, making observations and writing effective goals relatively easy. Whats more, these students were following an alternate and adapted curriculum, so even if we were basing what we did on grade-level standards, we had a great deal of latitude in what was taught. In a more typical high school setting, none of these things are true. The caseload sizes are larger, the students switch classrooms several times daily and may even switch their class schedules in mid year. On top of this, the caseload manager may or may not even have this student in one of their classes. All of these things make monitoring progress problematic. However the standards-based curriculum has rendered traditional academic IEP goals and objectives almost useless and meaningless on the high school level. As a caseload manager I have absolutely no say in the curriculum of a student as it is dictated by the state. The graduation requirements are dictated by the state. The topics on the end of course tests (EOCTs) are dictated by the state. The amount that the test counts toward the final grade is dictated by the state. The type of diploma is dictated by the state. The scope, sequence, and the speed at which material must be covered is dictated by the test, which is dictated by the state. You see the trend? So the question is this: what can an IEP committee possibly write in the way of academic goals that are meaningful? We can write anything we wish, although we are admonished to make sure they are based on the state standards. The problem is that the goals that we write are worthless if they do not lead to a student passing a required course that gets them through the required exam that grants them the required credits in order to get the one college prep diploma offered by our state. The true measure of any IEP component is whether or not it gives the student access to the regular education curriculum in the least restrictive environment. At the present time, there are no academic goals that succeed in doing that. The dictated curriculum can not be modified nor can the passing score on the required exam be modified. The frustration I\u2019m feeling comes from the fact that we are being pushed and driven into writing progress reports over our academic goals. Suzie is a 9 th  grader who is struggling mightily in her algebra class. She struggles with algebraic concepts like positive and negative integers and multi-step problems. She is lost with anything involving fractions. And she feels absolutely hopeless when confronted by a word problem. Suzie is not alone as most of the students in her co-taught class struggle the same way. You may know some students like Suzie. YOU may be like Suzie! Oh, and this is Suzie\u2019s second time taking algebra after failing it the first time. In the old days, we had a lot of options in what we could do for Suzie. There were other math classes that were geared to business, career and consumer needs. Suzie would like to be a chef or a work in a restaurant after graduation. But the hopes for graduation start to fade as she is stuck and unable to pass algebra the second time around. What academic goal could I write for her to help her get her diploma? I COULD write one relating to learning how to use a calculator, as that is a standard test condition. But what objective and goal do I write that will help her pass the class? And once I write that goal, how can I or another teacher support and monitor it? The academic goals and objectives of every high school student in our state are already written in the standards. There is nothing an IEP committee can do to alter those. The best we could do is to perhaps pick a couple of general goals to monitor. But monitoring is already taking place in the form of benchmark assessments, tests and quizzes and instruction is altered on the basis of those formative assessments in order to pass the summative assessment of the EOCT. I wrote my goals with fine precision, making sure they were SMART and were in line with both the standards and the needs of the students. Suzie struggles with multi-step problems, which is a pretty consistent thread throughout any of the math classes. So my goal is \u201cSuzie will independently solve an array of multi-step equations, using her calculator, scoring at least 75% on 3 consecutive trials.\u201d It is a wonderfully concise goal and designed for easy monitoring. I could give Suzie an array of problems at least 3 times and see if she can pass my little quiz. OR, more likely, I am going to look in the grade book to see if she has passed 3 consecutive quizzes. If she can do it 3 consecutive times, I\u2019m pretty confident of mastery. If she can\u2019t I am going to figure out why and see if there are any accommodations I can offer to help her. But what of she can\u2019t do more than 2 in a row? Ever? Do I lower the bar on the goal? Do I change the goal to something she might be able to master? This is how this game ends up being played, as there is some pressure to show mastery of goals. But even if Suzie has mastered 100% of her IEP objectives, if she does not pass her algebra EOCT, she is in for a third round or how ever many rounds until she either passes it or drops out. So where should I, as a teacher, devote my limited time? Should I monitor her and the other 25 students on my caseload more often and give them more quizzes or should I spend more time trying to teach them and help them pass the quizzes and tests they are already assigned? Do I help them by making MORE work for both them and me in order to get data for the IEP or do I devote myself to getting them through the class so they can get a diploma? Unfortunately, there are no diplomas for mastered IEP objectives. There are no credits toward graduation that can be earned through mastering IEP goals. EOCTs are not tailored to the current functioning of a student who has a disability. Individual Education Programs can address student supports, but they can not touch the requirements of getting a diploma as those apply to everyone, regardless of need, disability, aspirations or aptitude. Academic goals at the high school level are not worth the time it takes to write one let alone the time spent trying to track them individually. The academic goals at the high school are very explicit and clearly spelled out in the state standards. Everything written in the IEP should be geared to accessing and mastering those standards if that is what our schools have turned in to. We don\u2019t need extra academic goals to track unless the state is going to award some credit for students mastering them. I don\u2019t mind extra work and effort if it is for something that is worthwhile and produces some results. But the standardization of the curriculum, diploma and tests works against our kids who are by definition nonstandard. We are trying to fit square pegs into round holes here. Our kids are not stupid. They are often creative and brilliant in very nonstandard ways. We do nothing to honor creativity by wringing it out of them by our insistence upon the standardization of our educational system. We are going to have to find creative ways to facilitate and reward their brilliance and creativity while addressing their strengths as well as weaknesses. I suppose that is why I am bothered and overwhelmed by the task at hand. It requires me to pigeon hole my kids into categories and then justify why they are not fitting into a system that was not built for them. While our school does its best to offer individualized and engaging ways to meet the needs of our students, we are hamstrung by a system that punishes nonstandard ways of doing things. The state wants to rig the game so they can point at us and say \u201cSEE?!? You can not possibly meet the needs of these students in your setting!\u201d Never mind that it isn\u2019t working in the other settings any better. We\u2019re a nontraditional setting, teaching nontraditional students in a nontraditional way. The measures and systems designed to measure us were designed for and by those married to the old system. We exist because there are those looking for ways to escape and flee the old way of doing things. They are refugees from places where they previously did not fit and did not thrive. And now those old forces are marshaling their influence and position in order to make sure no one thrives here, either. Sir Ken Robinson is carrying the message. Am I the only one for whom this resonates?

{"date": "2013/07/11", "body": "I have finally finished my first year teaching for the largest charter school in Georgia, which also happens to be part of a larger company that is the largest online K-12 school in the U.S. And it has been quite an adventure on so many levels! I am working on an article about being an online teacher but realized that I also needed to write something about being an online student since these go hand-in-hand. Since far more people will eventually be taking classes online than teaching them, I decided to lead off with this one.\u00a0 All online teachers end up being online learners, so this is naturally a good place to start understanding what happens in an online school. Our school is the largest in the state with over 12,000 k-12 students serving all 159 counties in the state. And we serve students in all grades with most disabilities including some with severe and multiple disabilities. Families search us out for a variety of reasons, some of which  I\u2019ve covered in prior articles about charter schools . I have personally served students who have been shot, stabbed, beat up, ridiculed, harassed, bullied and otherwise traumatized within the more typical brick and mortar setting. Some students were themselves bullies or were kicked out of their regular schools for being disruptive. Some students are professional actors, athletes or have other interests that simply do not work well with a traditional schedule. Some students have extensive medical needs that can not be met in a traditional setting or it poses an undo hardship. Some parents chose this option because, for whatever reason, they found themselves being called into the school to come and get their child, conference with administrators, or deal with other problems in the school often totally unrelated to a child\u2019s education. Some of these are young teen parents themselves who want to take care of and raise their children without having to drop out of school. Whatever the reason, families are coming to us from all corners of the state from all backgrounds. Over 50% of our students were eligible for free and reduced lunches in their regular home districts. While these students don\u2019t get the free or reduced lunches in our setting, they are eligible to receive free laptops, printers and equipment from our school including the means to access the internet if they don\u2019t already have it. Our school is a free, public charter school which does not discriminate based on age, race, gender, gender orientation, income or academic ability. In general, we have similar admission criteria as any other public school except we also do not discriminate based on ones zip code as long as they live in the state of Georgia. If you live in my state, you or your child can attend my school. However, SHOULD you or your child attend my school? And if so, what do you need to know? The first thing any perspective student and their parent should realize is that online education is not easier, less rigorous or less work than a regular school. It is more flexible. In exchange for eliminating some of the problems of scheduling and social pitfalls, it poses some extra challenges that are not present in more traditional educational settings. The work still has to be done, the standards still have to be met and the standardized tests still have to be taken and passed. These are state mandates for all public schools that do not go away just because the bus is not coming to the door. Parents and students attending us for the first time are often a bit overwhelmed by the amount of work that is expected, having had some misconception that this would somehow be easier and less work. This is probably the biggest misconception of online education and it is the downfall of most students and parents entering our setting for the first time. The second thing parents need to know is that they are going to be more involved and doing more work themselves. In our school, they are called \u201clearning coaches\u201d. While a learning coach can be any adult, it is most often a parent or guardian. Students of all ages need a certain level of support in our environment, and the parent needs to be willing, or know someone who is willing to fulfill this role. In the younger grades, this means that the parent takes on the role of being the primary teacher. While this lessens with age and grade level, it is still a critical component even in high school. It is a rare student that can manage themselves alone even in high school, especially if is their first year with us. The benefit of flexibility is also a pitfall that many students and parents fall into, becoming a crater that they find themselves struggling to escape from. Most students who go back to the regular setting are ones who fell into this early on and struggled to get out of simply because they could not adequately manage their time. Procrastination is the biggest enemy of all in this setting and the online environment makes it exasperatingly easy to find other, more interesting things to do. This is a new system and environment for most students. There is a new language, new technology, new system and an entirely new way of doing things. The learning curse is VERY steep. Even though we might spend an entire month trying to orient new students and parents, there is a still a lot to learn and the volume of new information can be overwhelming. There is an entirely new language to learn in the ways of the OLS, LMS, class connect, blackboard collaborate, Kmail, and navigating the system. So if you are considering this environment, both parents and students need to have their eyes open. \u2013 Are you willing to devote MORE hours and time upfront to learn the new language and system? \u2013 Are you willing to keep up with the constant and steady flow of new material and information? \u2013 Are you willing and able to structure your time into a daily/weekly routine that will allow room for changes and disruptions? \u2013 Is the student/learning coach relationship robust enough to endure stress, hardship and trials by fire? \u2013 Are you able to persist through many challenges that extend beyond just the academic material, but also the challenges of technology? Discouraged yet? Online learning IS the wave of the future, and just the virtue of reading this blog shows that you are plugged in some how and investing a considerable amount of time in learning and researching. So I hope I can reward your efforts with some advice, if you are still considering this route. 1. Don\u2019t get behind. In fact, get ahead if you can. Things come up and Murphy\u2019s law will be there to frustrate you. One of the biggest benefits of this setting is that you CAN shoot out front and build your own buffer. Do it and you won\u2019t regret it. 2. If things come up and you DO get behind, communicate with the teacher. We always have catch-up plans and can help prioritize to get you back on track. One thing about my fellow teachers and I is that we never give up. As long as you are willing to do the work, we\u2019ll hang with you. 3. If you are new, give the system a chance until Thanksgiving break. Persist and hang with us through the tough learning curve. I found most new families DO feel overwhelmed at first, just like I did as a new teacher. But it DOES get better. If there are additional concerns or questions, I\u2019ll do my best to address them in the comments. But in just a few days, my summer will be over and I\u2019ll be back working again! And I already have a stack of work waiting for me. But it is a subject near and dear to my heart, which I will address in the next article about being an online teacher.

{"date": "2011/09/25", "body": "On Friday afternoon, my wife called out to me \u201cHey!\u00a0 You have to see this!\u201d And there on the news was a story about the waivers offered by our beloved national education secretary that would allow states to escape many of the more ornerous NCLB provisions.\u00a0 Which is to say, almost all of them.\u00a0 And the headline read \u201cNo Child Left Behind Ends.\u201d Could it be true?\u00a0 Could it REALLY be true?\u00a0 To me, this would be the educational equivalent of the the falling of the Berlin Wall.\u00a0 Perhaps\u2026just perhaps..we might see some real reform in education.\u00a0 Meaningful reform.\u00a0 Something besides the test scores. Georgia is a state  that has already  delivered its waiver application.\u00a0 Oddly enough, it was delivered by one of the authors of the original NCLB law, Johnny Isakson.\u00a0  Remember him ?\u00a0 Basically, congress has not done its job in doing anything to fix this law simply because it is unfix-able.\u00a0 It never was and it never will be. Isakson was one of the original authors of No Child Left Behind. But last week the Georgia Republican sponsored a bill with other GOP lawmakers to scrap the adequate yearly progress requirement. No Child Left Behind requires that all students be \u201cproficient\u201d in math and science by 2014. Those benchmarks are widely considered to be unrealistic. \n Isakson said that after a decade of implementation the law \u201chas served its purpose in raising expectations and standards.\u201d\u201dWe knew when we wrote No Child Left Behind that if it worked, we would reach this point where schools would not be able to continue to meet AYP (adequate yearly progress) because the bar is set higher and higher each year for schools,\u201d he said. According to Isakson, they knew when they wrote the law, that schools would eventually all fail. The law was PROGRAMMED to fail!\u00a0 These are the people we send to Washington and this is what drinking that water and breathing that air does to people.\u00a0 And it illustrates perfectly why the congress has no business dictating federal education standards.\u00a0 The law was destined for bankruptcy even while it was being written and the lawmakers who wrote it KNEW it! But this is not the end of NCLB.\u00a0 It is not the end of testing.\u00a0 It is not the end of the alternate assessment that has plagued those teachers of students with multiple and severe disabilities.\u00a0 There is still Race To The Top, which  Georgia just received  a year ago.\u00a0 And those who are most saddled by a law that never had them in mind when it was written, will be the last to realize the benefits of this waiver.\u00a0 That is because the waiver was also not written with these students in mind.\u00a0 But hopefully what eventually trickles down will be no worse than what is already in place. I am somewhat hopeful that the career and work-ready provisions might at least help those students who could be employable with enough and the right kind of training, when they would otherwise stand no chance of getting into a college. And yes, there are a large number of students where this is true; they will not be able to get into a college and they have no desire to do so.\u00a0 But at least by fostering a culture of productivity and relevant skill-based training, it might prevent them from dropping out and actually give them an edge in life.\u00a0 At the present time, the work skills of a college drop-out and a high school drop-out are almost exactly the same due to  vocational funding  and programs being cut and minimized in order to switch the focus to collage-ready.\u00a0 And this focus has been particularly  hard-felt for students with disabilities . NCLB has been little more than an expensive and nightmarish public awareness campaign.\u00a0 According to Isakson, they wanted to put a spotlight on poor performing schools and poor performing groups of students by raising expectations and raising standards.\u00a0 But the law was outdated the day it was signed, as the world economy has been globalized.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We need innovation, creativity, enthusiasm for learning, entrepreneurship and exploration.\u00a0 And these were exactly the things that NCLB has succeeded in killing with the standardized test-taking culture that saw the diminishing or elimination of the arts in education.\u00a0 While the rest of the world has been learning how to solve problems and create, our kids have been learning how to fill in bubbles.

{"date": "2011/09/06", "body": "This is what dominates our house on a nightly basis.\u00a0 And by dominate, I mean in the most oppressive sense possible.\u00a0 In the same way Pharaoh dominated the Israelites by forcing them to make bricks without straw, so it is that we seem to be forced to toil under the oppression of a load of homework.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think teachers and administrators fully understand the weight and stress of homework on a family that makes an attempt at doing the right thing and being involved in the sense that schools like. Any sort of church or other activities during the week are absolutely out of the question.\u00a0 My oldest in middle school does not get home until almost 5 in the evening.\u00a0 Any sort of written assignment will take him hours to complete simply because he labors long and hard at those types of assignments.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course he also chooses to dawdle and procrastinate as much as possible, making homework time even longer and making it more painful.\u00a0 If the school is Pharaoh, we his parents are the overseers charged with wielding the whip to keep him producing.\u00a0\u00a0 There is much raging and gnashing of teeth, especially since we are all tired, hungry and irritable at the end of the day.\u00a0 But experience tells us that letting them eat before homework will delay the completion even longer into the night. There are several factors which make homework more painful than it needs to be.\u00a0 Some of these are because of the student (my kids) and some of these are because of the school and others are a combination of the two.\u00a0 As parents, we try to take care of those things that we can in our own kids by not letting them procrastinate and making sure they do the assignments right.\u00a0 But sometimes that is not an easy task. Sometimes we don\u2019t even know there is an assignment due.  I know it is hard to imagine, but sometimes when we ask our kids if they have homework or if it finished, they lie.\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 They tell us they have no homework or they tell us it is finished.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the past several years, some teachers have active and updated  Moodle  sites (called ELearn in our county)\u00a0 where they list the assignments and may even have copies of some of the material they pass out in class as well as other resources to help parents keep up.\u00a0 It makes being an involved parent MUCH easier.\u00a0 I know this is one more thing a teacher has to do, but nowadays, most grades and subjects are following each other, they might be giving the same assignments.\u00a0 In fact we did use that knowledge once when my youngest didn\u2019t write down his assignment.\u00a0 While his 4th grade teacher did not have an active site, there was one across town who did, and we happened to know she did from prior experience with our oldest child.\u00a0 So it was simple for us.\u00a0 But if a teacher does not have an active site, they really should consider linking to one that is active. Sometimes they forget their book or other needed material. \u00a0 Kids can be forgetful, careless and disorganized.\u00a0 Again, having an active web page that is updates can help.\u00a0 And nowadays most textbooks have an online version available.\u00a0 This has also made things easier for us. Sometimes they did not learn the concept at school and have to be taught at home. \u00a0 This can be a pet peeve of mine, although I understand there are a lot of reasons why a student does not get it at school, including distractions or their own inattentiveness.\u00a0 Nevertheless, homework is supposed to be something the student should be able to do independently as a way to get more practice toward mastery.\u00a0 However, many times the student has not even reached the acquisition stage of a skill or concept.\u00a0 At this point, we as parent have to step in and take over their education because the school, for whatever reason, has failed to teach them.\u00a0 I know this sounds like a harsh indictment, it is a simple fact that if my child has work to do and they have no clue how to do it, they have failed to learn it at school.\u00a0 No matter the reason, the child still has to be taught and this makes the process of homework completion more drawn out.\u00a0 And more oppressive. Sometimes there is too much homework. \u00a0 My middle schooler has 4 core subjects plus two electives, one of which is band.\u00a0 If you want to be good at band you have to practice and they recommend 30 minutes per day.\u00a0 So if each core subject follows the same guideline, we can have a total of over 2 hours of homework.\u00a0 Fortunately it has not been that bad, but the estimated time is not the actual time.\u00a0 30 minutes easily becomes 2 hours if any one of the above factors is true.\u00a0 Teachers need to assign based on estimates and then dial it back by at least a third.\u00a0 I would say cut it in half because a large portion of the students will take twice as long as you think they should. Sometimes we, as parents, have no clue what they are supposed to be doing or we have to teach/reteach ourselves before teaching our kids.\u00a0  For me this is less true of science but I can see many parents struggling with any or all of the subjects they have not used in years and years.\u00a0 Just watch a few game show fails and you see how little many adults retained from their own schooling. People just like these, everywhere, are making babies who grow up to be school children who will need help on their homework.\u00a0 And seriously, even those of us with college degrees will struggle with 4th grade math the way it is being taught in schools decades after we were taught the same sort of math.\u00a0 They are teaching it totally different from anything that I ever studied in an effort to increase math scores.\u00a0 So if we have to teach ourselves before we teach out children, this will further slow and burden the homework process, as well as add to the considerable fatigue and stress of it. Don\u2019t forget all of those nifty projects that may not be mentioned until the night before they are due.\u00a0  I have issues with projects that demand considerable time and resources from the parents.\u00a0 I think about the single mother working 2 jobs to support her family and then she has to go by the store to pick up extra supplies for some sort of project assigned by the school.\u00a0 Wealthy kids with wealthy parents have the nicer looking projects because their parents can spend the money and time to make it look really polished.\u00a0 But even outside of this, the projects usually demand time above and beyond regular homework assignments and can take an entire weekend to complete.\u00a0 So now in addition to the stresses of the week, it bleeds over into weekends and over breaks.\u00a0 Our school board does mandate that no homework be assigned over breaks, which gives some relief. The entire concept of homework needs to be reevaluated as to how it is assigned in both quality and quantity.\u00a0 There are  books  and\u00a0  a site  devoted to lessening the homework crunch, largely caused by pressures caused by AYP and NCLB.\u00a0 There is  also research suggesting  that homework is of little benefit anyway.

{"date": "2011/09/30", "body": "There was some news that broke about arsenic in fruit juices and my wife was all over it, I think because HER mother had heard about it.\u00a0 So I was enjoined to study and read up on the topic and here are articles and resources I have read about arsenic and Lead in Juice: \n \nThis is about traces of lead found in Juice boxes .\u00a0 You\u2019ll notice that Minute Maid Apple juice, the preferred substitute for the juice I had been buying is  on this list.  There is a couple of  good follow-up  links about this and other heavy-metal scare studies.\u00a0 Again, the recommendation is to have whole fruits and vegetables.\u00a0 But more on that in a second\u2026 I did read about the arsenic in juice,  specifically the Dr. Oz study  as well as other sites associated with the  Tampa Bay press-commissioned study . Next, I read rebuttles from  one company  as well as the one  from the juice industry . The conclusions are: \n\u2013 There are no safe levels of lead Or arsenic \n\u2013 lead and arsenic are found in the soil, the water and the air \n\u2013 therefore, breathing, drinking and eating will be fatal no matter what\u2026it is found EVERYWHERE. Having said all of that, the reason for all of this for us, is trying to treat a chronic constipation problem in one member of my family.\u00a0 So it might be helpful to see what nutritionists and doctors have to say about the topic, from the  Dr. DMK collecton : This one is by a pediatric gastroentologist  about what to do.\u00a0 Lots of info here, but a bit more complex and boring for most kids. \nThis is a  simpler video  that our kids might even be able to watch which has some different ideas. \nAnd this is a video by a nutritionist talking about  juice v. fresh fruit .\u00a0 Kids could could and should watch this too. Dr. MDK is a pediatrician from the New York area who interviews experts in many different fields.\u00a0 This is actually a great resource for ANY medical question as the videos tend to be very concise and helpful.\u00a0 And yes, he has done a variety of videos about autism and disabilities. SO when buying, preparing and eating food, I try to look at all the factors, including taste, allergies and economics.\u00a0 Everyone has different needs and preferences which makes food preparation a daunting task on even the best of days.\u00a0 I\u2019m quickly discovering that the freezer is my friend so if someone wants something not on the menu, there ARE healthy alternatives that can be relatively quick and easy.\u00a0 Quick, easy and tasty rule the day around here, and so I\u2019ve had to come up with ways to sneak in nutrition and fiber. Having everyone armed with the facts at least minimizes the arguments so we can all make better choices.

{"date": "2012/06/25", "body": "Almost a year ago, I wrote a little post about the  Future of Education .\u00a0 Ever since reading Clayton Christensen\u2019s book  Disrupting Class  and even prior to that, I have been watching and waiting for public education in this country to come around and catch up to what I had been thinking about and doing.\u00a0 The salient components were creating, collaborating and distributing ideas, lessons, materials and then having students do the same. Back in 2010, these ideas were not welcome in public schools and to a large degree, sharing things publicly is largely discouraged, which includes teacher blogs.\u00a0 Teachers are highly discouraged from being active in public media, forums and discussions on an individual level.\u00a0 And heaven forbid there is anything posted that might be construed as dissent or dissatisfaction.\u00a0\u00a0 Schools fear transparency for a pretty good reason.\u00a0 If parents  really  knew what was happening in classrooms, they might react with shock and horror.\u00a0 We need more transparency in our schools, not less.\u00a0 And attempts made by systems to censor through fear and intimidation need to quashed. Despite or perhaps because of the negativity in education nowadays, th disruption predicted by Christensen is coming closer and closer to reality.\u00a0 As budgets become more strained and as dissatisfaction increases, new opportunities are beginning to appear and technology is becoming a very key component to that.\u00a0 When I start thinking about what I see in schools and look at what can be offered in a virtual environment, the traditional factory modeled schools become a tougher and tougher sell. First of all, I think about the benefits to the students.\u00a0 First off, physical bullying is nonexistent in this setting.\u00a0 Bathroom graffiti; nonexistent.  Pink slime in the lunches : nonexistent.\u00a0 Need a pass to use the bathroom?\u00a0 How about being interrupted by a fire drill?\u00a0 Then there are the issues around riding the bus.\u00a0 Some might argue that students will miss out on valuable social skills from the interaction with classmates.\u00a0 I have seen and experienced these \u2018social skills\u2019 which include learning how to curse at adults and each other.\u00a0 Or how to sag your pants and show your butt.\u00a0 Or how important having the latest designer clothes and gadgets is to social status.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I could do without a lot of the social lessons that are being passed around in todays schools. There are benefits to teachers as well.\u00a0 not having to take a lunch count, not having to supervise halls and lunchrooms and playgrounds frees up time to actually work and interact with students.\u00a0 If a student gets unruly or disrespectful in an online session, it is all there and recorded and they can removed with a push of a button, denying the offending student an audience.\u00a0 A teacher in this environment does not have to worry about being assaulted or having their car vandalized in the parking lot.\u00a0 While some online sessions can have many more students, many more can be accommodated through watching recordings of the live sessions.\u00a0 Why should a teacher have to present the same thing 6 times a day when one recording can work as well? The single biggest downside to the virtual learning environment is that it involves a significant investment by the parent.\u00a0 Not necessarily in money as most homes already have the technology and connections necessary, but in time.\u00a0 The parents have to take over the custodial role for their children, instead of the school.\u00a0 And this is significant especially if both parents are working in full-time jobs. The disruption is already taking place all over the country and it remains to be seen if or how positive the impact will be on the education of our students.\u00a0 But times for traditional schools are getting tougher all the time with school budgets tightening around the country causing increased class sizes and decreased number of days in schools.\u00a0 With the shortening of the school year, parents are already having to find other ways for their children to be looked after while they work.\u00a0 And herding more students into smaller spaces brings the task of control to such prominence as to totally overshadow the supposed main goal, which is education.\u00a0 It forces the culture to have more in common with prisons than with places of learning.

{"date": "2012/09/14", "body": "I knew not everyone would agree with my take in my last article on Charter schools and the charter school amendment.\u00a0 I will admit that the issue is a bit complex, muddied by some emotional rhetoric on both sides.\u00a0 And I freely admit that I can be as shameless of a purveyor of rhetoric as anyone.\u00a0 Writing without hyperbole is just kinda boring. Lost in all of the debate, accusations and political gamesmanship is the main focus and subject: students.\u00a0 They are the ones who will ultimately gain or suffer by what we do or don\u2019t do in November. The anti-choice folks state very passionately that the students in traditional schools will ultimately suffer due to the funding that will be taken away from their schools, causing more overcrowding and more deplorable conditions.\u00a0 And I can sympathize as I have witnessed first-hand what has happened to the education system in my beloved district.\u00a0 Paras were the first to be let go, and then the furloughs and then loss of benefits and finally the overcrowding of almost every class in every school.\u00a0 Teacher morale was at an all-time low when I left that setting.\u00a0 Conditions have not improved by any degree or measure in the 2 years since then.\u00a0 So in some sense, it appears that by taking money away, I advocate making things even worse! I do not advocate taking money away as much as I advocate taking children away.\u00a0 And many parents are doing just that, at great cost and sacrifice.\u00a0 The giant brick and mortar factory schools are crumbling. So who are the students in my school?\u00a0 I am now teaching in the largest charter school in the state, and one of the largest in the nation.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have buses, we don\u2019t have lunchrooms and we don\u2019t have sports teams.\u00a0 What we do have are students.\u00a0 Over 12,000 of them in Georgia, with a long waiting list of more who want to get in. Over 50% of our kids qualified for free and reduced lunches when they went to a brick and mortar school.\u00a0 Over 1000 receive special education services at every level.They come from towns that I have never heard of, all over the state, from every ethnic background.\u00a0 Some are urban and some are rural.\u00a0 But one thing they all have in common is hope.\u00a0 A hope for a better future, a new start and some way of attaining their goals.\u00a0 Intimately linked to these students are their parents who aspire for better and greater things for their children.\u00a0 Most have chosen to stay home to be their children\u2019s learning coach and to invest personally in their child\u2019s education.\u00a0 They make the sacrifice of career in order to offer something better for their children, giving up much economically, which is especially poignant in today\u2019s economy.\u00a0 A few of them were already homeschooling while for many this is their first foray into taking charge of their children\u2019s education, becoming true partners with the educational system, interfacing with the teachers, the curriculum and the classes.\u00a0 Every single day, there are parents who attend classes with their children, sitting right beside them, helping and guiding them. K12 has a Facebook page which often asks parents this question: Why did you choose K12? There are scores of replies that can generally be categorized as follows: \u201cMy child was bullied\u201d, \u201cMy child was too distracted,\u201d \u201cMy child was repeatedly bullied and there was nothing the school could do\u201d, \u201cThe classes were too overcrowded for my child to learn\u201d \u201cMy child was bullied and did not want to go to school anymore\u201d \u201cMy child was not making progress\u201d \u201cMy child was bullied and harassed daily and the school would not do anything\u201d \u201cMy child needed a more stable learning environment and I did not have enough knowledge to home school\u201d \u201cMy child was attacked and stabbed\u201d \u201cI was fed up with what was going on in my home school\u201d \u201cThere were too many fights at my child\u2019s neighborhood schools\u201d \u201cMy child needed to learn at her own pace\u201d \u201cMy child was afraid to go to school because of the bullying and fights\u201d\u201dMy child became afraid to go to go to school after she was attacked\u201d \u201cMy child has a medical condition and she was missing too many assignments\u201d \u201cThe only social skills my child was exposed to was fighting, bullying, cursing and swearing\u201d\u201dWe could not afford a private school and our neighborhood school in south Fulton was too violent and my child was not learning anything\u201d \u201cMy child had a disability and his needs were not being met\u201d \u201cMy child has aspergers and was teased relentlessly\u201d \u201cMy child needs 1:1 support to be successful\u201d \u201cMy child became so depressed and withdrawn, they did want to leave the house after starting middle school.\u00a0 I later found out she was being teased and bullied daily\u201d You get the picture?\u00a0 Your school may not have any of these problems and you may have the best and most dedicated teachers in the world.\u00a0 But these children are refugees from the world of traditional schooling.\u00a0 Their entire school experience, for many of them, was dictated by their zip code.\u00a0 If you live in a nice, suburban wealthy neighborhood, you might not have many problems in your school of overcrowding, gangs, bullying, distractions or other things that make daily life for many students a living hell.\u00a0 All of the families might be well-adjusted and involved in the local PTA.\u00a0 Every classroom might be staffed by a highly qualified, enthusiastic teacher who incorporates technology and engagement into every lesson. But for too many of the children I and my fellow teachers serve, this was not their experience.\u00a0 Their experiences were so bad, that many single parents sacrificed many opportunities in order to provide the safe, nurturing and distraction-free environment that only a parent can provide in their own home so that their children can attend school without the fear and anxiety that comes with being a victim of harassment, bullying and abuse.\u00a0 They were looking for a new start where they could again become confident learners without being persecuted for being \u201cdifferent.\u201d I hope to eventually blog my own transformational experience since joining this incredible team.\u00a0 But suffice it to say that I adore my students as well as their parents who have sacrificed so much to offer their children what they perceive to be their best chance at success.\u00a0 I owe it to them to do the best that I can for them, and I am a tenacious advocate for their cause.\u00a0 They inspire me to be a better teacher. I know that those who oppose the charter school amendment, in their own way, are advocating for children too.\u00a0 They fear that the traditional schools demise will be hastened by the advent and rise of charter schools like these.\u00a0 But the genie is out of the bottle.\u00a0 While you might be able to slow the process, the changes are coming.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure what you expect to happen within the next 10 years with traditional schools, but I can tell you what we saw in the last 10 years does not bode well.\u00a0 Schools, schooling and learning are going to be transformed.\u00a0 They MUST be transformed.\u00a0 Putting these kids back into traditional schools after what they suffered through and after having tasted the sweetness of success, would be devastating.\u00a0 Why would you do this?\u00a0 Why would you send a child who has found success and confidence in this new environment back into the old environment where fear and failure ruled their lives? Many detractors point out that charter schools do not do any better than the traditional schools when it comes to test scores, the current rubric of measured success in American education today.\u00a0 And this is true in my school, where the gains are often modest at best.\u00a0 But read the comment excerpts above.\u00a0 The case could be made that many of these students suffer from PTSD, and many of them came to us 1, 2 and even 3 years behind.\u00a0 These are not kids who were achieving well in their old schools, and often sought escape, refuge and asylum after a long string of failure.\u00a0 I know of no parent who makes the decision to withdraw their child from their neighborhood school lightly as the decision carries with it some serious economic, social and lifestyle consequences.\u00a0 Change is never easy, and this sort of change for young people is pretty drastic.\u00a0 But given the comments above, I have to ask you: What would YOU do?\u00a0 Should your zip code be the sole arbiter of your child\u2019s educational success?\u00a0 Should the quality of your child\u2019s education and life be dictated solely by the economy of your neighborhood? Jane and I are in the midst of the very same discussion as so many parents today.\u00a0 We look at the declining state of our neighborhood schools and we are fearful of what will happen in the future.\u00a0 My oldest son\u2019s middle school does try very hard and they have done their best to address the instances of bullying that have occurred.\u00a0 They really have put a lot of effort into trying to provide a safe environment that enables him to succeed as best they can.\u00a0 But the high school up the street is a nightmare engaged in a seeming race to the bottom.\u00a0 We are looking at our options, and they are few.\u00a0 But there ARE options, thank goodness. And this is one thing that I think detractors of charter schools overlook.\u00a0 Simply having viable options in place that are close by can actually help your neighborhood school.\u00a0 When those options are not in place, the more dramatic sacrifice is to pull up the stakes and move.\u00a0 When your option is dictated solely by your zip code and there are no other options many, many families choose to change zip codes.\u00a0 At least a neighborhood charter school keeps involved families in play to be won back if the schools can turn things around.\u00a0 But once families leave their neighborhoods, you begin to see businesses close their doors and board up their windows. Is K12 or any other charter school perfect?\u00a0 Absolutely not, and I do intend to blog an open letter to the good folks in Herndon, VA at some point.\u00a0 But in the meantime, it provides a place for at least 12,000 of Georgia\u2019s children who, for whatever reason, did not fit in at their traditional brick and mortar schools.\u00a0 Our beloved State School Superintendent has voiced his willingness to send those 12,000 students and their families back to the schools they fled from, and bar the door to keep them there.\u00a0 Georgia\u2019s families will be once again tied to their schools based on their zip codes and their income. In a world where knowledge and information are ubiquitous, it is time to put an end to the educational apartheid that exists in the state of Georgia and around the country.\u00a0 The quality of a child\u2019s education should not be dictated by their township anymore than it was in South Africa in 1980.\u00a0 It was wrong then and there, and it is wrong here and now.\u00a0 Today I can shop in a neighboring town\u2019s store (or online) for better goods, go to a neighboring town for better health care or attend a church anywhere that I care to drive.\u00a0 But my child can not attend a school outside of the district or zoning lines. We owe it to our children to offer opportunity and choice.\u00a0 We need to decide the type of world we are going to live in.\u00a0 The amendment, like it or not, IS a referendum on choice and opportunity for Georgia\u2019s families.\u00a0 Are we going to follow the same path that we have been on for the last 10-12 years?\u00a0 Or are we going to risk something different? The traditional public schools have a problem that has become a ubiquitous epidemic.\u00a0 It is persistent and rampant.\u00a0 It is also a problem that completely disappears once students enter our school. John Barge, the teacher\u2019s unions, the school boards and so many others who hate our charter school are not addressing or talking about it.\u00a0 Their failure to effectively deal with it has created a demand that would simply not otherwise exist. \u00a0 Now these same people are are trying to take my kids; the ones I teach; the ones who have escaped to a safe and secure place where they can actually learn and return them to the same conditions they fled from.\u00a0 Where is the outrage?\u00a0 Where is the shame? \u00a0 Tags:  bullying ,  charter school ,  Charter school amendment ,  Georgia ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/the-truth-about-charter-schools-the-students/", "title": "The Truth About Charter Schools: The\u00a0Students"},
{"date": "2012/08/11", "body": "\u00a0 I need to write this to get it out of my system, despite the fact that I have a mountain of tasks that need to be accomplished before Monday. A major portion of my task list revolves around IEP goals and objectives. \u00a0 One of the amazing things I discovered when I wrote my  blog post  back in 2006* about IEP goals and objectives (which later became published as part of a  collection of articles in book form ) was the level of concern parents have about this topic. As teachers, we have to write them and are supposed to be tracking them, because it is the law and best practice. However it always seemed parents were more anxious to talk about placement rather than spend much time on goals and objectives. However that article continues to be the most read post I have ever published, getting almost 28,000 hits out of 350,000 all-time views, plus it is read at the  TPGTA  website as well as many  liking and reading  it in the book. The message is clear: parents are intensely interested in this topic. Therefore, we owe it to them as well as to ourselves as teachers to get it right. \u00a0 To their credit, the folks I am currently working with have revised their goals and objectives to be much better and pretty much follow the guidelines that I set up in that article. They are actually the best goals I have ever seen written as a an entire school. They get it\u2026sort of. \u00a0 As I started looking at my caseload and preparing to track the goals, the shortcomings of the 80% criteria mastery became more and more glaring and disturbed me more and more. While the goals were better written and more measurable, it was going to be an absolutely oppressive task to decipher, measure and track all of these goals for literally hundreds of students. We need to do better. \u00a0 Somewhere along the line, 80% became this mysteriously magical number. To be sure, it is better than 60, 70 or even 75%. But in real life, our tolerance for 80% is low to negligible. \u00a0 What if your employer offered to pay you 80% of your agreed salary 80% of the time? Would you accept that? What if your car only started 80% of the time? Would that be acceptable? What if 1 out of every 5 planes crashed while taking off? Do you feed your children 80% of the time? Do you think the government is going to accept you paying your taxes 80% of the time? Which appliances do you want to perform on demand 80% of the time? In which store would you shop at where you have an 80% chance that the merchandise you bought will be what is inside the box? \u00a0 The 80% criteria is the criterion of mediocrity. There ARE times when it may be appropriate but they are few and far between for most busy special education teachers. Even moreso for parents who might be responsible for tracking some of these things. \u00a0 Here is a goal I saw today (Name changed, but I think it might have actually been an example for how to write a goal): \u00a0 \u201c Given instruction Wilma will increase her words per minute (WPM) to 100 by the end of the school year\u201d The criteria was 80% \u00a0 That was the objective, and it is pretty straight forward. It fits the  SMART definition : Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time limited. But there are still niggling problems. \u00a0 Is she already reading 80 WPM? Is she going to read 100 words and miss 20% of them? Increasing reading rate is certainly a worthwhile goal. And if reading 100 WPM is worthwhile, why are we satisfied with 80% ? Why not 100%? \u00a0 And this is where I have gotten LOT of resistance from colleagues, present and past. \u201c100 PERCENT! OMG! **I** don\u2019t do anything 100% of the time or with 100 percent accuracy! I would hate for anyone to expect me to be perfect 100% of the time!\u201d \u00a0 It is true that we are flawed human beings and prone to error. But when we take a plane, we expect to arrive at the correct terminal 100% of the time and have our luggage arrive at the same place 100% of the time. If it does not happen the way it is supposed to, we get mighty cranky and demand that things be fixed and made right. \u00a0 While our students are as flawed as any of us, the assumption is that they are somehow more badly broken. Only a broken toaster would perform at 80%. Only a broken car would start 80% of the time. Only if we think a thing is broken and we have no intention of fixing it do we accept 80% as a criteria for performance. We need to change our thinking. \u00a0 If the child is reading 80 WPM, and our goal is to get them reading at 100 WPM, then that needs to be the goal. And the criteria needs to be 100%. They either read 100 words correctly in a minute or they don\u2019t. However, when we write the goals, we need to set proper conditions: \u00a0 \u201cGiven one trial per day, Wilma will read 100 WPM for 3 consecutive days.\u201d Criteria = 100% \u00a0 Is Wilma expected to be perfect all the time? No. But given the deliberate and planned nature of a trial, I am pretty confident of her mastery if she can be perfect 3 times in a row. THAT, my friends, is a much better picture of true mastery. Yes, there will be the occasional plane crash, but most of the time, thankfully, things go exactly as planned. Sure, there are delays but the main goal is arriving at the destination. And even with how common delays are, we are not necessarily happy when they occur. So should it be with our goals and objectives. \u00a0 While my thinking on goals is evolving, let\u2019s try another goal: \u201cGiven a weekly homework schedule, Fred will complete and hand in his work over 4 of 5 opportunities\u201d \u00a0 This goal is way better than most goals on the subject of handing in homework. Again, it is SMART. At least it does not have the onerous 80%, right? \u00a0 Welll\u2026it is actually not-so-cleverly couched within that criteria. It is a major improvement over \u201cHanding in his homework on time with 80% accuracy\u201d but it still has some brokenness and failure built into it. Why did we say 4 of 5? Why not just 5? Will Fred be capable of handing in 5 assignments over 5 opportunities this year or not? If he is, then why do we settle for 4? If he is not, then why are we making ourselves track 5 data points that he will never hit? Again, we need to strive for consistency in performance that indicates mastery. If we want him to turn in 4 assignments in a row over 4 days, then that should be the goal. And the expectation is that he will be able to hit 4 days in a row without a miss. \u201c4 of 5\u201d is actually like saying \u201c3 in a row\u201d because there is no possible way to hit 4 of 5 with being able to hit at least 3 consecutive times. It\u2019s mathematically impossible. If you miss once, you are out after the second miss. This is why I often will truncate my objectives and do 3 consecutive trials with 100%. \u00a0 So: Given a weekly homework schedule, Fred will complete and hand in his work, on time, 3 consecutive times\u201d Criteria = 100% \u00a0 Now this is a behavoral issue. Fred is a smart guy, and he will master this objective in the very first week as it is written, You grade his first 3 worksheets and they are turned in on time but they are all blank! Or he rushes through them and scores a 50. THIS is where the 80% can come into play: \u201cGiven a weekly homework schedule, Fred will complete and hand in his work on time 3 times in a row scoring 80% or better. Criteria = 100%\u201d If Fred has academic problems we might say 70%, but we are making sure he actually passes the work he turns in. He does not have to be perfect in the academics, but he DOES have to demonstrate mastery on the behavioral part. If he misses just once, we reset the clock, give some additional support, and try again. We can track academics in a separate goal. \u00a0 \u201cTrials\u201d v \u201cOpportunities\u201d Our students have many, many opportunities to read, write and complete tasks, but we are not going to track and measure each one. We are going to set specific conditions when we measure progress. This deliberate and planned setting of an antecedent gives rise to a trial, which demands a response or behavior. This is the most fundamental component of instruction. We give a cue, they respond and we give feedback in the form of comments, a grade or even a reward. We certainly want our kids to generalize across settings, and this should happen once the task is mastered. We plan to test and teach Wilma to read 100 WPM, and we want this to carry over to when she reads social studies or science. But she has to master the target under the best of conditions before we go into other areas. A trial optimizes those conditions. An \u201copportunity\u201d simply looks more haphazard. Most teachers use \u201copportunities\u201d when they mean \u201ctrials\u201d. Say what you mean, and mean what you say. With the huge number of goals a teacher has to manage with a caseload of 26 students, we can not afford to be haphazard. And since someone else might end up tracking the objective or goal you are writing, it is simply more humane to make the goals as easily trackable as possible. We need to stop abusing our colleagues with poorly written goals that require a math degree and several hours to track. \u00a0 Let me give one more reason to make our goals easier. They need to be understood by parents and the students. Unless you are prepared to make a graph, you need to shy away from partial and broken goals. Almost 90% of my students struggle with math, and parents and and special educators do not vary substantially from that. Otherwise we would all be math teachers! Everyone understands 100% mastery and know it when they see it. This is especially true for behavioral goals but is just as true for many academic goals. Stick with making the goals more simple and achievable. Almost any goal can be manipulated into a 100% mastery criteria. Any parent will be able to understand and know when it is achieved and so will most students. Many of my students are gamers and they have a better understanding of striving for mastery than many adults. They understand the concept of questing and mastering a series of objectives is a sort of quest. We set our kids on it and when they complete one quest, we give them a new, more challenging one. But if they don\u2019t understand the quest or know when it is completed, they quickly lose interest in the game. \u00a0 So when is 80% or its fractional equivalent (4 of 5 or 8 of 10) appropriate? When we are doing something where we are willing to make a graph and when we can track larger arrays during our trials. Math achievement is a good example, where there is an array of 10 or more problems. The larger the array of measured trials, the more a percentage is appropriate. In the case of math, each problem represents a trial. Some behavioral goals where you are using time sampling or event recording and have over 10 data points lend themselves to using a percentage or fraction of a large total. The larger the sample, the more appropriate it is to use a percentage. But in that case, you still need to think about your marriage to 80% mastery. Percentages lend themselves nicely to automated collection systems, like computer-graded tests. If a computer is not doing the collecting and scoring, you are making your life miserable by living within a percentage, \u00a0 One more thing about goals: Less is more. I have some students with over 20 objectives. If I have a caseload of 25 students (it\u2019s actually 26), that means I am trying to track over 500 separate pieces of data! I can be either complete or accurate, but it is inhumane to expect both. It is simply impractical to devote the attention that each goal requires if I have to manually enter, manage and track individual trials and then decide if we are at 80%. It\u2019s far easier to look for \u201c3 in a row\u201d or however many and mark that quest as complete as we go. Especially if I can keep it down to 100 or less. \u00a0 When potty training our children, our goal is 100% . Accidents can and do happen, but that is the exception not the rule. We start out wanting Freddy to be dry an entire day, then 2 days in a row. Not for 2 days at 80%. Two days. Period. Then 3 days and so on until his diaper is dry for an entire week. Every parent nows that at that point, he is \u201cgetting it.\u201d Then we move up to pull-ups and eventually his \u201cbig boy underwear\u201d. We support him at every stage, striving for more and better consistency. Are we demanding that little Freddy be perfect 100% of the time? No! But we are striving for consistency. I won\u2019t buy from any eBay retailer with less than 97% positive ratings. Why do we settle for so much less for our kids? \u00a0 For most goals, 80% is simply not consistent enough. When we disengage from mediocrity, it makes life easier and better for all of us. I\u2019m not programming for mediocrity or failure, I want to program for success! And true success in most meaningful things requires a higher level of consistency than 80%. \u00a0 *Note: Back in 2006, I was blogging pseudonymously under the name \u201cDick Dalton,\u201d hence how I was addressed in many of the comments at that time.

{"date": "2012/10/27", "body": "In the interest of disclosure, I do work for the largest charter school in the state of Georgia. My views do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer and should not be construed to reflect any other opinion other than my own. But I\u2019m trying to present mostly facts here to educate those who might seek more knowledge before they make any decisions. There is an election coming up, in case you might not have heard or have missed it. In the state of Georgia, neither of the presidential candidates have spent much time or money here, and neither state senator is up for re-election so it has been comparatively quiet here. Except for one issue: The State Charter School Amendment. You can read the entirety of the  legislation here . It\u2019s barely over 2 pages long. In a week or so, the people of Georgia will cast their vote on this question: \u201cShall the Constitution of Georgia be amended to allow state or local  approval of public charter schools upon the request of local communities?\u201d YES NO That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all there is. The Georgia school districts and the state Superintendent of Education have campaigned relentlessly against this amendment. I was going to link to the Boards of Education who have come out against the amendment, but instead I\u2019ll link you to the school boards that I know of who have supported it: [\u2026.sounds of crickets\u2026] Well, that was nice. If anyone knows of any public county or city school system that has voiced approval for the amendment, please let me know! I will link to  one BOE\u2019s resolution here . I actually agree with over half of of the preambular clauses of this resolution. I agree that education is important and that public education is critical to the future of our community, nation and state.  I linked in an earlier article  to  Condolezza Rice talking about education  as a national security issue and the civil rights issue of our times. I also know the reality of education funding, and the squeeze it has put on districts. Districts in the state are repeatedly being asked to do more with less. And so, the districts across the state opine that state funded charter schools will divert money away from the local school districts thereby impoverishing them even more. But is this true? Most of the funding for traditional public schools come from the local property taxes. There have been many efforts to reform how money is raised to pay for education but no one has succeeded in changing it and so property owners foot most of the bill for their local district expenses in education. The meltdown of the real estate market during the current recession put most districts in Georgia in a state of crisis as property values plummeted and tax revenues followed. But everyone who owns property still pays taxes on the assessed value whether they have children that go to the school or not. The only way I can escape paying my property taxes is to sell my property. In the state of Georgia, the average district  spends about $9,000 per student . And roughly $4,000 of those dollars come from the state. The other $5,000 comes from taxpayers of that district. If a student moves from one district to another, the state money follows that student while the local money stays. But when a school district is so bad that families begin moving out in en mass, then property values suffer and the district\u2019s revenues suffer as well. Wherever the student moves, the state still recognizes its obligation to educate him or her. So what affect does the charter school amendment have on this funding dynamic? If it is a charter school established and supported by the local school board, things don\u2019t change much at all. The board still does the oversight of funds, same as usual according to the school\u2019s charter. However if it is a state charter school, then it is written in the bill that the state would fund it and not the local district. So if Thomas is attending a regular school and withdraws to attend the school I work for, then the school district does indeed lose about 4,000 state dollars that go to my state funded charter school. However the remaining 5,000 local dollars are distributed among the remaining students to be used as the local board sees fit. In addition, since my school does not require students to leave their home towns or counties, the family continues to reside there and pay their taxes as normal. Thomas does not have to move to find a school that better works for him, and the district actually gains $5,000 as it no longer has to educate a student that was probably unhappy there anyway. So the district\u2019s argument that they lose money because of public charter schools is simply not true. Local school superintendents would have you believe that public charter schools are gigantic leeches on the backs of already beleaguered traditional schools. But this is untrue, and the only thing the Charter School Amendment does in regards to funding is to guarantee that local districts get to keep their local money. This amendment actually  protects them and the majority of their funds ! The other club that districts are using against this amendment is that of taking away local control from local school boards. This is probably closer to the truth behind the popular opposition to this initiative. And when I first heard about this amendment, I was thinking much the same way. It was the state, taking money away from me, and establishing schools that my local school board did not want over their objections. It certainly smells like Atlanta butting in where it isn\u2019t wanted, doesn\u2019t it? But the fact of the matter is much different. Charter schools are not initiated by the state. They are initiated by concerned parents of children who want to be served in a different way than the traditional schools are able or willing to do. So the first step is to petition the local board to establish a charter school. In the current climate, you can see that there is not going to be much sympathy toward such parents in these districts. So then they petition on the state level to the state Board of Education. Again, our beloved State Superintendent of Education has stated his mind in regards to charter schools. So where can families go now? Some of them are pulling up the stakes and leaving. Some of them are homeschooling. And some try private schooling. But remember the preambular statements in the above resolution? Public education is important, and parents ARE willing to make enormous sacrifices for their children to obtain a decent chance. Local school boards are NOT the lowest level of local control. The most local control of all is in our own houses at our own kitchen tables. Families all over the state exercise their most fundamental right to local control and self governance when they decide how their children should be educated. What this amendment does is help to give parents an option; an avenue of control that is apart and distinct from that of the local board of education. The 180 schools systems in Georgia are not ALL bad, but several of them seem to have distinguished themselves as being sub par. Many of the school boards seem to have proven out Mark Twain when he said \u201cGod made the idiot for practice and then He made school boards.\u201d Just what is a parent supposed to do in such circumstance? Surely they can vote, but in the meantime their children still need to get educated. Charter schools would not exist at all if no one wanted them. These same school officials speaking out against this amendment are the very ones who have helped create the demand for them, and yet want to cut off that option from parents. The fact is that this amendment recognizes the right of charter schools to exist and the right of the state to fund them while protecting the local funds from being used to fund them. If parents don\u2019t like a charter school, they do not have to send their kids there. Parents can and will vote with their feet. And this is precisely what local districts are afraid of. They are of afraid of the state taking control away from them, they are afraid of parents taking control way from them by opting out of their own systems. If the status quo is allowed to continue, districts will continue to deny opportunities for parents and students, and keep them bound to the same system. In my previous article I pointed out why many of the students that I teach are ill-served by the present system. Public charter schools provide them the opportunity to continue their education while remaining in their home communities. Voters who are concerned about this topic should vote their conscious, and make a decision based on the facts, not on the series of fictions and fears currently being publicized. Do not be swayed by Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt: FUD. Be informed and be proactive. People need facts, not FUD. Read the bill as it is written, and make your decision based on whether it is something you agree with or not, not because of what I say or because of what your district superintendent says. Sure, I definitely have an interest in keeping my job, but I also have an interest in the students that I teach and their families. Shutting down state charter schools may make life easier for 180 superintendents who no longer have to compete with us, but it will not help the students that I teach who DO have to compete with the rest of the world. Note:I saw this AFTER I had already written my piece. If you would like to see a debate on the issue,  you can watch it here . My favorite quote is by Supt. Wilbanks  \u201cParental choice is an issue that is overplayed.\u201d Tags:  chater school amendment ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/pdf/hr1162.pdf", "http://www.newtoncountyschools.org/about/news/articletype/articleview/articleid/278/boe-approves-resolution-opposing-charter-school-amendment.aspx", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=qNi-Bz0QRLE", "http://febp.newamerica.net/k12/GA", "http://www.gpb.org/blogs/passion-for-learning/2012/10/23/charter-school-amendment-debate"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/the-truth-about-charter-schools-funding-and-local-control/", "title": "The Truth About Charter Schools: Funding and Local\u00a0Control"},
{"date": "2012/12/27", "body": "I remember my oldest when he couldn\u2019t talk.\u00a0 He finally started to talk when he was about 3 years old, after a lot of intense therapy done be various SLP\u2019s, including a few working through Georgia State\u2019s \u201cToddler\u2019s Project.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s only been a few years since they stopped tracking him and his progress, but I\u2019m sure he was one of their success stories, combining AAC with various behavioral techniques. Now we have a hard time keeping him quiet.\u00a0 Back in the day, his meltdowns would be seriously long and loud crying jags that might even include him hitting himself.\u00a0 The a couple of years ago, there was a lot of self-negativity as he felt awful about himself.\u00a0 Some of it was actually amusing as he took responsibility for the sinking of the Titanic and the Cretaceous period extinction event.\u00a0 During each stage, we always wondered what was next.\u00a0 He\u2019s almost 14 and has been going through full-blown puberty and teenage angst.\u00a0 It can be a frightful thing for even the parents of the most typical children.\u00a0 For those who have children with autism it is even ore perilous as so many things become magnified with adolescence.\u00a0 The academic and social expectations go through the roof during middle school. Just lately I have noticed a new trend with his meltdowns, which happen most often when we as parents put demands on him or reprimand him for doing something he should not be doing.\u00a0 \u201cOH!\u00a0 You\u2019re just discriminating against me because I have autism!\u201d or \u201cYou hate me because I have autism!\u201d or \u201cYou need to learn more about autism so you don\u2019t judge me!\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s usually saying this while pulling at his own hair. It\u2019s kind of an astounding evolution in thinking and language.\u00a0 But I do have to hand it to him: he is learning how to advocate for himself.\u00a0 Back when he couldn\u2019t talk, I would have never dreamed we would get to this place.\u00a0 Even though the tantrums are not pleasant and even though when he gets to this point he doesn\u2019t listen to anything anyone says, it is still movement forward. We\u2019re fortunate that he knew how to read before he could talk.\u00a0 He always loved books and reading to him was actually something that was soothing and calming to him.\u00a0 So when he was in 1st grade or so, we got him a  book about someone who had a friend named Sam .\u00a0 It kinda helped that he had someone close in the family named Sam.\u00a0 We got it so maybe his own classmates might be able to relate to him better and it wasn\u2019t long before he was reading it himself.\u00a0 We never really tried to hide autism and what it was from him.\u00a0 I do know parents that do that, in the name of trying to protect the kids from labeling themselves.\u00a0 But kids do that anyway, even if they don\u2019t know what exactly the label is.\u00a0 Different.\u00a0 Weird.\u00a0 Dork. Nerd. Outcast. Freak. Geek. Retard. \u00a0 Whatever you want to call it, kids will label themselves and each other.\u00a0 I know parents who quit going on the annual autism walks because the kids were starting to ask questions about autism and why they were walking. The latest book his mother got for him is Ellen Sabin\u2019s  Autism Acceptance Book .\u00a0 He\u2019s had that for a few years but now it seems to be sinking in that he is different.\u00a0 The fact that he is using the label to kind of try to guilt us as parents seems to indicate that he is beginning to differentiate himself.\u00a0 This is not a bad thing, even though it seems like he lashes out with it at the worst times.\u00a0 He\u2019s establishing an identity and autism is part of it.\u00a0 It is part of who he is, and he isn\u2019t trying to dodge this fact of his life.\u00a0 In fact, he is kind of embracing it.\u00a0 He can tell you that talking to yourself can be part of autism.\u00a0 Being sensitive to sound can be part of autism.\u00a0 He is getting to a point where he can articulate what is going on with him and is becoming more okay with it.\u00a0 He\u2019s not there yet.\u00a0 EVERY teenager struggles with doubt and insecurity and finding a place to belong.\u00a0 He\u2019s trying to discover his own autonomy and identity and is gradually getting a handle on things.\u00a0 Gradually. I think the best way to help a child who has the ability to grasp the idea, is to be honest with them in all things.\u00a0 And to accept them for being the individuals that they are.\u00a0 We can all dream of there being some sort of cure, but that dream doesn\u2019t help my son today.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t help him with his schoolwork, his desire to fit in or to develop his own dreams for the future.\u00a0 And by the time there is a cure, would he even want it?\u00a0 He\u2019s incorporating this into who he is and it looks to me like he is staking his claim on his own little piece of the universe.\u00a0 It just happens to include autism.\u00a0 I tried to search for \u201cAutism Power\u201d and all I saw were images, slogans and sights dedicated to \u201crecovery\u201d.\u00a0 Unlike \u201cDeaf Power\u201d which returns all  sorts of sites  dedicated to the belief that deafness is only a disability because hearing people make it that way.\u00a0 There\u2019s a few images referring to Autism as a superpower, but I\u2019m not sure I like that message either. This (among other reasons)\u00a0 is why I love the good folks on the  Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism  blog.\u00a0 Autistics are beginning to take up their own cause for advocacy and are actually offering a lot of hope for people like my son.\u00a0 The dialog is less on the horrible-ness of the disease and how hopeless it is, toward a more positive message of acceptance and that things ARE doable.\u00a0 I see this as one of the major civil rights shifts of our day.\u00a0 And if the numbers (1 in 88 births) are any indication, then we can expect a lot more voices demanding their right to exist.\u00a0 Expect to see \u201cAutistic and Proud\u201d on a shirt or button near you.

{"date": "2012/09/11", "body": "The  Georgia Charter School Amendment  is gearing up to be one of the hottest items on the fall ballot for the state of Georgia, outside of the presidential race.\u00a0 I have wanted to write on this for some time, as I am now intimately connected to the charter school movement.\u00a0 I am currently working for the largest charter school in Georgia, so it might be fair to say that I might be a little biased.\u00a0 At the same time, both my children still attend their local non-charter public schools.\u00a0 And I do have experience teaching in public schools for over 20 years. I am writing mostly in response to the article by Matt Jones,  8 Myths About the Proposed Charter Amendment  which was published in the AthenPatch site .\u00a0 I was originally going to write about myths, but Mr. Jones beat me to it!\u00a0 So, I guess I\u2019ll have to play the role of Mythbuster for a minute.\u00a0 I do admit that my experience is confined to the  Georgia Cyber Academy , but I did not see where he had taught at any charter schools. When I first heard about this amendment, I was worried about the implications of a state agency leaping over a locally controlled one, and thereby robbing the local community of tax dollars without representation or oversight.\u00a0 But a few things have taken place since then which have changed my views.\u00a0 One of which was working for the GCA.\u00a0 Another of which was the horrific meltdown of our local school board and administration into a hopeless morass of infighting, nepotism, sniping, circling the wagons and otherwise failing to exercise leadership. It is useful to read a bit of background about  what happened in Cherokee County .\u00a0 This is what was being mirrored around the state in many counties.\u00a0 In fact several counties joined in the Cherokee County lawsuit. So let me look at this issue through the lense of Mr. Jones, and clarify a few things.\u00a0 His article is worth the read, simply because it provides a handy repository of half-truths and its own share of myths.\u00a0 Many of the myths around charter schools could be avoided if people would simply do a little diligence and  read the DOE\u2019s website  on the topic. Myth: The State Does Not Have the Power to Approve Charter Schools That Were Denied by Local School Boards \n Fact: The Georgia Department of Education currently has the authority to review and approve state charter applications. \n According to State School Superintendent Dr. John Barge, \u201cwith the state charter schools review process already in place, why does Georgia need another state agency that can do the same thing?\u201d It is true that the State DOE does have the power to approve state charter schools: those that are considered  special schools .\u00a0 From the DOE FAQ: \n Who are charter school authorizers in Georgia? \n In Georgia, local boards of education and the State Board of Education\u00a0are charter school authorizers. In order to be granted a charter,  schools must be approved by both their local board of education and the State Board of Education  with the exception of state-chartered special schools which are authorized by the State Board of Education only. We\u2019ll talk a bit about funding in a bit, but basically the approval and funding of charter schools are intimately tied together.\u00a0 Gov. Deal approved  HB 797 , but that law hinges heavily on whether or not the state has the power to approve charter schools over local board objections.\u00a0 And that power can only come from a constitutional amendment, at least according to Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court which argued that the state did not have the constitutional authority to over ride local school boards on this issue.\u00a0 So while it IS true, it is only sort of true.\u00a0 If this amendment fails, the same schools who presented the first case are poised to launch into a second round against charters already established.\u00a0 And Dr. Barge and the DOE have already expressed opposition in word and deed to the state charter schools. Moving on: Myth: Charter Schools Are More Innovative and Flexible \n Fact:  Charters are allowed to \u201ckick out\u201d students for behavior or academic reasons.  And Mr. Jones hasn\u2019t heard of \u201csuspension\u201d \u201cexpulsion\u201d or \u201calternative school?\u201d\u00a0 Our regular public schools find innovative ways of getting rid of students with behavior problems all the time.\u00a0 Not a lot innovative there, true enough.\u00a0 An odd, and little known fact is that in my home county we have exactly one locally approved charter school.\u00a0 That school has  never  made AYP and yet it is allowed to exist.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because it is a nice handy place to send students with behavior and academic problems.\u00a0 This street runs both ways. Fact:  Charters are able to hire uncertified teachers/staff and ignore class size caps. Class size caps?\u00a0 Mr. Jones again ignores facts and the sad state of education in Georgia.\u00a0 There are NO class size caps in the state of Georgia!\u00a0 Our beloved legislature lifted all that over a year ago.\u00a0 So whining about Charters doing it seems very ill-sighted indeed.\u00a0 As far as uncertified teachers, this is another blatant falsehood and I have no idea where it came from.\u00a0 We have this thing call  No Child Left Behind , with the flagship provision of being  HIGHLY QUALIFIED!\u00a0\u00a0 Charter schools are still public schools and can not opt out of Federal laws and regulations, as per our friendly and helpful GA DOE site: Charter schools and systems are subject to all provisions outlined in O.C.G.A. 20-2-2065(b). In particular, charter schools may not waive state laws or State Board of Education rules pertaining to health and safety, funding formulas, or accountability provisions. In addition, charter schools may not waive any aspect of federal law. This includes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (also known as No Child Left Behind), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and all applicable civil rights legislation. Due diligence, Mr. Jones. Myth: State Charter Schools Will Not Take Funds Away from Traditional Public Schools \n Fact: If the proposed charter amendment passes, charter schools authorized by the Commission will be 100% funded by the state. Actually there is some truth in your fact because charter schools, will in fact, take money away from the traditional public schools.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to deny it at all.\u00a0 This is because some of the money is bound to follow the student, as parents vote with their feet.\u00a0 When students leave the traditional school, much of that money departs with them, which is a good incentive for traditional schools to try to hold on to their students and keep as few other options open as possible.\u00a0 But the cut is much deeper than the money, albeit it is a very painful cut to systems already strapped.\u00a0 The worst part is that the parents who take the initiative to start a charter or move their children into a charter are the ones most school really like.\u00a0 The involved parents who care about their children\u2019s education and the ones willing to make certain sacrifices in order to make that happen such as providing transportation and packing a lunch. Fact:  The state has a constitutional obligation to fully fund and provide for an adequate public education for every student in Georgia. 4 \n Currently, the state is not meeting its constitutional responsibility. Most Georgians understand that budget cuts were necessary due to the economic downturn, but the passage of the charter amendment would bind the state to additional funding obligations. \u00a0 This assumes that Georgia was meeting its responsibility  before  the economic downturn, and that responsibility is limited to providing funds.\u00a0 By almost any metric. calling Georgia\u2019s education system as \u201cadequate\u201d is generous at best.\u00a0 Charters exist and have the support that they do because parents crave an option.\u00a0 Americans like choices, especially if the only one that exists isn\u2019t that good. Myth: Charter Schools Are Public Schools \n Fact:  There are many elements of charter schools that make them appear more private than public. Again, Mr. Jones might wish to do some research into \u201cTheme Schools\u201d and \u201cMagnet Schools.\u201d\u00a0 In my county, we have a \u201cParent involvment\u201d theme school which my youngest attends.\u00a0 They have criteria for admission that would prevent my oldest son who has high functioning autism from being admitted.\u00a0 They also make parents sign a contract, pledging to do so\u00a0 many hours of service.\u00a0 They don\u2019t provide transportation but DO provide the  yummy lunches  proscribed by our beloved USDA.\u00a0 This school has the approval and support of the local board of education, but it has more elements that make it look private than and charter school would be allowed to do.\u00a0 Why is it allowed here?\u00a0 The same reason it allowed the charter school mentioned above, only on the other end of the spectrum.\u00a0 At least this way, they keep the kids and their funding.\u00a0 Local boards do this in response to parent demands and that is a GOOD thing! Fact: The charter movement has close ties with the pro-school choice movement.\u00a0  Heaven forbid parents might actually CHOOSE.\u00a0 I hear people complain about the lack of parental responsibility with their kids and yet many of these are the same people who want to block the school house doors and keep kids trapped.\u00a0 Choosing a school or how to educate their children is the most responsible and involved thing a parent can do, and yet systems do all they can to block that avenue of responsibility.\u00a0 The Anti-School choice movement has close ties with socialism and Communism, but I\u2019m not going to make that an issue in this debate. Myth: Charters Serve All Students \n Fact:  Many charter schools use lotteries to avoid qualifying for AYP testing, making it difficult to compare their success to public schools.\u00a0  The lotteries are simply a tool used to insure the distribution of students matches the district demographics within the smaller size of the charter school.\u00a0 This is like saying \u201cMany Georgians use cars in order to avoid buying new shoes.\u201d\u00a0 Small sample sizes do make comparisons difficult, but its erroneous to accuse them of deliberately keeping their sizes small just for AYP, especially when you\u2019re going to accuse these same players of ties to big business designed to maximize their numbers. Fact: Overall, data suggests that students who are the most challenging to teach and require the most resources are not being served by charters in the state. I\u2019m one of a large number of special educators currently serving students with disabilities in the largest charter school in the state.\u00a0 And I happen to be certified and highly qualified.\u00a0 Whatever data you have can suggest what it wishes, but the facts are much different. Myth: Charters Seek to Put the Interests of Families and Students First \n Fact:  Proponents of the proposed charter amendment wave the banner of families and children, while advocating the interests of business interests over students\u2019 interests. You mean like those teachers on strike in Chicago?\u00a0 Schools of any size are businesses with stakeholders that include families and students and all the other business entities that serve them.\u00a0 The people making the textbooks in your school are businesses and they have lobbyists and marketers targeting people in your district.\u00a0 They are also political.\u00a0 However, unlike the traditional schools, charters DO have to be able to attract students/parents and retain them over time.\u00a0 Parent satisfaction is critical to their existence!\u00a0 Or at least higher satisfaction than the neighborhood school. Fact:   For these groups and individuals, support of the proposed charter amendment equates to making a business investment, instead of investing in all of our schools and all of our children. The reason there is money to be made is the high dissatisfaction among families with their neighborhood schools.\u00a0 But it\u2019s hard to know a person\u2019s real motives.\u00a0 What I do know is that traditional schools have struggled with the disruption caused by technology and the social changes of the last decade.\u00a0 They are trying to give their children every advantage they can. Myth: Charter Schools Increase Student Achievement \n Fact: Multiple Studies and Reports Call Into Question the Effectiveness of Charter School This fact is actually not too much of a myth, at least for our school. We do track and strive to achieve success but our results are not always at the state level.\u00a0 But test scores only provide part of the equation.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have to give a narrative composite sketch of our students next time.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be surprised at how it looks. Fact: Charter school proponents regularly cherry pick data and make broad comparisons. Sorta like Mr. Jones\u2019 critique of the pro-school choice movement??\u00a0 Actually, making a few broad comparisons is better than just making stuff up. \u00a0 Myth: Charters Will Expand Choice and Create Competition\u00a0  \n Fact:  Passage of the charter amendment does not guarantee that charters would be added to areas that have chronically underperforming schools.\u00a0  But the failure of the amendment will almost certainly prevent them from moving in.\u00a0 It is probable that many that already exist will die off from lack of funding or be sued out of existence from the opponents. Fact: True competition can only exist if the same system of rules and regulations are in place for all participating parties. Again, this street runs both ways.\u00a0 Fact is, my charter school is undergoing a lot more scrutiny on compliance issues compared to the traditional schools because the state DOE does NOT like us and would rather we did not exist.\u00a0 Dr. Barge has already stated his position which is that no charter school should exist while other schools don\u2019t have enough money.\u00a0 And since NO regular school district EVER has enough money then we should not exist. Charter schools employ many of your former colleagues who were otherwise unemployed or laid off.\u00a0 Charter schools also educate students that traditional schools have been either unwilling or unable to serve.\u00a0 And they do so at a much smaller cost to the tax payer much of the time. Having choices is a very American thing.\u00a0 Having choices in education is a humane and just thing, especially if we can offer free and public choices.\u00a0 People will vote with their feet.\u00a0 Since most charters have waiting lists and most traditional public schools have declining enrollments, it might be wise to look around and recognize that times are changing.\u00a0 The present structure has existed for at least the last 40 years and Georgia has never been in the top 10 in education but consistently been in the bottom 10.\u00a0 Mr. Jones makes an appeal to fix the system in place, but that system has consistently refused to allow itself to be fixed and it is way past adolescence.\u00a0 We need real change as it is too important to put off any longer. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Georgia_Charter_Schools_Amendment_%282012%29", "http://athens.patch.com/articles/8-myths-about-the-proposed-charter-amendment", "http://gca.k12start.com/", "http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/14505659/article-State-BOE-OKs-Cherokee-charter-school--after-local-delegation-voted-it-down", "http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/External-Affairs-and-Policy/Charter-Schools/Pages/General-Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx", "http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20112012/HB/797", "http://dacula.patch.com/articles/pink-slime-in-school-lunches-sparks-concern"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/myths-about-charter-schools/", "title": "Myths About Charter\u00a0Schools"},
{"date": "2012/10/30", "body": "\u00a0 \n It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don\u2019t lose faith. I\u2019m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You\u2019ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. \n Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, keep looking. Don\u2019t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\u2019ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don\u2019t settle. \n \u00a0 Steve Jobs in a  2005 commencement address  to Stanford students \u00a0 One of the lost stories in the controversy around charter schools is the stories of teachers. We hear about parents and students who end up doing battle against some sort of administrative body trying to start a charter school or trying to get into one. Or there is the corporation trying to start a school for profit. Or a local district trying to stop them. \u00a0 In the middle we have teachers. And I\u2019m ashamed to say we are often at odds with one another on this subject. Many of my fellow teachers don\u2019t hate me for what I do so much as where I do it. Perhaps they think I have sold my soul to the corporate devil. I do not fully understand why I and my school are disliked so much, but we are. Public school teachers seem to generally oppose charter schools because we are seen as robbing the public treasury of money that should rightly go to them. \u00a0 Full public disclosure: I currently teach in the largest charter school in the state of Georgia which is affiliated with the largest virtual public charter school in the country. I DO have skin in the game when it comes to how charter schools fare in the upcoming election. \u00a0 Prior to coming to this school, I have taught in a variety of settings, traditional and not so traditional. I taught at small public schools and large ones. I taught in a residential private boarding school and then later at a residential hospital. I also taught in the state psychoed network. But over half my career of nearly 20 years has been in a traditional brick and mortar setting. Most of this blog was written while in that setting, albeit teaching mostly nontraditional students. \u00a0 But I did get to a point where I was no longer willing to settle and wanted something different. So I resigned out with the idea of reapplying and effecting a transfer that I was unable to get any other way. I asked for several years and the answer was always the same: \u201cWe\u2019ll let you transfer when we can find someone to replace you.\u201d But they never looked for anyone to replace me! \u00a0 The result was that I was out, very much like Steve Jobs when he got fired from Apple. I spent the next 2 years trying to get back into a field where I had formerly occupied the top of my game. I had a 100% pass rate on my GAAs every year I ever did them. I proved myself over and over in long-term substitute positions and had administrators who were interested in me. But the board office was not. I was branded for trying to take control of my own destiny. \u00a0 I was not proud of going on food stamps, and was plagued by self-doubt. I still loved teaching but no longer felt like this business had any use for me. Perhaps it was time to go back to the farm in Iowa and forget about teaching. \u00a0 But I held out, hoping that the speech Steve Jobs gave might one day be something I could also say. \u00a0 Yes, life hit me with a brick. But I can honestly say that through the loss, I managed to find life again. I\u2019m passionate about reaching out to kids again. I\u2019m passionate about helping the parents of kids again. Actually, it was always my passion, but I just needed to rediscover it. And the virtual academy has helped me do that. I love what I am doing, and think of it as great work. I have never been a traditional teacher of traditional students. I am an oddball, an out-lier, a nerd, a geek and a misfit in so many ways. But the kids I reach out to are also feeling those feelings and need a hand that will not judge or bully them. They need to relate to someone who is like them and for a lot of them that someone is me. \u00a0 The traditional brick and mortar setting works for many \u2018traditional typical kids.\u2019 But it is very unyielding and even cruel to those who do not fit the traditional or typical mold. This is equally true of teachers. Those of us who are nontraditional often come up against stiff opposition from traditionalists. It has always been the case throughout educational history that the industry has to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into more modern methods and technology. Much of the opposition to me being rehired in my county was because of the fact that I had a blog. THIS blog. They hated the fact that a teacher could write and publish their own material free of their ability to control or censor it. \u00a0 Any administrator or school board member can have their own blog if they want. But instead of joining the conversation, they want to shut down everyone, so that no one has a voice. And I am not a good fit for that sort of atmosphere. And I am not the only teacher who is not a good fit for stiff and inflexible working conditions. \u00a0 Schools like my school become a haven for teachers like me who are otherwise nerdy misfits who will never coach a football, basketball or soccer team. I didn\u2019t fully realize just how well fitted I was for this job until my mom asked me questions like \u201cDon\u2019t you get tired of being on the computer all day?\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t you start to feel closed in and get a little stir crazy?\u201d No and no. I don\u2019t mind it because I am, in fact, reaching out continuously and touching students and families where they live, no matter where in the state they reside. I had never heard of Grovetown, Georgia until I talked to a student and parent that lived there. \u00a0 I am where I am meant to be, doing what I was meant to do. I\u2019m helping students and their families get the best education that I possibly can give them. I am making a difference. I am passionate about what I do. \u00a0 I\u2019m not kicking dirt on my fellow teachers in traditional settings who are passionate about what THEY do. So I find it hard to understand why the opposite might be true. My former traditional school system turned their back on me for the sake of petty politics, and yet opponents of the Charter School Amendment are trying to scare people into voting against it with the claim that a charter school commission would be a purely political body. For 11 years such a commission approved charter schools in the state of Georgia including the one I work for now. It was not until a group of school districts, among them Gwinnett County, Dekalb County and Atlanta Public Schools filed their lawsuit, costing their districts in excess of $300, 000  did the State court overturn the constitutionality of the commission in a 4-3 decision . These 3 districts are the epitome of political hubris and nepotism that stifles the educational creativity and achievement that we need to get Georgia\u2019s educational system out of the national gutter. But they claim the the commission is too political. \u00a0 I\u2019ve seen and personally experienced the hurt and damage inflicted by the nepotism of the local community school district. My fellow teachers know it exists and live in fear of it. Everyone knew what was happening but no one could do anything about it. They couldn\u2019t even talk about it because some unelected person sitting in the board office had friends and relatives who were waiting to take their jobs irregardless of qualifications or merit. \u00a0 In a charter school, parental and student satisfaction matter. They do not HAVE to be there. The local control exercised by the parents in their own homes with their own families can be exercised at any time. They do not have to appeal to a board member who gets elected once every 4 years to exercise the right to vote with their feet. I feel some obligation to honor those parents who choose to stick with me for the year and do the best that I can for them. I think all of my fellow teachers are committed to the kids they teach in the same way. We are born into it, and feel joy in doing what we feel is an important work. \u00a0 All of the teachers I teach with are just as committed as our traditional counterparts. We are all certified and highly qualified, many with advanced degrees. We like what we do. We chose to be here. If you are a teacher, you don\u2019t have to settle. There are other places and options where you can discover and exercise your passion for teaching. I highly recommend that you consider keeping as many of those options open as you can for yourselves as well as for other teachers like me.

{"date": "2015/02/26", "body": "I hope my co-teacher doesn\u2019t see this.\u00a0 But in case she does, I\u2019ll say here what I\u2019ve already told her and the other pre-calc teacher with whom I share (virtual) classroom space: They do a superb job at teaching students and accommodating my lack of mathematical prowess.\u00a0 They are amazing teachers, and the most wonderful co-teachers anyone could ask for.\u00a0 They are top notch people who love students and love what they teach.\u00a0 Which is to say, they love math. I do not love math.\u00a0 But I do give the math teachers that I have co-taught with high marks for moving me into a space where I don\u2019t hate it.\u00a0 Much.\u00a0 This is high praise, considering where I started several years ago.\u00a0 I have almost always hated math.\u00a0 And most of my caseload students hate math as well as most of my fellow special education teachers.\u00a0 Fleeing a math-intense curriculum is one reason many of us became special educators.\u00a0 We loved teaching, and loved kids and some of us even loved science.\u00a0 But we hated math. I\u2019m currently lobbying to create and sponsor a \u201cI Hate Math\u201d club for our school.\u00a0 The idea is to have a club that is like a support group akin to those support groups for people having to go through chemotherapy.\u00a0 We don\u2019t like it, but we have to do it.\u00a0 We have to endure, and we have to survive.\u00a0 And we can do it much better if we do it together rather than fall apart.\u00a0 We can become math survivors. I\u2019m pretty well qualified for such an endeavor because not only do I have a lot of anxiety, fear, loathing and anger toward the subject, I\u2019m also somewhat compelled to be around it more than I would like.\u00a0 Which is to say, almost all the time.\u00a0 This describes a lot of the students I encounter in our schools and in my own family.\u00a0 Outside of math teachers, engineers and a few other oddballs, I\u2019m very hard pressed to to find people who really and truly like mathematics.\u00a0 There are a few of us who like logical thinking and may enjoy an occasional mathematical puzzle ( Sudoku  anyone?) but when we start talking about calculating slope, synthetic division, imaginary numbers, cosines and radians we start entering that dark distasteful zone that begins putting people off.\u00a0 It can even have many of the same symptoms as anxiety due to chemotherapy.\u00a0 I\u2019ve talked to students who became physically ill every day before entering their math classes.\u00a0  Math phobia  is a real thing to many, many students. I like how a math educator,  Dan Meyer,  introduced his  Ted Talk  : \u201cI sell a product to a market that doesn\u2019t want it but is forced by law to buy it.\u201d Almost every school teacher could identify to this on some level, but math teachers are especially vulnerable to being abused by students who hate their subject.\u00a0 I might have abused a math teacher or two in my own way back in the day. And right now, wherever they are, they are having a wry smile at my expense.\u00a0 I would never have predicted that I would be near a math classroom at any time after graduation and now I get to endure much of what my old math teachers did. But for all my discomfort with the subject during my own middle and high school years, it is no where near what today\u2019s students are being subjected to. The above is an image of the math curriculum for a school in another state, but closely matches what is in place in the state of Georgia and several other states.\u00a0 By the time a student is in 11th or 12th grade, they are expected to be taking either pre-calculus or calculus.\u00a0 For those of you with children in school, let that settle for a minute.\u00a0 There is no alternate plan here.\u00a0 This IS the state curriculum. Recently, the state of Georgia did announce a change in its sequence that does offer a less daunting option and you can  see the pdf here .\u00a0 I will applaud a move in the right direction, especially for our students with disabilities.\u00a0 However, Algebra II is still required in order to get a high school diploma in the state of Georgia.  And where is consumer math? While researching for this post, I looked for articles and discourse on this topic and found a dearth of articles addressing the question of whether or not we should be requiring every high school student to master Algebra II (let alone pre-calculus) in order to get a high school diploma.\u00a0 The best one that I could find was a report issued by the  National Center on Education and the Economy  (NCEE) that issued a  report looking at the requirements for admission into community colleges  back in 2013.\u00a0 They had this to say about the high school math curriculum currently being pushed by most states: \u201cMastery of Algebra II is widely thought to be a prerequisite for success in college and careers. Our research shows that that is not so\u2026 Based on our data, one cannot make the case that high school graduates must be proficient in Algebra II to be ready for college and careers. The high school mathematics curriculum is now centered on the teaching of a sequence of courses leading to calculus that includes Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-Calculus and Calculus. However, fewer than five percent of American workers and an even smaller percentage of community college students will ever need to master the courses in this sequence in their college or in the workplace\u2026 they should not be required courses in our high schools. To require these courses in high school is to deny to many students the opportunity to graduate high school because they have not mastered a sequence of mathematics courses they will never need. In the face of these findings, the policy of requiring a passing score on an Algebra II exam for high school graduation simply cannot be justified.\u201d The odd thing about this report is that it is written in support of the Common core Curriculum which puts me in a very odd place.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a fan of the Common Core, largely for reasons that you can  watch in this documentary on the subject . I have experience with this on 3 different levels: as a person who is mathematically challenged, as a parent and as a teacher of students with disabilities. As a person who was difficult to motivate during his middle school years, especially in the area of mathematics, I am very thankful I grew up when I did.\u00a0 Namely that I was not required to master Algebra II in order to graduate high school or even college.\u00a0 If that were the case, I would not have a college degree, let alone a Master\u2019s degree, and it might be doubtful I would have gotten through high school.\u00a0 I would have done what I see more and more of the students that I teach do: I would have quit.\u00a0 I have no doubt in my mind that I would have taken this option.\u00a0 I started out well enough, getting an \u2018A\u2019 in my first quarter of Algebra I.\u00a0 Next Quarter I got a B, and then I got a \u2018C\u2019 and then I got a \u2018D\u2019.\u00a0 In Geometry I started with a \u2018B\u2019 my first quarter, then a \u2018C\u2019 and then\u2026well I finished the second semester with an \u2018F\u2019.\u00a0 A lot of this was due to motivation, but in those days there was an option to make up that math credit by taking business math, which I did.\u00a0 It was a class that was infinitely more fun and practical where I learned about amortization and interest rates and where I was the one to figure out how to program the school\u2019s new Apple I computer to do my homework.\u00a0 I loved computers back then and taught the thing how to calculate my interest homework.\u00a0 Visicalc hadn\u2019t been invented yet, or at least no one I knew had heard of it. Now I have a son of my own who, unfortunately, has inherited his father\u2019s rich loathing of math.\u00a0 But he has a more determined mother than I did, and he\u2019s probably going to finish with an \u2018A\u2019.\u00a0 However that \u2018A\u2019 in Algebra I is probably taking 10 years off of my wife\u2019s life in the form of all the frustration and the constant strife and battling.\u00a0 He still has 3 more years to go and at this rate, I might need to put an extra life insurance policy on my wife.\u00a0 At the very least, I\u2019m going to be bound to staying in a job with good health insurance. Like so many of my students, my son has modest goals for his future.\u00a0 If he were 10 years younger, he would not even be on track for a regular education diploma much less doing and succeeding in algebra I.\u00a0 In this way, inclusion has been a good thing for many students and does challenge and offer them a good education.\u00a0 However the focus on college readiness is going to doom a lot of the students who have less determined or educated parents.\u00a0 He could learn and be very good at a trade and really that\u2019s all he wants to do.\u00a0 He wants a good job that allows him to afford his appetite for all things having to do with model railroading.\u00a0 However, there are very few vocational programs in high schools anymore.\u00a0 The arts have also been marginalized because of the pressure generated by the testing culture. The bottom line for many of our students is that the bar for a high school diploma has been raised to such an extent, especially with the math curriculum, that too many of them are not going to make it.\u00a0 They will get discouraged and quit all because of a barrier that has been put in place  needlessly .\u00a0 According to the NCEE study, less than 5% of all students will require much more than\u00a0 Algebra I in order to function well in their jobs and careers. I\u2019m currently engaged in a bit of a battle, trying to save as many of my students as possible, and enable them to reach that finish line.\u00a0 They want to be mechanics, welders, seamstresses, healthcare workers, hair dressers, farmers and truck drivers.\u00a0 These are all skilled positions and careers where they will need some additional post-secondary training.\u00a0 But in order to get that they are faced with a stark and scary road that leads through Algebra II and possibly pre-calculus.\u00a0 They struggle massively just to make it through coordinate algebra, which is even harder than the algebra that I had in 9th grade.\u00a0 The pass rates on the End Of Course tests in math in the state of Georgia are absolutely dismal,  with 60-70% of all students taking the exam failing it .\u00a0 For students with disabilities, the failure rate is closer to 90%.\u00a0 There is a provision for students with disabilities in Georgia to follow an  alternate curriculum  that can rescue them from the Algebra II trap.\u00a0 However, there seems to be some question among some districts as to how to apply this, and some are very slow in applying it.\u00a0 In the meantime, the river of students continues to flow through the system and many of them are opting out by dropping out.\u00a0 Applying this rule fairly early on when it is obvious to the parents, the student, the teacher and the IEP team that this student will quit or fail school before succeeding in Algebra II can give them an early lifeline in helping to persevere through the rest of the courses.\u00a0 Knowing that there is an end point that doesn\u2019t have to end in a needless mathematical death march can help keep the doors open for many of our students.

{"date": "2011/11/06", "body": "I thought this video was really interesting, not only in what the talk is about but also the way it was presented: I\u2019ve always been fascinated by how our brains function, and how it enables us to adapt. The drawings add a lot of context but also a lot of humor that make this worth watching more than once because there is so much that will be missed with one viewing\u2026at least for me who favors the narrow focus of things while often missing the broader contexts or things. In a sense the lack of connections between the two hemispheres has left us slightly learning disabled, I think, hence my categorizing this under that heading as well as perhaps having consequences in the the world of interventions and therapy.

{"date": "2011/10/09", "body": "Someone asked me about it and so I thought I would share.\u00a0 I have no idea how long it will remain up, since I\u2019m not under contract there any more.\u00a0 But it IS a resource that can still be used by those in the distract or anyone else.\u00a0 But I have to warn you that this is not a very flashy or polished site.\u00a0 It was designed to be a work-in-progress and it STILL is! I\u2019ve been involved in the internet and bulletin boards and usenet for over 2 decades.\u00a0 I was SO happy when it looked like our district has something where teachers could build and collaborate together.\u00a0 That tool was  Sharepoint .\u00a0 Each school had its own site and each department eventually had its own site within the school\u2019s site.\u00a0 I was excited about the ability to have discussions and share things with colleagues within the school, as well as possibly with teachers from other schools in the discussion forums.\u00a0 But as it turns out, the discussion forums were the least-used areas of all.\u00a0 No one posted anything except me.\u00a0 To my knowledge, Sharepoint is still not a place where teachers share thoughts and idea, as they seem to still prefer and rely upon email. So I began using it to store documents and anytime someone needed a form I gave them the url for sharepoint.\u00a0 It was the perfect place to store forms or anything else that needed to be shared with everyone, but again, email is still the primary vehicle that is used for this.\u00a0 Today, the school is beginning to use it as a repository for lesson plans, thanks to a technologically savvy assistant principal who makes the teachers put their plans there. After about 5 years of being \u201cthe Sharepoint guy\u201d, the one who was always trying to get teachers to use this tool provided by the district, I finally managed to make it the tool of choice for our special education department.\u00a0 The killer app was not the discussion forums or even the file sharing.\u00a0 It was the calendar.\u00a0 Anyone could go in and edit that calendar, so that is how we began collaborating on an IEP schedule.\u00a0 Each teacher could input their name, time and place and then another teacher who needed a meeting for that day could look at the calendar and schedule around what was already there.\u00a0 As cancellations happened, it became easy to change and adapt the schedule.\u00a0 Withing the department, it became a very important tool and I feel pretty good about helping them take advantage of it. There are many better and more advanced Moodle sites than mine.\u00a0 Anyone with any degree of creativity could make one more appealing, but mine was designed to do several tasks in one place, which is what makes this such a powerful tool.\u00a0 In our district it is called eLearn, but you can clearly see the Moodle icon when you open up a tab to  visit my site .\u00a0 I also have other courses, but this is my main page and one that I still occasionally work and fiddle with. I originally was going to make this a real course that new SID/PID teachers could take to orient themselves with the field.\u00a0 Most of the course elements remain from when I took a staff development class on making the site.\u00a0 I quickly realized that this was a much more robust platform than Sharepoint was for sharing and collaborating.\u00a0 However the learning curve here was much steeper, so I still tried to get others into Sharepoint while I worked on my owm eLearn. In the center is all the course materals.\u00a0 Sorry if sone of the Teachertube links are broken but they are all still on  my channel .\u00a0 And the server does house a few videos not shown anywhere else. On the right side, there is a calendar that is linked to my Google calendar.\u00a0\u00a0 The main use of this was to share with my paras, and anyone else who needed to know, my schedule for the coming week as well as the scedule for any outings that we had coming up. Again, the calendar is what drove most people to my site as it also had the school holidays and other events built into it. Below that is just a few links that I would use most frequently as well as my mug shot.\u00a0 HTML blocks are extremely versatile for customizing content even if you don\u2019t know html natively\u2026which would be me.\u00a0 I also have a box for behavior terms which shows a random word out of a list of maybe 10.\u00a0 But some teachers have \u201cVideo of the day\u201d or \u201cWord of the day\u201d included on theirs.\u00a0 On the left side I have an html block with resources that I, or other teachers, frequently use.\u00a0 I just updated this last week as the paras wanted a way to get to resources for their brand new active board.\u00a0 Since my site is open to anyone, they could go their regardless of whoever logged into the computer it was connected to.\u00a0 Thus is was a way to preserve bookmarks. Moodle is an amazing tool for teachers, students and parents.\u00a0 My wife and I have often consulted the sites of our children\u2019s teachers in order to see if there was homework, or if they forgot the worksheet atschool we could print it from the site.\u00a0 But alas, most teachers still do not have their own site or do not update and use it.\u00a0 At some point, it would be nice if they could all collaborate and pool their mental energy to create a grade and subject specific site.\u00a0 But alas, despite a lot of lip service to the concept of \u201clearning communities\u201d, true collaboration becomes an afterthought if it appears on the radar screen at all.

{"date": "2011/12/15", "body": "I said last time that I would give some ideas on how to prevent or avoid the pitfalls that I listed and detailed in my previous post. It\u2019s one thing to criticize, but another to propose concrete steps to right the wrongs and prevent things from getting so bad  as they did in Fulton County . So I\u2019ll take it point-by-point: \n Open up the classroom, at least to the parents but also to others: Transparency.  Make the place visible! This addresses the problems of isolation and powerlessness. The tendency to isolate this population is exactly the opposite of what should be done. Being visible will minimize the risks of abuse because everyone will see. It also helps educate everyone else about this population. And if there are problems, it will be more difficult to sweep them under the rug. The privacy concerns for these students are secondary to the safety concerns and that needs to be looked at. The privacy and confidentiality provisions of the law have been used to keep things out of the light that would have prevented abuse had they been known in the Fulton County case. Parents did not know their children had been abused until almost 2 years after the final report was released! Keeping secrets never benefits the students. \n Get them out of the single room and enforce LRE.  Least Restrictive Environment is built into the law, but with the most severe group, it is the least enforced. Community-based outings should count toward LRE as they are in the community with nondisabled community members. Also more than one teacher should be involved with these students in a given day. That means they need to move around within the building and spend some part of their day, even a short time, with nondisabled peers. This is a VERY inconvenient thing, but it is part of the law and it is part of the solution that can keep classrooms for the students with the most complicated disabilities from becoming incubators of abuse and neglect. \n Hire people that are the most qualified and experienced possible.   And some schools are not doing that because they need a coach or because there is a relative of someone who needs a job, or because there is a teacher they know of who needs a job but can\u2019t teach in another area. For whatever reason, some administrators are NOT hiring the most qualified and experienced people. This alone might have saved years of abuse,  if the recommendation that the existing teacher not have her contract be renewed would have been followed.  But that did not happen in the Fulton Middle School. And it does not happen in many other counties. The nepotism and corruption will eventually find your district and be costly. And this goes also for the paras and assistants. The most needy students need the most competent people. But they tend to be staffed in the reverse fashion. \n Make sure that those who need the most training have some good models.   One of the most beneficial things I ever did my first year was visit the classroom of someone who was experienced and qualified. That totally helped change and shape the way I would teach this population. So even if you can\u2019t find someone who is experienced, the chances are there is SOMEONE in the district who is. In my case, that first year it was a middle school teacher. In later years, I was allowed to travel and visit the classrooms of new teachers to help model and demonstrate things to do with them. And sometimes they came and visited me. One of the biggest breakdowns I had was when I asked to visit any other school that had a program the size and scope of the one I had. Sometimes just seeing is believing and if I could have connected with other teachers who were coping with similar challenges I think it would have made life more bearable. \n Keep the class size manageable.   Doubling the size literally triples the problems in this sort of classroom. The logistcs of having enough floor space for wheelchairs, adaptive positioning equipment and just space for the students to be able to move becomes a serious issue. We ended up stacking a lot of the chairs outside when we had the students positioned in other devices, which also had the benefit of letting the chairs air out. Class size is always an issue for all classrooms, but for students with multiple needs, there is always a safety concern as there needs to be enough people t move students efficiently and safely. \n Connect with others who are in the same business.  This is something that does not have to be very costly at all, but can pay dividends in professional growth. In a lot of ways, this blog has functioned that way for me. A lot of special education teachers have found their way here, and have gotten some degree of affirmation knowing they were not alone in their struggles and feelings. Other teachers take this somewhat for granted as there is almost always another math, science or English teacher around with whom to swap ideas and commiserate. It is almost never true for those who teach students with multiple needs that there is someone down the hall to talk to. BUT even having someone across the county can be a source of strength and comfort. Let these folks get together on professional learning days, where they can tackle issues and swap ideas. \n Let the teacher who is going to supervise and train them help hire new parapros.   Imagine if the superintendent did the hiring of everyone from the central office who was going to be in the building. The principal or a committee designated does this for a very important reason, as they know their own culture and their own needs. The same should be true of the classroom serving students with severe disabilities. I actually had the privilege of doing this for a couple of years when we had an administrator who admitted he was less familiar with my classroom and allowed me to sit on on the interviews. I was able to explain what we we did and what the requirements of the job were upfront. It saved a ton of grief down the line when they knew ahead of time that diapers and feeding tubes were involved. As a side benefit, this can also help groom teachers for leadership, helps the administrator know what the teacher needs and expects as well as helps the administrator become more familiar with what is happening in that classroom. \n Keep the lines of communication open.  And this is between everyone, including the families and the administration. This particular population requires more collaboration and communication than any other teaching I have seen or done. NOT having open lines causes more problems when things eventually come to light. I am basically reiterating the call for transparency in point #1. I always wrte something to each parent, each day, about their son or daughter. Most parents were fairly decent about keeping up with my notes and responding to any questions that I had. I tried to make sure that parents especially had as much access to my classroom and had as much awareness as to what was going on as possible. The most uncomfortable position in the world is when a body feels like they have to hide something. Whenever we had staffing cuts and reductions mid year, I always struggled on how to inform parents. \n Require high standards in regards to student welfare as well as professional and personal integrity and ethics.  It\u2019s hard to put a price on such a thing, but this is probably THE biggest thing that could prevent abuse and neglect. It means being conscientious, striving for excellence in all things. \u201cExcellence\u201d with this population is measured differently than in most, as they don\u2019t produce test results. But steady improvement is always something to strive for, as well as fighting against stagnation and regression. This was something that I was never willing to compromise on, even though it became harder and more challenging at times. Mediocrity was simply not acceptable to me. One does need to pick their battles, but in all things I wanted to get the best from my students and then stretch them even more. And I did it. In many ways this has driven my desire to work with a slightly younger population in order to see if I might be able to coax a bit more earlier on. Perhaps we can make that next transition easier for them. But a large part of this involves  personal  accountability, and doing the right thing even when no one else is looking. It\u2019s one reason why I don\u2019t mind anyone else looking in. I always knew we were doing right by the kids. \n Everyone needs to be an advocate.  It sure would be nice if there were not a need for advocates. But unfortunately there does seem to be a need as I see story after story of teachers abusing students, or of students not getting needed services. I honestly believe that a society will be judged mostly on how it treats its most vulnerable population. It has been my privilege to have been on the front lines of that effort and I would hope that I am on the same side as the family in regards to wanting what is best for that student. I understand the struggles of families who are doing the best they can with the limited resources that they have. I\u2019ve been there and I still am. I am also aware of the realities of the modern school climate with the emphasis on test scores and budgetary constraints. We need to make sure we get the biggest bang for every dollar spent. This is one population where the \u201cfree market\u201d currently has no model of service. We ARE the front line in the battle for justice and equality. The arena of disability advocacy is the last and greatest civil rights cause that we face in the U.S. The current economic climate is going to sorely test our society\u2019s moral and ethical resolve to do what is right for those least able to advocate for themselves. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/parents-sue-saying-teacher-abused-her-students/nFXzr/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2011/12/15/countering-a-culture-of-abuse/", "title": "Countering a Culture of\u00a0Abuse"},
{"date": "2011/11/08", "body": "\u201cThe Fulton County School System will not tolerate the mistreatment of any children and has strict policies in place to prevent such actions. We have hundreds of caring, devoted individuals who work every day with our students with disabilities.\u201d This is a statement made by a spokeswoman for Fulton Couny schools in  a case where the system is being charged with neglect and abuse .\u00a0 To be sure I have no doubt that a part of this statement is mostly true.\u00a0 There  are  some caring and devoted individuals working with students with disabilities.\u00a0 But the first part? Let\u2019s just say that Fulton County is not alone in having a culture where those who have the most severe disabilities are systematically marginalized, neglected and outright abused.\u00a0 It is not an isolated case.\u00a0 It is a  systemic  problem where several heroic and caring individuals manage to overcome a bias against these students and those they care for that is inherent in our present system.\u00a0 To be sure, I think this is an extreme case that was allowed to go on well past what it should have.\u00a0  Reports show that there were loads and loads of reports, interviews and statements  by faculty and staff that this was going on.\u00a0 You see stacks of CDs with videos with these interviews on them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think anyone seeing this video can be anything other than outraged.\u00a0 It truly makes my blood boil which is why I am so moved to blog about it.\u00a0 And I am so close to the business as a parent and as former teacher of this population, it does touch a raw nerve. So how could something like this happen?\u00a0 There are  SO  many reasons\u2026let me see if I can count them\u2026 1. The students are nonverbal and powerless. \u00a0 These students represent the most vulnerable segment in the entire school population.\u00a0 They are vulnerable to anything and everything because they can not tell what happened when they get home from school.\u00a0 Many of them can barely move.\u00a0 They have severe and multiple needs including limited language and limited mobility.\u00a0 They can not escape and can not fight back.\u00a0 Actually, some of them can and try to escape and fight back in their own way, but they are largely at the mercy of who ever is caring for them. 2. These students (and the staff that care for them) are the most isolated group in the school. \u00a0 If you want to create an environment for abuse and neglect, the recipe is fairly simple: Take a bunch of people, put them in a room together all day and then put some stress on them.\u00a0 I\u2019ll talk a bit about the stresses in a moment, but the isolation is one of the things that makes this so bad in so many ways.\u00a0 Despite the provisions in the law for \u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d the students with the most severe disabilities continue to spend their entire day in a single room.\u00a0 Many do not even eat in the cafeteria.\u00a0 With budget and staff cuts, community-based instruction is largely a thing of the past.\u00a0 If the staff in Fulton County saw abuse in the halls, you can only imagine how hideous conditions were in that room.\u00a0 There are reasons for the isolation and I should do a blog post just on that alone. But isolation provides a place where bad things can brew and incubate, especially given #1 above.\u00a0 Students and their teachers need to  get the heck out of that room  once in awhile! 3. The staff are some of the most poorly trained and unqualified .\u00a0 I have had a chance to work with and around some wonderful and brilliant people in the field.\u00a0 Some of them were truly amazing, especially a lot of the paraeducators.\u00a0 With a bit of training they really shined, and were tremendously good with these students.\u00a0 And then the administration promptly transferred them somewhere else.\u00a0 To be honest, many of them may have asked to be transferred.\u00a0 But many did not.\u00a0 As a rule, truly competent paras usually were moved into other settings outside of those who have multiple and severe disabilities. As a rule, teachers have little or no say as to which paras get assigned to their classrooms.\u00a0 They are expected to be thankful for whoever they get. 4. Overcrowded and understaffed classrooms .\u00a0 If you simply look at the numbers, you would wonder how something like that could be.\u00a0 How could a class of 10 students in a classrom with 5 adults be overcrowded and understaffed?\u00a0 Part of it goes back to #3.\u00a0 If I had the most qualified and capable staff, I  could  do a lot more with a lot less, and that is the way I would prefer it.\u00a0 More adults CAN add to more overcrowding and more stress. But each of these students demand total and absolute care.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t necessarily the ones who have the most impairments that have the greatest needs, either.\u00a0 It is the combination of the physically immobile and fragile, combined with those who might be totally physically capable that causes many of the problems.\u00a0 If I have 10 students and 5 are in wheelchairs, it takes 5 people to to push 5 chairs such as during a fire alarm or assembly or fieldtrip.\u00a0 However if I have 5 kids who like to run, it puts the teacher in a dilemma about leaving the one child to chase after another.\u00a0 So this leads to problem #1.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply easier for an understaffed group to hunker down in the one classrom and play \u2018zone defense\u2019.\u00a0 By the way, the state of Georgia once had a class size limit of 5 for individuals with profound intellectual disabilities.\u00a0 Since waiving class size requirements, class sizes and caseloads have routinely doubled for this population.\u00a0 I know of a teacher who at one point has 15 students.\u00a0 And no matter how many paras you cram into a room to help, each student needs direct 1:1 time with the  teacher , something more than just changing a diaper. 5. The noise level adds to the stress and isolation .\u00a0\u00a0 These students may be nonverbal but they are not silent.\u00a0 Not by a long shot!\u00a0 I have had several students that could rattle every window in the hallway with their various noises and screeches.\u00a0 And they would do it often, they would do it all day and they would do it LOUDLY!\u00a0 Many of the most frustrating instances of abuse occur over the noise and the stress it causes.\u00a0 And the more students in the room, the more the noise level increases and the more stressed it feels.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that these students are necessarily in pain.\u00a0 Sometimes they are expressin happiness.\u00a0 But sometimes they are verbalizing their own frustration and stress.\u00a0 And sometimes I\u2019ve found myself with some of the loudest  staff  on the faculty!\u00a0 Talk about days where I wanted to just wear earplugs!\u00a0 But that is a big reason why many of these classrooms are as far away from other classrooms as possible so as to not disturb those who are trying to take and pass a standardized test. 6. Where is the administration? \u00a0 Probably not in the self-contained classroom where none of the students help increase AYP, the graduation rate, test scores, athletic prowess or college enrollments and scholarships.\u00a0 The sad fact is, is that not many administrators know what happens in these classrooms.\u00a0 Not many know what  should be  happening in these classrooms.\u00a0 This is a different world where things are not as easily measured as bubbling in answers.\u00a0 The principal in Fulton county should have known that students were not supposed to be pushed, hit, kicked and kept isolated in little dark rooms.\u00a0 But she probably also had no idea what  should  have been going on instead.\u00a0 Many of my observations were conducted in the lunchroom while we fed the students.\u00a0 At least once, I had no idea I was being observed!\u00a0 And my final year, the principal never observed me.\u00a0 He watched  this video  and based his observation on that.\u00a0 I had videos of me actually teaching that he could have watched, but he made me take those down.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tried to show people what I do, but the administrators frankly do not care that much.. .until something happens : \u201cMany schools do not have a sufficient number of students with disabilities to \u2018count\u2019 as a subgroup for Adequate Yearly Progress,\u201d the auditors wrote. \u201cSchool-based leaders could not answer questions regarding the performance of students receiving special education. Their answers included these: \u2018I will have to look it up,\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s not as good as they want it to be,\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t remember the exact number but it was not good,\u2019 and \u2018We don\u2019t have to worry about the group because there are not enough to count.\u2019\u201d And this often leads to them hiring someone who is unqualified because they are unsure of what \u2018qualified\u2019 looks like beyond the certificate\u2026. 7. The #1 question I get asked by teachers who are just hired and new to this field is \u201c What do I do with these kids all day? \u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Anyone else see a problem with this?\u00a0 I think it is good that a new teacher reaches out and asks for help.\u00a0 And I am more than happy to help them!\u00a0 Teachers in this positon are usually pretty good at listening and taking direction and they pick things up pretty quickly and are able to run with it.\u00a0 I have no idea the credentials of this Fulton County teacher, but I do know of at least one very highly qualified and experienced teacher who has been passed over\u00a0 for jobs like this only to put someone less experienced and qualified into it.\u00a0 Why? 8. Speaking out against abuse, neglect, inequality and discrimination will get you fired, it may make you unemployable and/or make working conditions more unbearable .\u00a0 In an age of accountability and feedback, this is one area where the tolerance is very low.\u00a0\u00a0 Teachers who talk too much, who blow the whistle and try to point out injustice and outrage find themselves in big trouble in a lot of ways.\u00a0 In the Atlanta Public schools we saw this before in the  cheating scandal where the district tried to fire teachers and humiliated and intimidated those that tried to report instances of cheating .\u00a0 I have tried my best not to be overly critical in my blogging of specific instances in my home district, but my advocacy efforts using this blog might be one reason why I am writing this at home right now instead of delivering outstanding services to students with disabilities at a school near you. 9. Parents have no idea. \u00a0 And that is probably the most frightening thing of all, as a parent myself.\u00a0 At least my children are verbal and can talk.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t always mean thay  will  but at least they  can .\u00a0 So how can a parent know?\u00a0 Sometimes their kids  DO  let their parents now through behaviors.\u00a0 But mostly the parents of these students are in the dark, and the system likes to conspire to keep it that way.\u00a0 See #6 and #8 above, and you see why a teacher who knows will not necessarily tell you.\u00a0 Everyone in the building may know that your child\u2019s teacher is horribly incompetent and abusive but you, the parent, will be the last to know.\u00a0  Unless you sew a microphone in your son\u2019s shirt collar. 10.\u201d Something bad has to happen before anything will change.\u201d \u00a0 This is what a former principal once told me while I was sitting in his office.\u00a0 We were discussing a letter that I had written and I was getting ready to send home to parents, telling them about what was going on in my classroom.\u00a0 He was not happy with my letter because it was written in such a fashion that it made it sound like the district and the school cared less about my students than other students in the school or less than   I\u00a0 cared.\u00a0 See #8 and #9 above. \u00a0 That letter never did get sent out to the parents.\u00a0 My job was to make sure nothing  did  happen, while the system was making choices that seemed to guarantee and foster an environment where something bad  had  to happen. THAT is why I resigned at the end of that year.\u00a0 I could not speak out and tell my parents.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t feel like I was being listened to.\u00a0 I was feeling more and more powerless as things deteriorated.\u00a0 Keeping bad things from happening was getting to be more difficult and more stressful.\u00a0 I am not a pessimist by nature, and always seek to turn situations around by finding new and creative solutions to whatever problems may exist. But I was faced with a situation where those above me were pretty much going to continue to let things deteriorate until something bad happened and then who would be to blame? The system is set up so that bad things have to happen before people are motivated to do anything.\u00a0 And even then, sometimes they are reluctant to make the necessary moves.\u00a0 Which of you would volunteer  your  child to be the victim of abuse, injury or neglect in order to turn things around?\u00a0 I know the parents of Alex Williams would not have wished this on their own child for anything.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think Stefan Ferrari\u2019s parents would have volunteered their child for mistreatment.\u00a0 In both cases the school district is aggressively trying to cover up and defend itself and seems rather unrepentant throughout the entire process. The environment in education today is ripe for this sort of thing to happen in a school near you.\u00a0 Is it happening in your school?\u00a0 In your classroom?\u00a0 With your child? What happened in Fulton County is happening all over.\u00a0 Much of what is happening can be summed up by the term \u201cWillful Ignorance.\u201d\u00a0 Everyone acts like it is all okay, especially those within the institution itself.\u00a0 Anyone who speaks out is shut up and silenced and intimidated.\u00a0 Heaven forbid we let one of these people who see the problems back into our organization!

I have enjoyed contributing online and for the most part have enjoyed my fellow travellers.\u00a0 The biggest hurdle I have faced, and still face, is administrators who are scared to death of content that they can not control.\u00a0\u00a0 Add a few stories like the ones about  Ashley Payne  and  Dr. Talvatie-Siple  and it\u00a0 puts a real chill on social networking and sharing anything!\u00a0 And this is where the habitudes kick in. As content creators we have to own what we put out.\u00a0 This takes a lot of courage.\u00a0 When I was blogging anonymously, I was able to write much more honestly but I was not able to really help the people that mattered most to me.\u00a0 Or help anyone outside of the blog.\u00a0 So now I write with more sensitivity and more responsibly.\u00a0 As an anonymous blogger I could hurl out ideas, even some very good ideas, but I didn\u2019t take as much responsibility for what I was saying as I do today. The best example of the worst sort of online habitutes cultivated by anonymity is Youtube comments.\u00a0 Dial up any popular video and read the comments.\u00a0 That sucking sound you hear is civility being being sucked out of the universe as people leave stupid and hateful comments.\u00a0 And this happens as well in the blogging world,but for some reason Youtube had a bigger population of degenerate haters.\u00a0 However, sometimes the feedback is brutally honest.\u00a0 When I have posted a video that was kind of crappy, people did not hesitate to tell me exactly how crappy is was. As a professional, I can\u2019t afford that same level of honesty without being willing to back it up in some way.\u00a0 But I am also more conscious of the person on the other side of the screen.\u00a0 They had the courage to put something out there for others to see and comment and even if it isn\u2019t the best, they did create something original.

But the other side of it, is that the internet seems to be built for distraction.\u00a0 For instance I start this blog post and start looking for Higgs Boson particles, and enter the world of Youtube, the mindless distractions are just a click away.\u00a0 And it is SOOO easy to say \u201cOH, this is only 2 minutes\u201d\u2026and an hour later I still haven\u2019t finished this because I got lost in videos, Facebook and emails.\u00a0 This was only supposed to be a 20 minute task! I have an  iGoogle  with all of the news and interest sites in one place that I like to regularly read.\u00a0 I have an education page and a technology page as well as a general news/weather/email/calendar page.\u00a0\u00a0 There is so much information, it is almost impossible to keep up with everything!\u00a0 Another important tool in my internet arsenal is my podcast subscriptions.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to be on the road a couple hours per day, and the podcasts are a way to continue to learn while on-the-go. I\u2019ve made a conscious decision to kind of avoid Twitter for the moment, because I sometimes I feel as if I am already swimming in information as it is with blogs I can\u2019t read, podcasts I haven\u2019t gotten around to listening to and other things I have had to skim over. To be sure the internet is an incredible resource for learning and teaching, and I\u2019ve done my share of both through this blog, Teachertube and other resources.\u00a0 I notice a lot of other teachers who have joined in and we are looking for ways to leverage this technology to better reach students.\u00a0 One of the unique and interesting things about Mightybell is that you can support and cheer on colleague through comments or just clicking the \u201ccheer\u201d button which is more or less like a \u2018like\u2019 button on the Facebook.\u00a0 And I notice that feature on my blog as well.\u00a0 So I can imagine a time when students might be writing and producing content, posting it on the inernet using it as a sort of virtual refrigerator, and then everyone can view it and \u2018like\u2019 on it.\u00a0 Now that seems a lot a lot more realistically motivating than grades or test scores.

So a person needs to be aware of what is out there, and they need to manage their own online presence.\u00a0 For instance I have been out there for quite a long time and have a fairly big internet footprint.\u00a0 There is not a lot I can do about that because once it is out there, it is out there potentially forever.\u00a0 But I can mak sure that my best stuff is on top.\u00a0 That means having\u00a0 Linkedin site that I am active with and gets updated and it is listed on Google.\u00a0 That means posting useful information here on my blog.\u00a0 And it might mean contributing meaningfully to  other projects .

A few months ago, I signed up for  MightyBell  through the  Future of Education  group that I belong to.\u00a0 And then I promptly forgot about it, until I started getting the daily email alerts, encouraging me to go on to the next step, which is to say, take the first step.\u00a0 The initial idea of signing up what to have something blogworthy, thus it might get me writing again. I know that I am not the only person who is feeling pretty dissatisfied with education and the direction it has been going the past 10 years.\u00a0 In fact I have never talked to anyone who has anything to do with it, who is totally satisfied with the direction of our educational system.\u00a0 But the online groups, Future of Education in particular, has at least kept me in the loop when I have otherwise wanted to run away from the education business. It\u2019s still an awkward relationship, but I\u2019m at least willing to give it another go. Mightybell is simply a string of tasks that is done whenever you feel like it, with a daily email reminding you of what you need to do next.\u00a0 For instance, step one is signing up for  Teacher 2.0 .\u00a0 That was fairly easy, although it took a day to get approved.\u00a0 The next task was thinking about and listing your talents, as well as thinking about how to recognize student talent.\u00a0 I sort of breezed through that with teaching being a talent, some writing, dealing with and using technology and applied behavior analysis.\u00a0 These are all things that when I think about, people either have recognized me for, or they are asking me about.\u00a0 I was one of the technology nerds as a student and as a teacher, who people ran to when they were having trouble with their computer. The next task was about passions.\u00a0 Things I love doing and things I love learning about.\u00a0 I was pretty stumped and decided I had enough for the day, right there.\u00a0 Now there are a lot of things I like learning about.\u00a0 Technology being a big one, along with U.S. History and science.\u00a0 I like learning about the latest trends in gardening and becoming more self-sufficient.\u00a0 I like learning about elves and hobbits.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t know if these are all passions.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty sure my family would all agree that I am passoniate about my laptop as I spend most of my time on it. But a follow-up question asks: Do I spend enough time on my passions?\u00a0 Lately, the answer has been \u201cno\u201d.\u00a0 Or at least not enough on where my passions and talents align.\u00a0 And that is what I\u2019m working through at the moment.\u00a0 Discovering where my passions and talents align.\u00a0 It occurred to me the best things that have happened to me in the past month WERE because of my writing right here on this blog.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the rare places where the talents and passions seem to intersect.\u00a0 Of course, the real trick is to get this intersection to pay the bills!

Now PLN is being used instead to indicate a \u201cPersonal\u201d Learning Network: a very personal (individual) set of people you choose to follow or communicate with for your professional development, usually outside of any formal requirement. Today\u2019s  Mightybell , like many of the other ones, consists of something that I have done somewhat naturally without necessarily doing it with the explicit purpose of building the network.\u00a0 The main point of today\u2019s exercise was using the RSS feed in order to subscribe to various blogs and websites, and then using some sort of service or tool to aggregate this information.\u00a0 I actually do use both  Google Reader  and  iGoogle  to gather and organize my RSS feeds and information.\u00a0 iGoogle is my tool of choice because the layout is more appealing and I can pick and choose what I want to read much easier. I also use RSS to subscribe to various podcasts and use iTunes or another open source program like  Banshee  in order to subscribe to podcasts.\u00a0 Podcasts are actually slightly better for me because I often find my reading time at a real premium. In fact, te single biggest complaint or concern from fellow Mightybell travelers is pretty much the same: having too much information and sifting through it all.\u00a0 I almost always get behind on all of my subscriptions and end up only reading or listening to a fraction of what I have coming in.\u00a0 I\u2019ll talk a little more about this overload in the next exercise, but it really is a concern even though I am not even using all of the tools available.\u00a0 I have lots of interests, it is just a matter of managing them all! For me there also has to be some balance between reading and writing.\u00a0 Reading more makes me a better writer for sure, but I need to find a balance in order to continue to be part of the network and environment that I choose to participate in.\u00a0 The two go together for me, so the PLN is a crucial piece. The biggest weakness for me, at least at present, is how to leverage this network into something that has a more tangible benefit professionally.\u00a0 I have interests and enjoy pursuing those through reading or writing.\u00a0 But it is only recently that I have been concerned about these pursuits having some sort of monetary value.\u00a0 I have always seen the reading and writing as a sort of sideline hobby, but it IS something I enjoy doing.\u00a0 I still scratch my head when I consider that people would actually pay to read something that I write.\u00a0  The Thinking Person\u2019s Guide To Autism  is at least a step in helping me see some potential in that direction.\u00a0 But generally the biggest satisfaction for me is derived from helping other people\u00a0 which is what I think underlies most of the content and people in my PLN. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tags:  Mightybell ", "outgoing_links": ["https://mightybell.com/", "http://www.google.com/reader/view/", "http://www.google.com/ig", "http://www.audials-one.com/article_1.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692010556/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwmyersr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0692010556"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/mightybell-pln/", "title": "Mightybell: PLN"},
{"date": "2012/01/27", "body": "Time to think about annual IEP reviews.\u00a0 I know many teachers are still working on their GAA\u2019s, but you need to be finishing those up and turning your sights on your next big thing which is IEP annual review season. I don\u2019t always agree with everything she posts, but  Carol Sadler  is definitely someone that is worth following on Facebook.\u00a0 And she recently posted this: \n Advocates Advice \u2013 We are quickly moving into \u201cIEP Season\u201d. Time to get your year end IEP meetings scheduled and on the books. Better to get scheduled in advance to make sure you have time to invite your help. Be sure to notify the school you will tape record the meeting and ask for a Draft copy of the IEP \u201cthat has been updated\u201d with their proposed PLOP\u2019s, accommodations and goals/objectives. Take the time to compare the Draft line by line to last year\u2019s IEP to see what they changed and what they are proposing and make sure it is appropriate. \n If you are a teacher and reading this, your hair might be turning a bit white or falling out.\u00a0 Or you might be tempted to start pulling it out.\u00a0 Let me tell you that what she is suggesting should be a matter of best practice for competent teachers.\u00a0 Getting the meetings on the calendar early serves everyone well, and knowing who all is going to be attending will help secure a place that is big enough for everyone. Tape recording the meeting (or using an mp3 recorder) is not a big deal.\u00a0 If you are a teacher, bring your own to the meeting as well.\u00a0 Both the parent and the district should be recording at the same time.\u00a0 There is no presumption of privacy at these meetings, even though they are confidential.\u00a0 You can\u2019t podcast the meeting.\u00a0 But by now teachers need to be getting used to being  in the spotlight ,\u00a0  being recorded  at  any time , any where.\u00a0 Transparency is our friend.\u00a0 Stop being hostile to it, and open up your records, your mind, your intentions and your heart to the parents of the children you teach.\u00a0 You might discover a wealth of rewards await you as the relationship transforms from confrontation to cooperation. The idea of having a draft prepared a week ahead seems to always trip up teacher case managers. They can not seem to wrap their minds around the idea of moving their entire time table up one week.\u00a0 You have to write this thing one way or another.\u00a0 Stop the procrastinating and the excuse-making and just do it, and get it done.\u00a0 You send it out a week or so ahead of time, with \u201cDRAFT\u201d written by hand in big letters, and attach a note \u201cPlease look over the enclosed proposed IEP DRAFT.\u00a0 Please write down any concerns and/or suggested changes that you might have on the draft and send it back to me so I can include them and make sure they are acceptable to you before the meeting.\u201d Imagine an IEP that is less than an hour long, and everyone leaves the room smiling, and pleased and relaxed, feeling good about what just occurred.\u00a0 If you have several annual reviews that are NOT like this then you should probably consider sending out your drafts well in advance so parents can look at them.\u00a0 But aside from pleasing a parent, there are also other good reasons to move your time table up a week.\u00a0 Remember you HAVE to write the thing regardless.\u00a0 Why not do it well in advance when you can actually THINK about what you are writing instead of having that deadline looming over you?\u00a0 You will discover that you make better choices and decisions when you are not rushed and pressured.\u00a0 And if there are problems looming ahead, you have some time to begin addressing them before the meeting with the parents and the rest of the team. I always did this as a matter of regular practice.\u00a0 I always tried to get the draft done and out at least 4 days ahead of the meeting regardless of who the parent was.\u00a0 If I get a parent making a request like Carol, guess what?\u00a0 I move my time table up TWO weeks!\u00a0 I want to swap IEP drafts, ideas and suggestions several times in advance of this meeting if at all possible.\u00a0\u00a0 If the parent is bringing an advocate, then I would rather the advocate look over my IEP, mark and bleed all over it with red ink and send it back however many times before the meeting, rather than rip me to shreds for hours in front of the rest of the team.\u00a0 The advocate will have plenty of fodder for bloodletting at the meeting from other members of the IEP team but not me if I can do anything about it. This is because the other members of my team balked at writing their portions in advance.\u00a0 The occupational therapists, physical therapists and speech language pathologists have HUGE caseloads and I understand that.\u00a0 BUT the workload is exactly the same whether you do it now or later.\u00a0 I put all members of my team on notice as to the day the draft is going out.\u00a0 It is up to them if they are ready or not, and 95% of the time, they failed to meet that deadline. IEPs are exactly the same as alternate assessments that way.\u00a0 If you procrastinate, you will end up under a huge backlog, and it will seem like a dark pit that you forever are trying to dig yourself out of as each deadline comes and overwhelms you.\u00a0 You have got to get ahead and try to stay ahead.\u00a0 Give yourself some wiggle room.\u00a0 Waiting until the night before is a terrible choice that invites mistakes and trouble. I actually attended one middle school meeting where everyone was there except the caseload manager.\u00a0 When I asked the SLP where she was, I saw an eye roll and she whispered \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs trying to write the IEP!\u201d\u00a0 This was a meeting that was already an hour late.\u00a0 It was a good thing that parent was not paying Carol\u2019s hourly rate!

{"date": "2012/04/12", "body": "A  recent report  about the lowering of reading scores is  making news  in educational circles.\u00a0 Sandra Stotsky, holder of the Twenty-First Century Chair in Teacher Quality in the department of education reform at the University of Arkansas, says American high school students do not read challenging books, whether they are assigned by their teachers or chosen for leisure reading. \n The report is put out by the same company that sells the Accelerated Reader, more commonly known as AR in a school near you.\u00a0 Basically, AR is built for data.\u00a0 Books are rated and organized according to reading level and length and then quizzes are given to students after they read the books and awarded points based on how well they perform on the quizzes.\u00a0 The quizzes are all computerized thus facilitating the data driven instruction favored by the leaders in educational reform today. Here is a great article by Gary Stager  on the shortcomings of AR and how it drains schools of scarce resources while creating and exacerbating a problem that it is claiming to address.\u00a0 What I want to add to the conversation is first-hand experience with how AR, and its implementation has had a detrimental effect on reading in our household. In my youngest son\u2019s 4th grade classroom, he is assigned a sort of individualized reading goal of a certain number of points per month.\u00a0 Making this goal is a substantial part of his grade.\u00a0 The goal is fairly well-written, in that it is precise and can be efficiently measured, since AR is a like a dream for people who are data driven. Plus it can be individualized based on ability.\u00a0 You would think a behaviorist like me would love it. \u00a0 My 4th grader has the dubious honor of being able to read on about the 6-7th grade level.\u00a0 So the grade level he is restricted to is at the 5-7th grade range.\u00a0 If he reads anything at too low a level, he doesn\u2019t get enough points.\u00a0 If he reads to far above, he can\u2019t comprehend enough to pass the AR test.\u00a0 So AR should be aiming at his sweet spot of about the 6th grade level.\u00a0 The problem is, is that my quest student has a goal that makes him read a book about every week.\u00a0 In 4th grade.\u00a0 On top of the rest of the homework he is being assigned.\u00a0 So right away, we are digging into his non-homework time at home, as the school day is extended 2-4 hours every afternoon and night.\u00a0 But there is another problem with this AR system besides the bone-numbing reduction of reading into data points.\u00a0 It is also expensive and it creates additional and needless drain on resources while at the same time\u00a0 it decreases accessibility and options.\u00a0 The true limitations of AR didn\u2019t really hit us until we decided to buy a  Kindle Touch  with our own scarce financial resources. The idea was that eyes strain from staring at a computer screen for long periods for just reading might be alleviated by the more natural experience offered by the Kindle.\u00a0 And that we could have more access to more books, free books, using the Kindle.\u00a0 And indeed there are free classic books to be had.\u00a0 Most of them freely available through the Gutenberg Project.\u00a0 And they are classic literature, time tested and things that many of us might have read when we were kids and our kids might discover and are completely appropriate for school.\u00a0 The first book I downloaded on our brand new kindle was a book called  Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks with the Circus .\u00a0 It has some pretty heavy themes but there is no bad language and there is a less on to be learned.\u00a0 The book is slightly on the low side for my 10 year-old at about a 4-5th grade level.\u00a0 But I thought he might enjoy it.\u00a0 But he will probably never read it because if you search the  AR book finder , it is not there.\u00a0 And neither are several free and classic works of children\u2019s literature.\u00a0 Basically, we are totally limited to those books that have tests because he has only a limited amount of time and he has high expectations for himself and will push himself to reach certain goals including getting straight A\u2019s.\u00a0 So AR books, and his grade, have a much higher priority than reading for enjoyment. It is NOT enjoyable to read for him, it is a CHORE. His less conscientious classmates choose books from the AR list, but compare that list to the Netflix/movie list in order to \u201cfinish\u201d a Harry Potter book in about 2 hours.\u00a0 They basically game the system as much as possible. Let\u2019s talk a a bit about the less motivated brother who just turned 13.\u00a0 He likes to read, but his interests are so restricted that they hardly even appear on any AR list at any reading level.\u00a0 Titanic, trains, and\u2026.that is about it at the moment although we are gradually working on expanding the list.\u00a0 For awhile he was interested in entrepreneurship and read books about the founding of Coca cola and McDonald\u2019s which I think I enjoyed reading more than he did.\u00a0 But those were each only worth one point despite being on a 7th grade reading level just because they were relatively short.\u00a0 Getting him through a novel is a LOT of work.\u00a0 We had to work overtime to get him through the book  Where the Red Fern Grows  which included having him watch the movie more than once.\u00a0 And he has developed a fixation toward getting coon dogs now.\u00a0 This is a fine story, but it was SO hard getting him to read the book.\u00a0 But we also didn\u2019t want to add the expense of an audio book on top of the book and the movie we bought.\u00a0  One thing about the free classic works of literature, is that they are available in audio as well as free electronic book form though  Librivox .\u00a0 So now a person can listen with their Kindle Touch while they read along.\u00a0 Every book can be made into a read-along-book.\u00a0 And it is free.\u00a0 And these are challenging books.\u00a0 these would be a much better choice for both of my kids because they are presented in multiple formats and widely accessible.\u00a0 Being in the public domain also opens up all sorts of possibilities for manipulating these stories and putting on plays, doing illustrations and basically having fun without the worry of copyright and cost restrictions.\u00a0 This would be leveraging technology properly, although it does not lend itself especially well to the data driven approach favored by the education czars of both Bush and Obama administrations.\u00a0 And I see nothing that convinces me a new president will make any positive changes.\u00a0  AR is an expensive program that limits and saddles a school with only certain books that happen to have quizzes in them.\u00a0 The entire idea of reading as an enjoyable endeavor is abandoned in favor of turning both my kids into data points.\u00a0 It is not cost effective to limit its use to only those students who might benefit from the point system, so everyone has to use it. I happened to witness another casualty of the AR system.\u00a0 It encourages cheating, which turns the poor librarian into a sort of guard who has to make sure that kids are not looking over another\u2019s shoulder and getting answers.\u00a0 I saw this while substituting in a 4th grade classroom.\u00a0 The lone librarian (she had no aid as those positions had been long cut) was exasperated with trying to monitor my class, the AR test takers plus check out books and organize the huge stacks behind her.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure when she entered the field she many idea of how she might promote literacy and a love of reading to children everywhere.\u00a0 I have yet to meet one that had anything good to say about AR. \u00a0 \u00a0 Tags:  accelerated reader ,  libraries ,  reading ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.renlearn.com/whatkidsarereading/", "http://blogs.ajc.com/get-schooled-blog/2012/04/12/high-school-students-arent-reading-challenging-books-by-choice-or-assignment/?cxntfid=blogs_get_schooled_blog", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gary-stager/mission-accomplished_5_b_1408896.html", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005890G8Y/ref=kindfampage_tab1_touch_shopnow", "http://www.amazon.com/Toby-Tyler-Weeks-Circus-ebook/dp/B000JQUU7S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1334259660&sr=1-1", "http://www.arbookfind.com", "http://librivox.org/"], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/accelerated-reader-undermining-literacy-while-plundering-library-budgets/", "title": "Accelerated Reader: Undermining literacy while plundering library\u00a0budgets"},
{"date": "2012/02/20", "body": "Saturday, my oldest turned 13 years old. The pregnancy was almost absolutely normal, and I remember going through the childbirth classes with several other couples, sharing a lot of anticipation.\u00a0 Finally, the day came.\u00a0 I came home and my wife let me know that it was time to take that trip to Tallahassee.\u00a0 I remember giving her a stopwatch and told her to hit the splits button whenever she felt a contraction.\u00a0 All the way down, I could hear a \u201cbeep\u201d every time she hit the button.\u00a0 The watch was rather high tech, and would keep track of the closest and furthest contractions as well as the average time between them.\u00a0 It\u2019s the nerd in me that wanted to know such things! We were doing pretty well, but it was a pretty long night.\u00a0 When he was born, I remember cutting the umbilical cord and I also remember a swarm of nurses coming into the room.\u00a0 I had no idea what was going on.\u00a0 As it turned out he had a  pneumothorax  which caused one of his lungs to collapse.\u00a0 He was rushed to the NICU, and I went with him, leaving his mother who was also in some distress of her own, unbeknown to me. I remember him wiggling around as they attached the wires and tubes and needles.\u00a0 He spent 4 days in the NICU, before it healed on its own without any medication, surgery or other interventions beyond oxygen. I was in a total daze.\u00a0 I had no idea of what was happening at the time.\u00a0 Or that this was just the beginning of a long journey. In my wife\u2019s words: \u201c[He] was born on his due date. As he struggled to take his first breath, his left lung collapsed. Within the following day, his lung had healed without requiring a chest tube. He spent a total of 4 days in the NICU. When he was 2 weeks old, we was back in the hospital with aspiration pneumonia. He was diagnosed with moderate reflux. When he was 4 months old, he started having seizures. At 15 months, he lost the ability to speak the words he had acquired. At 20 months, he was diagnosed with autism. I often asked, \u201cGod, why me??\u201d My wife was always a step ahead of me as far as recognizing when there were problems.\u00a0 But it was my own background in special education that enabled me to recognize that we were seeing something akin to autism.\u00a0 The when I asked him, the neurologist admitted that it could be some form of developmental delays and gave him the  PDD-NOS  diagnosis.\u00a0 Pervasive Developmental Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified.\u00a0\u00a0 Back then, they seemed very reluctant to give an autism diagnosis, especially to someone as young as my son was. Our story follows a similar trajectory of many other families as we experienced the ups and downs of life with autism.\u00a0 We had the assistance of many good and competent therapists and teachers.\u00a0 And there might have been a few less-than-good ones along the way. He has generally been a happy child, but the teen-aged years are starting out very rough for him.\u00a0 He has been changing into a young man for the past couple of years with his voice changing and then the attendant  mood swings  that goes along with  this transition .\u00a0 And typical middle school behaviors of his peers have not helped matters as other kids make fun of him, and he is unable to ignore or handle the name-calling and criticism like he could when he was younger.\u00a0 There was a time when he often could care less what people thought of what he did or said, but today it is far different.\u00a0 He is very sensitive about what his peers think or say and of course it is the negative things that get amplified. In a lot of ways, he reminds me of Daxflame, a teenager who became somewhat notorious on youtube for his meltdowns on camera.\u00a0 But if you watch (and they ARE hard to watch for those of us close to autism and Aspergers) you can see him struggling to control himself, to be understood and to make friends. As hard as the videos are to watch, the comments are even more hideous.  He exhibited a lot of courage putting himself out there like that.   So as difficult as the first 13 years have been, we\u2019re entering some entirely new territory.  In some ways this is much like all parents of teenagers, but with an added complication that makes the conformity demanded by teenagers all but impossible for my son.  How does one \u201cfit in\u201d when almost everything they say or do makes them stick out?

{"date": "2010/11/01", "body": "I\u2019m still in the market, but have been actually fortunate to have been able to be working steadily.  I already have some GAA tasks underway, with a basic plan that will allow them to be carried through to completion IF the teacher who returned this week can follow through.  Basically there are VERY few teachers left in the building who know how to do a complete GAA.  And at the high school level, the GAA stinky dog acquired more fleas because now there are two more standards to address! \u00a0 But in the meantime I am transitioning to regular substitute work until I take another longterm position in a couple of weeks.  And after only a couple of days, it has been a really interesting experience being among a more \u201cgeneral\u201d population.  Regular high school freshmen are really interesting people.  Very energetic and squirrelly and all over the place.  I found myself spending the day teaching a freshman math class on Tuesday. \u00a0 Most special educators have issues with math, I have found.  And I am no except as I struggled with math all the way through high school.  In college, I took the easiest math course offered and it WAS such a low level course, I don\u2019t think they even offer anything like it anymore.  So when I took chemistry courses, I ended up having to go back and teach myself a lot of the math I should have already learned. \u00a0 All this is to say that I found myself teaching some geometry to these 9 th  graders.   I found that aside from the high energy of the classes and some bits of unruliness, I was able to do it surprisingly well.  I even heard a few murmurs from the kids \u201cThis guy is teaching more than our regular teacher!\u201d  It\u2019s hard to know whether to feel glad or sad about that.  I don\u2019t know the regular teacher at all, but did have to deviate from the lesson order a bit.  Plus the video he had was just TOO packed with information and I could see eyes glaze over after 10 minutes.  So after the first period, I broke things down a bit more and did a LOT more teaching than the typical babysitting most subs are used to.  But not knowing the students on a more personal level was a definite obstacle in trying interact with them.  One can not emphasize rapport between students and teachers enough when it comes to teaching and learning and it is something a substitute has a hard time with, especially just starting out. \u00a0 The next day, I was co-teaching an environmental science class teaching juniors and seniors.  What an amazing difference in maturity!  And I was able to teach most of the day with an experienced teacher who obviously had a great relationship with his students as well the the other sp. ed. teacher I was substituting for.  These students were so much more self-directed! \u00a0 The next two days, I spent teaching U.S. History.  Two sections were AP classes and the last class was a large regular class.  I loved working with all of these students and they all needed a lot of work.  Again, there was this sentiment expressed about wanting me or someone like me to be their regular teacher.  And this was even expressed more mildly even from the few adults who happened to come in and see what I was doing. \u00a0So I feel pretty good about my skills as a teacher. \u00a0How to get potential employers to see it and buy into it is another thing entirely. \u00a0 All-in-all it has been a bit of an eye-opening experience getting out amongst a \u201cregular\u201d population.  After teaching a decade in an environment that is so utterly alien to the rest of the school, I was wondering if I could even handle life on the outside.  And I am finding that while it consumes more energy, I\u2019m able to make a good transition to a less restrictive environment with a minimum of difficulty.  And I find myself enjoying the students a little bit more in that I can interact with them on a much higher level compared to what I\u2019ve been able to do the past 10 years. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/substituting/", "title": "Substituting"},
{"date": "2012/05/07", "body": "I don\u2019t have any IEP\u2019s to write this year, which might be the best and only good thing about being underemployed.\u00a0 Well\u2026actually I do have one IEP to write; my son\u2019s. And this year it has been enough of a headache to make up for not having 10 others to write and schedule.\u00a0 This one has been rescheduled at least 3 times.\u00a0 Right before the original IEP date, I submitted a letter of parent concern that sort of threw his case manager into a mild panic.\u00a0 I admit, that this sort of violated about  half of my own rules  for avoiding the long and ugly IEP meetings.\u00a0 So I was not too concerned about delaying the meeting a week to enable people to get their legs back under them, and to address my concerns in a thoughtful manner.\u00a0 But then another delay ensued and finally she wanted to delay until after the CRCT results.\u00a0 The CRCT, for those who don\u2019t know, is Georgia\u2019s Criterion Referenced Competency Test, which is the state-wide high stakes test.\u00a0 I decided to go along with this, but each and every time and during each and every communication I asked for exactly the same thing: a draft of the IEP. And now I am absolutely convinced that failing to receive such a draft in a timely manner is the single greatest cause of preventable stress during IEP season.\u00a0 This is why it is such a critical part of my aforementioned rules.\u00a0 Procrastination and surprises do not serve anyone well.\u00a0 It does not serve teachers well, because they are deciding and writing in a hurry.\u00a0 It does not serve parents well, because their anxiety mostly comes from not knowing and the fear of the district ambushing them.\u00a0 It does not serve the system well, because when parents feel ambushed, they tend to become contentious and litigious.\u00a0 And yet, I witness this time after time after time, year after year after year, the same exact thing.\u00a0 The worst was when I was the high school representative at a middle school IEP meeting and we were already an hour behind.\u00a0 We were all in the meeting room, waiting for the case manager. When I asked the SLP where she was, I got an eye roll \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs, writing the IEP draft.\u201d If you are a teacher with an IEP tomorrow morning and have not completed the draft yet, you should consider another career.\u00a0 You are probably already on some sort of blood pressure medication.\u00a0 Being a special education teacher is stressful. But this is one source of stress in your life that you can minimize by simply moving your own deadlines up a week.\u00a0 I used to be like you.\u00a0 I would wait and then scramble to get my drafts done, and then worried and ended up with all sorts of mistakes as I hurried and rushed.\u00a0 I finally had enough and began writing my drafts further ahead of the actual meeting dates and got them to parents over a week in advance.\u00a0 And guess what happened to that stress?\u00a0 It disappeared.\u00a0 And here is why: Being a parent of a child in special education also consists of a stress, only this is one that rarely ever sleeps.\u00a0 Although I knew this first-hand, it took me time to translate that into a practice that actually minimized worry for the parents as well as myself.\u00a0 Having a draft in their hands a week in advance allowed the parents to think and consider what we were doing.\u00a0 And it instilled a sense of  trust.  You have no idea how precious that is, until you realize that you have attained it universally and fully.\u00a0 And it shortened my meetings by almost hour.\u00a0 Parents could talk about what THEY wanted, because we had agreed on most things ahead of time.\u00a0 Most of the heat fell on the itinerant providers who failed to submit their reports and recommendations in advance.\u00a0 They were also procrastinators. Having a draft written also diminished the effects of having to reschedule meetings.\u00a0 I HATED rescheduling, but on the few occasions where it was absolutely necessary, it did not impact me significantly because I already had the draft written and distributed to the parent.\u00a0 I used any extra time to talk to the parent some more, making sure everything was okay and it was just the way they wanted it. It took some SERIOUS arm twisting to get an advanced draft this year, even though it should have been completed 2 months ago.\u00a0 And what I got was something that was barely written at all, with no mastery or goals and objectives.\u00a0 This means that this is going to be a very long and drawn-out meeting because we have to hammer out goals and objectives.\u00a0 Fortunately I had already done some work on a few that I wanted, but I\u2019m seeing some other concerns that have come up that will have to be addressed. I\u2019m going to challenge all special education teachers to set a goal to get their IEP drafts completed 5 days in advance of the meeting and get them in the hands of the parents at least 3 days ahead of time.\u00a0 Of course it is a little late for most of you this year, but if you take the 5 day challenge I guarantee you will lower your own stress as well as the stress level of the parents.

{"date": "2010/03/25", "body": "I have been up to my elbows and eyeballs in annual reviews. I\u2019m doing a bunch of my own this week, as well as acting as LEA for several others. Some teachers have reviews that go smoothly and amazing well. Some need a bit of help. And some are absolute disasters. It is this last category that results in headaches for everyone and unfortunately it happens all too often. There are many reasons why an annual review can go poorly, but I find the single biggest factor is in preparation. The more preparation, the better the meeting goes. The less preparation, the worse it goes. The most hideous meetings I ever attended was at a middle school. I was the high school representative and drove half way across the county to get there. Once I got there, I had to wait nearly an hour because other meetings were running late. Fortunately the parent was not there, as the teacher was anxious to postpone which I thumbed down. I made her call the parent and get permission to hold it, which the parent was happy to do. Then the IEP was not filled out. We had to bang it all out there. Oy. Or another middle school meeting where I arrived, and the parent and itinerants and everyone was there except the caseload teacher. Where was she? In her classroom trying to type the goals and other parts, thus making us all wait. Or, yet another middle school meeting where I was late because the one I was attending across the hall ran late. When I walked into the crowded room, the parents were visibly fuming and the tension was so thick everyone was about ready to suffocate. This was because the teacher had made some careless comment and now the parents were loaded for bear. In each of these situations, even though none of these were my students and this was not even my school or my meeting, I managed to help salvage the situation from potential disaster. Even the middle school LEAs and graduation coaches seemed at a loss as to how to handle these situations. In the first case, we were able to bang out the IEP in about an hour once I overcame the team\u2019s reluctance. It was the last meeting of the day and everyone wanted to go home. But my general rule is the death is about the only reason to postpone\u2026or an attorney, which is practically the same as death. It takes an enormous amount of coordination to get all the players in the same room at the same time. Don\u2019t blow it. In the second instance, I got the teacher to just print out what she had plus the previous year\u2019s IEP\u2026.after problems with the printer. This is why waiting until the last minute courts disaster, and Murphy WILL move in and take up residence. In the final case, I discovered there were things in the IEP that were negotiable enough for the parents that they could walk out less mad. They still did not like that teacher, but at least felt better about high school transition. An IEP is often treated like a court case just waiting to happen. And it is not a bad idea to view it as such when writing one. But you can not become so paralyzed with fear that you end up avoiding it. It must be done, so you might as well grab it and run with vigor to get it done. It is daunting but not impossible to write a decent IEP that will serve the student well without causing either the school or the parents to feel like they have been robbed. I have suggestions right here in my blog that might be useful for both parents and teachers. This is one field where experience really does count as long as it is good experience. Someone who can write a proper, legal IEP can save the school thousands in litigation costs. A teacher who knows how to talk to parents without ticking them off can save an administrator countless headaches. A competent teacher who can actually teach the students can help the school meet its goals and the all important AYP. I have seen all too often what happens when a teacher is incompetent. People get frustrated, corners are cut and then parents are ready to go to an attorney. An experienced, competent teacher is also more likely to stick around, as long as minimum efforts are made to retain him/her. I\u2019ll talk about retention in a future post, but experience does help endure future obstacles and deteriorating conditions at least up to a point. I was able to handle a caseload larger than any other SID/PID teacher in the county with less help than any other teacher by virtue of my experience and tenacious commitment to NOT allow anything to happen that would endanger the students. Over time I developed experience enough to keep little things from turning into big things and when a big problem came along I learned how to handle a fair number of those. And finally, I learned to recognize when something was too big for me to handle and that I needed to ask for assistance fro m people paid to handle the bigger problems. Those are all skills that you can learn only through experience. In special education, there are a ton of judgment calls that we are called on to make because there is not a set textbook way of handling our students. That is what makes it \u201cspecial!\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/whay-is-a-good-teacher-worth/", "title": "What is a Good Teacher\u00a0Worth?"},
{"date": "2010/03/19", "body": "I know I have sometimes gotten down and negative here, as I often use this as my own personal forum to vent various frustrations.\u00a0 But this is also a good place to tell about stuff I\u2019ve accomplished to any would-be future employers out there who are looking for a special education teacher.\u00a0 Remember, I AM HQ! I had a student who came to me in a wheelchair.\u00a0 This is not unusual, since most of my students nowadays seem to be in wheelchairs.\u00a0 However this little guy was different because he could, in fact, walk.\u00a0 He had an irregular gait due to his particular syndrome, but he could walk and get around pretty well.\u00a0 And that was kind of the problem.\u00a0 He was getting around TOO well.\u00a0 And he would get into everything and destroy whatever he got his hands on.\u00a0 He was all hands and all active.\u00a0 And he knew how to drive his chair probably better than he could walk.\u00a0 So containing him and keeping him out of trouble involved finding some elaborate way of blocking the wheelchair up so he couldn\u2019t move it.\u00a0 This was easier said than done as he was also fairly clever and persistent.\u00a0 The wheelchair was basically used by everyone as a restraint device.\u00a0 Keep in mind, he was seen as unmanageable all the way through middle school. And within 2 years, I got the boy to a place where he could be put just about anywhere and he would basically stay put.\u00a0 He would still occasionally want to wander off, but he was easily redirected.\u00a0 He went from being my most unmanageable challenge to being one of my best behaved students.\u00a0 And he no longer needs or uses the wheelchair.\u00a0 Not at school, not on the bus and not at home. I\u2019m not going to get into all the behavioral techniques used to getting him to that place.\u00a0 I will just say that perseverance and determination were major factors toward getting him where he is today.\u00a0 I\u2019m not to proud to say that when he first came to me, I didn\u2019t want him in my room.\u00a0 I thought we were already overcrowded and understaffed.\u00a0 Haha!\u00a0 Little did I know what was to come!\u00a0 But I had no choice but to bite the bullet and dig in and teach this student how to conduct himself in a classroom without wrecking the place.\u00a0 He will still wreck things if he gets his hands on them, but I have little toys and things he can use to keep his hands busy.\u00a0 He\u2019s still very active, but he can be active in his own space.\u00a0 While there are still a whole lot of things he can not do, he can now be maintained without his wheelchair.\u00a0 This is a relief for his family who previously had to cart the thing around everywhere they took him.\u00a0 It is less bother for the bus, as they no longer have to mess with the lift. And I would be remiss if I did not mention that this accomplishment in no way affected the school\u2019s test scores, graduation rate or AYP.\u00a0\u00a0 At no time did teaching him how to control himself address a state academic standard. \u00a0 And there is no part of the Georgia High School Graduation Test that measures whether or not a student requires a wheelchair. None of this will appear on the Georgia Alternate Assessment.\u00a0 I took time out from academic instruction in order to address this students needs, which pretty much violates whatever tenets are set by NCLB.\u00a0 There is no way to align the goal of not needing a wheelchair to any state standard.\u00a0 And it also was not explicitly stated as a goal in his IEP.\u00a0 Our beloved governor has not offered any merit pay to teachers who can get a child to not need a wheelchair anymore.\u00a0 There are no incentives offered by the state of Georgia to recruit or retain people that can do this.\u00a0 There is nothing on any evaluation instrument for teachers that says this is even a worthwhile activity. Despite several who told me this endeavor was a waste of time, I did it anyway.\u00a0 And while I have no test scores, enhanced pay, accolades, awards, or anything from other people that says this is at all important, I do have an empty wheelchair in the corner that has not been used in a very, very long time, except to hold a coat or a bag.\u00a0 And I have the audacity to feel pretty good about that! Lots of my fellow teachers do stuff like this all the time and we don\u2019t talk about, because it doesn\u2019t address a state standard.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t recognized or rewarded because it doesn\u2019t result in a college scholarship.\u00a0 And this student can\u2019t give me a recommendation to an employer because he can not read, write or talk.\u00a0 But he can walk, which is how he gets around now because he does not need a chair to restrain him.\u00a0 He has learned to control himself to some degree. The story of this student is not over, as he continues to progress.\u00a0 He has a long way to go, and I hope he continues to progress.\u00a0 But it will have to be with someone else.\u00a0 Perhaps there are other students in other schools that need to learn self control.\u00a0 It would save some poor high school teacher\u2019s hair if more kids could learn that skill in middle school.\u00a0 And that is sort of where I\u2019m aiming at the moment.\u00a0 I would like to get into a smaller community and with a younger set in order to see if I can apply some of this experience earlier on.

{"date": "2010/09/29", "body": "Every so often a student comes and needs to do an interview and for the most part I like doing them.\u00a0\u00a0My only condition is that I am able to post the questions and answers on my blog, and I\u2019ve yet to have anyone object to that.\u00a0\u00a0So I recently got one about prejudices against students with disabilities.\u00a0\u00a0I have written about these before, but maybe not quite this explicitly, so this gives me a chance to think about prejudice, discrimination and students with disabilities. Thank you so much again for taking the time to sit down and answer these\u00a0questions,\u00a0and it would actually mean a lot to me if they were posted on your blog.   1. What are the challenges and difficulties that you experience and encounter when parenting children with mental disabilities? Hmm\u2026this is actually a harder question for me, because I don\u2019t think of my oldest as having a mental disability as much as a behavioral disability with mental issues, namely as it relates to autism.\u00a0\u00a0But that actually highlights the most pervasive problem which is the stigma attached to mental disabilities in general.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter what term is used, sooner or later it will be used in a pejorative way.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cmoron,\u201d \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cimbecile\u201d used to be clinical terms! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation The challenges vary depending on the severity and pervasiveness of the disability.\u00a0\u00a0It would be difficult to list all difficulties, whether it\u00a0be\u00a0accessibility issues to having to endure the abuses of a society that devalues people with disabilities to the day-to-day challenges of trying to do \u201cnormal\u201d things that most people take for granted, like tying shoes or riding a bike. 2. What are the struggles, if any, that a child with a disability experiences on a daily basis? The\u00a0struggles that children with disabilities encounter on a daily basis varies\u00a0of course, depending on what the disability is.\u00a0\u00a0Some universal issues might deal with self-advocacy, where the person may need extra assistance or an accommodation.\u00a0\u00a0If they assert themselves by asking for it, they are often labeled as a trouble maker or censored for asking for special treatment.\u00a0\u00a0So many people often suffer with their disabilities in relative silence.\u00a0\u00a0This is assuming the person even has the skills to advocate.\u00a0\u00a0Communication is one of the most fundamental skills a person can have, and yet most disabilities have some sort of impact on communication either directly or indirectly.\u00a0\u00a0Disabilities also have social consequences when it comes to making friends, being accepted and just being able to socialize in a way that others take for granted. 3. Have you ever prevented any prejudices from occurring against children with special needs? Oh I wish I could!\u00a0\u00a0The best I can do is to educate others about students with disabilities and point out that they are people, too.\u00a0\u00a0They have things they like and dislike and may express their feelings in different ways.\u00a0\u00a0And deep down, I think most people *want* to be seen as compassionate and caring people.\u00a0\u00a0I think if one sees that as a basic truth \u201call people would like to be seen as compassionate and caring\u201d then giving people a chance to express that can help against mistreatment and abuse.\u00a0\u00a0Prejudice is basically a symptom of intellectual laziness, so the task is to get people to think a bit deeper about\u00a0whom\u00a0they are judging against.\u00a0\u00a0Not being prejudice requires a great deal of self reflection especially when it is deeply rooted in our own experiences and culture.\u00a0\u00a0The biggest challenge for me and other\u00a0advocates,\u00a0is being prejudice against those whose primary disability is ignorance!\u00a0\u00a0I would rather educate than have to confront. 4. If children do experience some sort of injustice against them, how do they usually react? Are they greatly affected by it? A lot of children who suffer injustices tend to suffer in silence.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes being too outspoken can create a backlash and bring about even more injustice!\u00a0\u00a0Those who choose to confront have to be willing to go all the way to the mat, and persevere in spite of that backlash.\u00a0\u00a0So many behavioral problems we see in children with disabilities are a response to perceived injustices.\u00a0\u00a0The level of effect varies of course depending on how well a child understands what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0Children with milder disabilities who have a greater mental capacity do often suffer from depression and anxiety caused by the social consequences of their disability.\u00a0\u00a0For\u00a0for\u00a0students that I teach, it is more subtle.\u00a0\u00a0All my kids can tell who does and who does not like them, and they somehow gravitate toward those people and avoid the people who are afraid or indifferent. 5. Do children with special needs ever receive or get peculiar responses from other children?   Responses range from indifference to being compassionate to feeling sorry for the child with disabilities.\u00a0\u00a0Much of it depends on how severe the disability is.\u00a0\u00a0As a society, I think we\u2019ve gotten better about how people with physical disabilities are treated.\u00a0\u00a0Behavioral disabilities are a whole different matter, and reactions to students who scream, yell, holler,\u00a0\u00a0bite themselves and hit themselves is mostly along some continuum of fear.\u00a0BUT having said that, children are often better about dealing with it than the adults.\u00a0\u00a0When I talk to students, they often simply want to have their questions answered about the disability and then they are mostly fine.\u00a0\u00a0The adults take more convincing and I think it is because adults have their own schedules and agendas compared to students.\u00a0\u00a0Those schedules and agendas are more easily disrupted by students with disabilities, hence more hostility and prejudice. 6. How can a person, like myself,\u00a0make\u00a0sure not to commit any prejudices accidentally against people with disabilities?   Don\u2019t shrink.\u00a0\u00a0By that, I mean don\u2019t be so afraid of committing an act of prejudice that you avoid contact with people with disabilities altogether.\u00a0\u00a0And remember that \u201call people would like to be seen as compassionate and caring\u201d applies to you too!\u00a0\u00a0I make mistakes all the time and sometimes readers are good about pointing them out.\u00a0\u00a0I take it, process and try to do better next time.\u00a0\u00a0And those of us who are dealing with disabilities everyday probably have to be even more mindful of our thinking as it is sometimes more difficult to think of people as people rather than commodities or products.\u00a0\u00a0There is a lot of cultural pressure to standardize our education system, and standardization and homogenization encourage prejudice by demanding everyone be the same.\u00a0\u00a0Our kids are different by definition, so every attempt to make everyone the same automatically puts them at a disadvantage. 7. Finally, what. In your opinion, is the best way to spread disability awareness? What have you tried, besides writing in your blog?   The best way to spread disability awareness is the same way as spreading awareness of any other cause.\u00a0\u00a0And that is to limit segregation and isolation.\u00a0\u00a0One of the biggest challenges that we have had to face is the idea of inclusion and what it means.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, including people with disabilities in the larger community is the best and most effective way to promote awareness and acceptance.\u00a0\u00a0When we were out in the community for instruction, we were serving the students but we were also serving the good of the greater community by helping people be aware of these exceptional individuals.\u00a0\u00a0It is very difficult to be seen as compassionate and caring when you don\u2019t have anyone to be seen as compassionate and caring toward!\u00a0\u00a0My blog provides me with a vehicle to talk about some of these issues, but I\u2019m mostly preaching to the choir.\u00a0\u00a0Most of you already are part of the disability community in some sense.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I\u2019m imparting a little knowledge I\u2019m not doing as much for disability awareness as when I answer the questions people might have when they see my students.\u00a0\u00a0People do watch me and those of us in the business, and I do have to be more mindful of that.\u00a0\u00a0Other people will often take their cues as to how to respond to those with disabilities from those of us who do it\u00a0everyday.\u00a0\u00a0If we can remember to be caring and humane in our everyday dealings, that helps everyone else who is less familiar as well as makes life better for the students themselves. Those are the questions, and if you feel like you want to add anything, of course feel free to do so. Once again thank you for giving me this opportunity!   Thanks for giving me the opportunity!\u00a0\u00a0Doing interviews like this helps me think about what I\u2019m doing in different ways as it provokes some thought and reflections on my own practice.\u00a0\u00a0It also helps encourage me in that people actually care about what I\u2019m saying here!

When I signed up to substitute I had a lot of papers to fill out and on one of them I checked schools and grade levels where I was willing to substitute.\u00a0 I promptly checked all the middle and high schools.\u00a0 I did NOT check any elementary school.\u00a0 I have been around some VERY young students (outside of my own) since college but for some reason never really embraced the younger set.\u00a0 Middle school always seemed to be a bit of a sweet spot for me, although most of my career has been in the high school.\u00a0 Teaching is teaching, no matter the subject and no matter the grade level or ability level.

So imagine my surprise on Friday getting a call asking if I would come and teach 5th grade for a day.\u00a0 Heck yeah! I said this with zero hesitation, which is probably good.\u00a0 If I would have actually thought about it, I might have stayed home.\u00a0 I had not darkened a 5th grade classroom since *I* was a fifth grader! BUT you never know.\u00a0 And so I went in to a sort of emergency situation and lo and behold I actually kinda liked it.\u00a0 I was essentially with the same group of students all day (which is not really new to me) but these were all very engaged, engaging and mostly confident students.\u00a0 Ten year-olds really are at an amazing stage of life where they are most definitely kids but also have an emerging level of independence.\u00a0 The girls all seem to have lots of confidence and have no fear of demonstrating their academic or physical prowess.\u00a0 While the boys still want to be cool, they are not afraid of taking risks and can actually laugh at themselves sometimes.\u00a0 The whole class loved participating and being engaged in their learning.\u00a0 They liked to show what they can do.\u00a0 Peer pressure has not quite choked so much of their individuality and confidence away.\u00a0 They are the top dogs of their elementary school but it is still early enough in the year that it has not really sunk in yet. The hardest part of the day was probably playing kick ball in the 90 degree Georgia heat during recess.\u00a0 They still needed some help organizing themselves into a structured game and needed a referee, but generally these were all good kids.\u00a0 One would not even think of it as a  Title 1 school  by what was going on in the classroom, which is exactly what you want.\u00a0 Good things ARE happening if you can look past the political and the system view of things. I think I might just see about picking up some more of the jobs in the lower grades.\u00a0 It IS a lot different and it IS very busy but the day rockets by pretty fast.

{"date": "2010/01/16", "body": "I have on several occasions gotten questions from graduate students who are taking classes for which they have to interview a special education teacher.  The questions are rarely simple or at least I have problem answering them simply.  So the price for answering graduate level essay questions on a Friday afternoon is that I blog them!  So guess what Ms. M \u2013 consider yourself officially blogged!  Hehehe! These are questions about cognative impairments and assessment.\u00a0 The school she is getting her degree from uses the term \u201cMental Retardation\u201d or MR in the questions, but you\u2019ll note that I generally avoid the \u201cR\u201d word in my answers in deference to those who are sensitive to that term.\u00a0 We do use it as professionals among ourselves, but not as a pejorative as much as well-recognized descriptor and is shorter and easier to write than \u201cCognative impairment\u201d or \u201cIntellectual disability.\u201d\u00a0 Not everyone knows what \u201cID\u201d means. \nKeep in mind I\u2019m doing this cold and flying without the net, a textbook or Wikipedia because that is how a face-to-face interview would be conducted.  So if I\u2019m wrong, feel free to correct me but no whinging on about it.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going anywhere to look this up, I\u2019m just answering it as I see fit.\u00a0 Your fitness will vary.\u00a0 All other standard disclaimers apply\u2026. #1 What in your professional opinion are the meanings of intelligence and adaptive behavior Intelligence, to me, is indicated by a person\u2019s ability to solve novel problems and navigate novel situations.  While you cannot teach intelligence, you can help it grow by requiring its regular use.  Intelligence is the ability to figure things out by pulling together reasoning, experience and observation. Adaptive behavior is the application of more specific skills in navigating through daily life requirements.  There are people with lower intelligence who can survive very well on the street, while your college professor would probably perish if he or she were require to live a week on the street.  Adaptive behaviors can be learned and taught and that is a large part of what we do when teaching students with MR.\u00a0 We can navigate many adaptive behaviors by following a script or series of steps. #2 What problems are associated with assessing students with MR? At my level, the problems are legion.  This is why \u201cpay for performance\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d break down so profoundly when we discuss teaching the population of students that I serve.  First of all, my students do not produce anything.  They are nonverbal and cannot read or write.  So right off, that eliminates 99% of all the assessment tools currently used for high school students.  Also keep in mind that my students have multiple impairments so they may be visually or hearing impaired.  My students are decidedly nonstandard, so there are few if any standardized measures that would work.  But even those with less severe impairments will work more slowly, require more support and generally do poorly under standard conditions. Under any objective standardized scale of performance, my students regularly floor out.  There are no high school assessments that give  a score at an 11 month-old instructional level.  Most simply don\u2019t bother with a percentile less than 20%. Finally, the fact is due to cognitive and sensory impairments, my students require thousands of trials to learn a single simple task.  In one academic year, they MIGHT gain 1 month of learning in some area.  I do not know of any initiative by any politician where this would be an acceptable gain.  So the politics that drive current assessment practice  further discriminate against the most severe students. #3.What are the characteristics of the students with MR that result in eligibility for special education? To simplify this, it is a combination of intelligence and adaptive behavior that causes them fall behind in their school achievement.  This cannot be caused by a sensory impairment, a specific learning disability or a behavioral disorder and the onset must be prior to being school aged.  For those with milder cognitive impairment, this would look like a broad form of a learning disability that is not specific to any one area.  Those with specific learning disabilities and many with autism will have performance valleys and spikes, where they may be proficient in one area while being very weak in another.  Cognitive impairment cuts across all learning, which is intelligence and adaptive behavior together, are important. So how would one assess a student with a cognitive disability fairly and accurately?  The answer to that is that it will take more than one tool to do it and over some span of time.  It will not be easy or cheap.  First off, you can use standardized intelligence tests providing they don\u2019t floor out.  You can also use adaptive behavior assessments and questionnaires.  The questionnaires should be given to parents as well as teachers.  Next, do some real-time observations of the student in the actual environment.  And then look at actual work products and compare them with same-aged peers.  All of these last measures should be done in several settings and across time in order assess the rate of progress.  Assessment should always inform instruction, but in practice most of what passes as \u201caccountability\u201d and  \u201cperformance\u201d  nowadays does not. This is just my quick and dirty take on assessment of students with cognitive impairments so hopefully it helps with the degree as well as gets my readers thinking about assessment beyond the graduation test or CRCT.

{"date": "2010/04/08", "body": "A while back I got an email inviting me to review a book, and the publisher even offered to send me a free copy in exchange for doing a review.\u00a0 This blog does often result in some interesting offers (no job offers tho, haha) but I do not do many of them.\u00a0 I like blogging because I can do it in my own time, in my own way.\u00a0 I also do not read a whole lot of books on autism much anymore.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been around the business enough that I know they generally follow a similar formula.\u00a0 Basically they tend to follow the story of a couple who give birth to a seemingly normal child and then within 2-3 years discover their child has some sort of developmental delays.\u00a0 They are thrown into fits of grief, rage and searching.\u00a0 Then the reader is led through a myriad of treatments and therapies, hoping against hope trying to find a cure.\u00a0 And each book author has found some sort of cure or recovery story.\u00a0 Or so it seems. Autism & Alleluias  is not that sort of book at all.\u00a0 In fact, it is more of a Bible inspirational devotional than a real story.\u00a0 Kathleen Buldoc may have covered the autobiographical formula in an earlier work, but this one is put together differently.\u00a0 In 39 little chapters, she conveys a different lesson in each that her son has taught her even in the midst of being nearly overwhelmed by the trials and tribulations of raising a son on the autism spectrum. Each chapter begins with a Bible scripture, then Buldoc shares a story of something that happened with her son.\u00a0 It might be a call from the school, trying to sit in church, a vacation gone awry or any number of challenges that all of us parents are familiar with.\u00a0 She will share her frustration and emotions before also sharing the lesson that each event teaches.\u00a0 At the very end of each chapter, there is a prayer thanking God for the lessons learned.\u00a0 It is basically about how she finds God expressed in raising a son with autism. I found the stories encouraging as this was a good demonstration of the pluck and courage of one mother in spite of some very real and very large challenges.\u00a0 Her son had many behavioral issues including some that seemed quite aggressive such as hair pulling and grabbing glasses.\u00a0 It shed a light on how gratitude could be expressed even in some dark situations. I did buy the book and once my wife reads it, I have no doubt is will be passed along to someone else.\u00a0 In\u00a0 fact, when it came in the mail I had to admonish Jane not to run off with it as she was REALLY interested it.\u00a0 So it is safe to say that just about any christian mother of a child with autism would identify with, and like this book.\u00a0 It is one of the few that lays out some comfort without a lot of guilt.\u00a0 Many books that purport a cure,will leave a reader feeling very guilty for not trying it out or doing it, all in the name of finding a cure.\u00a0 Kathleen does not do that in this book, but she does guide the way into finding more acceptance with her son and finding acceptance with God. So all-in-all, I would say it was a worthwhile purchase, even though it is well outside of the genre of books that I normally read and buy.\u00a0 I would be more apt to buy this for someone else rather than myself.\u00a0 So I think this might make a good gift book for christian parents of children with disabilities, especially autism.

{"date": "2010/01/06", "body": "We went back to school, the kids and I, for the first time in 2010 today (Jan 5th). Originally, yesterday was supposed to be a teacher workday, but the school board moved that workday to the end to try to make room for more furlough days should the state legislature decide that there is too much of a budget shortfall. I was totally fine with that move but I know a lot of teachers really needed and wanted that time to prepare their classes for the new semester. In my program, in matters less since we continue to do what we started last semester despite new course titles and course numbers. I\u2019m the only one in the school with more separate classes than students! My break was uneventful and calm\u2026just the way I like it! I did my best not to get too entangled in the holiday madness even though some of it is unavoidable. I am dealing with a slight case of  Second Life  (SL) withdrawal, though. Of all the things I\u2019m plugged into (blogging,youtube, Classroom 2.0, Teachertube, Facebook and the FB game Farmtown) SL has me the most hooked. It combines a lot of nerdiness, with heavy role play with social interaction and the only limit is imagination which is nearly limitless because other people are constantly creating things from  their  imaginations. I was in-world a lot over the break, up late at night. Back to work means getting to bed earlier which means less SL time. My students who returned today all seemed glad to be here, albeit some were tired by the end of the day. I know I had a period right after lunch when I was sleepy! but I thinki the restoration of a consistent routine is good for me and most definitely good for my students and my own kids at home. We just do better with a regular schedule rather than too much unstructured time. But to be honest, my oldest did really well with all of the unstructured time. He loves the computer and TV, of course. but also likes doing imaginative play with his brother using Legos or stuffed animals. For the past 9 months his obsession has been the Titanic. When he gets on the web, he is reading all about the titanic. He watch YouTube about the Titanic. He wants to know everything there is to know about the Titanic. His interest does branch out a bit to other ships in the White Star line and other ships in general that sank and finally to just ships. So what to do with someone who has a seemingly narrow obsession? I bought a book last fall by Paula Kluth called  Just Give Him the Whale: 20 Ways to use Fascinations, Areas of Expertise and Strengths to Support Students with Autism.   I have to admit that this is not a game changer, but then again I have not found many books about autism that really grab me anymore. I do like that these are simple and practical suggestions of how to incorporate a single fascination and use it to open new doors and expand personal interests in the process. So for those who have kids higher on the spectrum, it might be a handy book to have around.\u00a0 It is a place I will go when puzzling about what to do with  narrow interests  areas of expertise of my oldest son. And this blog is about to turn 4 years old! Whoo hoo! There have been some threats to it since I started and the present climate is every bit as threatening or more so than it was 4 years ago. School officials at every level (building, county, state, national) are simply not comfortable with some unauthorized teacher writing news and views without some explicit control or without their own front-person calling the shots and spinning things to make everyone look good. While I\u2019m not out to make anyone look particularly bad, neither does it have to look good all the time. I think people will respect the honesty involved in saying \u201cHey, we screwed up! We\u2019re willing to admit it, fix it and move on!\u201d 2010 is going to be a wild and woolly year, I have no doubt about it!

{"date": "2010/01/16", "body": "And other disasters inaugurated by our beloved governor. The Atlanta Journal\u2019s blog asked a question:  did Governor Perdue leave education better off than he found it?  In order to be fair we have to remember what it was like when he came into office. Governor Roy Barnes was often called \u201cKing Roy\u201d because decisions were made without any input from educators. He came up with what he termed the \u201cA+ Initiative\u201d which did limit class sizes but was also a call for accountability. It was an early precursor to No Child Left Behind, and Barnes would go on to lead the  Aspen Institute which called for a continuation and strengthening of NCLB . And anyone reading me for any length of time knows how I feel about NCLB. When Barnes left, Georgia was a state that was a bottom feeder in state rankings by almost any measure in education. So it is safe to say that the state of education in Georgia was pretty bad at the time Perdue took office. Personally, I did lose my job at the state hospital because of cuts made during the Barnes tenure, so no love was lost when he lost. So now we have our current beloved governor. How has education fared under him? First off, Georgia is still a bottom feeder using any objective measure of educational level or achievement. He pushed for and got the legislature to stop funding pay supplements for teacher who were National Board certified. His response was to replace it with a master teacher program which tied the credential to student achievement i.e. test scores. He also succeeded in getting a measure passed that would help recruit science and math teachers by allowing them to start at a higher salary step. And now he has his pay for performance scheme. These final three initiatives; Master teacher certification, recruitment of shortage teachers and pay for performance all have one thing in common. They each and all explicitly exclude me and those who teach students with severe disabilities. This is great for job security as there are so few incentives for coming into a field with such a massive shortage that opportunities should abound. Not so good if you are a parent of a child with a disability. The students and their parents are the biggest losers from the Perdue legacy. Teachers do fare worse than they may have otherwise. Choosing between our current governor and the one he replaced would be most difficult, but right now democrats have a golden opportunity. Pay for performance is a total loser as far as what I currently teach. It is why the master teacher certificate is not accessible in my field. Daniel Willingham has an excellent video that explains why merit pay is such a difficult and tricky issue. Teachers simply do not have enough control over all the contingencies that are involved in student outcomes. In my case, students progress so slowly as to defy any quick, cheap or reliable measure. Also they are all different. The idea is to reward the best teachers, but there is no standard of comparison between students in my classroom and any other students. Right now I have 9 students which is more than twice the size of any other comparable program in the district. How could there be a fair comparison? Secondly, my students are with me for the duration of the day for the duration of their school career. There is no standard of comparison there, either. One provision the governor included was for classroom observation to be a part of the determining factor as far as whether a teacher would get performance-based pay. I have no problems being observed by an administrator, and showing them what I do any time. One problem is that not many administrators have any idea of what I do or even what I should be doing. They walk in once or twice a year for about 5-10 minutes and then leave. That\u2019s if I\u2019m lucky. For the past several years, observing me consisted of watching me feed one of the students during lunch! Again, I have no problems doing this and demonstrating it as it is an important part of what I do and crucial to the student. But it isn\u2019t part of the Georgia Standards and is not going to apply toward ANY of the school\u2019s stated improvement goals.\u00a0 What I do is important, but it is not given value by any accountability scheme envisioned by any politician. One more note about the pay for performance scheme outlined by the governor is that  he references a survey taken by some 20,000 educators , 80% of which supposedly said they wanted to be evaluated and paid on the basis of student performance and observation.\u00a0 I never saw any such survey, unless it  was this one .\u00a0 in Georgia. Performance-based pay is a mine field. But if they people advocating this succeeded in designing something that was fair to me and the students I teach, I guarantee it would be fair for all. The reverse is decidedly not true as demonstrated by the Master Teacher debacle that leaves me behind.

{"date": "2010/07/18", "body": "Ten years ago, when I last set out on the job hunting trail, I went to exactly two interviews in the same county.\u00a0 I had driven up the night before and stayed in a hotel.\u00a0 The first interview was with an assistant principal and we seemed to get along almost instantly.\u00a0 We had a real easy and leisurely conversation about the position and just about teaching and education in general.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember how long it lasted, but it was a good while, and I left feeling pretty good. The second interview was at the other high school and I was not sure which it was for, but I found out when I got there.\u00a0 It was for an EBD self-contained, and I had been there and done that.\u00a0 I basically said I was not interested in an position that put me off in a back corner, isolated from everyone else.\u00a0 That interview lasted about 4 minutes.\u00a0 I walked out of there, feeling like I may have dodged a bullet. The assistant principal who called and offered me the job two days later would eventually become my principal.\u00a0 And I was not so isolated and was in fact all over the community as it was truly a community-based program.\u00a0 But after about 7 years, it began to change radically and under the yoke of NCLB, the community-based became less and less.\u00a0 And by the end of 10 years, I found myself in a corner, isolated from everyone else. This summer, the shortest interview ever was the one that did not happen.\u00a0 I am on summer schedule which means stay up late and wake up late.\u00a0 But one morning the telephone rang at 9 a.m.\u00a0 I rolled out, and answered the phone. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Ms.Principal from SuchAndSuch Middle School!\u00a0 I was wondering if you were still interested in the postiion you had applied for with us?\u201d \u201cSure, I\u2019m still interviewing, yes\u2026\u201d I\u2019m a bit groggy but now waking quickly and trying to remember about this particular position out of the many I had looked at and applied for.\u00a0 On the TeachGeorgia site, where schools post their openings, sometimes the positions themselves are a bit vague.\u00a0 Sometimes they just say \u201cGrades 6-8 combination\u201d\u00a0 or \u201cGrades 6-8 special education.\u201d\u00a0 Neither of these are terribly descriptive, but I hit \u201capply\u201d anyway, despite the vagueness and the fact that this county and school was a bit far.\u00a0 Now, as I wake up, I hear the principal, in a more testy voice, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t seem too excited\u2026\u201d I pause at this\u2026.this seemed like an odd comment, but then I am scrambling for a pen and paper to write down contact information.\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes!\u00a0 I\u2019m still interested, and looking forward to talking with you about\u2026ummm\u2026which position is this for, exactly?\u201d At this point, the lady at the other end got very exasperated, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2026you do a little more research on me and who I am and call me back!\u201d\u00a0 >Click< Wow.\u00a0 I had a good mind to call the county back to make sure this was not some sort of prank or joke.\u00a0 But this seems a bullet dodged perhaps.\u00a0 It also woke me up to the fact that the job market is VERY different than it was 10 years years ago.\u00a0 Special education teachers are still sought after.\u00a0 Especially those with my certificate.\u00a0 In fact, my home county has 3 openings for HS SID/PID\u2026.including the one I just left.\u00a0 All of the high schools are turning their programs at the same time which is a bit scary from a parent\u2019s perspective. The interviews I have had this summer have all been really good.\u00a0 I would call them great, in fact.\u00a0 Never less than an hour and we spend time talking about what is important to us as educators or they as a school system.\u00a0 Each and every time, I walk out feeling good, if not great.\u00a0 I feel like I was made for this position, whichever position it might happen to be.\u00a0 And these are some very divergent positions across a wide spectrum of settings and subjects.\u00a0 But I come from a wide background so have experiences far and wide.\u00a0 I can do a lot of different things and do them well. My first rejection, as it turns out, looks to be rather exceptional, as other interviewers have not gotten back to me or contacted me.\u00a0 Of course when they don\u2019t answer your phone calls or emails, that is not necessarily a good sign, either!\u00a0 But the waiting and not knowing is just as bad as a rejection in a way.\u00a0 Especially when we had spent the sort of time we had in an extended interview process.\u00a0 It really puts some doubt in my mind and makes me wonder what is going on in the background.\u00a0 Were my interviews the sort that was just done as part of a process since they already had someone in mind they wanted to hire? I have encountered this once before several years ago, when I interviewed for a behavior specialist position in our county.\u00a0 I was glad they hired the person they did, as she was extremely qualified.\u00a0 But if I had known she had applied, I would not have bothered because the the job description was written for her!\u00a0 I applied just because I was afraid some people who were much less qualified\u00a0 had applied and the thought of one of them getting into such an important position scared me! With 2 weeks left of summer before most counties start their preplanning, I\u2019m quite nervous.\u00a0 I did have another wonderful interview last week and am hoping this one is the one.\u00a0 I have loved all of these other situations and systems that I have visited.\u00a0 They are all newer facilities than the 35 year old building I have been in for the last 10 years.\u00a0 They seem to have a special caring for the students I would be serving.\u00a0 They seem to be supportive of the kids and each other.\u00a0 They are generally smaller, more intimate cultures and communities.\u00a0 And it is the supportive community that I seek more than anything, rather than just the room in the back corner of the building.\u00a0 Wonderful things happened in that back room in the corner, no doubt.\u00a0 But I\u2019 ready for wonderful things to happen in a place not quite so isolated.

{"date": "2014/10/06", "body": "It has been over a year since my last post, and I thought I would take a shot at a return to writing by tackling the subject of bullying since October is  National Bullying Prevention Month . \u00a0At least a quarter of all the students in the school where I work are there because of bullying, including one in my own household. \u00a0I remember seeing him as he was writing on the whiteboard when one of his teachers asked the students why they had chosen this school and he wrote \u201cNO BULLIES!\u201d \u00a0I was a bit surprised. \u00a0While it was a persistent problem at his previous school, I had thought that they had taken care of the situation. \u00a0But apparently it was still foremost in his mind. \u00a0My oldest is not a perfect student, and there were times when his own behavior could be construed as bullying. \u00a0Although he would never actually resort to real violence, he would resort to a threatening tone often enough. Bullying has been around since the first time kids ever got together and decided to ostracize one of their peers. \u00a0Kids seem to naturally gravitate toward that  Lord-Of-The-Flies  behavior and sometimes adults do too. \u00a0And anyone who has ever posted a YouTube video or even written a blog has experienced the cyber version of this, thanks to the anonymity afforded by the medium. \u00a0However, the internet\u2019s community-building has also \u00a0created safer places for kids who might be different so they can bridge the gaps created by physical geography to connect and share unique interests with each other. \u00a0There\u2019s never been a better time in history to be a nerd. \u00a0The internet was created by nerds for other nerds, and the rest of the population eventually jumped on the bandwagon and made it hip and cool and an environment almost as treacherous as the real playground. I was bullied pretty relentlessly while I was in school. \u00a0I was not \u201ctough\u201d, I wasn\u2019t a jock and I wasn\u2019t cool, although heaven knows I really tried my best at all of those things. \u00a0Being socially awkward and not a member of the cool crowd carried (and probably still carries) a pretty heavy price tag in small-town America. \u00a0It gets even heavier when you move from one to another, and you have no established family ties in the area and everyone else seems to be related to each other. \u00a0And if you didn\u2019t have the money for the coolest clothes, cars and consumer goods, you were were pretty much out of luck. \u00a0The town I spent most of my time growing up in, is actually now one of the most diverse communities in the state of Iowa; a state not known for its diversity. \u00a0And I imagine the natives that didn\u2019t eventually flee from the area HATE it! \u00a0I believe God has a unique sense of humor and this is proof of it. \u00a0A place that was pretty intolerant in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s now has it\u2019s economy pinned to its diversity. However, regardless of how I was treated I still have to ask myself a more important question \u201cWas I ever a bully?\u201d I certainly was not the guy shaking down others for their lunch money or terrorizing smaller kids on the school bus. \u00a0But I\u2019m pretty sure I might have done some things that were unkind to people who were lower on the social ladder than I was, as low as that was. \u00a0The desire and pressure to fit in, be cool and be popular would eventually get the better of me. \u00a0Or rather, it allowed control by the worst of me. \u00a0If I thought that it would have advanced my own social position, yeah, I would have thrown a rock or two at Piggy. \u00a0I probably said the wrong things to people that hurt them at some point. \u00a0So the line between the bully and the victim is not so clearly drawn, and I think we all have some darker part of us capable of inflicting misery on others. \u00a0There\u2019s always some degree of intolerance, no matter how tolerant we think we might be. \u00a0Sometimes we lash out at intolerance with  more  intolerance! It\u2019s rather ironic that October is devoted toward Bullying Prevention. \u00a0As we approach November elections we\u2019re going to witness intense bullying in the form of electoral discourse across all forms of media as each party clubs the other with negative advertising designed to cause lots of repeated discomfort for the other side. \u00a0I\u2019m just referencing the treatment given to the topic by the  American Psychological Association : \n Bullying  is a form of aggressive behavior in which someone intentionally and repeatedly causes another person injury or discomfort. Bullying can take the form of physical contact, words or more subtle actions. \n The bullied individual typically has trouble defending him or herself and does nothing to \u201ccause\u201d the bullying. \n Individuals with autism are especially vulnerable to bullying. \u00a0The  prevalence of bullying is so high \u00a0 against and among individuals on the autistic spectrum  that I would almost make an argument that it is as much of a Aspergers marker as repetitive behaviors. \u00a0The articles I linked to give a good treatment of the problem within this community and hypothesize as to the reasons for it. \u00a0 It\u2019s part of the body of evidence that allows me to stake a modest part of ASD \u00a0real estate for myself. I think the most crucial skill we can teach our kids, especially those who are prone to being bullied, is to recognize when they are being baited and to bypass the temptation to become engaged in a battle that can\u2019t be won. \u00a0Most arguments regarding religion and politics fall within that category but almost any area of interest or passion can be used to draw a person into a situation where they feel the need to defend themselves from attack. \u00a0Most cyber bullies will use those things to troll and trap a victim into a relentless cycle of abuse and it\u2019s important to know when it\u2019s time to  just walk out and not respond at all \u00a0like Zelda did. The internet and social media have turned into a double-edged sword for people who have difficulties relating socially. \u00a0The buffer of the keyboard often gives people the space for free expression and voice where they might otherwise not have one, but it also provides the sort of cover that can be harnessed by miscreants who like to ambush people and set them off for kicks. \u00a0I\u2019m grateful to be part of a school that offers a relatively safe place for students to learn without the threats of physical assault, incessant teasing and the anxieties of not fitting in becoming a distraction to learning. \u00a0There are still distractions and cyber bullying can still happen, but in our virtual setting and environment we are able to keep tight controls within our virtual classrooms. \u00a0For the most part, the students are friendly and very supportive of each other as they often find that they share a common history of maltreatment from their traditional settings. \u00a0This explains why there was such a flurry of agreement and supportive comments in the chatbox fpr a message on the white board. \u00a0NO BULLIES!

As I wrote my last entry, I began looking deeper and deeper into that situation, watching and reading hours of testimony given by witnesses.\u00a0 There were initially over 170 educators from 40 different schools named in the investigation.\u00a0 As time went on, educators came forward, confessed and cooperated and in return they were given a sort of leniency.\u00a0 But it was all predicated on an admission of guilt.\u00a0 They had to confess that they had some role in falsifying or corrupting the testing process.\u00a0\u00a0 One by one they came forward and made deals.\u00a0 Until there were only 12 defendants left who went the distance and went to trial and all the way to sentencing. Actually, that isn\u2019t quite true.\u00a0 There was at least one who could not be prosecuted because  she died before she could have her day in court . As I poured over the history of this unfortunate incident my heart went out to each and every person involved.\u00a0 Everyone.\u00a0 Of course the children who were fooled into thinking they were somehow gifted or doing better than they really were and subsequently failed to receive earlier intervention that might have come if the tests were serving the purpose they are purported to serve.\u00a0 But in truth, these tests have  never  served that purpose.\u00a0 George W. Bush made No Child Left Behind the crown jewel of his legacy.\u00a0\u00a0 Barack Obama took NCLB and \u201cimproved\u201d it by taking the most onerous parts of it and incentivized it during a recession that gripped the nation through \u201cRace to the Top.\u201d\u00a0 Beverly Hall won her accolades as Superintendent of The Year in 2009\u2013 on  his  watch. The teachers involved lived in a culture of  fear, intimidation and retaliation .\u00a0 Their jobs were on the line.\u00a0 They needed the benefits for taking care of their own children and to put food on their own tables.\u00a0 Even if they didn\u2019t cheat, they knew it was happening.\u00a0 Erasing student scores was wrong.\u00a0 We all know this.\u00a0 But I often ask myself, \u201cwhat would I have done?\u201d\u00a0 Then I ask myself \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d\u00a0 Because you see, things have changed but maybe not that much.\u00a0\u00a0 Notice that these teachers were sentenced on April 1st\u2013 a mere 3 weeks before the state of Georgia goes into its testing season.\u00a0 Fear, intimidation, retaliation.\u00a0 Those sentences and this whole story casts a long, long shadow over every single teacher in this state and even across our entire nation.\u00a0 NONE of us are immune from the fear, intimidation and the fear of retaliation caused by the spectre of the long arm of the law reaching and grasping us with its cold and loveless fingers. I felt for the judge.\u00a0 He really pleaded and did almost everything he could do to keep from having to hand down sentences to these educators.\u00a0 He delayed his sentencing by a day, in order to give them all a chance to make a deal with the district attorney.\u00a0 It reminded me of the story of Pontius Pilate who did not want to administer a certain other sentence, trying the flogging first and then appealing to the crowds.\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced he took no pleasure in this.\u00a0 Everything about this trial was painful to watch.\u00a0 I know the educators did wrong and deserved some form of punishment.\u00a0 But are they that much of a threat to society that they need to be taken off the streets and incarcerated with rapists and murderers?\u00a0 They\u2019ve lost their credentials that they spent a good portion of their lives acquiring and will never be able to practice their profession again.\u00a0 They are jobless and in some cases indigent, unable to afford to pay for their own appeals.\u00a0 They are broke and broken. As I watched the videos of the sentencing and the efforts of the attorneys to appeal for some mercy, I was genuinely moved by the entire thing.\u00a0 I felt a sense of hopelessness for every single person in that courtroom.\u00a0 I would have taken the deal.\u00a0 Any deal.\u00a0 Whatever it took to wash my hands of this dirty, filthy mess. And that is what this  entire testing culture is .\u00a0 It\u2019s not about the children.\u00a0 It\u2019s not even about accountability and it certainly is not about teaching and learning.\u00a0 It\u2019s pure filth.\u00a0 And as educators, we all have to swim in this hot, steaming vat of it.\u00a0 I\u2019m beginning to wonder if there is any pension, insurance benefit or salary that can possibly wash the stink of it off of any of us.\u00a0 We\u2019re in it for the kids.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not about them anymore.\u00a0  It\u2019s all about the data . In my last entry , I described our testing season.\u00a0 We are now a mere 3 days into a 10 day ordeal.\u00a0 I am working with a team of 6 other extremely dedicated educators who like our kids and enjoy teaching them.\u00a0 And 3 days in, each and every single one of us have had to write at least one incident report, reporting some sort of \u201ctesting irregularity\u201d that will put us on the radar of the Department Of Education and subsequent investigations that might just put an end to that.\u00a0 Most of these things are out of our control.\u00a0 The new computerized testing administration is full of glitches and problems which are still being hashed out and has caused most of these \u201cirregularities.\u201d\u00a0 In some cases, entire tests will be invalidated because of these problems.\u00a0 Some students didn\u2019t get their accommodations and we scrambled to make the best of things.\u00a0 Only time will tell if we did enough to satisfy all of the oversight. Parents all around the state\u00a0 and country are starting to push back  for a variety of reasons.\u00a0 But one thing they realize is that our education system is hopelessly broken and every effort by our government to \u201cfix\u201d it has made it even more broken.\u00a0 One of the reasons schools push so hard for students to take these tests is because  there is money tied not only to the pass rates, but simply for having at least 95% of the students take the test on test day .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fear, intimidation and retaliation.\u00a0 While those Atlanta teachers who cheated didn\u2019t do the rest of the dedicated teachers in the country any favors, the system has not gotten any kinder.\u00a0 It continues to cultivate the exact same culture that incubated the scandal in the first place.\u00a0 And it has made teaching a much more difficult and less rewarding profession than at any other time in our history.\u00a0  And its starting to show .\u00a0 I would have a  really  hard time recommending this profession to any student given the present climate.\u00a0 Back when I got my undergrad degree in agriculture education, only about 2 of us out of 10 who graduated the program that December had any intention of returning to the classroom, with the rest opting to go into agribusiness.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always liked teaching, and still do.\u00a0 But so much of the job involves so many other things besides teaching students, and almost all of it revolves around \u201caccountability.\u201d\u00a0 Covering your bum.\u00a0 It\u2019s increasingly difficult to survive and thrive in that sort of climate for students and the teachers who teach them.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re sowing seeds that will reap a bitter harvest for this country unless we can regain some control over a testing culture that has gotten out of control. Just remember that whenever you hear the word \u201cAccountability\u201d when applied to education, it is shorthand for  fear, intimidation and retaliation . 5/4/2015 Edit: Thank you John Oliver!

{"date": "2015/04/12", "body": "I can see that this might be one of those multi-part posts where I talk about different aspects of one of my favorite topics: standardized testing. I\u2019ve been grinding against this sort of testing\u00a0 for a  very ,  very ,  very  long time.\u00a0 Granted, most of it was about the alternate assessment because that is where I was living at the time.\u00a0 Now I live in a vastly different universe.\u00a0 Still exceptional in a world of exceptionalities! But I thought it might be informational and beneficial to talk a bit about the logistics involved with state testing for a virtual school that serves students in every single county in the state.\u00a0 This is something that no other school (as far as I know) in the state could even attempt.\u00a0 And yet we have been pulling this off for over 7 years.\u00a0 Mostly without a hitch and certainly  without scandal. \u00a0 (Yeah, I know\u2026I need to blog that) In the special education department, we start planning for the spring testing before the first day of school.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019re preparing for it the day after the last day of spring testing.\u00a0 It starts with the IEP, and we run annual reviews and amendments to those reviews all year long.\u00a0 We begin writing in the student\u2019s accommodations, including which tests they will take and which accommodations they will be given.\u00a0 And then there will be more meetings to amend and fix those as the year progresses, the tests change and the students schedules become altered. Testing accommodations are among the most important service options that are presently offered on an IEP.\u00a0 Especially since the academic goals h ave been rendered essentially meaningless , and the direct services are basically fairly standard and less individual than they ever have been.\u00a0 Accommodations have a direct impact on what happens to a student on test day, and their subsequent grades, promotion and retention. It\u2019s obvious that  my previous treatment  of accommodations, as controversial as it was in those days, needs to be reviewed and updated.\u00a0 It\u2019s really fun to see the interaction I had in those days among different teachers!\u00a0 gosh I miss that! This year, we filled out a gigantic spreadsheet in December listing all of the students and their accommodations for testing.\u00a0 This was the first of many, many spreadsheets and updates.\u00a0 Every co-teacher in our department has a full caseload of 26, so this is not a small task.\u00a0 Almost every task we have takes on gigantic proportions when working on this scale. As we get closer to testing, one of the first things that comes out to teachers is where they are assigned to test.\u00a0 Remember, we serve students in every county in the state, and each and every test is given in a face-to-face setting under standard conditions.\u00a0 And we try to offer testing locations within 50 miles of each and every one of those students.\u00a0 And every student that is given the End of Grade\u00a0 (EOG) grades 3-8 test is going to be tested during the same 5 day window of time.\u00a0 And every End of Course Test (EOCT) is given during the next 5 day period of time.\u00a0 In total, we will test over 10,000 students across about 50 different locations in the state in a 2 week period. That\u2019s why this is such a big deal and is unique among all of Georgia\u2019s public school systems. My first year, I was assigned to a location about 15 miles from my house and it was one of the largest testing locations in the state.\u00a0 That means that during the first week of testing we had about 300 students that we tested.\u00a0 Grades 3-5 in the morning and grades 6-8 in the afternoon.\u00a0 It was done in a community center that used to be a church, so it had a huge main room and then several smaller classroom areas that was perfect for a main administration and then several rooms for various accommodations.\u00a0 However what was NOT perfect was that the parking lot was too small and had, at most, spaces for about 50 cars with 10-12 of those being taken up by us teachers who were administering the test.\u00a0 This meant that traffic was lined up on the street during drop-off and parents getting angry before they even got to our door!\u00a0 So they have since changed locations.\u00a0 And so have I. Many of the areas that we test are much smaller, but still have students that need to be tested where few if any teachers live.\u00a0 That means that many of us will end up traveling and staying in some far-flung location in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0 Georgia has lots of these areas.\u00a0 Far flung ones. For most of the year, students and teachers are in their homes in front of their computers, on the couch, in the bed and wearing pajamas but during testing time, it is \u201call hands on deck.\u201d\u00a0 It is a dramatic change for all of us, where we have to get up early, shower, get dressed and adhere to a very rigid and set schedule.\u00a0 Basically pretty much what the rest of y\u2019all do all year-long!\u00a0 This radical departure from what happens from the rest of the year produces a lot anxiety and complications that most regular schools don\u2019t have to deal with.\u00a0 The testing environment is foreign to *everyone!* Last year I was shipped off to one of the smaller far flung regions and I actually liked it so well, I asked to go back again this year.\u00a0 It was just more relaxed because larger testing sites means more students and more difficulties that increase exponentially.\u00a0 It\u2019s just like teaching a larger sized class versus a smaller one.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier testing 35 students than it is 300, no matter how much help you ship in.\u00a0 So for about 2 solid weeks, I\u2019m going to be in Troup County Georgia living out of a hotel.\u00a0 The school is paying for it plus mileage so while it means being away from home it will also sort of be a working vacation minus tourist attractions.\u00a0 Yes, I\u2019ll be working all day on my feet instead of sitting down, but at the end of the day there won\u2019t be any last minute meetings or IEP meetings or the extra things I usually have.\u00a0 Much closer to a regular working day. After teachers get their assignments, then the administration goes about the task of assigning students to their sites.\u00a0 It\u2019s not an easy thing because students will often move and forget to tell the school where they moved to.\u00a0 So we send surveys for students or parents to complete making sure the address we have on file is correct.\u00a0\u00a0 While this is being worked on, there are trainings, trainings and more trainings that us teachers attend regarding testing procedures.\u00a0 We have testing security and integrity drummed into us, as if the news of the  Atlanta teacher scandal  didn\u2019t make enough of a case.\u00a0 I notice they always come out with news about this right before testing season, just to make sure the point is driven home: \u201cComply or ELSE!\u201d As special educators we go over our caseloads over and over again to make sure we have the correct accommodations for the correct test clearly spelled and marked on their IEP.\u00a0 One mis-marked checkbox and we get a call to amend the IEP.\u00a0 It is a stressful time for our department as we are also in the middle of doing annual reviews.\u00a0 Actually, we are  always  in the middle of doing annual reviews!\u00a0 We are also in the middle of registering for next year\u2019s classes and getting ready to run through the  Summary of Performance  for each graduating senior.\u00a0 Egad\u2026what a painful thing to look forward to and I have at least 5 of them to do! So the two weeks of testing is actually fairly relaxing compared to what\u2019s coming afterwards. So now we teachers are divided into site teams, with one person designated as a site coordinator for each week of testing.\u00a0 Unlike other school systems where the elementary teachers give the elementary test and high school teachers doing their own, in my school system it is *everyone*\u2013 high school, middles school and elementary joining together to give ALL of the tests.\u00a0 It\u2019s a huge deal.\u00a0\u00a0 The person lucky enough to be selected as a site coordinator is the one who puts together the site plane, dividing up students and teachers and who and where within the site various testing accommodations will be administered.\u00a0 This year, we have an added bonus of delivering the test online to certain students who have certain accommodations so there will be the typical test booklets and answer sheets but also some computers to manage. This next week is the week before testing and it is when things really start to gear up.\u00a0 Each site team has a day where we will go to a central metro Atlanta location for a half day of more training followed by an afternoon of assembling the materials that we will need for the first week of testing.\u00a0 This is a pretty substantial undertaking as we have to make sure we get it as close to right as possible as many of these sites are hundreds of miles away and there is no \u201cgoing to the office\u201d on the spur of the moment to pick up something you might have forgotten, like a test booklet, a manual or answer sheet.\u00a0 We put together our site kits that include all of the testing materials and labels, sticking the labels on the booklets and answer sheets, making sure that they match exactly.\u00a0 And we count and count and count some more and write down how many of each thing we have for we have to make sure that we bring back exactly the same amount of stuff that we check out.\u00a0 Once we are absolutely sure that we have everything we need and that everything matches exactly, we can seal our boxes up with the specially numbered seals.\u00a0\u00a0 Inside that box are also about 5 more seals as we will have to count and recount everything in that box each and every day and reseal the box each day of the test.\u00a0 We also get spare pencils, scratch paper, calculators and this year, computers. Once the box is sealed up, the testing coordinator takes it and locks it somewhere safe and then the next Monday morning we open the seals, recount and divide the stuff among the various test examiners. Every parent of every child has been informed of where their site location is.\u00a0 They have received a flyer with the time they have to report and they also have to fill out an emergency and release form.\u00a0 They will also receive a call from one of the examiners from their testing site.\u00a0 When they arrive to the test site they will show a photo ID and sign their student in.\u00a0 This is quite a production since for many students they will be going to a new space where they have never been before, around students and teachers they have never seen before.\u00a0 While some high school students might have seen my name or heard my voice or seen my picture, NONE of the elementary students will have the slightest idea of who I am!\u00a0 So this can be a time of anxiety for a lot of these families. But it can be a very rewarding experience as well, as teachers, students and parents can connect with each other face-to-face.\u00a0 We do have events where we all can get together in our respective regions but this is the one time where students and families will actually be gathering up according to their neighborhoods.\u00a0 This is one reason I richly prefer the smaller testing site as it\u2019s more possible to establish a friendlier and more relaxed connection to a smaller group of families.\u00a0 The larger sites are not nearly as personal and tend to be much more stressful for everyone, but there are still connections that will be made and often endure until that student graduates. We\u2019ll test one group in the morning and another group in the afternoon, each administration being about a 3 hour grind.\u00a0 None of us are used to being on our feet all day, so us teachers are pretty footsore by the end of the first day as we work the room, actively monitoring the students as they take their tests.\u00a0 Then we\u2019ll count and recount all materials before resealing the boxes until the next test the next day.\u00a0 Once that is done, we go home or to a hotel to collapse until the next day to do it all over again.\u00a0 This will go on all week.\u00a0 Generally Monday is the hardest as families arrive from all over and hopefully can find the site and arrive on time. On either Friday evening or early Saturday morning, the site coordinators will converge at the main office to turn in their EOG tests and pick up their EOC tests which will hopefully be sealed and ready in their separate boxes, making the swap relatively painless.\u00a0 \u201cRelatively\u201d is the operative term as the EOG materials will have to be checked in.\u00a0 That means unsealing and more counting and then sorting and dividing the booklets, answer sheets and other materials.\u00a0 At every single stage of this, there is careful attention paid to the accommodations to make sure that they have been given correctly for the correct tests. And then the next week, we do it all over again for the high school tests.\u00a0 This is generally easier because not every student has to take every test.\u00a0 So the groups tend to be much smaller with proportionally fewer accommodations to administer.\u00a0 So instead of the full 35 students, there might only be 20 for both of the ELA tests.\u00a0 But there is probably more counting involved as the tests are arranged by subject and not by grade like the EOG.\u00a0 And you can never count just one\u2013 you have to count ALL of them\u2013every test whether you\u2019ve given it that day or not to make sure they are all there.\u00a0 Lots of counting and recounting. Because we are dispersed all throughout the state, it would be impossible for a cheating scandal on such a large scale as happened in Atlanta to take place.\u00a0 And even if it did happen, it would be too easy to track and narrow down exactly where it happened and who it happened with.\u00a0 Eventually, all of the students will take it online and I suspect that will simplify this process greatly.\u00a0 No bubbling of answer documents, no test booklets to count and really very little to turn in as it all gets turned in when the student hits the \u201csubmit\u201d button. Oddly enough, it\u2019s because we are a virtual school that we have yet to fully adopt the online version.\u00a0 since the students could not use their own computers and it has to be in a controlled and supervised environment we haven\u2019t quite yet gotten the logistics of pulling together and deploying enough computers for all of our 10,000 students on the same day at the same time.\u00a0 But we will be working toward that.\u00a0 This year, it\u2019s mostly students with specific accommodations that will have the machines as well as students in certain sites that will be designated online sites.\u00a0 The online administration will open up some new assessment methods and opportunities as well as make testing itself more secure and less prone to the sort of human errors and interventions that have cropped up in previous years.\u00a0 And if we can get the deployment of thousands of machines down across the state, it might make our testing lives a lot easier.
