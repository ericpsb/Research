{"date": "October 29, 2014", "body": "\r\n If you haven\u2019t guessed by my blatant lack of posting, I\u2019ve been having a hard time of it lately. I\u2019ve been feeling like Job; except, I have conscience enough to feel guilty for feeling like Job, because I know Job had it way worse than I have got it. After all, Job\u2019s miseries started with the loss of all of his children in a \u201cfreak\u201d accident. Thankfully, all my children are alive and well. \n It all started with a good thing. I decided to try Chantix to help me quit smoking once and for all. It worked for my uncle. It was working for my mom. I was ready to bite the proverbial bullet and have a go. I was warned that it might make me \u201ca little more tired\u201d and that it may cause some \u201cvivid dreams.\u201d These warnings did not prepare me for what was to come. \n While on Chantix, I slept 18 to 20 hours a day. The worst part, though, was that I wasn\u2019t even aware of how much I was sleeping because I had very vivid dreams that I was living my life, including turning in the assignments I\u2019d promised to my clients. \n This went on for two weeks before I accidentally missed a dose and I started to realize that things weren\u2019t making much sense. I became suspicious\u2014paranoid, really\u2014and I decided to intentionally miss a dose. I was sick with headaches, nausea, and a pervasive dullness that made me want to crawl right back into bed, but I was also aware, with a growing sense of dread, that there was a distortion in my sense of reality. \n So, right before my mom\u2019s hip replacement surgery, I stopped taking Chantix altogether. I spent the day at the hospital, which is its own kind of misery. We had a bit of a scare (regarding the delay in my mom\u2019s \u201crecovery\u201d period). Yet, I was able to stay awake and alert and conscious of my surrounding throughout the day. I committed myself to \u2018ssessing out what\u2019s what. \n The next day, Tuesday, went by pretty quickly, as I needed to be there for both my mother and my children. But that evening I hunkered down to try to figure out what had really happened and what hadn\u2019t. I had over 800 e-mail messages in my in-box. That freaked me out. I shut down my e-mail and went to my assignment folders. I couldn\u2019t find any of the work that I remembered doing. I went back to my e-mail, sent off a frantic message to my co-author, and called it a night. Honestly, I just wasn\u2019t up to facing the dreadful truth. I was hoping to wake up to discover that  this  was just a nightmare and everything was really just fine and dandy. \n Wednesday morning my co-author and I had a Skype meeting and he gave me the nitty gritty from his end of things. I\u2019d been gone for two weeks. He couldn\u2019t get in touch with me via any of my known methods of contact. He\u2019d honestly feared that I, and possibly my entire family, had died. \n By then my e-mail in-box had over 900 messages (mostly spam). I tried to sort out the spam from the legitimate messages, got through about 400 messages (just sorting them), and sent off heartfelt, honest apologies to my clients. I then went upstairs, told my husband how thoroughly I\u2019d messed up, and cried on his shoulder for a good 15 minutes before I was ready to face the music. I went back downstairs and started reading the messages I\u2019d missed. \n Despite the mess my business was in, life went on around me and there were many needs I had to meet. My mom was in the hospital until Friday; then, she was moved into a nursing home. The boys needed me, my mom needed me, and my clients were all very understanding. I struggled to get everything back under control, but my confidence was shattered. I\u2019d messed up so thoroughly and, even though it wasn\u2019t exactly my fault, it was definitely my failure. I felt it keenly. \n Day after day I tried to manage everything I needed to do and everything I hadn\u2019t done\u2014and I failed. Day after day, I tried and I failed. Again. Again. Again. Again. \n The stress exploded exponentially and I succumbed to a fibromyalgia flare up that floored me completely. Before the Chantix I\u2019d gotten my daily, regular pain down to a 3 out of 10 (10 being bad). Now, I was at a 7 out of 10. (For context, my broken wrist, delivering my children, and my bouts with my gall bladder usually rang in at around an 8 out of 10.) My ability to concentrate was at a 2 out of 10 (10 being good). I just could not do my work. At all. I could barely meet the needs of my children and my mother. I could barely function. I felt even more like a failure. \n Last Wednesday was my day. I woke up, got the boys off to school, and decided I could afford to take a nap. I overslept. Scrambled to get ready. Arrived late for the IEP I was going to duck out of early. Contributed nothing and left anyway. I scrambled to finish getting ready at my mom\u2019s, but we just got later and later. We were supposed to leave by 2:30 PM. It was well after 3 PM when we actually left. I tried to make up the time as best as I could, because we were driving down to Chicago. This was going to be my night.  This  would turn everything around. \n I was doing fairly well\u2014just a bit late\u2014when we ran into a major slowdown that suddenly became a parking lot. We waited for over a half an hour before things got moving and by then I was definitely late for my night. It was pass time for things to start when we got off the interstate, but I was determined to make an appearance anyway. This was my night! \n I was going to my alma mater, except I drove right passed it because the building had been completely refaced and was now unrecognizable. I backtracked. My mom decided we could park; I didn\u2019t need to take the extra time to try to drop her off in front of a building we couldn\u2019t find. So, we parked in the underground parking area, right near an elevator which would take us up to the street. I unloaded her walker and we were off, albeit slowly. \n I managed to find my school, about a block and half away, and we made it into the building and to the room where the event was taking place\u2014just as people were leaving. I wormed my way forward to present myself to my former advisor. She got out the mic and got people\u2019s attention. She introduced the award that was being given and then she introduced me, the recipient. I read an excerpt from the piece that had won me an award for overcoming adversity. I was able to read it without any anxiety, because, honestly, how much worse could it get? I watched the audience respond to my piece with gratification. Then, when I was done, the audience applauded. This was my moment. This was the moment when everything would magically turn around for me. \n Except it didn\u2019t. It started with the walk back to the car. We walked back much more slowly, for my mom\u2019s sake. And it was during that long, slow, excruciating walk that I realized that the cramps I\u2019d gotten from the long drive would not be worked out of my legs before I had to get back into the car and do it all over again. Once we were back on the interstate, we still had to swerve through endless miles of non-existent road construction, where miles and miles of the road were \u201cunder construction,\u201d but there were only two areas (with many miles between them) where workers were actually working. As bad as that was, the worst was yet to come. \n The \u201chighlight\u201d of the evening was our stop at the Road Ranger. Mom didn\u2019t like to pay at the pump, so we went in to pre-pay. My legs were still cramped and my mom still had her walker, so the walk to the store was slow going. Mom pre-paid for the pump. We went to the rest room. We got some drinks and hot dogs. Then, we made the slow, painful way back to the pump. But the pump wouldn\u2019t work. I walked back to the store and the clerk explained that our transaction had been canceled, because we took too long. I walked back and my mom elected to use her credit card to pay at the pump instead, because I really, really didn\u2019t have to walk back to the store. So, I swiped the card through, made the appropriate selections, and set up the pump. The gas didn\u2019t come. I waited and waited, but the gas didn\u2019t come. So, I let go of the handle, turned back to the pump, and tried to see what was wrong now. Then, the gas started to flow and it started with so much force that the pump popped out of the gas tank. I turned just in time to be sprayed from head to toe with gasoline\u2014mostly in my face and all over my skirt. \n I stomped back to the store and reported the incident to the clerk. She just blinked at me. I stomped into the rest room, cleaned myself up as best I could, but I still reeked of gasoline. I stomped back to the car and did the only I could. I popped the trunk, threw my coat and my skirt into the trunk, slammed it shut, and put on the trench coat I\u2019d lent to my mom. The shirt I was wearing was a tunic, long enough that some people\u2014but definitely not me!\u2014might wear it as a dress, so this wasn\u2019t quite as \u201crevealing\u201d as it might sound. \n Finally, I got into the car and was prepared to drive away and never, ever come to a Road Ranger again. But my mom said she wanted her receipt. So, I drove her up to the store and got out her walker and let her go in by herself. She came out a little while later, saying that not only did the clerk say that I must have \u201cdone it wrong,\u201d as if I hadn\u2019t been pumping gas without incident since I was fifteen, but also claiming that she\u2019d already given me the receipt. My mom told me to come in with her so she could get her receipt. \n \u201cMom, I\u2019m not wearing any pants!\u201d \n And that was that. We drove away. When I\u2019d finally gotten us into my mom\u2019s garage it  hurt  to get out of the car, because my sweaty skin had stuck like glue to my mom\u2019s leather seat. I limped to the other side, helped my mom get out and up into her house. Then, I changed back into the clothes I\u2019d worn for the IEP and I went home. \n The days that followed didn\u2019t get better, because the sinus infection I had had become full-blown bronchitis, and got progressively worse. My productivity went from being negligible to be nothing at all. And I was angry. I was angrier than I had been in a long time. As a person of faith, I\u2019d been praying this whole time for some help\u2014divine intervention. The Bible tells us that God answers such prayers. My prayers were being answered with silence and I was angry. I\u2019d had enough. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and I couldn\u2019t do it anymore and I was done. I was DONE. I QUIT. And if God wanted to change that He\u2019d have to do something big. \n But we develop routines for a reason\u2014at least, the ones we develop on purpose\u2014so, the next morning I did my prayer journaling, grudgingly, then I did my independent studies. And, while my anger and resentment didn\u2019t evaporate, I realized something. There was that nagging voice saying, \u201cOf course you couldn\u2019t take it, of course you couldn\u2019t do it, of course you should quit...\u201d And I finally stopped long enough to examine why. \n I am a person with a disability. And as long as I\u2019ve lived I\u2019ve heard that people with disabilities can\u2019t\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter what it is, there\u2019s always somebody saying that a person with a disability can\u2019t do it, or can\u2019t do it well, or can\u2019t do it enough, and shouldn\u2019t try to do it at all. And for as long as I\u2019ve been aware of the disability rights movement I\u2019ve been fighting this kind of stereotyping. I\u2019ve been fighting the oppression that says that a disability\u2014any kind of disability\u2014dictates what we can and cannot do. Each of us has things that we can do, things that we can\u2019t do, and things that we cannot do very well but might enjoy doing anyway. Disability doesn\u2019t change that. I know this. I believe this! I fight for the world to see this! \n But it doesn\u2019t save me from that subtle and not-so-subtle voice I\u2019ve heard all my life. \n So, here is my confession: I am a person with a disability and I gave up\u2014just for a day\u2014for no better reason than that I believed that, because I am a person with a disability, I couldn\u2019t do it. But I won\u2019t live my life like that\u2014that\u2019s really something I just can\u2019t do. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/10/my-confession-i-have-a-disability/", "title": "My Confession:"},
{"date": "November 10, 2014", "body": "\r\n Clearly, it\u2019s taking me longer to recover than one might think. I\u2019m feeling much better than I have been, but if you could hear my voice you\u2019d know first thing that I am still sick. I am still congested and still coughing quite a lot, though no longer so much and so deeply that my sides ache. What\u2019s more obvious than that is that my voice is still recovering from a bout with laryngitis. Still, I have been \u201coff\u201d too long and I\u2019m doing my best to get back to being productive. As I am starting to get back to work, I wanted to take a moment to share some of the thoughts that have been with me these past several weeks. \n I\u2019ve wanted to read  James Charlton\u2019s \u201cNothing About Us Without Us\u201d  for a while now, and I finally got my own copy. Currently, I\u2019m reading five books at a time\u2014each book covering a different subject. (This count does not include textbooks.) Don\u2019t be too impressed, because I\u2019m reading them all very slowly, because I\u2019m not just reading them, I\u2019m also reflecting upon their contents and studying them as deeply as I can. I like the eclectic nature of it, even if it means my progress is slower than it might otherwise be, because I come away with a much deeper understanding than a cursory reading would provide. Besides, sometimes the things I read from these different books click together in unexpected ways. \n I hope you read  my confession , because this is directly related to that post. Something that Charlton wrote on page 27 helped trigger the realization I describe in that post: \n \n \u201cMost people with disabilities actually come to believe that they are less normal, less capable than others. Self-pity, self-hate, shame, and other manifestations of this process are devastating for they prevent people with disabilities from knowing their real selves, their real needs, and their real capabilities and from recognizing the options they in fact have. False consciousness and alienation also obscure the source of their oppression.\u201d \n \n Charlton goes on to explore the meaning of consciousness, culminating (on page 29) in this: \n \n \u201cThe point is that consciousness cannot be separated from the real world, from politics and culture. There is an important relationship between being and consciousness. Social being informs consciousness and consciousness informs being. There is mutual interplay. Consciousness is not a container that ideas and experiences are poured into. Consciousness is a process of awareness that is influenced by social conditions, chance, and innate cognition.\u201d \n \n I live in a culture that systemically devalues people with disabilities. I live in a caretaker culture, in which our government is expected to take care of people with a variety of disadvantages in a variety of ways that further reinforces the notion that they cannot take care of themselves. This culture is being reinforced through my \u201chuman resource management\u201d studies, which consistently uses ablist language and caretaker ideas while purporting to support diversity. \n It\u2019s left me feeling like I\u2019m getting it from all sides. On the one hand, I firmly believe that the \u201csafety net\u201d the U.S. and other \u201cdeveloped\u201d nations provide is necessary and beneficial to society. Furthermore, I believe the \u201csafety net\u201d should be stronger than it is in the U.S. Simply put, some people fall through no (or little) fault of their own and these people \u201cdeserve\u201d to be caught in the net. Other people fall due to their own failings and vices and, though they seem less \u201cdeserving,\u201d it is still in the best interests of our society that these people are caught in the net. Finally, there are people who are \u201cpushed\u201d by our society, who have few natural chances to succeed, and need to be caught be the net. Unfortunately, the fact is that this \u201csafety net\u201d we\u2019ve created often fails to catch people. But the true social crime is that we have inadequate means of helping people out of the net and back up into \u201cregular\u201d society. \n On the other hand, I reject the paternalistic, caretaker attitude out society projects towards people who get caught by the net. (Note that these condescending attitudes are even stronger to those we\u2019ve failed to catch in the net.) The underlying prejudice is that the people who provide the net are \u201cbetter than\u201d those who get caught in the net. Many of the existing mechanisms that are put into place to help people out of the net (or to make sure they don\u2019t have to rely on the net at all) are just as paternalistic and condescending as the net itself, including affirmative action and the many other mechanisms that \u201cpromote diversity.\u201d The idea here is that these people shouldn\u2019t be treated differently; to ensure that they aren\u2019t treated differently (because we know that they really are treated differently) we help them out of the net using \u201cprogressive\u201d initiatives (because we know that they cannot succeed on their own). The whole system is a subtle, but powerful reinforcement of the underlying belief that the people our society casts off really are \u201cless than\u201d those that society embraces. \n This is one of the reasons why I just can\u2019t support Democrats. The language they use and the policies they so often create are just so patronizing that their underlying belief in inequality seems blatant to me and it\u2019s offensive. But it\u2019s also one of the reasons why I just can\u2019t support Republicans, either. They\u2019re less patronizing, but they\u2019re also less apt to care enough to create the policies and programs that can actually help people. It\u2019s frustrating, because neither the \u201csafety net\u201d nor the \u201chands up\u201d need be patronizing or paternalistic. That attitude is not necessary, but it is beneficial if you\u2019re more interested in maintaining a voter base than you are in actually helping people. The more people who are dependent on Democrats\u2019 initiatives for basic survival the more people are likely to vote for them. And our bureaucracy often expresses both the political interests and the patronizing attitudes inherent in the system, when they\u2019re not reinforcing them outright. \n So, I\u2019ve been struggling with my own limitations for over a month now. Not only have I been stressed beyond what I can bear, not only have I made myself quite literally ill (thrice over now), but I\u2019ve also been imbibing this ablist garbage, while also reading two books (Charlton\u2019s and a book about revising government) that help me to better envision how things could be. I\u2019ve come away from this mess\u2014rather I\u2019m trying to climb out of this mess\u2014feeling very weak indeed. Physically, I am weakened. More than that, I\u2019m demoralized, because I\u2019ve learned that I am not immune to this culture that I live in. I internalize it. When I\u2019m strong enough, I reject it. Mentally, I reject it outright. But emotionally, when my filters and defenses are shredded, I internalize it and it sticks with me. I spew it back out in the form of self-talk that makes it harder to stand back up and get back to work. Then, I have to go back and clean the garbage out of my system by analyzing it, weighing its merits, and then discarding it once I realize (again) that it really doesn\u2019t have any. Before all of this, I was arrogant enough to think I was immune to this garbage, because I was conscious of it. I know it is garbage, so why would I be susceptible to it! But it doesn\u2019t work that way. Intellectually, perhaps I am immune, but how I feel is something entirely different. Sadly, I hear it, I feel it, and it hurts. When it gets its slimy tentacles tangled up inside me, it hurts more than I can bear. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-About-Without-Disability-Empowerment/dp/0520224817/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415635997&sr=8-1&keywords=James+Charlton"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/11/culture-and-consciousness/", "title": "Culture and Consciousness"},

Is that cryptic enough for you? \n Sometimes it takes longer for our lives to align properly than we\u2019d like. Sometimes, especially when you\u2019re me, you stubbornly head in the wrong direction like a bull with a bit in its mouth. And yes, I\u2019m the bull. Sometimes things have to come crashing down in dramatic fashion for you to question what it is you\u2019re trying to build here\u2014and why. \n Why? Good question. Of course, the answer was there all along\u2014but, well, bulls with bits aren\u2019t always so good at abiding by intuition. \n Throughout my adult life (since I had my first child when I was barely 19 years old, I do mean my whole adult life), my writing aspirations and raising my children have done this awful dance that ended with both halves of myself stomping all over each other\u2019s toes. Being the stubborn bull and poor dancer that I am, I tried to force them to align. I tried to break them up and put them off in their own separate corners. I tried to make them sit up straight and play nice. \n Needless to say, that didn\u2019t work so well. Go figure. \n I believe our lives fit to a plan not of our making. While I believe we make choices, and inevitably pay the consequences of those choices, I believe there is more outside of our control than is within it. All I can really control is how hard I work, and I\u2019ve worked pretty darned hard. But the timing, the confluence, the ever-elusive alignment evaded me. \n Until now. \n I\u2019ve accumulated the experiences I need. I\u2019ve developed my craft. And I\u2019ve found someone who, while not officially claiming the title of mentor, is certainly behaving as a mentor would. \n While it is not my intention to evoke the horrid autism-as-puzzle concept, I must say that the pieces of my life that I\u2019ve tried to force into place have finally taken a shape where they simply fit together to make a beautiful vision of what\u2019s to come. \n Right now I\u2019m trying to plan that vision\u2014with enough flexibility and potential serendipity to avoid a repeat of that word-image of two bulls dancing through a glass house. \n (shudders) \n Explanation aside, here\u2019s a little bit of what I have planned for future posts to make up for not actually having any of them ready: \n \n The Threat of Burn-Out (a response to Rachel\u2019s first book, amended by reading her second) \n Recommended Reading (reviews of Rachel\u2019s books) \n Embracing Chaos\u2026Again (why I have to start with my first book\u2026which seems rather obvious in retrospect) \n A Vision for the Future (in which I make cryptic references to plans that I\u2019m not ready to disclose in order to whet your appetites and build support for a long-term, collaborative project\u2014how diabolical of me) \n \n Stick around.

{"date": "December 8, 2014", "body": "\r\n Yesterday I was absorbed in a necessary, cathartic task. I took my finals for this semester. The first one took longer than I expected.

{"date": "December 2, 2011", "body": "\r\n As some of you may recall, I want to write a book called  Neurodiversity at Work . I still do, though in my recent upheaval I took a good, hard look at this goal and the skills and proficiency required to pull it off. I also looked at other autism-related books I would like to write. And I came to the inescapable conclusion that I would need to write two other books before I could broach  Neurodiversity at Work  with the experience, skill and connections it deserves. \n When I first started this blog, I had a book in mind. It was something of a cross between a memoir and an advocacy piece. At the time, I wanted to make the idea viable for traditional publishing, and for the intervening years I didn\u2019t see a way to do it. The audience it could be expected to reach within the first year or two of publication just wasn\u2019t large enough, not without changing the focus of the book dramatically. For the last two years, I\u2019ve been researching self-publication, and I find I\u2019m drawn to it\u2014at least as far as nonfiction goes. The relatively narrow audience for the book doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much if the book is self-published; if you have the skill and wherewithal to market the book, you can profitably self-publish a book with a narrow audience. \n So, in turning away from  Neurodiversity at Work , I\u2019ve come full-circle back to my first book. This time I\u2019m not dwelling on how to make it marketable to a traditional publisher; I\u2019m dwelling on how to make it a book that fulfills a need for its audience. It will never be a bestseller, and that\u2019s fine. This book, like this blog, is for people who already care, for people who want to understand autism in a way that doesn\u2019t reflect our fears of difference, but instead reflects our desire to understand, uplift and assist those we love who carry the diagnosis. \n In outlining and writing this book, I\u2019m taking great care to ensure one important difference that sets my book apart from so many parent books: I\u2019m not telling my children\u2019s stories. Of course, it\u2019s this difference that will make it less appealing to traditional publishers.  Embracing Chaos: Discovering Autism and Neurodiversity  will tell my story. In this book I will describe how I came to see autism and neurodiversity, explain why I have the priorities I do when it comes to raising my children and advocating for change, and invite others to join me. I\u2019ve seen so many books that purport to tell the stories of autistic children, while really advocating for whatever treatment or approach the parent chose for their child. Those books, the kinds of books published by traditional publishers, promise a cure, a recovery or some other conclusion that promises a semblance of normality. My book will show that normality doesn\u2019t have to be a goal, while arming those seeking a different path with insight and resources to help smooth their journey. \n But it\u2019s not just a book for other parents. There have been so many times when I have tried to verbally explain to those on the periphery of our lives what I believe and why. Often, due to my own struggles to communicate verbally, it seems necessary to direct them to my blog and the list of blogs on my sidebar to really make the point. This is fine for those who are comfortable in the blogosphere, but many aren\u2019t. If I had a resource, a book, that could explain it\u2014I would gladly have directed them to that instead. And this, for me, will be that book. But while it will be my story, my journey, I also want this to be a book others can hand out to those on the periphery of their own lives. So, it\u2019s not a traditional memoir, either. It is intended to be a source of information and understanding for those of us who refuse to take sides, or rather for those of us who feel that there are answers and truths evident in multiple arenas within the autism community. (After all, it would be disingenuous to suggest we don\u2019t take any sides at all.) \n I hope it\u2019s well received by those for whom it is intended, by those who\u2014like me\u2014feel they need a resource, a reference, a tool to stave off those exhausting conversations in which we try to justify to those who mean well why we, too, are not adamantly advocating for a cure. I hope it\u2019s also a book that adult autists might read to gain insights into us parents who, while not supporting and agreeing with everything they say or do, really are allies in our goals to make this a better world for all those deserve to be heard, appreciated, understood and accommodated. \n That is my hope. Only time and publication can determine if I will achieve those goals. But I have to try. I have to set the stage. Then, I have to move on to other issues that need to be addressed. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/12/embracing-chaos-the-book/", "title": "Embracing Chaos"},
{"date": "January 9, 2012", "body": "\r\n I don\u2019t know why, but my browser really hates  The Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism .\u00a0 While I don\u2019t share my browser\u2019s animosity, it does impede my access to the site.\u00a0 So, instead of trying to comment there, I will respond here to the post  Shannon Des Roches Rosa  wrote called  How Autism Parents Can Listen to Self-Advocates . \n First, I agree with the premise.\u00a0 It\u2019s important for all those invested in the issues of autism (not limited to parents) to listen to self-advocates, even when what self-advocates say is uncomfortable or goes contrary to what we believe\u2014especially then. \n It\u2019s important to listen.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to consider what others are saying and to look for the material content in their words.\u00a0 But, it\u2019s more than that. \n Communication is an imperfect art.\u00a0 When we speak or write, we think we are sharing ideas, but we\u2019re not.\u00a0 We are sharing words, looks, tones, behaviors, ect., which convey meaning; that meaning is then translated within the brains of our audience and interpreted.\u00a0 Only by communicating and re-communicating (involving multiple attempts at listening and speaking/acting) can we determine how effectively we\u2019ve exchanged our ideas. \n This, by the way, is true for everyone\u2014even people who are very much alike.\u00a0 The more two people communicate successfully and create a mutually understood short-hand, the quicker this process becomes.\u00a0 When you\u2019re communicating with collectives, versus individuals, we still tend to use whatever communication short-cuts we\u2019ve become accustom to, but this short-hand will almost always be interpreted differently by the different members of your audience.\u00a0 Thus, reliance on communication short-cuts is not effective, with a few specific exceptions. \n Furthermore, when you\u2019re communicating with someone new, you have to test each other\u2019s understanding to communicate successfully\u2014no short-hand exists between you.\u00a0 The greater the differences between the two of you, then there is an even greater possibility for mutually exclusive interpretations in your attempts to communicate.\u00a0 A common example within our own community is when a parent defines  autism  as \u201clike my child\u201d within their own mind, and is all too ready to exclude anyone who is not autistic the way their child is autistic.\u00a0 This difference in definition creates a communication barrier, since most people do not mean \u201clike that person\u2019s child\u201d when they say  autism .\u00a0 On the other hand, too many self-advocates seem to think  ally  means \u201cpeople who agree with me\u201d or some equally inappropriate definition.\u00a0 However, when I think of  ally , I think of the way the U.S. and Britain are allies; they don\u2019t always agree and they don\u2019t always work together, but they do have common interests and work together to further those interests\u2014but don\u2019t always do so very well. \n Shannon wrote: \n \u201cIf we parents say that we want to have conversations with self-advocates, then we need to do the human thing, and truly listen, try to come into self-advocates\u2019 spaces, rather than always expecting them to come into ours.\u201d \n This is where, essentially, I must disagree. \n Both approaches miss the mutual nature of communication.\u00a0 I agree that it is wrong for parents (or anyone else) to expect autistic self-advocates to come into their \u201cspace\u201d in order to communicate.\u00a0 It\u2019s a habitual expectation (part of the \u201cprivilege\u201d thing mentioned in the post), but it\u2019s ineffective\u2014regardless of who the communicators are.\u00a0 Thus, it is equally wrong, if also habitual, to try to go into the \u201cother\u2019s\u201d space.\u00a0 Firstly, this transfer of mental space is not really possible\u2014it\u2019s in our imaginations.\u00a0 I suspect that if we really checked every time we guessed how someone else feels or what they\u2019re thinking about or how they\u2019ll react, internally, to a specific stimulation, then we could blow this whole \u201ctheory of mind\u201d b.s. out of the bloody water for good.\u00a0 Second, our words and expressions are merely tools to facilitate communication.\u00a0 We have to check our mutual understanding\u2014ensure we\u2019re both using these tools the same way\u2014in order to communicate successfully. \n Effective communication is going to happen in a mutual \u201cspace,\u201d an in-between that requires us to join our efforts in order to communicate.\u00a0 In the online dialogue, this is most likely to happen in the comments.\u00a0 A blog post is for a wider audience; comments are, often, for specific, individual communicators. \n There are certain online spaces, specific blogs and forums, which have created, over time, a unique space where dialogue happens on a shared basis.\u00a0 But, in my experience in the greater autism community, most of these spaces are dysfunctional\u2014preferring a side to a dialogue. \n In short, we should listen.\u00a0 We should ask for clarification and for explanations, even if we\u2019re sure we know what the other person means because we know what we would mean if we said what they said.\u00a0 We should invest ourselves in creating a mutual \u201cspace\u201d where communication can occur, and we should base this shared space on mutual understanding and mutually agreed-upon definitions or meanings. \n This, obviously, requires effort from both parties.\u00a0 If one party\u2014and it doesn\u2019t matter which it is\u2014is talking, expecting to be heard, without making the effort to be understood and to understand in return, then the communication attempt has failed. \n The communication attempt has  failed . \n This does not, however, mean that parents (or other interested parties) should not make accommodations for those with communication disabilities.\u00a0 The very act of creating a communication \u201cspace\u201d is an act of mutual accommodation, and if one participant has communication disabilities than that must be a factor in determining how the accommodations must be made.\u00a0 But, again, it goes both ways.\u00a0 Both communicators must recognize that the participants are unique to each other and their intentions and their needs are equally unique.\u00a0 To communicate successfully, such unique understandings and interpretations must be taken into account.\u00a0 You can\u2019t come in with all your baggage, knowing what you expect, and projecting your expectations onto the other person. \n For communication success, both parties must make a joint effort to understand and to be understood. \n This is not common practice.\u00a0 This is decidedly rare.\u00a0 We\u2019re all so busy spouting off our opinions, our beliefs and our ideas that we don\u2019t take time to communicate them to others.\u00a0 But growth comes from communication.\u00a0 Change comes from communication.\u00a0 Progress comes from communication.\u00a0 Unless we take the time to create mutual spaces necessary for successful communication, we will not create the growth, the change, and the progress we need to make this world a better place for ourselves and those who follow. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/", "http://www.squidalicious.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-autism-parents-can-listen-to-self.html"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/01/joining-in-effort/", "title": "Joining in Effort"},
{"date": "September 3, 2011", "body": "\r\n So, while I was taking a short break from blogging in order to make more time to help my boys transition back to school I was also researching an article idea I had about stress and parenting children with special needs.  I wanted to provide my potential readers with a greater understanding of what stress is and how to cope with in relation to the challenges of special needs parenting.  As a reasonably well-educated and well-adjusted mother of three children with autism, I thought I could write from a position of authority on this topic. \n I wasn\u2019t wrong, but I wasn\u2019t right either. \n You see, for some silly reason I thought I had a pretty good handle on my stress.  Maybe, relative to some, I do.  But, as I started researching the signs of excessive stress (or, to be particular, excessive  unmanaged  stress), I realized that I wasn\u2019t managing my own stress as we as I should. \n The following list describes some symptoms of unmanaged stress and my reactions.  You might want to check your own reactions, because the consequences of unmanaged stress are bad for your health (not to mention your ability to parent your children effectively). \n Symptoms (my responses): \n \n Memory difficulties.  (Um, what was the question again?  Um, yes, I got that.) \n Difficulty concentrating.  (While I\u2019m sure my children being out of school\u2014and the subsequent increase in volume\u2014is part of it, concentration has been an issue.) \n Poor judgment.  (Not so much\u2026unless I\u2019m judging that poorly.) \n Seeing only the negative.  (Not  only  the negative.) \n Anxious or racing thoughts.   (Um, yeah, but that\u2019s kind of normal for me.) \n Constant worrying.  (Again, normal\u2014for me.) \n Aches and pains.  (Not really.) \n Nausea, dizziness.  (Thank goodness, no.) \n Chest pain, rapid heartbeat.  (Definitely not that.) \n Frequent colds.  (I work in a wet basement, so I\u2019m not sure my perpetual sinus condition counts.) \n Moodiness.  (Unfortunately, yes.) \n Irritability or short temper.  (Yeah, I got that.) \n Agitation, inability to relax.  (I\u2019m getting better, really I am!) \n Feeling overwhelmed.  (Does it count if you are  actually  overwhelmed?) \n Sense of loneliness and isolation.  (Nope.  The boys are way too loud and active for me to feel lonely or isolated.) \n Depression or general unhappiness.  (Yes, but I\u2019m clinical, so that doesn\u2019t really count.) \n Eating more or less.  (I\u2019ve eaten today, so I\u2019ll count that as a \u2018no.\u2019) \n Sleeping too much or too little.  (Too little time=too little sleep.  Duh!) \n Isolating yourself from others.  (Did I mention I work in a wet basement?) \n Procrastinating or neglecting responsibilities. (Um, well, yeah, there\u2019s that\u2026but only a little.) \n Using alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs to relax.  (I\u2019m addicted to cigarettes, but that\u2019s not new.  Though, stress is the reason I started to smoke and the reason quitting doesn\u2019t go well.  So, that\u2019s a \u2018yes.\u2019) \n Nervous habits.  (Yeah, again, that\u2019s kind of normal for me.) \n \n The symptoms of unmanaged stress correlate rather closely with the symptoms of certain anxiety-related disorders.  Go figure!  I have been diagnosed with both depression and OCD, so it\u2019s hard to separate out what\u2019s going to be normal for me and what\u2019s actually manageable stress, but it looks like I need to work on this some more. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/09/a-de-stressing-surprise/", "title": "A De-Stressing Surprise"},

{"date": "July 9, 2012", "body": "\r\n This movie about the problems a child, particularly a child with neurological differences, has in processing events that, in the mother\u2019s words, just don\u2019t make sense.\u00a0 A little boy loses his father, whom he identifies with and who understands him, to the 9/11 attacks.\u00a0 A year later he finds a key; keys unlock something; and he thinks if he can find what the key unlocks he can hold onto his father for a little longer, maybe forever.\u00a0 The unspoken message is that he hopes, by fulfilling this mission, he can make sense of his father\u2019s death. \n But his father\u2019s death doesn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0 Some things don\u2019t, no matter how hard we try to make sense of them.\u00a0 As human beings, we have to live with the nonsensical.\u00a0 But some of us struggle with that more than others. \n I never endured a significant loss and I never lived anywhere quite as busy and overwhelming as New York City.\u00a0 As a child, I wasn\u2019t nearly so conscious of my own anxiety or my sensory overload.\u00a0 Yet, I identify with the little boy in this movie as he struggles to overlay order on chaos, as he tries to make sense of the nonsensical, as he clings to what provided him with comfort and understanding, as he fights against his own limitations, and as he experiences the world with a heightened sense of determination. \n I also get the mother, who isn\u2019t quite like her son, who has been left without the interpreter that helped her to meet his needs, and her determination\u2014and struggle\u2014to fill in the large gap left by her husband while dealing with her own grief and loneliness and confusion and pain. \n But there is another side of this.\u00a0 A side that could give advocates fits. \n This movie could be perceived one of two ways: \n \n It skirts the implications of an Asperger\u2019s diagnosis by focusing on the experiences of the main character without labeling them. \n It abdicates its \u201cresponsibility\u201d to make a conscious point concerning the limiting effects of diagnostic politics in providing appropriate care and support to those who need it. \n \n As a writer, I understand why it would be important to skirt the issue of autism.\u00a0 For one, unless you live it, it\u2019s very difficult to research well enough to satisfy the critics among those who do live it.\u00a0 Somebody\u2019s always going to find fault with your portrayal, even if you are intimately familiar with autism, because you\u2019re not intimately familiar with  their  autism.\u00a0 Second, by labeling the experiences of a character, you tend to distance viewers who don\u2019t identify with the label from the character\u2019s experiences.\u00a0 Third, by labeling a character, you label your movie in a way that dominates the story.\u00a0 So, I can certainly empathize with the decision not to label the character. \n On the other hand, involving people with the appropriate label can minimize criticism of your portrayal while also grounding the character in reality.\u00a0 Labeling the character also validates the truth that stories about people who are labeled in a similar manner are worth telling, which also validates the humanity of those who share the label.\u00a0 Finally, by labeling a character you challenge people\u2019s preconceived prejudices that people who carry the label are \u201cother\u201d and therefore they cannot be identified with.\u00a0 So, I can certainly empathize with those who are disappointed in the choice not to label the character. \n Perhaps more importantly, the choice to almost label the character brings up an entirely new issue.\u00a0 According to the main character, the tests for Asperger\u2019s were inconclusive.\u00a0 By what the movie shows, the child was challenged with a disability.\u00a0 He faced barriers to his goals that consisted of the combination of his own neurology and a world designed not to accommodate his neurology.\u00a0 Over the course of the story, he had to face and overcome (or not) those barriers himself.\u00a0 Yet the movie doesn\u2019t address how the lack of a label prevented the boy from accessing services that could have helped him.\u00a0 The movie didn\u2019t address the unfairness or inadequacy of services, which it could and arguably should have done. \n So, while I applaud the story, I can\u2019t help but be disappointed in the lack of a conscious attempt to address the failure to effectively support this family\u2014at least, to acknowledge that supports, accommodations and other services could have benefited this family. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/07/review-extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close/", "title": "Review:"},
{"date": "December 4, 2014", "body": "\r\n Those are loaded words when you\u2019re part of a community of people with disabilities. Far too many people have been derided as stupid and useless for far too long. Yet those words struck a chord with me. \n \u201cStupid useless pain is much harder to bare than pain with purpose.\u201d \u2013Dr. David Schnarch \n I read these words in a book about marital relations. Of course, the book in question addresses far more serious situations than I am concerned with, but I\u2019m finding the basic tools are applicable. More to the point, the pain I thought of when I read these words did not involve (at least, not directly) my husband Mark. \n I\u2019m not prone to hyperbole, so believe me when I say the last two months have been hell for me. I\u2019ve had meds messing with my mind. I\u2019ve had so many troubles and complications that I\u2019ve given up hope, gotten it back, given it up, and gotten it back more times than I can count. I\u2019ve been sick for over a month and got so used to feeling weak and dulled that I didn\u2019t realize how far I\u2019d slipped until I started to climb back up to my strength. I\u2019ve been angry at God. I\u2019ve coughed until my lungs hurt and then coughed some more. And, no matter how much I try to get back on track, I keep slipping back into a cycle of decline-and-recovery. I\u2019m still not even with myself. \n Most of this time, I\u2019ve felt like everything I\u2019ve been going through was stupid and useless. It\u2019s been painful\u2014physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually  painful \u2014and it was useless and stupid and ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ALREADY!!! \n Like most human beings, I seek relief when I\u2019m in pain; yet, I\u2019ve gone through some incredibly painful experiences and I\u2019ve bore them much better because I\u2019ve understood their purpose. I\u2019ve born these last two months quite poorly. I\u2019ve done things I despise, like yelling at my child for being uncooperative because I just couldn\u2019t handle one more thing. I haven\u2019t done things that I should, like finishing all the work I promised to my clients  months ago . \n As an adult, when Mark moved to a new place, he\u2019d walk around until he got thoroughly lost in order to learn more about the place he chose to live. On the other hand, we took a trip as a family and I ended up missing an important turn. Instead of going down I-35, we were going down I-90. We got so lost and mixed up trying to cut across between the two that Mark literally used the sky to navigate for me.  I hate being lost . Mark takes it in stride and he finds the way forward. \n These last two months I\u2019ve been lost and I hated every moment of being lost. I hated being weak. I hated being tired. I hated being in pain. I hated my complete inability to turn things around. I was fighting so hard against the things I hated and I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere. It was stupid useless pain and it was eating me alive. \n Then, I stopped fighting. This time it wasn\u2019t a matter of giving up; it was more a matter of looking around and looking up. Two things occurred to me. First, I knew that I had finally completed my memoir and that, whatever happens, it will be published. Second, I saw that in trying to start from scratch I\u2019d begun writing again. \n Granted, my business is a writing business. I\u2019m always writing something. But everything I\u2019d been writing since I obtained my graduate degree in writing was written with a specific purpose in mind. Whether it\u2019s for a client or for myself, it\u2019s all been driven by a purpose, by an objective, by a goal. Everything I\u2019ve written has been practical. \n I am not, naturally, a practical person. I\u2019m a dreamer. In living my dreams, I\u2019ve pursued practical purposes that, together, are supposed to realize my dreams. But practicality doesn\u2019t come naturally to me. Dreaming does. So, when it came time to replenish my creative well, I started writing the passionate ideas that came to me\u2014without a predefined purpose. And it was liberating. \n Now, practically speaking, I\u2019d stopped  writing  in order to better use my time in my writing business. I suspect that there was no other way to get me  writing  again than to knock me so thoroughly down that I  had  to go back to my roots as a writer just to stand myself back up. You see, decades ago when I started writing, it wasn\u2019t with purpose\u2014just passion. I  loved  to write. Writing  excited  me. It  thrilled  me. Cultivating my talent and turning it into a business was something I was  proud  of, something I  loved . \n Then, once I\u2019d actually got my business up and running, there came the pressure and the consequences of that pressure and the consequences of those consequences. I became driven. I was still inspired and I was still passionate, but I wasn\u2019t using that passion or that inspiration, not to its fullest. I was working towards a purpose. Everything else fell to the wayside, including the love I had for what I was doing. \n So, while I\u2019m still recovering, I\u2019m recovering with a purpose. I\u2019m recovering my faith. I\u2019m recovering my inspiration. I\u2019m recovering my work ethic. And, yes, I\u2019m recovering my health, too. My life is imbalanced, but I\u2019m getting better now that I have a purpose I can really live with, despite the pain. And I\u2019m about one-fourth of the way through the first draft of a novel that I\u2019ve been trying not to write for at least six months. Now,  that  was stupid and useless, wasted effort. And I realized it by realizing, once again, that pain is necessary for growth and renewal. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/12/stupid-and-useless/", "title": "Stupid and Useless"},
{"date": "August 17, 2012", "body": "\r\n So, the ghost haunting my child has a name: Epilepsy. \n Is that inflammatory language?  Perhaps, but I don\u2019t care.  At least, not right now. \n I don\u2019t mean to offend the many people who live with epilepsy.  To them: You are not less of a person because of epilepsy.  I know that.  I respect that.  I respect my child, too. \n But the fact is that these seizures have haunted my son for months.  He\u2019s afraid of them.  He\u2019s afraid of what he does when they happen.  He\u2019s afraid of not being able to make them stop.  They strike without warning, without a known trigger, and they haunt him with exhaustion and unease throughout the time when he\u2019s not having them. \n So, there.  If it offends, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re experiencing this thing called epilepsy, and, unlike autism, I\u2019m not willing to let it run its course while offering support and opportunities for development.  It\u2019s just not the same thing. \n Now, as I was saying, the ghost haunting my child has a name: Epilepsy. \n This is good.  As anyone with more than a passing familiarity with the fantasy genre should know, naming things gives you power over them.  It brings to mind  A Wizard of Earthsea  by Ursula K. Le Guin.  The story starts with a young boy named Ged who is destined to be the greatest sorcerer in all Earthsea, but he makes a mistake.  I don\u2019t remember the details\u2014it\u2019s been a long time since I read the series\u2014but somehow Ged releases an evil upon the world, and he can\u2019t stop it because he doesn\u2019t know its name.  He hunts it and chases it, all in an effort to learn its name and to stop the evil from wreaking havoc on the world. \n Sure, it\u2019s a fantasy story and may seem to have little to do with the real world.  But, think about it.  It\u2019s true.  Naming thing gives you power over them.  It\u2019s not really magical power, like in the story, but it\u2019s the next best thing:  Knowledge.  Knowledge is its own kind of magic.  With knowledge, comes power.  Perhaps the power to heal.  Perhaps the power to understand.  Perhaps the power to cope.  But it\u2019s power nonetheless. \n After that first in-hospital seizure, we had the power of a name.  Later, when we came home, we brought that power with us and were able to tap into some pretty impressive resources.  But, in the hospital, it was the power of the name\u2014and with the naming came a course of action. \n Luckily, Willy slept after his seizure.  I talked with the doctor:  Willy would start medication to help with the seizures that very night.  An MRI would be ordered, because the doctor (the head doctor) saw the seizure in action through the EEG and saw that the seizure started in one location within the brain and then spread throughout Willy\u2019s brain.  He wanted an MRI to look closely at that part of the brain to see if he could find a cause.  He also ordered blood work to be done, and then we\u2019d come back to learn more about the results.  We had a step-by-step plan of action, finally, with the power of a name. \n When Willy was awake, he was weepy and whiny.  He wanted to go home, because his house was the best place for him to be and he really needed to get back there.  I\u2019d hoped the one seizure would be enough, but it wasn\u2019t.  They kept us over night. \n He had a seizure around 11pm, after I\u2019d fallen asleep.  He tore off his turban of gauze and ripped all the glued-on electrodes from off of his head, and made it out into the hall before anyone could stop him.  I didn\u2019t even wake up until they were bringing him back into the room.  They got him back in bed and I helped soothe him while they glued all the electrodes back onto his head and wrapped the gauze turban around and around, looping it under his chin this time.  Before they left, they turned on the bed alarm, which would sound if he got out of bed again. \n Around 2am the alarm went off, and it woke me up.  Willy was quicker than I was, tearing off the turban and electrodes before I could reach him, but I was able to keep him in the room.  Again, they glued the electrodes on and wrapped up his head.  Three layers of glue, now. \n After that, I had trouble getting back to sleep, though Willy fell asleep right away.  I tossed and turned as much as I could on the overly firm, narrow bed.  After an hour, I fell asleep, to wake two hours later and start a long, full day. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/08/video-eeg-an-experience-part-2/", "title": "Video EEG: An Experience\u2014Part 2"},
{"date": "August 22, 2012", "body": "\r\n As you might remember, Willy had a video EEG, which involved an overnight hospital stay.  Before we were released from the hospital during that stressful morning-after period, we were visited by a lead doctor and a string of interns.  This was an event significant in and of itself. \n Now, while the doctors\u2019 interactions were interesting\u2014I always find it rather interesting to watch an experienced doctor teaching a student-doctor\u2014that\u2019s not the point of this post. \n See, Willy started something that added a nice twist to the conversation.  They were focused on his reflexes and his processing time and all the things that might be affected by the three seizures he had while in the hospital, including confusion.  All very important things that added to their understanding of what Willy is experiencing and what they need to do to help him. \n Then, Willy added that twist.  He brought up his imaginary friends, who are all characters from games he plays.  Now, I\u2019m not a psychologist, but I know enough to recognize the area of concern.  When talking to Willy about these imaginary friends, it\u2019s impossible to tell just how \u201creal\u201d he experiences these friendships.  Are they just imaginary friends?  Or are they hallucinations? \n This isn\u2019t the first time someone has tried to answer that question using typical strategies.  It\u2019s not the first time someone has failed, either.  You\u2019ll never know, questioning him as you would a typical child, whether he experiences these friends with a semblance of perceived reality or whether he recognizes that they are fictional. \n Willy is different from me in many ways.  But he\u2019s also similar to me in many ways.  I\u2019m 95% certain these friends are just imaginary friends, not hallucinations\u2014though even I wonder sometimes.  This isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s not room for concern.  I know all too well how vivid these imaginary playmates can be, how vivid their stories can be.  I write fantasy fiction!  That\u2019s not a fluke, people.  My imagination is a powerful, wonderful thing and the inner reality it creates is a very real, and admittedly dangerous, competitor with our shared world. \n But it\u2019s not hallucinations and it\u2019s not mental illness.  It\u2019s something different.  Something wonderful and beautiful, but at the same time terrible and unpredictable. \n After Willy brought up his imaginary friends, talking about them as if they were real and in the room with them, expressing his own concerns about his mortality through his friends, the lead doctor took over the questioning.  I watched silently while the doctor questioned him.  I knew what he was doing.  I knew what he was looking for.  I knew he wouldn\u2019t find it.  I watched Willy, totally at ease discussing his friends, knowing Willy didn\u2019t pick up on how uneasy his vivid imagination made other people. \n Then, after the conversation petered out inconclusively and the lead doctor let the senior intern take over the questioning and testing, I said in a soft voice, meant to be heard but not to gain unnecessary attention, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to know whether they\u2019re hallucinations or not, not like that.\u201d \n The lead doctor looked at me, probably disconcerted by the apparent amusement on my face.  \u201cThey\u2019ve never hurt him nor have they ever told him to do anything, at least nothing that hurts someone else or himself.\u201d \n \u201cHas he been evaluated?\u201d \n I shake my head \u201cno,\u201d because he\u2019s never been officially evaluated.  I shrug.  \u201cHe\u2019s like me.  I\u2019m a writer.  I tell stories.  So does he.\u201d \n The doctor wasn\u2019t satisfied with that explanation or my lack of concern, but I knew I couldn\u2019t explain it to him.  It\u2019s one of those things that seems to differentiate those on the spectrum (or near the spectrum) from those who aren\u2019t.  The only people I have ever met who can fully grasp how \u201creal\u201d I experience stories are people who are on the spectrum (or their parents who are near the spectrum).  Even non-spectrum writers, those who love stories just as much as I do, don\u2019t experience them the way I do or the way Willy does. \n In a way, they are real.  In a way, they are so real they compete with the real world\u2014and sometimes the stories win.  They\u2019re not hallucinations, but they seem to be something fundamentally different from \u201cnormal\u201d experience.  It\u2019s more like a living dream or a deep meditative state.  It\u2019s powerful.  It\u2019s alluring.  And, yes, it\u2019s dangerous.  But it\u2019s also wonderful, magical, and one of the most essential parts of how I experience the world.

{"date": "August 15, 2012", "body": "\r\n We arrived in our room around 1pm, after traversing an ant-farm of hallways and passages, from one hospital to the next.  The room was small, but not too small.  The big hospital bed took center stage, facing a computer with a camera.  Behind a half-circle of curtain that didn\u2019t quite close on both sides, we found a toilet and a sink.  A night-stand with hospital equipment was next to the bed, along with an easy-wash chair and a tray on wheels that could extend over the bed.  On the far wall, there was a long couch that could transform into a high, narrow bed\u2014my center of operations for the next 21 hours. \n A nurse (possibly an NA) came into to check Willy\u2019s vitals, and then the initial placement began.  Lots of little electrodes were glued to Willy\u2019s head and then injected with conductive gel.  A turban of gauze was wrapped around his head of blonde hair.  A team of doctors came in to discuss the symptoms that had brought us to this extreme\u2014one lead doctor with a string of three interns. \n One of the interns was given the lead, with the lead doctor coaching him through the process.  Some of the questions were for Willy.  Some were questions for me.  I tried to follow along as well as I could, but I kept thinking about the toilet and the curtain and the inadequacy of the facilities with a room full of people, most of whom were men.  I needed to go and it became especially urgent before the doctors were finished with their questions.  I couldn\u2019t use the facilities provided in the room while they were standing on the other side of the curtain, so I had to go down the hall, through three sets of double-doors, to find a single bathroom\u2014which was, of course, occupied.  I\u2019d waited too long, and we\u2019ll leave it at that. \n I came back to the room as quickly as I could, which isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds even though I just went  straight .  When I passed through the final set of double-doors, still uncertain that I was in the right hallway, suddenly I knew that I was.  I followed the sounds into Willy\u2019s room. \n The four doctors were bunched in a semi-circle around Willy, who was locked in a brief seizure, struggling to launch himself out of the room, struggling to pull the electrodes from his head.  I came in just in time to lend a hand, and help calm him down afterwards. \n \u201cIs that typical?\u201d \n \u201cWell, usually there\u2019s not nearly so much of a struggle, because we don\u2019t try to stop him unless he tries to go out the door.  But, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much how it goes.\u201d \n I looked at Willy\u2019s face, waxy pale, drained of blood, his lips the same pale color as his face, his eyes dull, bruised with exhaustion. \n Once again the thought flits through my mind:  I\u2019ve known my boys were autistic for a long time.  For the vast majority of that time I\u2019ve had no interest in curing them.  Autism isn\u2019t a disease.  Autism means my boys are different.  They think differently.  They develop differently.  And that\u2019s just fine.  I want them all to talk and I want them all to learn and I want them all to be able to strive to achieve their goals.  But I don\u2019t want to \u201cfix\u201d them, because they\u2019re not broken. \n Seizures are different.  This isn\u2019t right.  This isn\u2019t just about being different.  Something is going wrong in my son\u2019s brain.  It\u2019s hurting him.  It\u2019s wearing him out.  It\u2019s taking my bright, sun-shiny boy and turning him into a pale ghost afraid for when the wrongness strikes again. \n Was it a short time or a long time later?  Was it the lead doctor with the string of interns or the head doctor who was in charge of the lead doctor?  I don\u2019t know.  I was comforting my boy, settling him into sleep.  I focused in on my son at the exclusion of almost everything else.  But then, there were the words. \n \u201cI caught it.  I saw the EEG.  It\u2019s definitely seizures.\u201d \n This I already knew, even if they didn\u2019t have proof.  \u201cIs it epilepsy?\u201d \n \u201cYes.\u201d \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/08/video-eeg-an-experience-part-1/", "title": "Video EEG: An Experience\u2014Part 1"},

{"date": "August 20, 2012", "body": "\r\n So, I woke up at 5:20am on Friday morning.  Luckily, Willy still slept.  I poked my head out of the room, called for a nurse, who came in to watch Willy while I had a cigarette.  Ah, nicotine addiction.  It sucks, but I haven\u2019t been able to kick the habit yet. \n Willy woke up some time after I returned, and had a breakfast of an apple and milk (which I ordered for him from room service) and carrots (which I\u2019d brought with me).  Everyone commented about how healthy he ate.  As for me, I had brought a yogurt drink and smoothie, and I drank both up, wishing I could get some protein into Willy in the mornings, but that\u2019s just not going to happen. \n By 7am, I needed another cigarette and the doctor wasn\u2019t expected for another hour.  I went through the warren of hallways and such, and for the first time I didn\u2019t get lost on the way there or on the way back.  Nice!  When I got back to Willy\u2019s room at 7:20am, the doctor was waiting.  Oops! \n Oh, well.  He repeated everything we\u2019d talked about, filling in a few blanks, and made sure I knew the plan of action we\u2019d be following over the next few weeks.  He also told me it\u2019d take about two weeks before he could produce the full results of the EEG.  Then, he said that we needed to give Willy his morning pill, get the gunk out of his hair, get checked out the by lead doctor and the string of interns, and then the nurse would discharge us.  \u201cYou\u2019ll be going home soon,\u201d he said to Willy. \n And here is my one point of criticism:  \u201cSoon\u201d is a very bad word to use with a literally-minded person.  See, as an adult, I know \u201csoon\u201d is relative.  But even I struggle with the misuse of \u201csoon.\u201d  Willy is not an adult and he struggles to reign in his overly-literal thinking when interacting with less-literal people.  See, to Willy, \u201csoon\u201d means in a few seconds\u2014a few minutes at most.  An hour cannot be \u201csoon,\u201d no matter the relativity of one hour compared to 24.  No, an hour is definitely not \u201csoon,\u201d and it is most certainly not \u201csoon\u201d when it\u2019s for something\u2014like going home\u2014that you\u2019ve been begging for. \n So, while Willy clung to the word \u201csoon,\u201d getting more and more upset as \u201csoon\u201d seemed to get further and further away, I clung to the list of tasks that needed to be completed.  Doctor and string of interns came in and did their thing.  Check.  Technician came in to remove electrodes and started the process of cleaning the glue from Willy\u2019s hair.  Check.   Finally , the nurse came in to administer medication.  Check.  So, we get to be discharged now, right?  After all, Willy had been weepy and whiny for the last hour and a half, waiting for \u201csoon\u201d to be \u201cnow.\u201d  So, now that we\u2019ve completed the checklist, do we get to go? \n Ah, no.  See, the pharmacist needs to come.  Why?  To tell you about the medication.  But the doctor already told us about the medication\u2014twice.  Once the nurse gives us our discharge papers, we\u2019ll have a paper record of the details about the medication.  But, the pharmacist has to come to tell us about the medication.  Okay, fine\u2014when?  It\u2019s hard to say. \n So, for the hour and a half Willy was miserably awaiting \u201csoon\u201d and I was the rock, calming him down.  Then, after this, Willy gets calm and I start to melt down.  I\u2019m trapped in a tiny hospital room (see how it\u2019s shrunk from \u201csmall\u201d to \u201ctiny\u201d) with a child who just wants to go home, we\u2019ve done everything we were told we had to do, we\u2019re packed and ready, and now we\u2019re waiting for someone who has never met my son to tell me about the medication the doctor prescribed, who had already explained the medication and the plan of action and had not only met my son but had been treating him all night long and the medication had already been started and what the hell was this guy supposed to know that  the doctor  didn\u2019t!  So, we waited another half hour for nothing.  Repetition\u2014unnecessary repetition. \n I felt like a dog on a chain that was too short and too tight, straining, straining, straining to be free.  Trapped in a box.  I needed to get OUT!!! \n It\u2019s not entirely reasonable.  I know that.  I do.  But do NOT use \u201csoon\u201d with a child with autism, when it means something totally different to you than it does to him.  It\u2019s not reassuring.  It\u2019s frustrating.  And do NOT give a to do list to someone who relies on them to function, only to add things to the list at the last moment after having dealt with an hour and a half of false \u201csoons.\u201d \n It\u2019s badness.  That\u2019s all I can say. \n Luckily, the nurse picked up on the fact that this whole pharmacist thing wasn\u2019t going over well, so once the pharmacist actually arrived she began the discharge stuff, so when the pharmacist left she was walking towards me with the discharge papers the very moment I stuck my head out of the room.  Freedom at last! \n We arrived home 23 hours after we\u2019d left.  And my day had just begun, because my brother had arrived the night before and the time I would get to spend with him before he headed to his new New York graduate school was short and precious and worth every little bit of exhaustion I would experience over the next week. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/08/video-eeg-an-experience-part-3/", "title": "Video EEG: An Experience\u2014Part 3"},

{"date": "August 24, 2012", "body": "\r\n Before I move on from the rather momentous experience of the video EEG, we need to talk about glue.  See, a 24-hour video EEG involves gluing electrodes onto the person\u2019s head.  And then, when the person tears off those electrodes during a seizure, there\u2019s more glue.  Willy had three layers of glue on his head.  Cleaning it off wasn\u2019t easy. \n So, here\u2019s a quick how-to lesson: \n \n If it is at all possible to buzz the child\u2019s head, even if that\u2019s not a style you\u2019d prefer, before the video EEG, then do it. It\u2019ll be worth it! I know, because we didn\u2019t. \n If it is at all possible to convince the child to leave the electrodes on, do it. I suspect multiple layers of glue are worse than a single layer of glue. \n Before you start to clean the glue out of the child\u2019s hair, assuming you failed in step 1 and step 2, be sure to have a comb or combs of varying fineness. This refers to how close together the teeth are. \n If the staff haven\u2019t already done so, start by getting your child\u2019s hair wet with a little bit of water and a lot of baby shampoo\u2014the kind that loosens tangles without tears. \n Then, without washing out the shampoo, comb a small section of your child\u2019s hair close to the scalp with the widest-tooth comb. You do this to pull up the glue \u201cscabs\u201d from your child\u2019s scalp. \n The \u201cscabs\u201d will fall apart as you comb them out. Get as much out of your child\u2019s hair as you can with the wide-toothed comb, rinsing the glue from the comb frequently. \n Then, use the narrower-toothed comb, again rinsing the glue from the comb frequently. \n Repeat these steps all around the head until you stop getting glue up with the comb. This will take at least a half an hour, probably longer. \n Then, rinse out the baby shampoo thoroughly. You\u2019ll see even more flecks of glue. \n Then, starting with wet hair, wash (or have your child wash) the hair as normal. \n \n It\u2019s a lot of work getting the glue out, but you don\u2019t want to leave it in to re-dry\u2014because that\u2019s even worse. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/08/eegs-and-glue-in-hair/", "title": "EEGs and Glue in Hair"},
{"date": "August 27, 2012", "body": "\r\n So, I\u2019ve devoted quite a few posts to the video EEG.  This is the last one, though it\u2019s less about the EEG and more about the consequences. \n It may seems hypocritical, considering that I\u2019ve so adamantly resisted medicating the boys for their autism, but my main hope throughout this process was getting a medication that could reduce or eliminate Willy\u2019s seizures.  You see, autism and epilepsy is not the same thing at all.  In my experience, medication for people with autism is usually recommended because autistic behaviors impact the lives of others in ways they perceive to be negative.  (There are certainly exceptions to this.)  When it comes to epilepsy, however, the medication is recommended to address a medical condition that impacts the quality of life of the person experiencing the seizures.  In my opinion, that is the purpose of medication:  Medication should help the person who is taking it, not help other people \u201cmanage\u201d the person who is taking it.  Of course, there are exceptions to this, too, especially in the case of severe mental illness in which the person becomes a danger to themselves or others, but again, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about here. \n My point is this:  My goal was to get a prescription for medication that would reduce or eliminate Willy\u2019s seizures, so he could get back to his own normal.  I\u2019m happy to say that the doctor\u2019s first try was something of a success.  The first medication works well, though not completely, and the side-effects have thus far been minimal.  Not only have we gone from 3 to six seizures a day to 3 or 4 seizures a week, but Willy\u2019s tiredness and moodiness have dramatically decreased as well.  There\u2019s still some fine-tuning to do, and it might require an increase in the amount of medication he takes, but we\u2019re making good progress. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/08/medicinal-improvements/", "title": "Medicinal Improvements"},

{"date": "May 14, 2012", "body": "\r\n I\u2019m not very good at developing predictable, reliable schedules for myself.\u00a0 Too much of my life (and my sleep) is influx to make that a practical solution for me.\u00a0 That, in itself, isn\u2019t the problem.\u00a0 I mean, it causes some problems, but not the problems I want to talk about. \n Because, you see, I do make schedules for myself.\u00a0 They vary from day to day and are often less dependent on time and more dependent on accomplishment.\u00a0 I like to break down whole tasks into parts.\u00a0 For example, a post is three steps: 1) write the post, 2) polish the post, and 3) post the post online.\u00a0 I schedule each step separately, but in order, with the others.\u00a0 I like to finish one step before I\u2019m interrupted by something else, unless I have a need to multitask, in which case I still complete one task before I move on to another task in the same set, which may occur at a different point than when I complete one task in a different set. \n Of course, if I have something scheduled for a specific time (or even a general time) I work on my lists of accomplishment-based tasks until they push up against the time constraint, and then I switch gears.\u00a0 Ideally, I will complete any accomplishment-based tasks I\u2019ve started before switching gears, and I\u2019ll avoid starting new tasks if I don\u2019t think I have time to complete them. \n Most of my days are broken down in a series of tasks, separated into sets, completed as I am able, but in order.\u00a0 What doesn\u2019t get done today is moved to tomorrow or one of the upcoming days.\u00a0 When the workload gets to be too much, I take time off to play\u2014or to decompress, as the case may be, since sometimes playing is more work than I can handle.\u00a0 And, lately, I\u2019ve been scheduling in more decompression time into each day. \n But, all of this is just the setup.\u00a0 The point is I am busy.\u00a0 There are few times in any given day when I\u2019m not doing something.\u00a0 This is a problem, because there are inevitable demands on my time that are not scheduled.\u00a0 These demands are often perceived (by me) as interruptions and I don\u2019t like interruptions. \n For example, I\u2019m in the middle of a set of business tasks and I take a bathroom break.\u00a0 If the boys are home, then I am almost always accosted by one or more of the children as soon as I come upstairs.\u00a0 Not only does this interfere with my ability to get to the bathroom, I perceive this as an interruption.\u00a0 Interruptions make me surly and of a sour temper.\u00a0 Yet, at least in theory, spending time with my kids and being available for my kids is a high priority in my life. \n Dissonance ensues. \n Again, my days are full of tasks.\u00a0 There is little time set aside for not doing, because there are few days when I get through all of my tasks and have time left over.\u00a0 It has been weeks (maybe months) since I\u2019ve had time left over.\u00a0 This is because, in part, my business is doing better, so that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 As our country slowly recovers (sort of) my family\u2019s economic situation slowly improves.\u00a0 All to the good. \n Yet, this has also been a time of many demands on my time, some of which are unexpected and unplanned.\u00a0 My mom is in the process of buying a house, so instead of coming over and doing respite as per usual, she stays home to clean and pack.\u00a0 That\u2019s fine, at least in theory, but when this happens without forewarning, when I arrive home at 8pm from a much needed shopping trip (groceries and the like, not \u201ctherapy\u201d) to discover that the rest of my night is going to be spent performing unexpected tasks in a rush to get the boys ready for bed, that\u2019s kind of a problem.\u00a0 Not only do I have new things to add to my lists of tasks, not only do I have more incomplete tasks that were already on my lists, but I\u2019m out of sorts with myself.\u00a0 The resulting stress means I am able to do even less of my original set of tasks than I would have been able to do with only the energy spent on the new tasks.\u00a0 Plus, the boys get to bed late, because I started the new series of tasks later than I should have and would have done, had I but known that I would have been doing them. \n Now, it\u2019s not that my mom\u2019s decision to stay home and work on her own things was at all unreasonable.\u00a0 It\u2019s not even unreasonable that she, thinking that she\u2019d be able to do both, postponed her decision until after I had gone to the store.\u00a0 After all, there was no way for her to know I would be going to the store, because I didn\u2019t even know when I was going to the store.\u00a0 Again, those decisions are often based more on my rate of task-completion, not a specific time.\u00a0 So, the point isn\u2019t that my mom did this thing that set my evening off in the wrong direction, the point is that such a change  sends my evening off in the wrong direction .\u00a0 And the busier I get, the worse the stress effects me. \n Another example is when Brandon, who is more active outside the house than his brothers, interrupts my work to ask for a ride.\u00a0 Suddenly, I\u2019m on the spot to do something that I wasn\u2019t expecting.\u00a0 Now, again, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to give Brandon a ride.\u00a0 It\u2019s that 1) I didn\u2019t know I was going to be called upon to give him a ride and 2) I had no warning of when I was supposed to fit this into my schedule.\u00a0 Brandon is getting better at this, and he\u2019s now letting me know at least a few hours in advance that a ride will be requested and providing me with an estimated time.\u00a0 When he knows in advance, he\u2019ll even inform me in the morning or the day before, which is very much appreciated. \n But, again, the point isn\u2019t that these interruptions and unexpected changes happen\u2014they\u2019re going to happen, as last week with Ben proved, even if everyone in my daily life does everything possible to prevent it from happening.\u00a0 Things change.\u00a0 The unexpected arises.\u00a0 I will be interrupted.\u00a0 And, in theory, I\u2019m okay with that.\u00a0 The point is that it has an unfortunate effect on me and that effect is getting worse and I don\u2019t like it.\u00a0 The effect,  my reaction , causes dissonance (which also makes it worse), because the reaction is inconsistent with my values. \n Any ideas on how to solve this that doesn\u2019t involve getting less busy (because that\u2019s not likely any time soon)? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "August 31, 2012", "body": "\r\n He knew what it was as soon as he saw it.  He knew it was his.  It was even red! \n As some of you may know, Alex is a sensitive little guy.  By sensitive, I mean he\u2019s sensitive to sensory stimulation most people can process with ease.  It\u2019s hard to pin him down to hypo- or hyper-sensitive.  He\u2019s seems to vacillate between the two at his own discretion.  But one thing is consistent, he\u2019s extra-sensitive to sound.  Everyday sounds are too much for him to bear.  One way he copes is by producing his own sound-canceling noises at high volumes, which is hard on everyone else. \n We recently had a home visit with the autism coordinator in charge of the boys\u2019 waiver funds.  (Wisconsin\u2019s solution to the financial \u201cburden\u201d of providing services to children with autism was to create an autism waiver that provides a limited number of years of intensive in-home therapy, followed by a slightly less expensive bundle of money managed by a social worker for services and equipment to help the family develop a post-intensive program tailored to their child(ren).  All three of my boys have \u201cgone post,\u201d meaning they\u2019ve graduated from the intensive in-home whether they\u2019re ready or not.)

It was a red pair of sound-dampening headphones. \n Alex took the offering and put it on right away.  He smiled.  Not the over-anxious smile of happy over-stimulation (his norm throughout the summer), but a contented smile of  peace .  He even wore his glasses for a significantly longer duration when paired with the headphones (which helped keep the glasses on without the strap). \n I could see it on his face.  This was what he\u2019d been missing since school had ended.  This was what he needed.  Sweet relief!  A break from the overwhelming sound of life going on around him.  Quiet.

{"date": "July 11, 2012", "body": "\r\n There\u2019s no use denying that parenting a child is stressful.\u00a0 Nor is there any use in denying that parenting a child with special needs is exceptionally stressful.\u00a0 Of course, some of that stress could be avoided by living in a more understanding society\u2014at least, in theory it could be.\u00a0 But some of that stress is unavoidable. \n First, there is stress in meeting an immediate special need.\u00a0 For example, helping Willy cope with the immediate needs brought on by his having seizures has been enormously stressful.\u00a0 Of course, all parents experience the stress of meeting their children\u2019s immediate needs.\u00a0 Parents of children with special needs experience more stress, because there are more needs, and often the needs are exceptional\u2014meaning we usually don\u2019t have readily available access to the experiences that would train us to deal with those needs. \n Here I must point out that I am using \u201cspecial needs\u201d more loosely than the term is traditionally used.\u00a0 Traditionally, \u201cspecial needs\u201d is synonymous with disability, but if you think about it there are many \u201cspecial needs\u201d that have nothing to do with disability.\u00a0 For example, a child who has been abused or physically traumatized in an accident has special needs.\u00a0 A child who has experienced an emotional trauma, like the loss of a parent, has special needs, too.\u00a0 These kinds of special needs can, of course, overlap with the special needs of those who have disabilities.\u00a0 The point is, as we acknowledge our own stress, it is also important to acknowledge that other parents can have very similar (in quantity and severity) demands placed on them due to very different circumstances. \n Second, there is stress in advocating for your child.\u00a0 While, in theory, the need to advocate could be avoided by living in a more understanding society, the only way we\u2019re going to get a more understanding society is by advocating for our children (and later with them).\u00a0 So, considering the times in which we live, advocacy is unavoidable.\u00a0 We advocate for appropriate medical care.\u00a0 We advocate for appropriate education services.\u00a0 We advocate for appropriate supports.\u00a0 We advocate for appropriate opportunities.\u00a0 We even, upon occasion, have to advocate for appropriate recreation.\u00a0 Advocating is stressful whether our advocacy work is on a small scale, concerning our own child and our own situation, or on a larger scale, concerning many children in our local, regional, national, or international community. \n Third, there is stress in meeting auxiliary and fall-out needs.\u00a0 Having a special need creates an immediate need.\u00a0 Again, I will use the example of Willy\u2019s seizures.\u00a0 He has a need for medical or neurological stability.\u00a0 We have a need for answers as to how to attain this medical or neurological stability.\u00a0 But there are also auxiliary needs.\u00a0 For example, we have to answer the question: \u201cHow do we support Willy\u2019s medical needs at home?\u201d\u00a0 And, by the end of the summer, we\u2019ll also have to answer the question: \u201cHow do we support Willy\u2019s medical needs at school?\u201d\u00a0 There are also fall-out needs.\u00a0 For example, \u201cHow do we cope with Willy\u2019s increased anxiety?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHow do we provide Willy with emotional support?\u201d\u00a0 All these needs add to the stress. \n Fourth, there is stress to meet on-going needs.\u00a0 In my case, I have a household of six (including myself) to manage.\u00a0 Luckily, I don\u2019t do that alone.\u00a0 But the point is that Willy and all his brothers, along with my husband and myself, all have on-going needs that don\u2019t cease to exist because a new special need has arisen.\u00a0 Meeting these needs was stressful before, and it continues to be stressful now.\u00a0 In fact, with each new demand, the stress of meeting previous demands increases, because there are fewer resources to devote to those demands. \n Fifth, there is stress to \u201ccatch-up\u201d at home.\u00a0 This may seem minor in comparison, but when you\u2019re so busy meeting new needs and ongoing needs and advocacy needs and auxiliary needs and fall-out needs, only to find that when you want something to eat your fridge looks rather bare and your cupboards aren\u2019t much better, then the weight of household needs can seem pretty heavy.\u00a0 In any American household, there is a need to restock or shop, to clean, to pay bills, and the like.\u00a0 These needs don\u2019t go away just because you have too much on your plate.\u00a0 The more you put them off, the more pressing they become, and the need to satisfy these needs can be its own stressor.\u00a0 (Of course, I can\u2019t imagine this stress fairly compares with the stress of having to grow one\u2019s own food, make one\u2019s own soap, and perform all the household tasks with fewer tools and less resources, as many people still have to do, so it\u2019s all relative.) \n Sixth, there is stress to \u201ccatch-up\u201d at work.\u00a0 Whether you make it to work or not, you\u2019re not going to be at your best when a new need arises.\u00a0 In my case, I have some choices, but I also have contracts.\u00a0 Besides, any job that requires a high degree of concentration is going to be negatively impacted by a new special need, because it is more difficult to concentrate on work when you\u2019re facing a new, unknown special need at home.\u00a0 It is also stressful to try to catch-up with all the tasks that you\u2019ve neglected. \n Seventh, there is stress to maintain relationships.\u00a0 People aren\u2019t just a parcel of needs that need to be met, though sometimes it can seem like it.\u00a0 At the core, we are a series of interconnected relationships, and those relationships need to be nurtured and maintained.\u00a0 Performing these tasks well can help alleviate stress, but the need to perform them when under extreme pressure is another stressor\u2014one that, unfortunately, tends to be neglected, which risks pushing those relationships to their breaking points. \n Eighth, there is stress to help others with their own stress.\u00a0 As the parent, you have the responsibility (which you may share with a spouse or a significant other) to help others in your household and extended network of family and friends deal with their own stress.\u00a0 Ideally, this goes both ways, but it doesn\u2019t always seem like it. \n This obviously isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, but I think I\u2019ve covered all the major general categories.\u00a0 (Feel free to add to the list in the comments.)\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of stress.\u00a0 Somehow we need to learn how to deal with it.\u00a0 I\u2019m still trying. \n ",

\n Now, I must nominate 15 other bloggers for this award: \n \n Aspergirl Maybe  \u2013 because she\u2019s still \u201cnew\u201d and deserves the love. \n AutismHerd  \u2013 (without the autism now), who is really funny and fun and just all around terrific! \n Autism and Empathy  \u2013 because I know durned well that the whole \u201cautistics don\u2019t have empathy\u201d is a big fat  lie  myth (with another nod to Kathleen). \n Kate Hutchinson  \u2013 with another apology for bringing controversy to her blog. \n Delightfully Different Life  \u2013 with a recommendation to find and buy her novel! \n Countering\u2026  \u2013 for those\u00a0 who like science or controversy, or both. \n Aspitude!  \u2013 because Elesia is just awesome! \n Rolling Around In My Head  \u2013 because Dave is a great person to help open your mind beyond any one disability or difference. \n The Tumultuous Truth  \u2013 because Sharon\u2019s passion is inspiring even when you\u2019re already inspired. \n Life with Asperger\u2019s  \u2013 because Gavin is a great source of information and a great person to help you see Asperger\u2019s from both sides. \n Special Needs Book Review  \u2013 because it\u2019s new to me and sounds like a great idea! \n Whitterer on Autism  \u2013 because it really shouldn\u2019t be so low in my blog list and because Maddy is wonderful and fun and definitely deserves the love! \n A Diary of a Goldfish  \u2013 for all she does for the online disabilities community. \n Sanabitur Anima Mea  \u2013 because she cares so much about so many things (just don\u2019t ask me to pronounce her blog, but I am pretty sure it\u2019s Latin, if that helps). \n And finally,  Meeka\u2019s Mind , because sometimes we just need something totally different! \n \n Now, apparently, the Versatile Blogger award is a real award with its own page and stuff, and you can  learn more about it here !\u00a0 The things you learn\u2026 \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://faithfulmomof9.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/i-have-been-nominatedawarded-the-verstile-blogger-award/", "http://aspergirlmaybe.wordpress.com/", "http://autismherd.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismandempathy.com/", "http://poetkatehutchinson.wordpress.com/", "http://dswalkerauthor.com/", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/", "http://aspitude.blogspot.com/", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/", "http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/", "http://life-with-aspergers.blogspot.com/", "http://www.specialneedsbookreview.com/", "http://whittereronautism.com/", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/", "http://sanabituranima.wordpress.com/", "http://acflory.wordpress.com/", "http://versatilebloggeraward.wordpress.com/vba-rules/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/08/the-versatile-blogger-award/", "title": "The Versatile Blogger Award!!"},

(I\u2019m not so good with going places I\u2019ve never been before.)  When the neurologist came in, the first thing out of Will\u2019s mouth was \u201cWhat language are you speaking?\u201d  To which the neurologist replied good-humoredly, \u201cEnglish,\u201d in a rather pronounced Asian accent.  I admit I cringed with that one. \n His accent, however, did not impede our ability to communicate with one another, and the appointment proceeded at a rather rapid pace, with me providing information that was (for the most part) already in the questionnaire that I\u2019d filled out, which he didn\u2019t take until the end of the appointment. \n The sum result of the visit is that he can\u2019t diagnose Will yet.  This is where the disappointment comes in.  However, the reason is because he doesn\u2019t have enough hard data, which is what impressed me.  I guess I\u2019ve just spent too much time listening to psychologists, for whom behavioral data is THE data, so I\u2019m not used to actually needing conclusive tests. \n And so the long story short is that the first EEG was not conclusive.  The neurologist is not satisfied that epilepsy has been ruled out, though he did talk about the possibility of \u201cfrontal lobe seizures\u201d without explaining the implications\u2014he wants to know what we\u2019re dealing with before he leads me down any rabbit holes (my phrasing, not his). \n So, we\u2019re going back tomorrow to have a video EEG which may require an overnight stay.  The goal, once again, is to actually record a seizure event and we\u2019re going to stay until we do even if it means staying overnight, which Will and I would rather not do for a whole host of reasons. \n Wish us luck! \n \u00a0 \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/08/eeg-round-2/", "title": "EEG: Round 2"},

But membership\u2014that commitment\u2014isn\u2019t the only form of participation.  Still, it\u2019s difficult to know which organizations are worthy of becoming an ally and which organizations are too vested in their own self interest that they act at the expense of the causes they proclaim to support, the causes that are their public reason for existence. \n So, which autism organizations do you support and why?  How do you show that support? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/07/autism-organizations-which-ones-do-you-trust/", "title": "Autism Organizations:  Which Ones Do You Trust?"},

\n 1) Come prepared. \n In this contemporary age of on-the-go moms and dads, we\u2019re all probably familiar with the diaper bag.\u00a0 You can even get chic diaper bags that don\u2019t look like diaper bags, unless of course you\u2019re familiar with chic diaper bags.\u00a0 We learned to pack diapers, wipes, bottles, formula, a change of clothes, a sippy cup of juice, or whatever.\u00a0 We might pack a blanket, sun screen, hat or other weather-appropriate extras.\u00a0 We usually stuff in various forms of snacks and toys, or other distractions. \n With an autistic child, you might need all of that or not, depending on their age and development, but you\u2019ll also need some other items.\u00a0 In particular, you should bring sensory-friendly or sensory-soothing items that help a dysregulated child get regulated, or at least stay within the bounds of self-control.\u00a0 Chewies are good for this, at least for my boys, and colorful fiddles with different textures.\u00a0 A set of sound-dampening headphones if you\u2019ve got them. \n Unlike when my kids were little, now we have the added advantage of iPods, iPhones, iPads, Kindle Fires and similar technologies which can act as an escape mechanism\u2014a set of comfortable headphones or ear buds and you\u2019re just about golden. \n 2) Keep it short. \n Sure, you\u2019re busy, and you want to get as much as you can so you don\u2019t have to come back later in the week.\u00a0 It\u2019s a strong urge, but you  must  resist.\u00a0 Keep your list short.\u00a0 Get what you need, what can\u2019t wait, and get out.\u00a0 Really.\u00a0 Trust me.\u00a0 It\u2019s not worth it to wander around leisurely and pick up anything you might like, no matter how much you might enjoy the experience.\u00a0 The meltdown\u2019s a-comin\u2019. \n 3) Practice that look. \n People will offer unsolicited commentary and advice.\u00a0 People will criticize you, harass you or your child, make disparaging remarks.\u00a0 Foster a facial expression that will stave them off and keep it handy.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s a slight tilting of the head and a raised eye brow, with a firm mouth and a slight flaring of the nostrils.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been told by those who it wasn\u2019t directed at, \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d\u00a0 But those who it is directed at know.\u00a0 They see it.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a form of challenge.\u00a0 Most people back down. \n 4) Prepare a statement. \n Perhaps you want to take the opportunity to educate people in your community.\u00a0 Perhaps you want to tell them to mind their own business and move on as quickly as possible.\u00a0 The look will stave off a lot of comments and questions, but it won\u2019t catch them all.\u00a0 Have a statement ready.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t, you might freeze or say something you regret.\u00a0 You don\u2019t want to be forced into a position where you find yourself apologizing for your child.\u00a0 Being autistic is nothing your child did wrong.\u00a0 You\u2019re not wrong for taking your child into a store.\u00a0 You have just as much right to be there as anyone else, both of you, and you can\u2019t ever forget that.\u00a0 Your child  is  listening. \n 5) Be prepared to drop everything and leave. \n Sure, you\u2019re only here because you have to be.\u00a0 Sure, you came because you need something and you really don\u2019t want to leave without it (or without paying for it).\u00a0 But it might happen (not the without paying for it part, please; that will cause problems and those bleeping things won\u2019t help your child).\u00a0 Your child may be more dysregulated than you think.\u00a0 Things can spiral out of control pretty fast sometimes.\u00a0 It happens.\u00a0 No matter how prepared you are, no matter how much you think you have things under control, sometimes things will be suddenly very much out of control before you can even take a breath, let alone prevent it. \n Be prepared to pick your child up and your bag/purse and get out of there.\u00a0 Leave the cart, the merchandise, and everything else for the staff to take care of (they get paid for it).\u00a0 If things get out of control, don\u2019t try to force yourself to finish.\u00a0 Just get out of there.\u00a0 It\u2019s not worth it. \n Shopping with an autistic child can be a wonderful experience, but it has to be the right time, the right mood, the right regulation, and the right store.\u00a0 Otherwise, it can be hell, but you can survive it with you and your child and your personhoods intact. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/03/how-togo-shopping-with-an-autistic-child/", "title": "How to\u2026Go Shopping with an Autistic Child"},

\n I held my son, murmuring to him.\u00a0 Moments passed.\u00a0 Minutes probably.\u00a0 My mom was there.\u00a0 My brother was there.\u00a0 The phone, the voice on the other end.\u00a0 The rational part of my brain reacted in a helpful manner somehow.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember.\u00a0 That other, larger part of my brain was focused entirely on my son as he slowly recovered, slowly regained control of his limbs, slowly got his words back. \n The next rational thought I had was seeing a stranger\u2019s head pop up over the ledge, wearing a fireman\u2019s jacket.\u00a0 There were questions.\u00a0 I answered them.\u00a0 I told them we needed to get him down, but he didn\u2019t have enough control to come down safely on his own.\u00a0 My head throbbed now and the dizziness was there\u2014muted, though, as if at the edge of awareness, as if, with the adrenaline and instinct, I\u2019d managed to push my own hurt to the back of my brain, suppress it, force it\u2019s gnawing claws down just enough so I could function.\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t trust myself to carry my son down the ladder. \n Then, things started to spin.\u00a0 I felt like I would fall over, like I would vomit, like my head would burst like a melon in the microwave\u2014but I couldn\u2019t let that happen.\u00a0 There was waiting involved, until Willy had regained enough control to climb down with the help of the professionals.\u00a0 EMTs.\u00a0 Tests.\u00a0 Low oxygen.\u00a0 Tubing in his nose to give him more oxygen.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want it.\u00a0 He had to have it.\u00a0 Ambulance.\u00a0 Hospital.\u00a0 \u201cYou have to go Willy!\u201d\u00a0 But he didn\u2019t want to.\u00a0 But he had to.\u00a0 \u201cThis isn\u2019t a choice.\u201d\u00a0 The EMTs don\u2019t have an ambulance.\u00a0 It\u2019s on its way.\u00a0 Helicopter on standby.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to keep it on standby.\u00a0 I sway where I stand.\u00a0 I find myself sitting.\u00a0 I sway where I sit.\u00a0 Questions swirl around me.\u00a0 I answer them.\u00a0 At least, I think so.\u00a0 I think I explain about the fugue episodes.\u00a0 We\u2019re from Wisconsin.\u00a0 We just arrived.\u00a0 Altitude sickness. \n Then, somewhere in those minutes of confusion, the ambulance arrived. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/07/grand-mal-part-1/", "title": "Grand Mal\u2014Part 1"},
{"date": "July 6, 2012", "body": "\r\n Willy chose sooner, rather than later.\u00a0 So, he went to bed right around his usual time.\u00a0 Four hours later, I woke him up.\u00a0 The three primary pre-EEG conditions were 1) four hours of sleep maximum, 2) no caffeine, and 3) clean hair. \n The EEG wasn\u2019t scheduled until 10 am the next day, so those eight hours of forced wakefulness were pretty rough.\u00a0 Willy kept trying to go to sleep on me, but I couldn\u2019t let him.\u00a0 Willy told me he didn\u2019t want an EEG after all, but that wasn\u2019t a choice.\u00a0 He said he wanted to heal his seizures all by himself and I told him \u201cThat would be wonderful, but we don\u2019t know how.\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cWell, I wish I had magic, then.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou know, so do I.\u201d\u00a0 He folded his arms across his chest, harrumphed at me, and flounced away. \n At this point he was more grumpy than anxious, which was something of an improvement.\u00a0 At his doctor\u2019s appointment, I\u2019d used the pain chart to ask him how anxious he was. \n \n He chose number 9.\u00a0 He was scared that the doctor was going to send him to the emergency room and that he would die there.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure where this came from, since his own emergency room visit went relatively well.\u00a0 We reassured him, of course.\u00a0 I did.\u00a0 The nurse did.\u00a0 The doctor did.\u00a0 But Willy was unconvinced.\u00a0 I drove him by the hospital the next day, showing him the big hospital and the (relatively) small emergency room wing, and showing that we\u2019d be going to the big hospital for his EEG.\u00a0 I found a YouTube video of an EEG and we watched it together.\u00a0 We talked about seizures and EEGs.\u00a0 All told, these efforts reduced his anxiety from a 9 to a 7.\u00a0 Being sleepy and grumpy trumped anxiety and brought him down to a 5. \n Seven and a half hours of grumpiness later, it was time to go.\u00a0 We drove to the hospital, avoiding the entrance that shows the big red EMERGENCY ROOM sign.\u00a0 When Willy got inside, he was in hypersocial mode, trying to introduce himself and chat up everyone in the waiting room.\u00a0 I had to caution him against stepping in front of people who were in a rush to actually get some place, but otherwise I tried to let him do what he needed to do to make himself feel better. \n The best part was when Willy introduced himself to two gentlemen who were talking in the lobby.\u00a0 I knew who they were\u2014rather, I knew what their function was\u2014but Willy had no clue.\u00a0 So, when the receptionist asked one of them to take us up to the next waiting room, Willy was shocked (imagine a cartoon-style performance, with bug eyes and dramatic gestures) and said, \u201cI just met you!\u201d\u00a0 So, we explained that the gentleman was a volunteer who made sure people got where they needed to get when they needed medical care.\u00a0 That eased Willy\u2019s anxiety quite a bit. \n Then, of course, there was the waiting in the waiting room, and that\u2019s never good.\u00a0 But finally, we got to the appropriate room, met the very nice and understanding sleep technician, and spent quite awhile getting Willy hooked up.\u00a0 Getting him hooked up took longer than the actual EEG.\u00a0 Even getting him unhooked took longer than the EEG, but the hooking up took longest of all. \n She started with a wax pencil and a tape measure, making marks in the shape of plus signs to indicate where the electrodes should go.\u00a0 Then she \u201cerased\u201d the center of each plus sign using an exfoliant, which she called a \u201cscrubber\u201d for Willy\u2019s benefit.\u00a0 Then, she gooped up the electrodes and stuck them on, placing a bit of cotton over them to hold them in place.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t count how many wires she used, but there were lots of them.\u00a0 Finally, after all the electrodes were in place, we were ready to go.\u00a0 She dimmed the lights. \n There was a lot of closing and opening of the eyes, without strobes, then with strobe lights, then with progressively more \u201caggressive\u201d strobe lights.\u00a0 (I don\u2019t react to strobe lights, but even I felt they were aggressive.)\u00a0 Willy had a hard time complying.\u00a0 At first, it wasn\u2019t a problem, but towards the end of the strobe light session he wouldn\u2019t keep his eyes open because \u201cit\u2019s messing with my brain.\u201d\u00a0 Willy was not at all comfortable with the idea of actively triggering a seizure, even with the technician and me right there with him.\u00a0 Later, when it was time to try to sleep while hooked up to the EEG wires, Willy was especially uncooperative.\u00a0 He feigned sleep, but he resisted actually letting himself sleep.\u00a0 Even afterwards, he wouldn\u2019t let himself sleep.\u00a0 So, I can\u2019t help but thing that, whether it\u2019s conscious or not, Willy has some self-defense mechanisms against triggering seizures. \n So, I\u2019m not sure how productive the whole thing was.\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping they could see enough to tell if they had found what they were looking for even though they did not trigger a seizure, but the technician wasn\u2019t allowed to indicate the relative success of the EEG. \n However, a little birdie did confirm that the minor fugue episodes we\u2019d been seeing were examples of seizure activity.\u00a0 After the grand mal, I\u2019d been working under that assumption\u2014not that there\u2019s anything I can do about it at this point\u2014but the birdie confirmed it.\u00a0 Like the technician, however, the birdie is not a neurologist, so it\u2019s a birdie, because birdies can\u2019t get in trouble for passing along information that\u2019s above their pay grade, I mean medical qualifications.\u00a0 Still, I trust the birdie. \n Now that this part is over, Willy\u2019s a lot less anxious, even though nothing has actually been resolved.\u00a0 He\u2019s still clinging to both Mark and I and he still needs a lot of emotional support, but his anxiety levels aren\u2019t hovering around 9 anymore.\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s back to the waiting and the hoping that there will be answers that give us the power to do something. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "July 4, 2012", "body": "\r\n The ambulance arrives.\u00a0 The paramedics come in.\u00a0 I think in the jumble of words the clog up the processing of my mind, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between an EMT and a paramedic?\u201d \n I have no answer, except that the EMTs were quicker, because they were local to the mountain, and the paramedics had to come all the way from Boulder. \n The paramedics ask the same questions, plus more questions.\u00a0 I repeat everything.\u00a0 Willy can walk now.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t want to go.\u00a0 \u201cNot a choice.\u201d\u00a0 We make it into the ambulance somehow.\u00a0 Moths cover everything.\u00a0 They\u2019re inside the ambulance.\u00a0 Hundreds of them, maybe thousands.\u00a0 Willy\u2019s in the bed, one paramedic is hooking him up to their equipment.\u00a0 Relax.\u00a0 Help is here.\u00a0 I sit.\u00a0 Dizziness.\u00a0 Pain.\u00a0 Fear.\u00a0 Panic.\u00a0 \u201cIs this a good spot for me to sit?\u201d\u00a0 It is.\u00a0 I buckle myself in.\u00a0 I caress Willy\u2019s cheek.\u00a0 We\u2019re waiting.\u00a0 Someone\u2014the EMTs, I think\u2014remember Willy\u2019s special pillow and special blanket.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 He was so insistent that we bring them, and I had to leave behind the extra clothes to make room in our bags.\u00a0 He needs them even more now.\u00a0 The moths aren\u2019t gone, but there\u2019s less of them.\u00a0 Banging as one paramedic communicates to the other that it\u2019s time to go.\u00a0 The ambulance rocks as it sets off into the darkness of the mountain roads.\u00a0 I look behind, eyes unfocused, caressing Willy\u2019s cheek as the paramedic finishes the last of his tasks to keep Willy stable.\u00a0 Willy can sleep now and he does. \n The paramedic in the ambulance with me is wonderful.\u00a0 He keeps up a conversation.\u00a0 Slowly the two sides of my brain coalesce.\u00a0 I learn that my headache is probably due to the altitude.\u00a0 That Wisconsin is \u201cabout 80% humidity\u201d and Colorado is \u201cabout 5%.\u201d\u00a0 I need to drink more water.\u00a0 I need to take things slow.\u00a0 He promises to get me some water as soon as we get there.\u00a0 We talk, me still a bit dazed, about autism, seizures, altitude, writing.\u00a0 Once he\u2019s given and received all the necessary information, we settle on the topic of writing.\u00a0 This calms me.\u00a0 By then, Willy is sleeping soundly.\u00a0 He helps me pull myself together, merging the two parts of my brain, giving me the ability to be both comforting and rational, coherently so.\u00a0 Of all the people who participated in this unwanted adventure, of all the people from my brother to the EMTs, from my mother to the nurse, it is this paramedic I am most grateful for\u2014he took care of Willy\u2019s physical needs, treating him just as respectfully and patiently and wonderfully as I would want, and he took care of my emotional needs, giving me the time and support I needed to brace myself for the rest of this adventure.\u00a0 It was a forty-minute trip back to down the mountain, to the hospital.\u00a0 In those forty-minutes I went from barely functioning fragments back to a cohesive whole. \n I notice a pair of headlights following, and I know it must be my brother and mother.\u00a0 I see that there are lights at the back and I wonder what they are.\u00a0 In time, I realize they coincide with the brake and turn signal lights.\u00a0 I\u2019m briefly proud of myself for figuring this out.\u00a0 Shortly, he\u2019s facing forward, preparing Willy for his departure, and we sway.\u00a0 The paramedic smiles and says, \u201cWe need those lights up there,\u201d pointing above my head. \n Willy\u2019s ready for his departure by the time the vehicle stops.\u00a0 My depth perception seems a bit out of whack, because we seem to be parked right up against a wall.\u00a0 But there\u2019s room for the bed to come down and there\u2019s room for me to climb down.\u00a0 I\u2019m unsteady on my feet.\u00a0 We make it to the room.\u00a0 I start to fragment again.\u00a0 There\u2019s people.\u00a0 Helping Willy.\u00a0 The curtain is pulled so I don\u2019t see what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 People talking to me.\u00a0 I must have made enough sense, because they nod their understanding.\u00a0 It seems a long time, but the curtain is drawn back, the paramedic is there, hands me a water bottle.\u00a0 I drink.\u00a0 I find I\u2019m very thirsty and I drink again.\u00a0 By the time the bottle is half-gone, I start to feel better.\u00a0 Things are quiet now. \n I get permission to bring my mom and my brother in.\u00a0 Willy\u2019s resting.\u00a0 I catch them up.\u00a0 I regret taking so long to think of them.\u00a0 Shortly after that, the adrenaline seems to leave my system in a rush and I experience a new kind of dizziness.\u00a0 Blood tests, monitors, then a CAT scan.\u00a0 Willy bravely tells me he wants to go alone.\u00a0 He does a wonderful job.\u00a0 More waiting.\u00a0 Lots of waiting.\u00a0 I remember that I haven\u2019t really slept in over thirty-six hours.\u00a0 It hits me like a rock slide.\u00a0 We hadn\u2019t had dinner either.\u00a0 It\u2019s now well past midnight.\u00a0 This started around nine, I think.\u00a0 Maybe eight.\u00a0 More waiting.\u00a0 My brother leaves to get us some dinner\u2014but not Willy, because he\u2019s asleep and because he\u2019s not supposed to eat until they\u2019re 100% sure he\u2019s stable.\u00a0 The doctor comes and tells us that there are no physical reasons for the seizure.\u00a0 He calls it a non-epileptic seizure, but tells me I need to take Willy to a neurologist for further testing when we get back home.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to be okay, he can go back to the cabin tonight, but we\u2019ll have to take things slowly, make sure he eats, drinks, and sleeps enough. \u00a0It\u2019s almost time to go.\u00a0 My brother comes back with food.\u00a0 It\u2019s not very good, but we eat.\u00a0 It\u2019s a toss-up as to whether the food makes us feel better or worse.\u00a0 There\u2019s more waiting and I\u2019m very tired, even after chewing down some roasted espresso beans.\u00a0 The caffeine rolls off of me and sleeps sings its seductive song in my ear, but I have to ignore it for a little while longer\u2014another hour at least. \n When it\u2019s time to go, Willy walks out by himself.\u00a0 My hand hovers near his arm for a while, but then he moves off on his own when he sees the Jeep before we do.\u00a0 We drink water as soon as we\u2019re in the cabin.\u00a0 We sleep in the bedroom together.\u00a0 My brother sleeps on the air mattress.\u00a0 My mom sleeps on the couch. \n In the morning, everyone is awake before I am.\u00a0 I drink down a glass of water right away, before I do anything else.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Willy remembers the ride in the ambulance, he remembers the hospital, but he doesn\u2019t remember the seizure.\u00a0 The loft is off limits.\u00a0 At first, he complains.\u00a0 But then, later, I show him the light that flickers in my brother\u2019s bedroom if you turn it too far.\u00a0 I explain that his brain is like the light and that a seizure is like the light flickering.\u00a0 He seems to understand, well enough.\u00a0 Later, the next day, we talk about maybe going up in the loft, during the day.\u00a0 He even talks about maybe sleeping there, if it\u2019s okay with me.\u00a0 We\u2019re never quite that brave.\u00a0 We never make it back up the loft. \n Each moment he\u2019s out of my sight I worry:\u00a0 What if he has another seizure and I\u2019m not there to hold him?\u00a0 But life goes on.\u00a0 Soon, we\u2019ll have the EEG.\u00a0 Soon, we\u2019ll have some sort of answers.\u00a0 I hope. \n ",

{"date": "January 9, 2015", "body": "\r\n I\u2019m reading  Nothing About Us Without Us  by James I. Charlton. One of the topics he covers is disability identification. As the argument is presented, one of the biggest challenges of the Disability Rights Movement (DRM) is getting people to both identify with their disability and their peers with disabilities  and  to feel empowered; because, dominant cultures assert that  disability  is weakness and inferiority. \n As the mother of three children with disabilities, it was easy for me to reject the idea that my children were weak and inferior. I value my children as they are for who they are. It was easy to recognize that, yes, they have disabilities, but no, their disabilities don\u2019t mean what the dominant culture says they mean. This is especially easy when confronted with the dominant culture\u2019s willingness to see children like mine as disposable, where parents who murder their kids are the real victims. That makes it really, really easy for me to reject the dominant culture wholeheartedly, because I just can\u2019t find it in my heart to  sympathize  with parents who kill their own kids, let alone  empathize  with them. \n As a woman with a newly diagnosed disability, it\u2019s a bit harder for me to reject the idea that I am weak and inferior while still acknowledging my disability. Really, the only thing I have going for me in that regard is that I was already primed to reject the dominant culture. When you\u2019ve lost abilities that you once had, it\u2019s hard not to see yourself as \u201cless than\u201d you were. I don\u2019t have the same physical capacity I once had, but since I was never a very \u201cphysical\u201d person, I can handle that. But I don\u2019t have the same mental capacity I once had, either, and that\u2019s much harder for me to cope with, because I was and am a very \u201cmental\u201d person. \n I think a lot. I think when I work. I think when I \u201cplay.\u201d I think instead of getting bored. I am a nearly endless source of my own \u201camusement.\u201d I  hate  the fact that I lose track of my own thoughts. I  hate  the fact that I can\u2019t remember things as readily as I used to. And I  hate  the fact that fatigue and cloudiness interferes with the way I want to live my life. \n I can deal with the pain of fibromyalgia a lot easier than I can deal with the mental impact. There is part of me that sees that impact as making me less than I was. For that part of me, acknowledging my disability is acknowledging that I am less than I was. But there\u2019s another part of me that knows that this struggle misses the point. \n When people without disabilities regard people with disabilities as being \u201cless than,\u201d they\u2019re not talking about being  less able , they\u2019re talking about being  less  human . The dominant culture treats people with disabilities as if they were less human, less valuable, less worthy of life, of rights, of support. \n I am less able than I was, but I am no less human, no less valuable to my family or my clients, and no less worthy of my life, my rights, and the support of my fellow human beings. \n This is simply true. \n I could make it a matter of arrogance and point out that I was  more able  before my disability and that I am still  more able  than most of humanity with regards to the things that I value. I am still more able to handle three children with autism while respecting them and nurturing them into adulthood. I am still more able to write a damned fine piece, whether it\u2019s a blog post or a web page or a book. I am still more able to create a loving, sustainable marriage with a partner with bi-polar disorder. I am still more able than anyone else to live  my life . \n That\u2019s true, too; but, it\u2019s not the point. \n The point is that people with disabilities should  feel  free to identify as having a disability without shame and without being made to feel less human. The point is that people with disabilities should not be ashamed to associate and affiliate with other people with disabilities, or even with other people without disabilities. Humanity isn\u2019t measured by degrees of ability. Humanity is an either/or option. Men are human. So are women. But gorillas aren\u2019t. Dogs aren\u2019t. And the fact that I can\u2019t remember the right word(s) to describe the distinction doesn\u2019t really matter either. \n We are all human beings, regardless of our abilities and our disabilities, and we all matter. \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n (This is not to be construed to mean that we should be free to go around killing gorillas and dogs for fun, because they don\u2019t matter. Animals matter, too. So do plants, for that matter. It\u2019s just that, in my opinion, people matter more.) \n (Now, I\u2019m going to go ask my husband what the word(s) I can\u2019t remember are, because it\u2019s bugging me that I can\u2019t remember. Apparently the words I couldn\u2019t remember are  binary distinction , but Mark doesn\u2019t think it works, because there is more than one type of animal, so it\u2019s not binary. But either/or and yes/no are binary, and that was the point I was making, so I\u2019m going to stick with the thought that refused to be pinned down.) \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2015/01/disability-identification/", "title": "Disability Identification"},

My point is simple:  There\u2019s always a choice! \n Admittedly, we may have few choices, we may have bad choices, but nonetheless we always have a choice. Claiming anything else serves only two purposes: justification and disempowerment. \n It started with a line in a book. \u201cRemember this, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d \n Except, even as that was said, the explanation belied the statement: Basically, the choice was to go along with the powerful but good person or fall into the hands of the powerful bad person. To avoid the latter, the powerful good person was willing to destroy the characters she was trying to save. \n We are talking about a life-or-death choice, but it is nonetheless a choice. And, honestly, there are some things we, as human beings, need to be willing to die for. Today is a good day to take a moment and think about that. \n Today is the day we honor Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the great American heroes. He became a hero, not be disavowing his choices, but by claiming his right to choose. And Martin Luther King, Jr. did choose and he chose well. \n Faced with prejudice, Martin Luther King, Jr. chose open-heartedness. Faced with hatred, Martin Luther King, Jr. chose love. Faced with violence, Martin Luther King, Jr. chose peace. Faced with oppression, Martin Luther King, Jr. chose resistance. Faced with fear, Martin Luther King, Jr. chose compassion. Faced with anger, Martin Luther King, Jr. chose understanding. \n These were not easy choices. They were inevitably life-and-death choices and Martin Luther King, Jr. chose what he did, knowing the example he was setting and the risks he was taking. He could have much more easily have said, \u201cI have no choice.\u201d He could have sat down, shut up, and lived long. If he had, he wouldn\u2019t be a hero, because he wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. He would have lived longer, but he would not have lived better. \n Every time we say, \u201cI have no choice,\u201d we give our power to choose away to another. When we abdicate our responsibility to choose, we give up our ability to make a difference. Today, of all days, honor your right and your responsibility to choose. Don\u2019t take the easy way.

{"date": "January 21, 2015", "body": "\r\n Alex gets it! He finally gets communication! \n For years, Alex didn\u2019t really understand how communication worked. Any communication that occurred was accidental. He would do or say something we could understand and interpret, and then he\u2019d be rewarded with what he wanted or needed. But he had no apparent control over these bursts of communication. \n After years of speech therapy, special education services, and intensive in-home behavioral therapy, Alex started to get the idea behind communication. Using pictures and PECS, voice output devices, hand over hand, and the occasional gesture, Alex started to communicate in a very basic fashion. Over time, he learned to show more specific wants and needs, like pulling out a food or drink he couldn\u2019t open and setting it in front of someone who could open it. He would spell out key words using blocks or tiles with letters on them. He would even type in a few key words on a computer. \n During these many years of slow progress, actual spoken words were rare. They occurred in those serendipitous moments when his frustration exceeded his tolerance  without  overwhelming his sensory processing abilities. During these rare moments, a word or a phrase would pop out of his mouth and we would understand. These brief successes were always a surprise\u2014a blessing, but still not a product of controlled communication. \n Now, finally, after years of trying, I have succeeded in providing Alex with a communication device. From my own perspective, this is \u201cassisted communication,\u201d in that Alex requires technology to access his ability to communicate. However, this is not \u201cassisted communication\u201d in the sense that we\u2019re putting words in Alex\u2019s mouth. \n In an effort to teach Alex to use the device more thoroughly, we will find the words (and show him where they are) in order to say what we think he might want. Then, if it is indeed what Alex wants, he will tap the sentence and the device will say it. If it is not what Alex wants, he\u2019ll erase it and enter in what he does want. \n Alex is communicating! He communicates familiar expressions independently with his device. He communicates less familiar expressions with some adult assistance and support. He communicates and the device speaks for him! \n But the wonder doesn\u2019t stop there. Hearing the device speak what he wants or needs has helped Alex get communication so much more thoroughly than he has ever understood communication before. Not only is he using his device as a talker,  he\u2019s talking!  He\u2019ll listen to what the device says, and then he\u2019ll say the keywords, too! He\u2019s said more words in the last week that he\u2019s said in the previous year! \n With all the success Alex has been having with this device, we\u2019re ready to proceed to the next step. We\u2019re in the process of gathering as much data as possible, which the speech therapist at the clinic will use to begin the application process for a permanent device.

{"date": "January 16, 2015", "body": "\r\n It is the opinion of this writer that any time you make a generalization, you enter dangerous territory. Among other things, you risk making the totality of your point (which might be valid if it were better defined) null and void by a single, contradictory example. \n [Enter James I. Charlton\u2019s  Nothing About Us Without Us  from stage left] \n In what must be considered poignantly illustrative of their perilous and degraded status, people with disabilities are significantly controlled by charity and social service institutions (broadly considered, private welfare agencies, asylums, and residential facilities). This is the case throughout the world, although charities are more prevalent in the United States and Europe. \n \u2026 \n Some might see that it is contradictory to point out that most people with disabilities do not have access to a safety net while at the same time criticizing charities and social service agencies. (p.93) \n Charlton\u2019s premise consists of a few main points: \n \n While charities and social service agencies (lumped together, falsely) do help some, they also create dependency. \n They contribute to the degradation and isolation of those they help, but taking care of clients whilst keeping them out of sight. \n If the problems they ameliorate were solved, the charities would cease to exist. \n Many of the people who do this work do so because, in the words of Billy Golfus, \u201cTheir game is about wanting to be in control of other peoples\u2019 lives,\u201d (p. 94). \n \n First, charities are nonprofit organizations that gather donations from the public (through public and private grants, as well) in order to meet an organizational mission. These charities may hire social workers, but a social service agency is, almost by definition, a government organization, which also hires social workers. Lumping these very different kinds of organizations together as a single problem or as a collective is logically unsound, because they operate and function in very different ways for very different purposes. \n Second, the unfortunate reality is that people who cannot support themselves are dependents. While much is done that encourages continued dependence, this is true across the entire strata of society, from families to international governments. If that is to change, then services need to be made available that contribute to independence. It\u2019s a difference of paradigm and mission, not organizational or functional structure. A nonprofit that takes creating independence, or better yet interdependence, as its mission would still be classified as a charity or a social service agency, depending on whether it\u2019s independent or governmental in nature. \n Third, organizations with such a mission already exist, as a byproduct of the same attitudes and social changes that have made the DRM movement possible. There are organizations that have already made the transition from disempowering caretaker organizations to empowering education organizations. \n \u00a0 \n Fourth, any organization that fails to adapt when its environment changes, dies. Those that try to keep the environment from changing inevitably fail and die. Only those that change survive. This is no less true of charities than of any other organization. \n Fifth, there certainly are people who strive to exert control over others\u2019 lives. Some gravitate towards social work. Some start charities. Some start businesses. Some start wars. Most just have kids. We live in a broken world full of such people and the rest of us just have to live with that, or change it. \n Despite the fact that I can pull apart the argument on logical grounds, there is truth to what Charlton is saying, especially from the perspective of people who\u2019ve been disempowered for most of their lives. If people are ill-prepared to take control of their own lives, then there are those who will try to withhold control from them. Again, most of these people are called parents. There\u2019s a time for this, and there\u2019s a time to let go. And it\u2019s never easy knowing which time any given moment falls under. There is nothing inherently malevolent or oppressive about this, though there are certainly malevolent and oppressive people who engage in the behavior. \n For me, the heart of the matter is something that Charlton would seemingly refute or ignore.  Charity  is, loosely translated, most properly equivalent to \u201cbrotherly love.\u201d The word as it is used today is a deviation of the  charity  found in the King James Bible in 1 Corinthians 13, which states in verse 3, \u201cAnd though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\u201d The whole of this chapter gives ample evidence that 1) giving and 2) serving are not  charity , that  charity  is loving others in Christ-like fashion, and that these acts only do good when they are done in the spirit of true charity. As Charlton seems quite anti-religion, he might find it rather ironic that his observations are proof of the soundness of this part of Jesus Christ\u2019s doctrine, at the very least. \n Shortly after reading and getting wound up over this segment, I had a chat with a social worker who also happens to have learning and neurological disabilities. This person had been struggling for months at work, because of miscommunication resulting in part from her reluctance to disclose her own disability and in part from her co-workers\u2019 apparent distinction between things-that-apply-to-clients and things-that-apply-to-coworkers. This isn\u2019t the first time this issue has gotten in the way of her work, either. \n Part of it is that Charlton\u2019s not wrong in his observations, he\u2019s just wrong to  generalize  those observations and apply them to two entire sectors in the global economy. Unfortunately, he\u2019s right that most of the professionals operating in these sectors  have been taught  in ways that contribute to the very problems he\u2019s cited. These are people who often don\u2019t know better, in that they\u2019ve never been clients. The people who have been clients tend to be marginalized, in part because they\u2019re not taught how to counteract the forces that marginalize them. These issues are not particular to disabilities, but are holistic and systemic within both sectors. \n My friend has been a client in almost every applicable way. She has had disabilities, presumably for her entire life, but has gone undiagnosed or underdiagnosed for most of her life. She grew up in extreme poverty and in an environment rife with abuse and neglect. She has been failed time and again by the systems that supposedly operate to protect and support people like her. She entered her profession to do better for others than was done for her. And she\u2019s not alone. There are many, many like her all over the world, who have struggled against terrible odds, who have become professionals in either the nonprofit or public sector, and have chosen to do better for others. And Charlton\u2019s rash generalization erases them all. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2015/01/on-charity-social-work-and-public-administration/", "title": "On Charity, Social Work, and Public Administration"},
{"date": "January 8, 2015", "body": "\r\n Across the U.S., we\u2019re being inundated with immoderate views. Recently, three men died instead of being taken into police custody. The issues are poignant: racism, police relations, recognition of authority, delegation of authority, and acceptability of subculture, to name a few. None of these issues usually appear on this blog. \n I don\u2019t write about racism or racial subcultures. But these events concern everyone, because the results of these events have included riots, public demonstrations, the assassination of police officers, and, of course, a whole lot of public commentary. Much of the latter involves individuals or organizations trying to use these \u201ccurrent events\u201d to bolster their own positions by taking an immoderate stand for or against something pertaining to these tragedies. \n I\u2019ll take a stand, too. I believe people shouldn\u2019t die because of their skin color. I believe police have a responsibility to protect themselves and others while on the job, because that  is  their job. I believe neither stand is the antithesis of the other. \n There\u2019s nothing extreme about my position; nonetheless, it\u2019s controversial. One might assume that I believe the three men that died instead of being taken into police custody died because of their race. I don\u2019t. In regards to the first two events, people came to these conclusions before the facts were made publicly available. They did so for two reasons: first, the media incited the public to believe that race was a factor in these events; and, second, people believed the claims purported in the media because they were inclined to believe them. Now that more facts have been made publicly available, the facts don\u2019t seem to support the conclusions so many people reached directly after the incidents; yet, it\u2019s easier for them to continue to believe in some great conspiratorial cover-up than to admit they were wrong. The truly sad and unfortunate part of this is that this country, this supposedly \u201cfree nation,\u201d has a history of cover-ups just like the ones they suspect, so their positions aren\u2019t implausible or even irrational. (In regards to the third incident, when you pull a gun on a police officer, you can expect to get shot\u2014that\u2019s what they\u2019re trained to do!) \n One might also assume that I think how the police handled these events was above reproach. I don\u2019t. There is always room for reproach. But there is a difference between reproach and threatening their lives. There is a difference between reproach and rioting. There is most definitely a difference between reproach and assassinating random police officers. There is also a difference between reproach for its own sake and effective protests. \n One person was sharing with me their take on the  \u201cdie in\u201d at the Mall of America . Yes, these people trespassed. Yes, they demonstrated on private property. Yes, it was disruptive.  It was supposed to be disruptive. It was supposed to get attention. It was supposed to make the news!  That\u2019s what  peaceful protest  is all about!!! From everything I\u2019ve read and everything I\u2019ve heard, nobody got hurt, nobody was violent. They got their message across in a way we should be able to support. \n Black lives matter. There\u2019s nothing extreme about that statement. Police lives matter. There\u2019s nothing extreme about that statement either. All lives matter. (Oddly enough, I\u2019m told that that statement is very extreme. Go figure!) \n Liberals, particularly extreme liberals, want to turn this\u2014and have achieved some success in this regard\u2014into a race war. Conservatives, particularly extreme conservatives, want to turn this\u2014and have achieved some success in this regard\u2014into a culture war. In the midst of these extremes, moderates (regardless of the way they lean) are most often silent; but, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re not talking, it because they\u2019re drowned about by the loudness of the extremes. \n We could all spend a lot of time pointing fingers and accomplishing nothing. For the most part, that\u2019s what people have been doing. A riot will destroy lives and businesses, but it will go down in history and change nothing. Distorting the views of opponents, as many conservatives seem inclined to do, will create talk, sway the unwary, but will inevitably change nothing. We create change when we sit down, figure out what went wrong, and  fix it . \n That\u2019s what moderates do. They try to find middle ground. They try to create solutions. They work with people who are different from them. They try to implement solutions. At least, that\u2019s what they do when they have a chance to try. \n This society that revolves so much around hits and likes and viewership doesn\u2019t condone \u201cmoderacy.\u201d In fact, \u201cmoderacy\u201d isn\u2019t even a recognized word. But immoderacy is. And that\u2019s what we get, because that\u2019s what bolsters ratings. \n We don\u2019t need ratings. We don\u2019t need pundits. We don\u2019t need riots.

I can\u2019t smell liquid Lysol without gagging. \n Start with the carpets or floors first, because you have to walk on them to reach everything else and you don\u2019t want to step in it.\u00a0 Start with the spot closest to the door.\u00a0 Work your way into the room.\u00a0 Be careful not to kneel (if possible) in a spot you\u2019ve cleaned.\u00a0 Check the whole floor.\u00a0 Don\u2019t rely on what you notice first.\u00a0 Check the floor thoroughly, every spot, even under beds and other places that are easier for your child to reach than they are for you.\u00a0 Then, move on to the surfaces.\u00a0 Scrub the cloth surfaces (anything that can\u2019t go into the washing machine) first.\u00a0 Then move on to hard surfaces.\u00a0 Check all surfaces.\u00a0 Then, move on to walls, doors, and don\u2019t forget the doorknobs. \n I recommend piling the soiled laundry in the tub until you\u2019re ready to deal with it, but unless you know you have two loads, don\u2019t start washing laundry until you\u2019re done cleaning other things\u2014you\u2019ll want those rags in there, too. \n Once you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve cleaned everything in the primary room, and gotten the soiled laundry out, check the surrounding areas.\u00a0 Search for poo, especially in the bathroom.\u00a0 When you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve gotten it all, wash the soiled stuff in the washing machine.\u00a0 Use bleach or OxyClean, but not both (they don\u2019t mix well).\u00a0 Put it through a full wash\u2014all the soiled stuff together, even if you wouldn\u2019t usually wash them together.\u00a0 Then, take them out of the washer, check for stains, smell for lingering odors, use Febreeze on those items that still smell and use stain remover on anything stained, and then sort them with whatever other laundry you have.\u00a0 Wash them again.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to go back and clean the bathtub, too. \n By now, the room should be a bit drier from the cleaning.\u00a0 Use paper towels to soak up lingering dampness.\u00a0 Then use Febreeze on the whole room.\u00a0 Every cloth surface that can be sprayed with Febreeze should be sprayed with Febreeze.\u00a0 Wait for that to dry, and then vacuum. \n If you have to throw up, go ahead and throw up.\u00a0 If you have to cry, go ahead and cry.\u00a0 In fact, I recommend crying, because crying acts like a release valve, letting off the \u201csteam\u201d of frustration, tension, anger, and other negative emotions that would otherwise get pent up and build until they explode. \n Once everything\u2019s clean, take a shower.\u00a0 Scrub yourself thoroughly.\u00a0 No matter how careful you were not to get any of it on you, you\u2019ll still feel dirty\u2014at least, I always do.\u00a0 After you take a shower, since now your bathtub is clean, feel free to take a nice, soaking bath.\u00a0 That, too, can help heal the trauma of having to clean up after smearing. \n Maybe even treat yourself to something nice.\u00a0 I recommend a non-food treat, like maybe an episode of your favorite television show (if you don\u2019t have DVDs, try Hulu or the website of the station that airs the show) or movie.\u00a0 Yes, I know, you don\u2019t have time\u2014you\u2019re schedule is already way off track\u2014but, really, make the time.\u00a0 Surviving a smearing is more than just cleaning the mess.\u00a0 You need to cope with the trauma, too; and it is traumatic, it is disgusting, it is frustrating.\u00a0 Give yourself time to recover, and then let it go. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/03/how-tosurvive-the-smearing-morning-with-school-edition/", "title": "How to\u2026Survive the Smearing (Morning with School Edition)"},

there are those who are worthy and there are those who are infidels.\u00a0 (Christians use both terms to describe those who are unworthy, plus they have the legacy of Election\u2014which I do not claim to understand.) \n Genealogical worthiness is also present in science, though perhaps it could be better called gene-o-logical, since scientists tend to be less concerned with the specific ancestors from whom you\u2019ve sprung and more concerned with the actual genes you\u2019ve inherited. \n Genealogical worthiness also permeates politics.\u00a0 Both Nationalism (which can have some positive aspects to it) and genocide (which is 100% negative) are products of political ideas of genealogical worthiness.\u00a0 But there are others.\u00a0 Eugenics was a strange hybrid of politics and science, and its effects linger in contemporary politics despite the many efforts to destroy this debunked theory. \n But genealogical worthiness is far from the only consideration.\u00a0 After all, nobody chooses their genealogy and many of us are willing to give at least a little consideration to choice.\u00a0 Those who choose to pursue higher education are often considered \u201cmore worthy\u201d than those who don\u2019t\u2014considerations of equal opportunity are often negated in these arguments.\u00a0 Those who choose to purchase responsibly are often considered \u201cmore worthy\u201d than those who don\u2019t\u2014what makes a worthy purchase depends, of course, on the prevailing perspective, from the responsible use of credit to green living and many considerations in between. \n And, of course, worthiness is also a matter of ability.\u00a0 Those who are able are obviously more worthy than those who aren\u2019t\u2014and for many this belief is so obvious, so strongly assumed, that the assumptions it is based on are never even questioned. \n The worthiness of people with autism is degraded on all three counts.\u00a0 Genealogically or gene-o-logically, autistics are inferior.\u00a0 There\u2019s something wrong with the genes and that makes them at least susceptible to autism.\u00a0 Shame on them.\u00a0 They\u2019re not worthy.\u00a0 But, of course, being autistic\u2014at least,  acting  autistic is a choice.\u00a0 Passing\u2014the contemporary equivalent to being cured\u2014is a choice.\u00a0 It\u2019s a choice to do the work to be able to pass and it\u2019s a choice to do the work to actually pass.\u00a0 Those who fail to pass have made the wrong choices\u2014opportunity, or lack thereof, to learn effective passing strategies is irrelevant, because if they really wanted to learn, then they would have.\u00a0 Choosing not to pass makes them unworthy.\u00a0 Shame on them.\u00a0 Finally, ability makes them unworthy.\u00a0 They are not as able as neurologically typical people, and they should be.\u00a0 They should be able to mingle successfully in a crowded room full of noisy party-goers.\u00a0 They should be able to sit quietly in a classroom and absorb the teacher\u2019s lectures like a sponge.\u00a0 They should be able to hold down a job without accommodations\u2014who do they think they are to ask, they\u2019re not even worthy to have a job considering how many able people are out of work.\u00a0 Shame on them.\u00a0 Strike one, strike two, strike three, autism is out. \n The above paragraph is, of course, an illustrative example.\u00a0 I believe it happens; I believe people think like that.\u00a0 But I am not one of them. \n Human worth cannot truly and accurately be measured by our genealogy (or gene-o-logy).\u00a0 Human worth cannot truly and accurately be measured by our choices, at least not without considering our genuine opportunities and our unique circumstances.\u00a0 (And it shouldn\u2019t be about how much we choose to accomplish in order to \u201cprove\u201d our worth, but whether we choose to hurt others for personal pleasure and gain.)\u00a0 Human worth most certainly cannot be measured by our abilities. \n Hello, I am the mother of three children with autism.\u00a0 I am worthy to live, to reproduce, and to raise my children.\u00a0 All four of my children are worthy of living, dreaming, loving, and having opportunities for personal growth and betterment.\u00a0 Whether you are autistic or not, you are worthy.\u00a0 Whether you are college educated or not, you are worthy.\u00a0 Whether you are rich and powerful or not, you are worthy.\u00a0 Whether you are able to live a normal and independent life or not, you are worthy. \n You are of infinite worth beyond human imagination just for being you.\u00a0 And so is everyone else. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/01/worthiness/", "title": "Worthiness"},

There are ghostwriters, too. \n \u2026 \n It also adds another layer of significance to our daily lives. A number of environmental factors, from nutrients to temperature to chemicals, are capable of altering gene expression, and those factors that manage to penetrate germline chromatin and escape reprogramming could, in theory, be passed on to our children and possibly our grandchildren. \n \u2026 \n Given the elusive nature of inherited epigenetic modifications, it seems that, despite decades of investigation, scientists remain on the brink of understanding. The possibilities, however, seem endless, even with the constraint that, to be inherited, epigenetic modifications must affect gene expression in the germline, a feat that even genetic mutations rarely accomplish. But with the skyrocketing prevalence of conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and autism, which have no clear genetic etiology in the majority of cases, as Brunet pointed out, \u201cIt seems that all complex processes are affected by epigenetics. \n While scientists continue to search for definitive evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans, the implications so far suggest that are our lifestyles and what we eat, drink, and breathe may directly affect the genetic health of our progeny.\u201d \n What can I say?\u00a0 I like it when scientists discover that what they knew wasn\u2019t all there was to be known.\u00a0 This is the science that attracted me so much in my childhood: \u00a0Science as exploration and discovery, not science as a god or using science to \u201cprove\u201d politically- or ideologically-motivated beliefs. \n The idea that nurture might affect nature as a ghostwriter appeals to me.\u00a0 Our lives are not predetermined by the genetic makeup of our ancestors, but products of on-going choices that echo through generations.\u00a0 And we just might have a scientific way to study a portion of that phenomenon. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111005143722.htm", "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-01-cshl-team-automated-imaging-greatly.html", "http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/01/16/epigenetics-a-turning-point-in-our-understanding-of-heredity/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/01/scanning-mice-brains/", "title": "Scanning Mice Brains"},

constant barrage, it seems, and I can\u2019t seem to find a way to help him manage it.\u00a0 He\u2019s had his tonsils and adenoids out, due to frequent illness.\u00a0 As a baby, he experienced reflux

surgery, to repair the hernia on the other side.\u00a0 His health has never been terrible, but it\u2019s never been terrific.\u00a0 Poor nutrition due to his self-inflicted dietary limits, plus the delays, have given him a susceptibility to colds and flus that seem to last longer with him than with his brothers.\u00a0 To top it all off, of the three boys, Alex is the only one who hasn\u2019t retained a deep attachment to a special therapist from his intensive program.\u00a0 In retrospect, the intensive therapy he received was a sham\u2014a waste compared to what it could have and should have been. \n I know there are many children, some with developmental delays even more severe than Alex\u2019s, who have experienced even more health issues than he has.\u00a0 Many children have to struggle through without even the opportunity to receive the kinds of therapies and supports that Alex receives.\u00a0 I know this, but it\u2019s not a comfort.\u00a0 Of my three boys, Alex is the

it seems all the love we can give him isn\u2019t enough to ease the hardships he faces.\u00a0 He\u2019s a wonderful, talented boy.\u00a0 This I know.\u00a0 And I worry that, as hard as it\u2019s been, when he has to go out and fight for his right to be himself and to be recognized as someone with a  positive future , that it will get harder still.\u00a0 I love him, and I feel so tenderly for all that he has faced and all he has struggled through, and that I, as his mother, have failed to ease his way. \n It was with this somber mood that I left the surgeon on Thursday, who confirmed that yes, the swelling in his testes was another hernia, not hormones, and who felt the urgency warranted a quick turn-over.\u00a0 Alex would be in surgery on Monday morning.\u00a0 I took Alex to his pediatrician on Friday, for a pre-surgery physical. \n After the nurse did her thing, Alex\u2019s pediatrician did his.\u00a0 When it was all done, the doctor leaned back on his heels and nodded, a satisfied smile playing across his lips.\u00a0 \u201cIs he okay for surgery,\u201d I asked.\u00a0 \u201cOh yes,\u201d the doctor said, \u201che\u2019s okay for surgery.\u201d\u00a0 He looked at me, our eyes meeting briefly, and the smile grew larger.\u00a0 \u201cAlex is in excellent health,\u201d he said, the dignified smile growing broader.\u00a0 The significance of the news must have registered on my face in some way, because the doctor nodded, looked at Alex, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, young man.\u00a0 Keep it up.\u201d \n I don\u2019t know for sure what Alex felt or how much of the exchange he understood.\u00a0 I think he was just relieved that this doctor didn\u2019t push the herniated intestine back into place.\u00a0 (Which I had watched with freakish curiosity and wide eyes as the surgeon did so the day before.\u00a0 Alex didn\u2019t cry or anything, but that could not have been comfortable.)\u00a0 Alex tried one more time to fit \u201cVeggie Tales\u201d into the little username box on the computer in the room, and then he let me help him get bundled back up.\u00a0 Snow streamed by the window, hiding the street beyond, as I helped him into his snow pants and zipped his coat. \u00a0Alex focused on the snowy show. \n When I got Alex back in school, I couldn\u2019t help but share the news with his teachers\u2014both the old teacher and the new one.\u00a0 Then, as soon as I was able, I had to share the news again with my husband, in e-mails, and on social media.\u00a0 It\u2019s a hard-won victory and those words, \u201cexcellent health,\u201d so much so that it almost makes up for Alex needing another surgery.\u00a0 Almost. \n ", "outgoing_links":

Brandon and Will\u2019s paths to manhood, though each different from the other, have been more or less typical.\u00a0 They each have their atypicalities, but the paths themselves form a linear progression, with ups and downs, regressions and bursts of development, lags and rushes, but more or less straight courses moving forward.\u00a0 Their gains in independence have been fairly easy to mark and recognize.\u00a0 Alex\u2019s path is very different.\u00a0 In some areas, he seems to make very little progress.\u00a0 In others, he\u2019s growing and changing.\u00a0 But you have to be willing to see it, to recognize it, to acknowledge it. \n Certain events and experiences show our characters.\u00a0 These events come in many shapes and forms, but all represent hardships of one kind or another.\u00a0 According to the movie,  Shadowlands , C.S. Lewis compared these experiences to the master artisan chipping away bits of stone to form the beautiful statue we are to become; it\u2019s painful, but necessary.\u00a0 Other Christian references refer to the refiner\u2019s fire or baking clay to make pottery.\u00a0 The idea is that God is crafting us, as any master craftsman crafts his creation, and we are becoming more perfect by our times in the fire. \n But not everyone survives this process, let alone becomes more perfect because of it.\u00a0 We all struggle, we all fall, and we all fail at times, but some of us get back up and try again, try to be better.\u00a0 Some of us sell out to earthly temptations.\u00a0 Others break under the strain. \n The vessel that is Alex\u2014the outer shell, the body and its limitations\u2014is childlike in many ways.\u00a0 But inside Alex is growing strong and sure.\u00a0 He endures.\u00a0 He seeks comfort when it is needed, and accepts it when it\u2019s offered, but he no longer clings to me as he did when a little child in truth.\u00a0 He\u2019s growing, he\u2019s enduring, and he\u2019s becoming the man he will be, slowly and surely. \n I don\u2019t know how to put into words what I observed.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t so much a matter of doing.\u00a0 It was how it was done, the spirit it was done in, and the way it was done.\u00a0 Once, Alex was the happiest person I knew.\u00a0 Despite his limitations, he was joyful and happy and exuberant.\u00a0 The spirit shined and it was a light in our house that shone brightly and with a constancy that I dearly miss.\u00a0 But the limitations and frustrations, not to mention the daily trials and intrusions Ben has placed on his older brother, have worn away that shine.\u00a0 Alex is struggling.\u00a0 But, as he suffered his recovery from surgery that first day in my mom\u2019s house, I saw a renewal of that spirit, a glimpse that assured me it wasn\u2019t gone or worn away, that it would shine again it its own time, as it shone that day he bore his pain and his new, if temporary, limitations. \n The next day, Alex was back to struggling and discomfort, irritated and aggravated and frustrated.\u00a0 But the light is there, waiting, banked against the daily trials, looking for the chance to shine again.\u00a0 The vessel may not be perfect by man\u2019s standards, nor even normal and acceptable; the spirit may still need perfecting by God\u2019s standards, as we all do; but the soul in that little boy, who is becoming a man, is a great soul, full of something special that has nothing to do with \u201cneeds.\u201d\u00a0 Someday, and I\u2019m committed to this, I will help to find a way for Alex to share this with the world, for he has something to contribute, something to be \u201cproductive\u201d about, and I will not all that contribution to be stopped by earthly, able-minded prejudices. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/01/post-op-my-tough-little-man/", "title": "Post-Op: My Tough Little Man"},

{"date": "January 27, 2012", "body": "\r\n I scramble out of bed after a few short hours of sleep and slip out of my warm bed into the shiver-worthy air.\u00a0 I hurry downstairs to slurp up as much caffeine as I can manage as I finish up the few tasks that remain in preparation for Alex\u2019s surgery.\u00a0 It is 5:20 AM, far earlier than I\u2019d like to be up, considering I finally fell into bed some time between 2:00 and 3:00 AM.\u00a0 Despite the rush of activity, I take the time for my morning prayers.\u00a0 Today is not the kind of day I can venture into without prayer. \n I\u2019d already gotten most of the bags out to the car\u2014one bag for Alex\u2019s needs at the hospital, one bag for when we\u2019d spend the afternoon and evening at my mom\u2019s, and one bag full of what portable work I was willing to take with me to alleviate the wait.\u00a0 I also had an insulated lunch bag full of canned caffeine.\u00a0 I hurried upstairs to bid Mark a sleepy good-bye and to get Alex up.\u00a0 I dressed him in loose clothes, and stuffed him in coat and boots.\u00a0 Alex lolled with sleepiness, not having had time to wake himself thoroughly.\u00a0 I left off hat and gloves, because the day was warm for winter (foggy and raining, instead of bitter cold and snowing), and because I didn\u2019t want to have that extra bit to look after. \n The drive was slower than I would have liked.\u00a0 According to the weather report I\u2019d read before crashing into bed, the fog was supposed to have lifted by now and the icy roads melted to wetness, but everything was still foggy and slick.\u00a0 We got there five minutes later than we should have.\u00a0 We checked in, in quick and easy fashion, and the receptionist handed a card to an elderly volunteer.\u00a0 With formal courtesy, he said, \u201cWould you follow me, please,\u201d and led us from the front desk of the hospital, through the warren of corridors, to the outpatient surgery desk.\u00a0 I made as if to step up to the desk, but he handed them a card and said, with a slight bow, \u201cIf you would follow me please.\u201d\u00a0 We ended up tucked in our little, private cubby with as little fuss and effort on our parts as possible.\u00a0 Nice.\u00a0 Very nice. \n We were visited by a nurse\u2019s aide, an admissions lady with a rolling, computerized terminal, and then the nurse.\u00a0 The simple stuff went by with minimal fuss, though we had to coax Alex to let the light clamp thing measure the oxygen in his blood via his finger.\u00a0 Of all the times I\u2019ve seen it and had it used on me or my children, I still have no idea how that works, but, once we got Alex to leave it on, it found that Alex\u2019s blood had plenty of oxygen. \n The anesthesiologist came in before we were ready, and was left waiting a bit, but it gave me a chance to mention (thanks to my mom\u2019s memory) that anesthesia makes Alex nauseated, so he\u2019ll need the medicine to help with that.\u00a0 Then, the surgeon popped in, dressed like a civilian, and we went over everything I hadn\u2019t asked yet: I shouldn\u2019t worry overly much about the bouncing, as it can\u2019t be helped; he\u2019ll probably need a few days off from school; and it\u2019s all very much like the last time.\u00a0 The anesthesiologist came back and we talked about the options, and I was able to assure him that, from previous experience, Alex was fairly cooperative with the medical staff, at least as far as going back with them on the rolling bed was concerned.\u00a0 No separation anxiety would cause Alex to freak out as they were taking him back to the surgical room.\u00a0 (Taking his blood pressure and the finger clamp were other matters.\u00a0 Fight the little stuff, but cooperate with the big stuff\u2014that\u2019s my Alex.) \n We gave him the dopey medicine, and within a few minutes Alex was ready to go.\u00a0 The anesthesiologist had suggested it would take about ten minutes.\u00a0 Alex waited three, then took my hand and led me out.\u00a0 The bed was waiting for him, but I think Alex\u2019s readiness took them by surprise.\u00a0 With help, he clambered up into the tall bed and lay down.\u00a0 He knew what was expected of him, and I guess he just wanted to get it over with.\u00a0 I kept pace as the doctors wheeled him to the double doors, offering what comfort and reassurance I could.\u00a0 Through the dopey haze, Alex smiled and nodded, then let his eyes droop closed.\u00a0 And they were gone. \n For a moment, I stood, feeling a little bereft.\u00a0 Then, I went back for my purse, headed to the car for our hospital bags, and settled into the waiting room.\u00a0 I tried to work on a paid assignment from a print-out.\u00a0 I made a little progress, but my ability to concentrate was hindered by the other people waiting and by the rather enthusiastic, but silly talk show host and guests jabbering away on the television.\u00a0 I cut about half of the material that needed cutting from my draft, but couldn\u2019t work on the transitions, since I couldn\u2019t hear the words in my head over the drone around me.\u00a0 So, I put it away and worked on some of my novel planning, which required less concentration. \n Time passed.\u00a0 I was restless.\u00a0 As much as my work is sedentary, it doesn\u2019t require me to just sit and wait.\u00a0 I get up and do things when my body needs it.\u00a0 Here, I had to check the progress of the surgery each time I left the room.\u00a0 Luckily, my timing was good, so when they came for me, I was there and seated, waiting in readiness.\u00a0 I quickly put away my things and went back to the private, little cubby we\u2019d started in.\u00a0 Alex was still drowsing under the effects of the anesthesia, fluttering between sleep and wakefulness, covered in blankets, and beneath the blankets he was naked.\u00a0 A patch of gauze was taped over his incision, and his hand was wrapped with self-sticky bandages to keep him from trying to rip out his IV again. \n He threw up once, violently, but then was done, and seemed to feel better.\u00a0 He refused to drink or eat for them, but I\u2019d warned them that might happen.\u00a0 The nurse had gone through the trouble to get Alex cheese sticks, but even these held no appeal for him.\u00a0 After a while, he let me dress him.\u00a0 Then, he let me put water to his lips by placing the droplet on my finger and touching to his lips.\u00a0 He\u2019d rub it into his chapped lips, but wouldn\u2019t let me bring cup or straw near to him. \n The nurse called the doctor to ask if Alex could go home without drinking, and that was approved.\u00a0 A little while later, I brought the van to the front while they rolled Alex to me in an oversized wheelchair, so he could curl up in the seat.\u00a0 My new, full-sized van made the trip a bit easier.\u00a0 I opened the double doors wide, and then lifted Alex up and placed him into the nearest seat, reclining it a little, buckled him in, and covered him with my winter coat, which I\u2019d left in the van.\u00a0 The hazy sun had burned away the fog and the slickness, so the drive to my mom\u2019s was quick, and aside from the chill of surgery and the overall comfort of being just on the edge of too warm, the coat/blanket was unnecessary. \n Everything went smoothly.\u00a0 Everyone adapted their expectations to Alex\u2019s peculiarities, especially in regards to not assuming that his unwillingness to eat or drink was a sign of distress.\u00a0 I did have a bit of difficulty getting the pain medicine from the pharmacy, though that might have been a product of my fatigue and worry.\u00a0 In the end, the pain medicine turned out to be a liquid form of regular Tylenol in a kid-sized dose; so we\u2019re using the tablets of \u201cmelt away\u201d Tylenol that we usually use instead, because I can crush it up in his class of soda, just like I do for the melatonin, and he takes it much better that way. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/01/operation-hernia-repair-part-deux/", "title": "Operation Hernia Repair, Part Deux"},
{"date": "September 10, 2011", "body": "\r\n It seems all three boys are transitioning back to school nicely.  Aside from a coughing spell that lost Alex a day of school, there have been no major incidents, no reported minor incidents of the negative kind, and a lot of \u201cwows!\u201d  Then, of course, Ben got his bearings and started being his own stubborn little self.  The honeymoon is over\u2014let the trouble begin!  And that\u2019s my Ben for you. \n It\u2019s been said many times, but:  If you know one person with autism, then you know ONE person with autism.  What\u2019s left out of that quite often is the apparent differences don\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with autism.  People have personalities.  Autistic people have personalities, too.  And, sometimes those personalities are \u201cproblems\u201d in and of themselves. \n Not that I\u2019m saying Ben is a problem, or that his personality is.  But, if you interact with Willy or Alex, and then interact with Ben\u2014well, autism isn\u2019t the all of it.  They\u2019re different people: wholly and completely different people from the nature and \u201cseverity\u201d of their autism to their coping mechanisms, from their interests to their strongest personal characteristics. \n Ben tests boundaries.  Sure, Alex and Willy do too, but Ben does so with a mixture of passion, determination, resourcefulness, and resilience that continues to amaze and astound.  This has nothing to do with his autism, but is part of his personality.  It\u2019s part of who he is; the ways it manifests are influenced by autistic traits, but this nature is inherent in all that is Ben. \n I\u2019ve been reading a lot of newsy stuff and I can\u2019t help but feel jaded.  There\u2019s still an overwhelming amount of \u201cautism is bad\u201d out there.  People go into details about what autism takes away and it\u2019s frustrating to read.  It\u2019s like they\u2019re so busy looking for what\u2019s not there, they don\u2019t see what is: a person, a unique person who is doing the best he or she can to exist in a world that wasn\u2019t made with his or her needs in mind.  Parents seem so flummoxed that they didn\u2019t get their mini-me, they\u2019re lost when it comes to seeing, being aware of the person their child really is. \n I don\u2019t get it.  I don\u2019t understand.  Why do parents get so stuck on having the child they want\u2014something they have no control over, something that few parents ever really get\u2014that they miss out on the child they have?  This isn\u2019t really an autism thing, either.  Some parents want their children to grow up to be doctors, but the children would rather be artists.  Some parents want their children to marry and have babies, but the children are perpetual bachelors or bachelorettes or\u2014gasp!\u2014they may even be gay. Why is it that so many parents try to force their children\u2014unique people who are very much themselves\u2014into some kind of mold that doesn\u2019t really fit?  Whether it\u2019s driving your child crazy with your lust for vicarious football glory or trying to make your autistic child normal, how do they justify it? \n Is it really so hard to respect the little people in your care? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/09/the-personality-of-the-matter/", "title": "The Personality of the Matter"},
{"date": "September 22, 2011", "body": "\r\n My step-son is living with us now. The dust from his arrival is settling, but I\u2019m not going to get into the details of all that. \n In the past, my stepson would stay with us for a weekend, or for longer during vacations from school. He was always presented with a few rules that he didn\u2019t have to face over at his mom\u2019s house. One of those rules was not to use the \u2018R\u2019 word. For a short duration, he could usually follow the rules with a few reminders, but it didn\u2019t impact much of his life outside our circle of influence. Now that he\u2019s living with us, the \u201cbig\u201d rules, like curfews and school work, are getting easier for him to follow, while the \u201clittle\u201d rules, like word and entertainment choices, are getting harder. \n On the one hand, it\u2019s very, very important that he feels at home here. On the other, there are some things I just cannot be okay with. The \u2018R\u2019 word is one of the latter. In my stepson\u2019s world, it\u2019s just something kids say, a means of expression. It\u2019s like \u201ctubular\u201d or \u201crad,\u201d if we want to go all the way back to the 80s. In reality, it is a label that refers to real people and uses the label as a negative. Despite my efforts to put the usage in context, he didn\u2019t get it. Sure, he\u2019d get it for a moment, but the moment would pass. My message never really sank in. \n We were recently watching videos on YouTube, finding ways to connect. One used the \u201cR\u201d word in the title and showed a horse with two legs running. He laughed. I didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t laugh. So, I had them do a search for \u201cthe \u2018R\u2019 word campaign.\u201d They chose to watch the video done by  Glee . The laughter stopped. Perhaps it was just another moment. I hope not. \n Part of it is just general compassion. There are real people who experience real hurt when they hear the word misused. Sure, fine, good. That would be enough. \n But there\u2019s more to it than that. When you misuse the \u201cR\u201d word, or any other disability-related word, you are perpetuating a system of beliefs that is detrimental, and potentially deadly, to my three younger children. My stepson doesn\u2019t get that. In part, that\u2019s a good thing. He can\u2019t imagine a world where people in authority would dismiss his little brothers so thoroughly that their very lives, let alone their liberties, would be in jeopardy. Unfortunately, whether he can imagine it or not, that is the world we live in. From current efforts to  dehumanize  autistics to our history of eugenics, my children are in danger. We live in a world where it\u2019s not safe to be autistic, it\u2019s not safe to be retarded, it\u2019s not safe to be disabled. Using the \u201cR\u201d word perpetuates that, it\u2019s one of the little things people do that says it\u2019s okay for it not to be safe for people with disabilities. And I\u2019m not okay with that. I will never be okay with that. He doesn\u2019t know that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019s still young enough for all of this to seem less than real for him. But all too soon ignorance will no longer be possible for him, and it\u2019s my job\u2014at least, in part\u2014to make sure he\u2019s ready. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.shiftjournal.com/2011/09/09/the-empathy-issue-is-a-human-rights-issue/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/09/the-r-word/", "title": "The \u2018R\u2019 Word"},

{"date": "September 12, 2011", "body": "\r\n There are a lot of new routines involved with the start of a new school year. Sometimes these are really old routines that we have to re-establish. This year, however, there\u2019re some new elements to our morning routines. \n Puberty does some interesting things to the body: hair growth, increased sweating, acne, greasy hair. Nighttime bathing used to be adequate. Now, Willy needs daily showers and taking them before bed just doesn\u2019t cut it. I remember enough about my own middle school experience to know that, while Willy hasn\u2019t run into any bullying yet, being the \u201cstinky\u201d one wouldn\u2019t help his chances. So, even though Willy hasn\u2019t gotten to the point where he takes particular care of his appearance (if he ever does), we\u2019re adding showering to his morning routine. \n In the past, Alex has usually been the one I get up first. Now, Ben is usually the one ready to go in the morning. Plus, since Willy\u2019s bus comes first this year, Ben comes after Willy is almost completely ready. Add that change to the change in bus schedule and this means Ben is usually completely ready long before his bus arrives. It\u2019s been difficult for Ben to know what to do. After all, he\u2019s awake, he\u2019s dressed, his shoes and backpack are on, maybe he\u2019s even eaten something. And then, what? He\u2019s just supposed to wait. But Ben doesn\u2019t like waiting. Ben likes doing. So, if the bus isn\u2019t just going to show up because he\u2019s all ready, then what\u2019s he to do? \n The first few days of this, Ben decided that he should go outside and get in the van (not that he made it that far), so I could drive him to school. After all, the bus obviously wasn\u2019t coming or it would have been here already. (This has happened a few times over the years, and once already this year, for various reasons.) Unfortunately, trying to keep Ben inside means I have less attention to finish getting the other boys ready. \n Today Ben was a little more tired than usual, but I think we finally have the routine established that Ben should, in the event that he\u2019s ready before the bus comes, do something else\u2014like play or color or something. Last Friday went well, today went well and I\u2019m hopeful we can keep it up. \n So my advice to my fellow parents is this: New routines can be stumbling blocks, but you have to give your kids time to adjust and communicate the changes so they know what to expect. Stick with it, and before you know it the morning routines will go by (almost) smoothly! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/09/establishing-new-morning-routines/", "title": "Establishing New Morning Routines"},
{"date": "October 30, 2011", "body": "\r\n One trait that seems common to autistic individuals is a need for order, for predictability, for sense to be made in this chaotic and unpredictable world\u2014it\u2019s often marked as a deficit. But I\u2019m not sure this is so different from typically developing people. I\u2019ve known more than a few control-freaks who have no other marked traits associated with autism. The difference is how they cope with their need for order and predictability. They apply a patina of control over the world by being rigid and driven, filling their lives with minutiae, and bullying others to conform to their ways of doing things. Their will is a formidable force to be sure, but I can\u2019t really see that sort of behavior as a positive. They don\u2019t look particularly odd, but they attain their semblance of control at the cost of others. Whereas, meltdowns aside, most of the autistic coping mechanisms are less destructive to others\u2019, but limit the abilities of the autists. \n For me, order isn\u2019t necessarily a matter of constructing a daily routine. I\u2019ve never found a good way to bring order to my day in the sense that I know what I\u2019ll be doing and when. If nothing else, the irregularity of my sleep cycle interferes with that in problematic fashion\u2014something to work on, definitely. I prefer order to start on a more macro level. I need to have goals for my life, and I set those goals at least five years out. Then I need to break those goals down to what I want to achieve in a given year, a given month, a given week. \n The problems I encounter are two-fold. First, I set the wrong goals. Second, life intrudes on my sense of order. In the last two years life has intruded a great deal. Very few of my plans have worked out. Many of those goals were just the wrong goals or the right goals at the wrong times. My goals also lacked a necessary balance\u2014I lacked goals that would improve or maintain my own health and well-being, like getting sufficient sleep on a predictable basis. The rest of it was the natural chaos that results from this messiness we call life. And, of course, I wanted to more than I was able to in the time provided. \n Recently, this has all come to something of a head. My train, rumbling ahead at high-speeds, derailed. The aftermath was devastating. It wasn\u2019t just a single point coming on done; it was the accumulation of my chaotic life paired with major and minor goals coming unraveled, seemingly one on top of the other before I could cope with the first. The cars piled up. The result was an inner life more mangled than manageable and an outer life that hasn\u2019t been working for far longer than I\u2019ve been willing to acknowledge. \n Sifting through the wreckage has taken some time. Making sense out of the pieces, identifying where I went wrong, and discovering ways to fix it have also taken time. The process isn\u2019t complete, either. But I\u2019m laying new track\u2014setting a new course\u2014and picking out new cars to put on the train that is my life. \n Order doesn\u2019t come naturally in this chaotic world.

You\u2019re allowed to make mistakes. You will make mistakes. It\u2019s inevitable; being a parent doesn\u2019t make you any less human. \n Some behaviors go beyond simple mistakes. \n Parenting is not a selfish endeavor. Parenting requires sacrifice and generosity, compassion and discipline, love and giving, helpfulness and respect. \n If you don\u2019t respect your child, you are a bad parent. \n If you don\u2019t care what\u2019s good for your child, you are a bad parent. \n If you abuse your child, you are definitely a bad parent. And I don\u2019t just mean smacking him or her around or subjecting him or her to sexual contact. Verbal abuse is abuse. Bullying and manipulation is abuse. Tearing apart your child\u2019s self-esteem is abuse. \n Children need to be loved and cared for. They need to be supported\u2014physically, financially, developmentally, and emotionally. \n We all make mistakes. We all go through rough patches. That\u2019s no excuse for abuse. \n When you abuse your child, when you don\u2019t care what\u2019s good for your child, when you constantly disrespect your child, when you bully your child, then you cross a boundary that you can\u2019t step back from. You can repent, you can make amends, but you cannot uncross that line. You can\u2019t take it back. \n Knowing the \u201csystem\u201d fails kids is different than seeing it in action with a child you\u2019re trying to protect. Knowing there are bad mothers out there is different than screaming into the phone at a woman who doesn\u2019t care about her child and only wants him for the financial aid he entitles her to. That and the feel of power it gives her to force him to do what she wants, regardless of what\u2019s good for him, regardless of what he wants and needs. \n I know there are worse people out there. I know things could be so much worse. But when the system fails, I also know a week, a day, or even an hour is too long to wait for the system to work. Holding a teary-eyed teen in your arms because he  has to go back  to a place where he\u2019s disrespected, abused, threatened, bullied and manipulated is awful. It doesn\u2019t help that it could be worse. Knowing that just makes it hurt more. Knowing I can\u2019t save him from yesterday, from last night, from this morning, and for however long it takes for the system to work is agony. \n A child is not a piece of property. A child is not a weapon to use in a personal war for power. Every child deserves to be loved, to be cherished, and to be nurtured. \n And if you don\u2019t believe that, if you don\u2019t get it, THEN DON\u2019T BE A PARENT!!! \n You\u2019re not worthy of the title. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/10/bad-mothers/", "title": "Bad Mothers"},
{"date": "October 11, 2011", "body": "\r\n Ben is talking. A lot. It\u2019s still not conversational. He\u2019s not stringing sentences of his own together to form complete, coherent, unique thoughts. But he is stringing sentences of dialogue and storytelling together. He\u2019s reciting long passages to himself and he recites them to communicate with others. \n His language has gone far beyond the simple parroting that is echolalia. Though, sometimes he repeats your words back to you in order to communicate. This means sometimes what he says is a bit off. If I say, \u201cI love you, Ben.\u201d He\u2019ll look me in the eye\u2014briefly!\u2014and say, \u201cI love you, Ben.\u201d If I then try to make the distinction, \u201cBen says, \u2018I love you, Mama.\u2019\u201d He\u2019ll say, \u201cI love you, Mama,\u201d instead of repeating the whole phrase. But Mark cuts out the confusion and leaves off the name: \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d \n Other times what he says has meaning within the repetition. We have a nighttime routine that consists of several shared phrases. One is \u201cSquishes and kisses or all done?\u201d If he wants lots of squishes and kisses, he\u2019ll say, \u201cSquishes and kisses\u201d every time I ask. If he\u2019s already reached his limit, he\u2019ll say \u201cAll done\u201d and then fake bonk himself on the head like he\u2019s being knocked unconscious. When he\u2019s just about squished up, but not quite, he\u2019ll say, \u201cSquishes and kisses or all done.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t say is, \u201cSquishes and kisses and then all done.\u201d But the meaning is clear, because he makes a choice about what he says. Whenever I try to shape the \u201cor\u201d into an \u201cand\u201d he fakes bonking himself on the head like he\u2019s being knocked unconscious and pushes me away if I try to engage him, whether our routine is finished or not. Ben wants nothing to do with this and/or distinction. Unless, of course, someone is singing \u201cConjunction Junction.\u201d \n As hard as it is for me to let go the important distinction between \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d\u2014for now, only for now\u2014it\u2019s more important to recognize the limits of shaping and the moment of choice.

He\u2019s quite capable of following our lead, but on this one thing he chooses not to\u2014and bedtime isn\u2019t the only time the distinction has been introduced and rejected.

{"date": "October 26, 2011", "body": "\r\n I\u00a0was sitting in my journalism class, trying to find a way to sit that would allow me to concentrate better by making me less conscious of my body when my professor said something that struck a chord. It wasn\u2019t a chord of similitude, but a chord of difference. The lecture was on overcoming writer\u2019s block. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve never had writer\u2019s block, but I\u2019ve read few descriptions of the phenomenon that really matched up with my own experiences. My professor\u2019s rendition was no different in that regard\u2014it didn\u2019t fit with my own experience. \n This is by no means meant as a comment on my professor\u2019s teaching. Aside from the obvious bias towards neurotypical processing and skills, he\u2019s a great teacher. He really cares, he\u2019s interested in learning our interests and helping us to develop them, and he\u2019s got some great insights to share. In a way, even his neurotypical bias is intriguing. I love reading about how different people think. How else\u2014unless someone describes their own thinking\u2014am I supposed to learn what really goes on in people\u2019s heads or how their brains work? \n Sure, yeah, I\u2019ve done Cognitive Empathy 101, but, frankly, I think the theory is baloney. People  assume  they understand what\u2019s going on in each other\u2019s heads, but there is a lot more variance than such assumptions account for. Some of the more obvious things, like whether someone is sad or troubled, provide insights into someone\u2019s emotional state. But you don\u2019t  really  know what\u2019s going on in their heads, nor do you  really  understand how their brains work. Just look at all the fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and various other art forms that try to express and/or explore the differences between male and female brains. Throw in autism, bipolar disorder, ADHD, child abuse, depression, addiction, personality types, sexual orientations, cultural differences, racial differences, intelligence differences, and just about anything else you can think of\u2014and, guess what, you\u2019ve got a lot of different brains working in a lot of different ways. Sure, some of those ways overlap and some differences are greater than others, but the thing about cognitive empathy is that it is based on an assumption of similitude that is, more so or less so, inaccurate. \n Back to the classroom. Back to my professor\u2019s description of the  work  he does (and has generalized to others) to flip between the right brain and the left brain in order to produce creative works. Hm. He described in considerable detail his process of pushing through left-brained (or conscious) writing to right-brained (or unconscious) writing. Hm? I mean, really? That\u2019s  work ? It takes  effort ? Really? Apparently it does. \n My brain doesn\u2019t work that way. I flip-flop between right- and left-brained thinking/writing almost at will. Sometimes\u2014rarely\u2014I\u2019ll need a jolt. And by \u201cjolt\u201d I mean a few minutes to stand up and pace to unwind the right-brained rant going on in my head so I can get back to the more critical, more responsible left-brained point I was trying to make. The switch, for the most part, is fluid. I can do it at will. It\u2019s not work. But that\u2019s just me. Well, I\u2019m sure there are others, but I don\u2019t  assume  everyone\u2019s brain can or should be so fluid. But, I also didn\u2019t know how much work, and how much crap, some people have to go through to make the switch. \n I have no idea whether this quirk of my brain indicates that I\u2019m closer to the autism spectrum, or if it indicates something else entirely. The point is that individual brains work differently. Each person is different. My brain is not some standard model issued out of some cognitive-empathy-friendly box. Few people I\u2019ve talked with understand the seething layers of discourse and distraction going on  in my head and only my head  almost constantly. Few people understand why writing is so much easier than talking for me: because writing forces my brain to work  consciously  on one and only one level at a time, while talking does not. \n In fact, when I described this internal noise to someone who had a limited knowledge of psychology (Psych 101, without independent and supplemental study), they told me it sounded like I was schizophrenic, except they just used the word \u201ccrazy.\u201d Of course, due diligence being what is and knowing enough about schizophrenia to know that it\u2019s not something I want to experience without professional help, I told my psychologist exactly what I told that individual. She laughed (in a friendly way, not as if she were laughing at me\u2014and yes, I can tell the difference). No, I\u2019m not schizophrenic and no I\u2019m not delusional. I just think too much. \n Yeah, well, I knew that. \n So, back to the whole brains thing\u2014differences make for different brains, different thought patterns, different thought styles, different coping mechanisms and different internal realities. I greatly admire and appreciate  Rachel\u2019s  efforts to tackle the myth that equates autism with a failure to empathize, but I\u2019ve really, really got to wonder about the people making these claims and  their  ability to empathize. While Rachel is making the distinction (and it\u2019s an important one) between cognitive empathy and emotional empathy, I really have to wonder if the first step to  true  cognitive empathy isn\u2019t the ability to recognize that other\u2019s people\u2019s brains may not (probably don\u2019t) work like yours does. What \u201cgets\u201d other people\u2014what makes them laugh, or cry, or smile, or dance, or whatever emotional response you want to insert here\u2014isn\u2019t necessarily going to be what makes you do the same. \n We\u2019re different. It\u2019s not a bad thing. It really, really isn\u2019t. If we were all the same, we wouldn\u2019t need fiction or nonfiction narratives. If we were all the same, we wouldn\u2019t need art or poetry or memoirs. If we were all the same, we\u2019d bore the life out of each other\u2014social contact would suck us dry and leave behind lifeless, boring husks of numbness. We wouldn\u2019t need to reach out, because the only people to reach out to would be others who were just like ourselves. I shudder to think of it. Different is good. Different is right. We\u2019re different for a reason, more so or less so, but all different. And I\u2019m glad for those differences. \n Now if we could all just figure out that communication\u2014not some magical, inaccurate \u201cknowing\u201d\u2014is how we connect. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journeyswithautism.com/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/10/creative-flip-flopping-a-thought-on-my-neurodiverse-brain/", "title": "Creative Flip-Flopping: A Thought on My Neurodiverse Brain"},

A throw-back, really, to a different time and place. The man as the breadwinner is a quaint notion. In contemporary times, you either need a breadwinner who is exceptionally good at providing or you need two breadwinners to provide for a family. And that\u2019s just to attain a middle class living. \n My husband was never that man. As a provider, he could eke us just over the edge of poverty. As a family, we\u2019ve never been homeless. As a family, we\u2019ve never been anywhere near starvation. But we have had our electricity shut off. We\u2019ve had our phone shut off. We\u2019ve had more cupboards that were bare than were full. We\u2019ve had problems that money could solve that we couldn\u2019t solve because we didn\u2019t have the money. We\u2019ve been on food stamps and we\u2019ve been on heat assistance and we\u2019ve accepted a lot of help from our families. \n Over seven years ago, we made a choice. We knew that, working the jobs he could get in the place we wanted to live, Mark wasn\u2019t ever going to be able to lift us as far above poverty as we wanted to be. We were urged to become a two-income household \u201clike everybody else,\u201d but instead we switched. \n Mark became the stay at home Dad. I went to college. I graduated. I started a business. I went to grad school. I started my first book (sort of, but that\u2019s a long story). I graduated. I revved up my business. I started another grad school program. I finished my first book. \n There\u2019s times when I feel like a failure because I\u2019m still a far cry from getting us to where I want us to be, but Mark is the first to remind me how much progress we\u2019ve made.

So, while there were some extra-lengthy rough patches in 2014, I\u2019m satisfied that we have done the best we could with what we were given and that we used what control we had, however limited it seemed, well enough to make progress this last year. \n Now, as I look ahead to the coming year, there are several things I expect out of 2015. For myself, I expect to publish my memoir, several smaller works, and (hopefully) a novel. I expect to grow both my business and my advocacy platform as well. I expect to become healthier, more balanced, and more joyful. Finally, I expect to be able to help others more. \n For Brandon, I expect a happy high school graduation. I expect him to discover more of what he wants to do after graduation. I expect him to start setting and realizing plans with which he can build the future he desires for himself. \n For Willy, I expect him to explore his interests in greater detail. Instead of passively watching videos and playing games, I intend to encourage him to begin learning to create them. (I also intend to provide him with the tools necessary to do so.) I expect him to grow and mature and to take greater charge of his own life. I hope he can make another friend to bring home, too. \n For Alex, I expect him to learn to use the new communication device he\u2019ll be receiving shortly. I expect the trend of communication to continue to grow exponentially, including using more words like the very clear and appropriate \u201cwater\u201d he just said. I expect him to use this new ability to share more of himself with us and others. \n For Ben, I expect him to better regulate himself so that he can use his interests and energy in kind and productive ways. I expect him to grow in his communication abilities so that he can use words to express his preferences clearly. I hope to hear him answer the question \u201cwhy\u201d a few times, too. \n Mark is always a tough one. I continue to hope that he will find ways to become more motivated and involved  outside  the Facebook/Twitter communities. \n And I hope we all do better at appreciating and exploring the social opportunities available to us! As for the world, sadly I think it\u2019s too much to hope for peace. Instead, I will hope for more moderation and fewer extremes in our national and international discourses. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/12/happy-2015/", "title": "Happy 2015!"},
{"date": "December 11, 2014", "body": "\r\n Socializing is work. It takes effort. Even when the people I am socializing with are people who mean the world to me, the people I love, and even the people I love who I also live with, it takes work to socialize. When I\u2019m overwrought, overwhelmed, overextended, overcommitted, and overtired, it takes a great deal of effort just to function. In those times, it\u2019s easier to pull in on myself than it is to socialize. \n I\u2019ve been there a lot in the last few months. I\u2019ll horde a small bit of energy for minimum-necessary-interactions, but I just can\u2019t \u201cbe there\u201d whenever I\u2019m wanted, or even whenever I\u2019m needed. According to a great deal of literature touching on a broad range of topics, this is not a \u201cbest practice\u201d for human relations. The emphasis is almost universally on \u201cbeing there,\u201d wherever you are, whoever you\u2019re with. If you\u2019re at work, then be there. If you\u2019re at home, then be there. If your home is your work, then set boundaries so you can be there with whatever set of tasks/people you\u2019re with at the moment. \n My conscience knows this is right and true. But, in these times of high demand and low self, it feels like a matter of survival to hold back. \n When it comes to minimum-necessary-interactions, I force myself to be there, as best I can, no matter what. When I get the boys up and off to school, when I tuck them into bed, and the little moments that happen every day in between. I know my children need me to be there during these moments. But even then, even when I try my best, I tend to be so tightly strung that it\u2019s far too easy for me to snap. \n Ben, my baby, my willful young man, tends to trigger my breaking points. He\u2019s not cooperative. He resists going to sleep. He resists waking up. Even with routines in place, there are transitions that he just doesn\u2019t like. Oh, sure, eventually he will fall asleep, and eventually he will wake up, and if these transitions occurred according to his natural rhythms, he\u2019d be just fine. But, like me, his rhythms are out of sync with the general public and the general public determines when school starts. To be honest, I don\u2019t like it any better than he does. There are times when homeschooling seems all too attractive, if only because we could keep our own wacky schedules. Then, I remember that there would still be doctors\u2019 appointments and a myriad of other engagements that have to be on someone else\u2019s schedule. So, while I sympathize with Ben, I don\u2019t give in. Except, sometimes I just don\u2019t have the energy to do it right and my being there just makes things worse. His stubborn streak sets in and our volumes rise and Alex gets upset and the reassuring morning routine turns to chaos. \n I\u2019m a kids-first kind of person. It\u2019s wired into my worldview. As the parent, it is my job to satisfy my children\u2019s emotional/social needs as best I can. I feel a great deal less responsibility for the emotional/social needs of other adults. This is especially hard on my husband. We\u2019ve been married for nearly seventeen years. We\u2019ve been through the proverbial fire together. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell whether we are interdependent or co-dependent or both, but we function best when we are in sync. But, when I pull back, I can\u2019t provide him with the emotional support he needs. I do save up some time/energy for him, too; but, it\u2019s not enough. He keeps trying to engage me when I have nothing left to give. And then there\u2019s my mother, who needs me too, and I have even less to spare for her. The guilt just adds to the stress. \n I live in a society that admires those who can \u201cstand alone.\u201d Self-sufficiency is encouraged. But there\u2019s another side of that. There are people who stand alone because they have to and there are people who stand alone because they can\u2019t/won\u2019t stand with others. Those of us who isolate ourselves may do it out of a need to survive\u2014a feeling that we have to pull in on ourselves, rely on ourselves, suffice ourselves in order to survive\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy. \n I can already hear the surge of criticism: I\u2019m defining \u201chealthy\u201d as \u201cnormal\u201d and all that. But that\u2019s not it. We isolate ourselves to survive, because we feel endangered by others. Sometimes this danger is real\u2014it is a learned response, after all\u2014but the response becomes ingrained, it becomes triggered not out of any true danger, but out of habit. Human beings, even those of us who function differently, are not wired to be alone, even when we tell ourselves quite convincingly that we are. We\u2019re not. \n Socialization may be work, but it\u2019s also a need. I know this, I understand this, yet the defense mechanisms remain. I know they can be changed. I know that I can change them, yet I feel as if I cannot. I feel as if I\u2019m trapped in the isolation of my own making. My husband reaches out, my mother reaches out, but I am as intangible as mist. I slip through their grasp. I go it alone through the dark, even as I scramble for the light. But there\u2019s no switch to flip. A lifetime of learning cannot be undone in a single moment. The darkness I see is behind my own eyes. It\u2019s inside me. It\u2019s a choice made too many times. But I can choose differently. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/12/self-isolation/", "title": "Self-Isolation"},
{"date": "December 17, 2014", "body": "\r\n If you\u2019ll recall, when the wars first got going, there was a significant amount of attention paid in the U.S. media to the needs of soldiers who had children with disabilities. Programs were created. Problems were solved. Families were taken care of while soldiers went off to war. \n Now, as our soldiers are returning from those wars, there is a significant amount of attention being paid to the needs of soldiers who have acquired disabilities while in service to our country. Some of these disabilities are physical in nature. Others are psychological or mental-emotional in nature. Some are both. Programs are being created. Problems are being solved. Our soldiers are being taken care of. \n One could easily argue that we, as a nation, don\u2019t do enough for our soldiers. I agree, but that\u2019s not my point. \n Both times, people with disabilities and people who had children with disabilities, people in the general population, were hopeful that the experiences of these soldiers would translate to more awareness, more support, and  more help  for people with disabilities who are citizens but not soldiers. Both times, people have been woefully disappointed. Before now, I never got why these incidents of increased awareness were never generalized. \n The public administration perspective, I\u2019m learning, is a rather peculiar worldview. The way working with government agencies shapes ones outlook on the world and its programs is somewhat surprising. After a while, though, it makes sense. As I have interacted with my instructors and my fellow students, I\u2019ve noticed that most of them, with very few exceptions, are far more invested in the PA worldview than I am. I\u2019m not just an outsider looking in; I\u2019m an outsider that is privy to a very intimate look at the worldview itself and how it is shaped. \n Despite the natural efforts to pull me into the group, I am most definitely an outsider. My purposes for being in this program are different than the common purposes shared by most of my peers. I have never worked for a government organization and I don\u2019t really intend to do so. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m in the program. I\u2019m not getting this degree to further my career. I am here to learn how to (and how not to) design and build nonprofit organizations that work. This program does serve that purpose\u2014I\u2019m learning, especially with the addition of my independent studies, what I need to learn, even when I didn\u2019t realize I needed to learn it. My unique perspective is also valued\u2014I\u2019m not being forced to conform (not that that works well with me anyway), nor am I being excluded. But I\u2019m still an outsider. I don\u2019t share their worldview, but I\u2019m starting to understand it and even appreciate it. \n From a PA perspective, meeting the needs of soldiers during the war helps us succeed in our war efforts. It may be a relatively small contribution, but these small contributions can add up to make a big difference. After the war, meeting the needs of soldiers is both a matter of duty and an investment in our ability to attract new soldiers for the next war or the next deployment. This forward-thinking focus is something I can appreciate; it shows that they recognize the impact their positive and negative actions have, which is very important. Unfortunately, that focus has side effects; the reason this attention to our soldiers\u2019 needs is not generalized to the non-military public is because the attention isn\u2019t really on the needs, but on the soldiers. \n For example, there is an effort in our government to help soldiers (with disabilities or not, but especially those with disabilities) obtain government jobs. They\u2019re given a priority in hiring and it\u2019s not only legal, but the requirement to do so is written into our laws. It is considered very important to give qualified veterans an especially good opportunity to work for the federal government and to benefit from support services and training to qualify for a position and to benefit from advancement opportunities once a position is obtained. There is also an effort in our government to help people with disabilities in a similar fashion. They also enjoy certain privileges in hiring that aren\u2019t available to the general public, and may even benefit from non-competitive hiring. BUT while the goals are similar and the methods are similar, the programs aren\u2019t linked. I can find little or no evidence in the consciousness of this worldview that there is a clear and discernible interconnected relationship between these two programs. We have soldiers (with or without disabilities) and we have people with disabilities. There is no recognized overlap. \n As an outsider, this is mindboggling. But as an outsider with an intimate view into how this worldview is formed and how it operates, it makes a \u201ccommon sense.\u201d I\u2019m not saying that it  makes sense ; just that it makes the kind of sense \u201cthey\u201d hold in common. \n Our government recognizes that we do not treat our soldiers as we should, and they\u2019re trying to do something to fix that. Our government recognizes that we do not treat people with disabilities as we should, and they\u2019re trying to do something to fix that. But they see both groups as distinct, separate demographics. They treat them as distinct, separate demographics. They address their needs as distinct, separate demographics. And, in doing so, they miss the point. It seems to me that they\u2019re so worried about missing the forest for the trees that they\u2019ve failed to understand that the trees aren\u2019t the forest. They don\u2019t realize that they can \u201csave\u201d the forest without really helping the trees. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/12/soldiers-disabilities/", "title": "Soldiers & Disabilities"},
{"date": "December 19, 2014", "body": "\r\n I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve revealed the specifics yet, but I know I\u2019ve reported my intention to start a nonprofit organization. In fact, I intend to start two from the very start. So, why, you might ask, must there be two? \n The goal of both nonprofit organizations is to seriously improve the quality of life available to and experienced by people with neurological disabilities and/or differences, regardless of the severity of those disabilities and differences. \n In order to do this, you have to proactively address two different spheres of influence: advocacy and service delivery. \n On the one hand, you  must  work at the (inter)national level. You must raise understanding, awareness, and acceptance. You must advocate change. You must influence society. You must influence legislation. And you must cooperate with other disability organizations to accomplish all of this. This is the advocacy sphere. \n On the other hand, you  must  work at the local level. You must provide opportunities for enrichment (building daily living skills, building social skills, building work skills, building household management skills, building business management skills, etc.) that meet the specific needs and goals of each individual. You must provide opportunities for employment (career planning, job hunting, business start-up, seed money, and job or business maintenance) that meet the specific needs and goals of each individual. You must also provide opportunities for empowerment (self-advocacy skills, issue advocacy skills, opportunities to advocate in the community, opportunities to advocate at home or with family, opportunities to advocate in the workplace, opportunities to advocate at the regional, national, or international levels) that meet the specific needs and goals of each individual. And you absolutely must have a way to navigate the various programs, services, and opportunities that are available in the local community so that the needs of each individual can be met and their goals can be achieved in a cost effective manner so the maximum number of people can be served with the resources available while still meeting quality standards. This is the service delivery sphere. \n If you put these two spheres of activity together under the same organization, you\u2019ll get an ineffective, inefficient organization. If, on the other hand, you have both spheres linked but separate, you can produce a powerful, driven set of organizations that meet the complex needs of people with neurological disabilities/differences in both areas that matter most. The (inter)national organization will actively advocate at the topmost levels of society; the local organization(s) will actively deliver the  individualized  services that are most desperately needed by people with neurological disabilities/differences. There will, of course, be overlap by design: the national organization will \u201cseed\u201d the local organizations, develop appropriate policies, and distribute the capital necessary to \u201cplant\u201d the organizations, while also holding functional local organizations to the conduct standards set in the organization\u2019s charter; the local organizations will \u201cfeed\u201d issues and problems to the national organization, which the national organization is responsible for addressing as the advocacy organization, and they will also develop the skills and provide the opportunities for volunteers/employees to move from the local to the national level. \n I\u2019ve been around enough to know that the way things are done for people in need\u2014in the U.S. at least\u2014has a tendency to function in such a way that creates dependence without really solving problems. A set of services are provided and people who need help can choose among the options that are available. If enough people have unmet needs after those selections are made, then a new service is created to meet those needs. But people aren\u2019t individuals. Decisions are driven by statistics, metrics, and policy goals. The idea isn\u2019t to help  people ; the idea is to help demographics. The result is that people aren\u2019t really helped in a way that satisfies their needs, facilitates their goals, or solves their problems. This occurs, in part, because these decisions are made far away from the people who are actually in need, by policy makers operating at the national and state levels. \n My goal is therefore two-fold. Create a system and processes that work by actually working with individuals with neurological disabilities and differences. The system and processes will be flexible enough to be individualized, but also knowledgeable enough to leverage available resources to provide as help as much as possible, yet independent enough to fill in the gaps as needed. This will transform the quality of life for the people I understand best and am most passionate about; yet, it will also create a model that can be used by other organizations (the national organization would facilitate this) in order to truly meet the needs of populations that my program is not designed to address. \n Usually this kind of holistic solution-oriented service delivery is restricted to select localities. A few local areas work together to solve problems. These solutions become case studies that are offered to other communities. The process is replicated, though the same results are not always achieved because the solution-oriented spirit of the process is gutted from the service delivery design. My hope is that by combining the local impact with the national reach, I can change this. So, there has to be two organizations, inextricably linked, but independently functioning. There must be two. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/12/why-must-there-be-two/", "title": "Why Must There Be Two?"},
{"date": "December 5, 2011", "body": "\r\n Lines are drawn in the sand. A community of interested, active participants is divided and shattered into ineffectual bits and pieces. People who care, who are knowledgeable, who mean well, who are willing to work for change\u2026people who should work together butt their heads against each other, wasting their energy on each other, arguing with CAPS, shouting across picket lines, reveling in the damage done to the other side. As these divisions are formed, it seems we are drawn to dichotomies. However much we know there are many sides, many points of view, and much room for both agreement and disagreement; we inevitably boil it all down to \u201cus\u201d or \u201cthem.\u201d And those who wield the power go on their merry ways, sacrificing the welfare of the many for the profit of the few, with no concerted effort to thwart them. \n The environment is discouragingly familiar. I find it sad and disappointing that I could be describing the autism community. You see, I left that environment years ago when I left the political blogosphere. I was tired of watching the citizens that make up this democracy turn on each other while those who held power exercised it with impunity. While there are legitimate debates between conservatives and liberals, and all the mid-points in-between, I couldn\u2019t stand watching either side defend their dirty politicians as if their talking-points were motivated by anything other than political self-interest. (Full disclosure: I was party to such behavior early in my foray into politics; it was listening to other \u201csides\u201d that helped me to see what was going on and it was my affinity for \u201cthe big picture\u201d that made it clear that positive change wouldn\u2019t come out of such dialogues.) \n I didn\u2019t expect that scene to be replayed in the autism community. I didn\u2019t expect to see the different sides within that community turn on each other with such force that it risked grinding the forward motion of the community to a halt. Yet, I see it happening. \n Sure, there\u2019ve been disagreements from the beginning. There have been sides. Some could be dismissed as fringy quacks. Others were in natural opposition. But lately it seems there is less and less reasonable discourse and discussion among those who used to be capable of it. Instead, we get vicious diatribes. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much room any more to speak and be heard by anyone who doesn\u2019t already agree with you. While self-advocates and parent-advocates are duking it out, those with power go along their merry way. \n I close my eyes and think about Gifford and the horrible days that followed her shooting. I think about how each side, pretty much ignoring what happened, turned on each other. I think about the recent snafu involving a Republican something-or-other distributing an image of President Obama as a zombie with a bullet through the head. I think about the verbal attacks that followed. I\u2019m not a Gifford fan. Nor am I an Obama fan. I\u2019m just a citizen who wants the middle ground to have a voice, too; a citizen who would rather work to fix what\u2019s wrong with this country than argue who is to blame for its unavoidable ruin. \n I close my eyes and try to imagine the autism community reaching the same caustic point. I wish I could say it was unimaginable, but the way we\u2019re going\u2026it\u2019s not. I can close my eyes (and without the benefit of mental pictures) see just how far astray this community could go. \n I left the political blogosphere because I couldn\u2019t stand what I was seeing. I\u2019ve \u201cspoken\u201d with several people in the autism blogosphere who are considering doing the same. With all due respect to what they were trying to do, the people who are calling that recent \u201cdialogue\u201d snafu a success have closed their minds to the terrible consequences of their poor judgment. Diatribes and personal attacks are not steps towards productive discourse. For many, that was a last straw. They\u2019ve opted out of such \u201cdiscussions.\u201d Now, if their voices are heard online at all, it will only be by those who are deemed \u201csafe.\u201d If that\u2019s a victory, then we all might as well pack our metaphorical bags and go home, because if fractures like that continue to be hailed as victories, the autism community will shatter. \n I, for one, don\u2019t want to see that happen. \n Time is against me. I have an idea. But it has to be done right. I need resources I don\u2019t have. I need collaborators and contributors. I need time. My conservative estimate is that I will need eighteen months to get everything into place in order to launch my idea to the public. A lot could happen in eighteen months. Voices may be lost. Irreconcilable differences may be formed. The autism community could easily shatter in eighteen months. \n But I can\u2019t walk away this time. I have to try.

\u00a0 You know that moment that you realized\u2014however it happened, whatever triggered it\u2014that something was wrong (or \u201cwrong\u201d) with your child, that your child\u2019s development was atypical, that you needed help to raise your child.\u00a0 If you fantasize about murdering your child, then you need to realize that there is something wrong with  you  and get the help you need.\u00a0 If you are having such fantasies, you have to realize  IT\u2019S NOT ABOUT YOUR CHILD , you have to realize  IT\u2019S ABOUT  YOU !!!\u00a0  There is something wrong with you. \n Believe me, anything\u2014yes  anything \u2014is better than murdering your child.\u00a0 If you do that, your child\u2019s life is over.\u00a0 Done.\u00a0 There\u2019s no coming back.\u00a0 There\u2019s no recovery.\u00a0 There\u2019s no hope.\u00a0 (Yes, I\u2019m a Christian and I believe in the resurrection after death, and  YES  I\u2019m still saying that, because you have  NO RIGHT  to send your child to heaven.\u00a0 God put your child on this earth for a purpose and  YOU HAVE NO RIGHT  to thwart that purpose by murdering your child, whatever your reasons may be.) \n Consider the possibilities:\u00a0 If you have to put your child in a horrible school (Alison\u2019s trigger), you can do something.\u00a0 You can advocate for changing the school, you make money to send the child to a private school, you can learn how to homeschool your child, you can move to another state or another country, you can  DO  something.\u00a0 If you kill your child, it\u2019s  OVER .\u00a0 You can\u2019t do  anything  to help your child. \n If you\u2019re not getting the services and support you need, you can do something.\u00a0 You can advocate for change, you can ask family, friends, neighbors, hell even  strangers  for help.\u00a0 You can knock on the door of every agency in your county until you get a lead.\u00a0 You can apply for grants.\u00a0 You can build your own support network.\u00a0 You can  DO  something.\u00a0 If you kill your child, it\u2019s  OVER .\u00a0 You can\u2019t do  anything  to help your child. \n If you really can\u2019t handle your child (or  feed your child ), then give your child up.\u00a0 Put your child in foster care.\u00a0 As horrible as foster care can be, it\u2019s better than being  DEAD .\u00a0 Even if the child will end up in an institution, being in an institution is better than being  DEAD .\u00a0 Your child can recover from an institution.\u00a0 There are people who are working to change the system and help children just like yours.\u00a0 You can take your child out of foster care when you\u2019re better. \u00a0You can  DO  something.\u00a0 There\u2019s a course of action, a way to help.\u00a0 If you kill your child, it\u2019s  OVER .\u00a0 There\u2019s no next step.\u00a0 You can\u2019t help your child any more, nor can anyone else. \n If you are fantasizing about murdering your child, then I see two possibilities:\u00a0 Either you\u2019re experiencing some kind of mental health issue or you are evil.\u00a0 Chances are it\u2019s the first one. \n Despair is not an excuse for fantasizing about murdering your child.\u00a0 Despair is certainly not an excuse for doing so on an internationally distributed video that makes it seem like it\u2019s okay to murder autistic children. \n Mental illness is not an excuse for fantasizing about murdering your child.\u00a0 Mental illness is certainly not an excuse for doing so on an internationally distributed video that makes it seem like it\u2019s okay to murder autistic children. \n There is no excuse for that kind of behavior.\u00a0 There\u2019s no justification.\u00a0 There\u2019s no reasonable explanation.\u00a0 And, by God, I hope that Alison has apologized to her daughter, because that\u2019s what loving parents do when they\u2019ve hurt their children.\u00a0 I also hope she finds it in herself to apologize to people with autism and to the world at large. \n Now, back to  Sharon\u2019s post , I won\u2019t write Alison off.\u00a0 I won\u2019t write her Autism Science Foundation off.\u00a0 There is the possibility of redemption.\u00a0 There is the possibility of forgiveness.\u00a0 There is still the possibility to do some great good for people with autism. \n But I won\u2019t excuse her behavior either.\u00a0 What she did was wrong.\u00a0 There is no justification for it.\u00a0 There are no acceptable excuses.\u00a0 Her behavior was  WRONG!!! \u00a0 Her words hurt people\u2014real people with real feelings.\u00a0 She can\u2019t explain it away and expect the people she hurt to just let it go.\u00a0 I can\u2019t just let it go.\u00a0 I won\u2019t.\u00a0 Not until she admits that what she did was wrong and  apologizes .\u00a0 Because that\u2019s what ethical, responsible people do. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/", "http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/2011/12/leave-alison-alone.html", "http://www.examiner.com/x-21742-Long-Island-Autism-Examiner~y2009m9d7-Why-autistic-people-dont-like-Autism-Speaks#comments", "http://autismsciencefoundation.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/speaking-out-about-autism-every-day/", "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57337766/mom-denied-food-stamps-shoots-kids-kills-self/", "http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/2011/12/leave-alison-alone.html"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/01/why-its-not-okay/", "title": "Why It\u2019s Not Okay"},

{"date": "December 12, 2011", "body": "\r\n When Alex was first \u201cthreatened\u201d with failure to thrive, I looked for information outside the clinical setting. At first, I didn\u2019t find anything that could help me with Alex. Sure, there was generic information geared towards the needs of infants, but Alex was not an infant and sensory aversions weren\u2019t even mentioned in the articles or database entries I could find. I was surprised and disappointed, to say the least. \n Furthermore, my research about autism and diet or autism and feeding would often turn up results that I had no interest in. I\u2019m referring to GF/CF diets, herbal supplements and the like, all claiming to alleviate or cure autism to one degree or another. Now, I readily admit we tried the GF/CF diet, which turned out to be a good way to starve our kids. (Not that we let it go that far.) After all, the reason that Alex was on the verge of failure to thrive was because he\u2019s very stubborn about what he will and will not eat; and bread that is GF/CF is not, to Alex\u2019s mind, actually food. (Honestly, I\u2019d have to agree with him on that.) \n Later, I stumbled across some information, but it was written by researchers for researchers or medical professionals, not for parents. Occasionally I\u2019d stumble across a pertinent article, but rarely did it offer anything new or insightful. \n Now, Alex and Ben are both doing well. They\u2019re gaining weight. Both of them actually have a visible layer of fat around their muscles! As much as obesity is a problem in this country (and a personal problem, in my case), fat on my kids is good. They\u2019ve got plenty of energy, which wasn\u2019t really a problem for Ben, but it used to be a problem for Alex. They\u2019re both expanding their diets and getting the nutrients they might otherwise lack through prescriptions of PediaSure. In short, they\u2019re thriving. \n It\u2019s been a long road and now that we\u2019ve traveled so far, I\u2019m hoping to gather information from reputable sources and create a guide for others to use, the kind of guide I wish I\u2019d had. \n Along those lines: Do you have experiences with feeding issues?

{"date": "December 14, 2011", "body": "\r\n Alex turned twelve over the weekend. For eleven days out of the year, Willy and Alex are \u201cthe same age,\u201d which pleases Willy to no end, though Alex doesn\u2019t seem to care one way or the other. To celebrate Alex\u2019s birthday, we had an Alex-centric meal of pizza, followed by brownies, because he prefers brownies to cake. \n Alex is very much a Wisconsinite when it comes to the consumption of cheese. Cheese is Alex\u2019s primary source of protein, including cheese sticks (not individually wrapped), grilled cheese sandwiches, and, of course, cheese pizza. He likes to peel the melted cheese off the pizza and squish it into a cheese-laced-with-tomato-sauce blob. Then, he eats the blob. He eats the pizza crust last. Well, he might. But he might not. This time he ate some of it, but concentrated on the cheese on the pizza and the breadsticks. He\u2019s a very loyal cheesehead, just so long as you don\u2019t expect him to care that  the Packers are kicking butt . \n Of course, when it came to presents, he had to get something VeggieTales, so I got him  The Pirates Who Don\u2019t Do Anything . The boys love it, though apparently it\u2019s not as good for stimming as  Moe and the Big Exit . I also decided to try something new. I bought him a gyroscope. I figured as much as he likes to look at things from all angles and as much as he likes things that spin, a gyroscope might be a good toy for him. So far it\u2019s been met with a mixed reception. He likes it, but it\u2019s not as interesting as VeggieTales. Go figure! One the up side, I learned the basics of how a gyroscope works, though this one doesn\u2019t seem to be properly balanced. \n As wonderful as Alex\u2019s birthday celebration was, I can\u2019t help but take a moment to reflect on Alex getting older. He\u2019s twelve. He\u2019s a pre-teen. In a year, he\u2019ll be a teenager. Somehow his delays seem more significant in that context. While other kids his age are starting to look at gender differences and are exploring their feelings towards potential dates, Alex is still watching a show which is designed to teach little kids Biblical lessons. \n I\u2019m guessing that pronounced developmental differences like these are what lead to the perpetual-youth-myth when it comes to kids with severe disabilities. The myth certainly does have its appeal. How do you teach a young man who doesn\u2019t talk, who has little control of his own waste removal, who is still fascinated with little kids\u2019 shows, who, as per his own behavior, seems like a little kid, about his own sexuality? How do you prepare this young man for the decision he\u2019ll face as an adult? \n It would be easier to deny his sexuality and impending adulthood. He has the mind of a child, so he is a child. He\u2019ll always be a child. We will always have to make his decisions for him. He\u2019ll never be sexually active. He\u2019ll never decide how he wants to live as an adult. That\u2019s just the way it is. \n There\u2019s something appealing about that line of thinking. You see, if it were true, it would make things so much easier. And that\u2019s the crux of it. Being a caregiver\u2014oh the tremendous, horrible burden of caring for someone with special needs!\u2014is easier than conscientiously parenting a child with special needs into the adult they will become, and putting the work and the skill-building into the effort so the child will be the best adult they can become. \n It would be easier to deny Alex\u2019s maturing sexuality, but I can\u2019t. If you\u2019re willing to admit and are in position to observe his more intimate functions, like changing diapers and bathing, you\u2019ll realize that his sexual development isn\u2019t going to wait for his emotional and mental development to catch up. It\u2019s already started. To deny that won\u2019t help anyone. Which isn\u2019t to suggest that I have any idea what to do about it, but it does mean we\u2019re going to have to come up with something better than burying our heads in the sand singing la-la-la-I-can\u2019t-hear-you. \n It can be difficult when your child becomes a teenager, as Brandon has proven for us. It will be difficult helping Willy to grow into his new role as a teenager. In a way, we don\u2019t have to worry about some of the same things with Willy that we do with Brandon. But we\u2019ll worry about other things. Alex becoming a teenager is going to be something else entirely. I just don\u2019t know what yet. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to handle that or what we\u2019re going to do. For a long time, these problems seemed so very far away. Now, they\u2019re almost here and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n But I do know that I won\u2019t fall into the perpetual-youth trap. Easier doesn\u2019t make it better. It certainly doesn\u2019t make it honest. Alex is going to mature. He is going to become an adult. And it\u2019s my job as a parent to figure out how to help him do so as best as we all can. Just like it\u2019s my job to help Brandon and Willy become the best adults they can be. \n It\u2019s not about what\u2019s easiest. It\u2019s about Alex. And Alex grows, matures, and changes, even though his development is at its own pace and on its own track. He may not appear much like a typical pre-teen, but he is a pre-teen nonetheless. His body is maturing. He\u2019s growing up. Denial is not the answer. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://packersnews.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20111211/PKR07/111211042/Mike-Vandermause-column-Winning-streak-begins-winning-mindset", "http://www.veggiepirates.com/", "http://store.veggietales.com/moe-the-big-exit-veggietales-dvd.html"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/12/my-little-cheesehead-is-growing-up/", "title": "My Little Cheesehead is Growing Up"},

I know I mentioned it on Facebook, but I don\u2019t know where all I\u2019ve said it, so if this is news, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s the trouble with multiple platforms, I guess. \n Bowling is an interesting sport. Not only do you have your special shoes and your mysterious rules, but you\u2019re playing this sport in a neon-lit whirligig of activity. You switch lanes every other turn. People mill around you socializing. Other bowlers shout out their victories or bemoan their failures. \n Then, there are the social aspects: interactions between teammates and between teams, comments from parents and spectators, directions from the coach to the kids. And there are the physical aspects: the weight of the ball in his hand, the sequence of steps which is more complicated than it seems, and the need to heft, to swing, to aim, and to release. And then there\u2019s the lingo: strikes and spares, pickups, and gutter balls\u2026I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more, but that\u2019s all  I\u2019ve  picked up so far. \n This is a complex little microcosm that Willy has scuttled into. And I\u2019m at something of a loss on how to help. Suffice it to say that I can\u2019t teach Willy to bowl. Though, I do observe what other players are doing and what Willy\u2019s not, and the results of those differences. Like, every time he points his thumb at the gutter right as he releases the ball, the ball goes straight into the gutter before it gets even halfway down the lane. This, if you weren\u2019t aware, is not a desired result. So, I try to advise Willy on that angle. But mostly I just encourage him and try to pick up what I can from the helpful people around me. \n Willy\u2019s talked about quitting once, though it was after a four-day weekend, too little sleep, and the challenges of re-adjusting to his schedule. By the time he came home, he decided he wanted to stick with it, but that he really wanted me there. I wasn\u2019t looking for another time commitment, and I really don\u2019t feel very useful, but if it helps him in some small way\u2026then I guess I\u2019m going bowling.

{"date": "December 16, 2011", "body": "\r\n There are many ways to be an advocate. There are many causes we can cling to and many ways we can do it. I tend to be a broad scope kind of advocate. There are too many issues and too many grievances for me to hunker down and focus on one. I\u2019m not really the go-to-gal for anything. Geez, I can\u2019t even stick wholly and purely to autism. \n There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n But there\u2019s also nothing wrong with having a focus, a cause, a very real problem you want to shout about from the rooftops. \n Sue  is a dear friend with a real problem.

Sue and I are proof that we can support each other. \n Believe me, bullying isn\u2019t a topic you should ignore. Bullying hurts. It hurts the victim. It hurts the witnesses. It hurts the bullies, too. I have no statistics to back me up in this, because, after all, neither statistics nor bullying are my areas of expertise, but I feel 100% confident that your child is going to be bullied, be the one doing the bullying, or witness bullying. Both my two bigger boys, one who is \u201ccool\u201d in all the typical senses of the word and one who is \u201ccool\u201d in the unique way that he is and in the awesome way that he\u2019s been embraced by his peers, have witnessed bullying. Both boys have had bullying touch their lives. My \u201ccool\u201d kid, the one who I\u2019d have least worried about being the subject of bullying, at least at school, has actually been the one to experience it the most. He\u2019s had friends who were bullies, he\u2019s been bullied, and he\u2019s see those he loves being bullied by others\u2014sometimes by his own friends. Willy, who is lucky to be embraced by his peers as a \u201cdifferent kind of cool,\u201d has seen his friends bullied and has been hurt by what he saw. I\u2019m proud to say that both my boys have spoken out against bullying. \n I\u2019m proud of my two boys who go out of their way to condemn bullying. But they got that way, in part, because of what I\u2019ve shared with them. A lot of what I\u2019ve shared with them, especially lately, has come through the information, links, and other tidbits that Sue has shared with me. Simply said, Sue is helping me raise better children. I\u2019m grateful for that, and I\u2019m proud to know her and call her friend. It saddens me that, as supportive as I know this community can be, she\u2019s not getting the kind of support and encouragement she needs. She\u2019s doing good work. Please, check her out, support her efforts, and take a few moments out your day to spread the message that bullying is not okay, that it hurts, that the damage can be lasting and painful. Stand up against bullying. It doesn\u2019t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don\u2019t have to make bullying your one cause. But, please do something to let those people who\u2019ve been the victims of bullying know that you care. Do something to stop a bully from thinking their behavior is acceptable. Just do something. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://dswalkerauthor.com/", "http://dswalkerauthor.com/2011/12/08/misfits-on-the-island-of-misfit-toys/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/12/may-i-have-your-attention-please/", "title": "May I Have Your Attention, Please?"},
{"date": "December 23, 2011", "body": "\r\n Recently  Gavin  wrote about  executive functioning .\u00a0 I  started with Willy , and now I\u2019m going to explore executive functioning in low-functioning autism. \n In the first post, I provided a recap of Willy\u2019s development on the autistic spectrum.\u00a0 Now, here\u2019s Alex\u2019s:\u00a0 Unlike Willy, Alex never developed typically.\u00a0 This means, in short, that Alex didn\u2019t regress, because he never developed the social and communication skills that Willy demonstrated early on and lost.\u00a0 Throughout Alex\u2019s life, he\u2019s been delayed.\u00a0 These delays are often regarded as a combination of autism and cognitive disability, but the latter has not been proven.\u00a0 It is often assumed simply because it hasn\u2019t been  disproven .\u00a0 Alex\u2019s disabilities are very visible.\u00a0 His inability to speak effectively for communication, his body movements, his toe-walking, and his vocalizations and mannerisms all make sure that Alex stands out as someone who is different. \n With regards to Alex, there is so much focus on other deficits that executive functioning gets short shrift.\u00a0 For example, Alex has no effective means of communication.\u00a0 This is a big, huge barrier, a serious disability which has far-reaching implications.\u00a0 Every aspect of Alex\u2019s development suffers because of the communication barrier.\u00a0 Thus, the communication challenges get a great deal of attention.\u00a0 Added to that, Alex lives in a state of near-constant dysregulation.\u00a0 This, too, gets a lot of attention.\u00a0 Most of the therapy and educational services Alex receives focuses on one or the other or both.\u00a0 A fraction of our energy is focused on building independent living skills, like getting dressed, getting his coat and shoes on, putting things away, and completing routine chores.\u00a0 To a certain degree, these skills often involve fine motor skills, which is another area of deficit.\u00a0 But to a greater degree, all these skills rely on executive functioning skills.\u00a0 And, lo and behold, when I stop to think about it, Alex has fewer executive functioning skills than Willy and fewer accommodations and supports to compensate for that deficit. \n See, for Willy the example of \u201cget ready for school\u201d used  in Gavin\u2019s post  describes his need to break down regular tasks to a more basic level of instruction.\u00a0 I can tell Willy \u201cIt\u2019s time to get ready for school\u201d and then break that major activity into minor tasks like, \u201cIt\u2019s time to wash your face and your hair, then take your shower\u201d and \u201cGet dressed, then come put on your shoes.\u201d\u00a0 If I were to try that sort of thing with Alex\u2026well, just forget about that.\u00a0 It\u2019s not going to happen. \n For one, Alex is still in diapers and he doesn\u2019t change them himself.\u00a0 And that\u2019s where things get kind of\u2026well, once I seriously start thinking about this, I\u2019m not proud of my responses.\u00a0 You see, I coach Willy through his morning routine.\u00a0 I provide support to help him get himself ready.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t been doing that with Alex. I\u2019d just do it for him.\u00a0 On the surface of things, it would just take too much time and too much effort for me to coach Alex through these activities.\u00a0 Then again, it\u2019d been a long time since I\u2019d tried, since it\u2019s easier to just do it for him.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t help Alex build skills nor does it give him the opportunity to exercise the executive functioning skills he has.\u00a0 \n So, I tried an \u201cexperiment.\u201d\u00a0 Instead of doing everything for him, I broke the tasks down to a level Alex could do independently.\u00a0 I changed his diaper, and then, instead of dressing him, I handed him his each article of clothing as independent tasks.\u00a0 \u201cPut on your socks.\u201d\u00a0 When he\u2019d complied, \u201cNow, put on your pants.\u201d\u00a0 Then, after he\u2019d done that (and gotten some help with the snap and zipper), \u201cNow, put on your shirt.\u201d\u00a0 At that level of instruction, and with some assistance on the fine-motor tasks, he was able to dress himself. \n And we haven\u2019t even gotten to Ben yet.\u00a0 See, often I describe Ben as being in between Willy and Alex.\u00a0 That\u2019s mostly the focus on language and sensory management.\u00a0 In those areas, Ben is between Willy and Alex.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t talk as much as Willy, but he\u2019s a more effective communicator than Alex.\u00a0 He\u2019s not as regulated as Willy, but he\u2019s more regulated than Alex.\u00a0 But, when it comes to executive functioning, Ben is still further behind than Alex.\u00a0 I just do things for him.\u00a0 And, to a great degree, that\u2019s not likely to change any time soon, because he\u2019s still working on things at a more basic level.\u00a0 With Willy, it\u2019s \u201cget dressed, then put on your shoes.\u201d\u00a0 With Alex, it\u2019s \u201cput on your pants, then put on your shirt.\u201d\u00a0 With Ben, it\u2019s \u201cpull the shirt over your head, then put your arms through the sleeves.\u201d \n The take-away lessons here are: \n 1) Executive functioning deficits apply to low-functioning autism as well as high-functioning autism.\u00a0 Thus, parents shouldn\u2019t scoff at \u201cexecutive functioning\u201d as a real sign of disability, instead they should look at their child and consider how they can help him or her become more independent by providing accommodations and support at their child\u2019s level regarding executive functioning tasks.\u00a0 They should take a look at their child and the ways they help their child to see if they\u2019re building skills or taking the easy way out.\u00a0 They should take a moment to consider whether sensory dysregulation is the culprit for the most recent meltdown or whether it might be confusion or frustration with regards to executive functioning.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let the invisible fall to the wayside just because there are more visible disabilities; don\u2019t assume they can\u2019t, just because they require support and accommodations to succeed. \n 2) More than that, one thing I think we should all be considering more seriously is if managing deficits in executive functioning are best served by coping mechanisms and accommodation strategies, or if there is a skill-building aspect to it that we haven\u2019t properly considered (or that I\u2019ve never seen properly considered). \n Is there another way of looking at these abilities (another context or frame they could be put into) that would translate them from the typical mindset to an autistic mindset?\u00a0 For example, visual schedules are one of the accommodation strategies that are used.\u00a0 Is there another level we could take that to that would translate that accommodation into an independent skill that is developed and then self-sustained? \n *Please note that I will be taking a week off of blogging.\u00a0 I'm going to have an at-home vacation.\u00a0 My next post will be up on Jan. 2, 2012.\u00a0 It's already written and scheduled, so I can't forget.* \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://life-with-aspergers.blogspot.com/", "http://life-with-aspergers.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-lack-of-executive-functioning-may.html", "http://life-with-aspergers.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-lack-of-executive-functioning-may.html"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/12/executive-functioning-in-low-functioning-autism/", "title": "Executive Functioning in Low-Functioning Autism"},
{"date": "November 14, 2011", "body": "\r\n I recently finished  Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg\u2019s  books,  The Uncharted Path  and  Blazing My Trail . I\u2019ll do a full review of each book, I promise, but those will have to wait. Right now I must address one urgent issue particular to those adults who either are on the autism spectrum or those who, like me, are close to being autistic, but don\u2019t quite meet the diagnostic requirements. \n As I\u2019ve said before, and will again, I have many of the traits attributed to autism, including sensory processing difficulties, language processing peculiarities (a marked difference between speech skills and writing skills), and social processing difficulties. Were it not for the facts that autism (as it is defined by society) is a disability and that many people with legitimate diagnoses of autism struggle much, much more than I do (including all three of my children) and that I feel expressing my experiences as being equivalent to their experiences would detract from their struggles\u2026were it not for these things I would feel wholly comfortable calling myself autistic. \n Before I discovered autism in order to understand my children, I had never really understood what set me apart from my peers. I never understood myself. I\u2019ve never felt I belonged in a community better than I belong with autistic adults. While I\u2019ve always (as far as I can recall) understood that people have different gifts and different abilities, before I discovered autism I\u2019d always more or less assumed people experienced the world in more or less the same way. I just wasn\u2019t very good at coping with it. \n Compared to the ideal neurotypical, I\u2019m still not good at coping with it. Compared to the struggling autist, I am quite good at coping with it. And, that\u2019s the thing. As far as I understand current diagnostic standards, I don\u2019t qualify for a diagnosis of autism because I cope too well. I\u2019m not disabled. Sure, coping is hard work. Sure, there are some days when I just don\u2019t want to cope with the outside world. There are days when I dread answering the telephone, and would much rather the person trying to contact me via a letter or an e-mail. Sure, I freeze in social situations most people take for granted. But, when it comes to traversing my day-to-day life, and getting by in the world at large, I can cope more or less successfully. \n (This is not some sort of gloating self-congratulatory baloney. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being disabled\u2014except for the lack of acceptance, accommodation, and appreciation from the world at large, but that\u2019s a problem with the world, not a problem with being disabled.) \n The point is that I cannot, in good conscience, consider myself disabled. I struggle, but I can cope without the kinds of accommodations others  need  to cope. Sure, those same accommodations would make coping much less work for me. But I can do it on my own, with my own self-provided coping mechanisms and accommodations. There are many people who can\u2019t and they deserve the focus of the autism community much more than I do. \n I\u2019ve struggled to communicate this position of being between to my readers, my family, my friends, and anyone else who has a need to know or who just might be interested. I was confident that I\u2019d gotten it down (though there are still those who want to call me autistic and those who are offended when I consider myself close-but-not-quite). \n But, perhaps it was time for my understanding to change. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journeyswithautism.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Uncharted-Path-Journey-Late-Diagnosed-Autism/dp/0984138803/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1290727803&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Blazing-My-Trail-Living-Thriving/dp/0984138811/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318214337&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/11/imminent-burn-out-part-1-where-i-stood/", "title": "Imminent Burn-Out?

{"date": "November 21, 2011", "body": "\r\n Again, I knew I was  adjacent to the autism spectrum , I read about  Rachel\u2019s experiences , and  I panicked . \n The threat to autistic children is real. The threat to autistic adults is real. Combine the two and the threat becomes even stronger. And these threats apply directly to my family. This is why I fight. This is why I advocate. It\u2019s not the only reason, of course. If my family was suddenly safe from all future threats, if we got a pass on all the discrimination and prejudice, well then I\u2019d still fight\u2014because nobody should have to face this kind of threat. But we do. It\u2019s real. Right now, my boys cannot advocate for themselves on this level. They cannot face down CPS and win. They shouldn\u2019t have to; I shouldn\u2019t have to. But I had to and I did, but if I had to do all over again, with the loss of functioning that Rachel described, I would lose. And that possibility is incredibly scary. The consequences for my children are terrifying. \n Reading Rachel\u2019s words, I felt this terrible ticking clock hanging over my head. I drive myself hard\u2014too hard. I know that. Everybody who knows me (in-person) knows that. Periods of burn-out, of being too tired to keep up, of running out spoons, of hiding in my basement office to avoid the very loud noises my children make when they\u2019re all playing in parallel\u2014these things are inevitable, and as long as Mark and I are a team and I can keep up my end of the bargain, they\u2019re just part of the flow of our lives. \n But what if I couldn\u2019t keep up? What if it wasn\u2019t temporary? What if it stretched on for months or years? Pardon my language please, but my thoughts could best be summed up:  Oh shit! Is that going to happen to me? \n I kept reading. I finished  The Uncharted Path  and moved onto  Blazing My Trail  and\u2026I kept reading, sighing in relief. While I don\u2019t mean to minimize the significance of burn-out, the dramatic shift in abilities got a new explanation in  Blazing My Trail . They were due, to a great degree, to a medication she took that made things worse instead of better. \n The relief was palpable. I know with certainty never to take that drug. Besides, I\u2019m horrible about taking daily medications. And I try medication only as a last resort\u2014or after significant experience that it will be necessary, such as with bronchitis and antibiotics. And, well, the only time I found a psychological medication (for example, an anti-depressant) that didn\u2019t provide more side-effects than positive effects was when I had that terrible reaction to a birth control shot that lead to a serious case of post-partum depression. The drugs then were just a temporary fix to get me by until the birth control hormones were out of my system and it was only effective because my depression was more poignantly chemical than usual and far stronger than I usually experience. \n So, avoid drugs\u2014check. \n But, that\u2019s not enough. She also described a plan that helped her regain abilities she\u2019d feared she\u2019d lost forever. It was simply a matter of taking care of herself and being responsive to her distinct needs. \n Now, that\u2019s not as easy or as obvious as it sounds. Not for me. I\u2019d always thought that I should be my lowest priority, after family, God, work, school, friends, etc. I knew I had to sharpen the saw and all that\u2026but that didn\u2019t make it a priority, did it? Not really. Certainly not. \n This scared me into reevaluating and reassessing the importance of my own well-being. Because, yes, actually, I am a priority. As a caretaker, I need to take care of myself so I can continue to take care of others. It seems obvious. In fact, I  knew  it, on an intellectual level. Reading Rachel\u2019s story has made it visceral. \n So, take better care of myself\u2014check. \n I can\u2019t stop pushing myself. There\u2019s too much to do. But I don\u2019t have to push myself so hard that I break. I don\u2019t have to ignore my own needs and well-being. In fact, if I pay attention, I\u2019ll be able to do more, because I won\u2019t get quite so tired. \n But, wow, was it a scary, rocky trip\u2014and I didn\u2019t even have to live through it! \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Uncharted-Path-Journey-Late-Diagnosed-Autism/dp/0984138803/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1290727803&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Blazing-My-Trail-Living-Thriving/dp/0984138811/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318214337&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Blazing-My-Trail-Living-Thriving/dp/0984138811/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318214337&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/11/imminent-burn-out-part-4-the-next-word-and-resolutions/", "title": "Imminent Burn-Out?

Then, I read  Rachel's  book  The Uncharted Path . \n As the full title,  The Uncharted Path: My Journey with Late-Diagnosed Autism , implies, Rachel was not diagnosed as a child. Rachel lived for 50 years with no explanation for the ways she experienced life. Essentially, Rachel passed, or strived to pass, as neurotypical\u2014for 50 years. She coped, she lived a successful life, she had relationships, she had a child, and she had a career\u2014for 50 years. \n Then, she started researching autism in regards to her father, and that sense of similitude that maybe it applied to her as well crept in. This search for answers culminated with an official diagnosis: \n After a half-century of feeling invisible, unworthy, and utterly strange, I wanted someone else to see me, to hear me, to understand me, to take me seriously, and to not send me away until I got a label that made sense. ( UP , page xiv) \n Sure, she struggled. Sure, it was work. But she coped. Self-doubts (I am oh-so familiar with those) aside, she  coped  for  fifty years ! \n I used to be able to do so much. I could get up in the wee hours of the morning, drive long distances, go grocery shopping, work full-time at a demanding job, teach my daughter, support my family, pay the bills, cook the meals, clean the house, plan birthday parties, include all the neighborhood children in our holiday celebrations, exercise, and do just about anything anyone asked me to do, except stand on my head. ( UP , page 98) \n And then, she burned-out. She stopped coping. She lost functioning. \n Those times are over. I\u2019m sad that they\u2019re over, and I\u2019m also very relieved. I\u2019m finally learning that I am not an infinitely renewable resource. Walking through the world and taking care of myself is a lot of work. I have to use my energy wisely. As I experience the effects of a lifetime spent defying the way I was made, taking care of myself is the most vitally important work I can do.

I felt a similitude to that woman who pushed herself so hard and did so much for others\u2014career, family, friends. I understand, because I do it. I\u2019m living that life right now. And I get tired.  I run out of spoons. \n And that\u2019s where the fear comes in.

{"date": "December 21, 2011", "body": "\r\n Gavin  recently wrote about  executive functioning . After reading his post, I couldn\u2019t help but think that much of the focus on executive functioning is in relation to high-functioning (or low-visibility) autistics. Parents of low-functioning (or high-visibility) autistics tend to dismiss or downplay the disabling aspects of autism among those with high-functioning or low-visibility autism; sometimes, it\u2019s these individuals themselves who insist autism isn\u2019t a disability at all. Partly in reaction to this, high-functioning or low-visibility autistics tend to focus on the disabling aspects of executive functioning differences. So, in reaction to Gavin\u2019s post and the greater dialogue, I wanted to take a moment to consider executive functioning as it manifests in my household of three boys with autism who are at very different functioning levels. Due to the length of the original post, this will be a two-parter. \n I\u2019m going to start with Willy. For those who aren\u2019t regular readers, here\u2019s a brief recap: When Willy was first diagnosed he displayed classic regressive symptoms of autism, meaning that he developed more-or-less normally and then lost many functioning abilities, including the ability to communicate effectively. In retrospect, there were warning signs regarding his development prior to this regression, but as we were not familiar with autism and autism awareness had not progressed to its current levels, these warning signs were delegated to the \u201cwait and see\u201d category of concerns. When Willy started to regress, these concerns took on new meaning and the search for an explanation began. Willy\u2019s resulting diagnosis is autism. At the time of his diagnosis, his autism was considered severe and institutionalization was recommended. Willy turns thirteen today, so this wasn\u2019t all that long ago. With the help of several therapies, and due to Willy\u2019s own development (which is beyond our control, obviously), Willy has regained the skills he lost. He is now considered fairly high-functioning, but a great deal of his functioning ability is due to the adaptations and accommodations we\u2019ve been able to make for him. \n On the surface of things, Willy appears very high-functioning. He talks, attends classes with his peers, pursues multiple interests, uses his imagination, and tells stories. He has friends. He\u2019s well-liked in school. On the surface of things, executive functioning skills seem to be his biggest weakness. Getting through his day requires quite a bit of coaching in regards to scheduling his day and scheduling the different steps in each task. Getting his homework done is a hard-won achievement, which heavily relies on a physical schedule of assignments and a \u201clearning lab\u201d which is kind of like study hall, except with extra help. On the surface of things, all the work we put into building and maintaining his executive functioning skills helps us compensate for his disability to the point that his disability often seems invisible to us. \n But that\u2019s only the surface of things. As high-functioning as Willy is, when you put him next to his typically developing peers, especially those at different age levels, you can see delays in reasoning skills development, social skills development, and language skills development; and, we\u2019re back to the pervasive developmental disorder. In time, Willy\u2019s reasoning, social and language skills might catch up. They might. But there will always be differences in these areas. Willy will always think, socialize, and speak/write differently. Executive functioning is a bit tricky. It seems less emphasis is put on developing executive functioning skills, i.e. translating these skills into a do-it-yourself set of abilities that Willy can understand, and more emphasis is put on providing him with coping mechanisms, support, and resources to compensate for this disability. \n There are two basic take-away lessons in this: \n 1) Willy\u2019s \u201cinvisible\u201d disability becomes quite visible if you compare him to his typically developing peers. The invisibility is most apparent when comparing him to his brothers, who have fewer functioning skills. Furthermore, his \u201cinvisible\u201d disability becomes very visible if you take away the supports and accommodations that make this level of functioning possible for him. Thus, it would be ridiculous to claim that Willy isn\u2019t disabled simply because Alex and Ben are more disabled. \n 2) How we approach executive functioning seems to assume that it is an ability (or disability) and not a set of skills that can be developed and internalized, with appropriate adjustments. The general approach seems to be one of accommodation and support; whereas, the approach to Willy\u2019s language and social development seems to be one of skill development and support. I\u2019d be interested to know how wide-spread this assumption is and why it is made. \n Are executive functioning differences a matter of life-long disability?

{"date": "November 25, 2011", "body": "\r\n Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg \u2019s book,  The Uncharted Path: My Journey with Late-Diagnosed Autism , is a memoir detailing Rachel\u2019s journey of self-discovery as per her diagnosis of autism at age fifty. This is a self-published book available in soft cover and e-book formats. The majority of the book is text written in the same style as Rachel\u2019s blog,  Journeys with Autism , but there are also illustrations. \n Rachel\u2019s experience of self-discovery and self-acceptance makes for a poignant tale. In this book, readers will travel with her through an abusive childhood into adulthood and parenthood, and finally to her discovery of autism, her discovery of self and her discovery of acceptance. Rachel paints herself as a determined achiever in early adulthood, taking on the tasks of career, marriage and parenthood with a serious energy while still struggling with experiences only clarified by her new-found understanding of autism. As she reaches her limits, she depicts her burn-out in vivid detail, wrenching herself and her readers away from the life she had to a life of drastic limits. Then, slowly, painfully, she comes to terms with those limits while also pushing herself forward\u2014not to do more than she can, but to be accepted in a society that does not yet understand. As a memoir, her story is simply told, but beautifully written\u2014it is approachable, understandable and organized, with a hint of elegance showing through her love for words. \n More than simply detailing these experiences, Rachel reflects on them, she expounds on their significance to her and she encapsulates her discoveries in a way easily shared with and translated for others. In the course of telling her story and trying to share the meaning she found, Rachel has created a memoir that\u2019s also an act of advocacy. In retrospect, Rachel describes how her life was an autistic life all along, even when she knew nothing about autism. She shows the struggles she\u2019s faced, knowing that others face similar struggles. From bullies in childhood to the confusion of the adult social environment, from the societal conviction of her brokenness to the discovery of her deficits as strengths, she counters the general awareness surrounding autism and challenges many preconceived notions held by the general population. For those active in the autistic adult communities available online, these portions of the text will seem straightforward and well-written. For others, these portions of the text will be revelatory. Rachel\u2019s journey through her uncharted path won\u2019t convince everyone that autism isn\u2019t a tragedy\u2014that autism itself does not have to be\u2014but it is a successful work of advocacy, because Rachel makes her point honestly and effectively, sure to reach those who are truly willing to listen. \n Rachel\u2019s writing is beautiful and vivid, capturing telling moments and showing them to readers in the sense of that moment, but also expounding on them in a big-picture context. This combination of showing and telling makes for a moving memoir that is also a work of activism and advocacy. \n Readers who want to understand the autistic experience will get a very detailed understanding of Rachel\u2019s experience, which is only one experience but also provides insights into the experiences of those who are less able to communicate for themselves. Readers who are interested in understanding the self-advocacy movement and the need for advocates and allies will also benefit from Rachel\u2019s cogent arguments in favor of acceptance, accommodation and understanding. Finally, readers who enjoy the memoir genre will find Rachel\u2019s soothing and articulate voice, her commitment to organization and her skill with words a welcome relief from some of the poorly executed works available on autism. Her story is a captivating tale that will widen readers\u2019 understanding and experience, even if it does not change their minds. That said, no book is perfect and while Rachel\u2019s book ends where it does for good reasons, this book definitely needs a sequel. Luckily,  it has one . \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journeyswithautism.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Uncharted-Path-Journey-Late-Diagnosed-Autism/dp/0984138803/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1290727803&sr=8-1", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Blazing-My-Trail-Living-Thriving/dp/0984138811/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318214337&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/11/review-the-uncharted-path/", "title": "Review: "},
{"date": "November 30, 2011", "body": "\r\n At a time like this, I can\u2019t help but think about the autistic adults who write about how they\u2019re silenced by the community at large, and by the community of parents of children with autism. I think about how they type their complaints and post them online. I think about how they host protests and shout at the marching parents who demand a cure. I think about these autistic adults, and I have to remind myself they\u2019re not wrong. Their needs and their complaints are real. They\u2019re very real and they are very important. \n But at a time like this, it\u2019s hard to empathize. Here I am typing away my own complaints and posting them online. It seems, at the moment, that we\u2019re on equal ground. Whereas, the child I shelter is at an extreme disadvantage. \n Monday morning I noticed that Alex was limping. It was only a slight limp, so I assumed he wasn\u2019t wearing his shoes properly. He\u2019s a toe-walker\u2014walking as if he\u2019s wearing high-heels even when he\u2019s barefoot or wearing tennis shoes\u2014so he frequently scrunches his toes as deeply into the shoes as they\u2019ll go, with the heel flapping awkwardly behind his foot. I didn\u2019t think much of it. \n That afternoon, I got a call from the school nurse. Alex was limping at school. She examined his feet and ankles for swelling, but didn\u2019t find anything wrong. He was calm\u2014a bit out of sorts due to a cold. He came home and continued to limp. I didn\u2019t know what to think, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother him much and it didn\u2019t seem to be getting any worse. I examined his feet, his knees, and his legs for an explanation. I saw nothing worth noting. \n Tuesday morning he was still limping. I checked his feet, his legs and his knees again. Nothing. I sent him to school, and he was still limping. They also noticed some mysterious signs\u2014lack of focus, apparent lack of recognition\u2014and worried something else might be wrong. (I still think he\u2019s just feeling a bit off from his cold, because his mood seems fine at home. He\u2019s a bit cranky, but we\u2019ve seen no signs of mysterious blinking or unfocused eyes. But his limping was definitely worse.) So, I took him home, took off his shoes and socks, and examined his feet. One side seemed just a slight bit swollen, but only in comparison to the other foot. His feet are so thin, so bony, and so muscular that a little bit of swelling fleshed out his one foot so it almost looked normal. It was only in comparison that the swelling seems unnatural. \n Then, I looked all over the foot that was swollen. On the bottom inner sole of his foot, in a place that\u2019s difficult to see because of the way the shape of his foot has been distorted by his toe-walking, there is a rather large, purplish bruise. I can\u2019t help but feel guilty, since it seems unlikely that the bruise just appeared. We must have missed it. \n The place was tender, of course, and is almost certainly the cause of the limping. Still, despite the limp, it\u2019s not slowing Alex down much. He still jumps, walks and plays around. He still resists icing it or any other form of treatment available to us. \n I can\u2019t help but think about the ways Willy or even Ben ensures they communicate their discomforts, pains and injuries. I can\u2019t help but think of all those who are \u201csilenced\u201d and yet are able to articulate their hurts. I can\u2019t help but sympathize with the parents who, when confronted with minor mysteries regarding their nonverbal children, gravitate towards the terrible \u201cwhat ifs,\u201d because I do, too. What if Alex was troubled by something serious, even deadly? How would Alex communicate it? Would we notice the signs in time? \n I don\u2019t support the ways that these parents lash out. From angry words to ridiculous claims, they devalue and dehumanize others. I can\u2019t support that. But I can understand the fear that drives them. I share in their frustration, their fear, and their desire to \u201cunlock\u201d their child. \n Autism didn\u2019t steal Alex. He\u2019s not trapped behind a wall of autism. I will never support metaphors like this to describe Alex\u2019s experience of the world. I cherish the ways he communicates who he is to those who are willing to listen. I grieve that so many aren\u2019t willing to listen. But how I wish, oh how I wish, that Alex could say, \u201cMommy, my foot hurts. No, it\u2019s this one, down here. See!\u201d \n Giving room for adult autists to speak and to write is worth fighting for. But those words, those revealing words that Alex just can\u2019t say\u2026they\u2019re worth fighting for, too. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/11/a-voiceless-mystery/", "title": "A Voiceless Mystery"},
{"date": "November 12, 2014", "body": "\r\n My husband Mark has been in and out of mental health treatment (outpatient services for the most part) for bi-polar disorder, a.k.a. manic-depression, since he was a teenager. For much of this time, he has received his psychiatric services from the same doctor who, for the most part, simply provided him with medication. These meds have changed a few times over the years, but for the most part he responds fairly well to the medication. \n Recently, he noticed that his pill bottle described \u201cschizophrenia\u201d as the reason for the prescription. This was odd, because he\u2019d never been told he was schizophrenic and what he experiences doesn\u2019t seem like schizophrenia at all. But his doctor is now retired and he won\u2019t be seeing the nurse practitioner who took her place (temporarily) for a while, so he brought up this \u201cnew diagnosis\u201d to his therapist. His therapist accessed his records and, as best he can tell, the \u201cschizophrenia diagnosis\u201d is nothing more than a clerical error. But in refuting the diagnosis that Mark had seen on his pill bottle, the psychologist discovered something interesting. \n Mark\u2019s records included an official diagnosis from his long-time psychiatrist that Mark had never been told about. Apparently, Mark has an official diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s syndrome, as well as bi-polar. This isn\u2019t a surprise in the sense that we disagree with the diagnosis\u2014we\u2019ve long suspected that if Mark ever wanted to go through the same diagnostic process we went through with our children, then he\u2019d be diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome. This is a surprise because he\u2019d received the diagnosis without that process and without ever being told that he\u2019d gotten it. \n In all fairness, the diagnosis doesn\u2019t change anything. Mark\u2019s primary diagnosis is still bi-polar disorder; that\u2019s the one he needs ongoing treatment for. A secondary diagnosis didn\u2019t change anything with his old psychiatrist, because she\u2019d already been working with Mark\u2019s quirkiness and knew how to handle it, which is why Mark always opted to be under her care when he needed help to manage his mood swings. A secondary diagnosis didn\u2019t change anything with his therapist either, for the same reason. It may help the new people coming on board, but it doesn\u2019t change which medication works with the least side effects nor does it change anything about Mark\u2019s life. \n The only thing it does is confirm what we already suspected. Mark is an Aspie. While I don\u2019t quite fit the usual diagnostic criteria, we know that I am, at the very least, adjacent to the autism spectrum myself. Thus, when our genes combined, we created three autistic children. We already knew this! \n That being said, it\u2019d be kind of nice to know when one gets a new label slapped on oneself, don\u2019t you think? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/11/the-mystery-of-the-undisclosed-diagnosis/", "title": "The Mystery of the Undisclosed Diagnosis"},
{"date": "November 23, 2011", "body": "\r\n I attended Alex\u2019s IEP and 3-year re-evaluation on Monday. By mutual consent, the meetings were combined and the material of the IEP represented most of the re-evaluation work, simply because nobody had any doubt that Alex still qualifies for special education services. \n One good thing about the 3-year re-evaluation: When one of the therapists questioned why Alex wasn\u2019t marked as qualifying for the special education services based on cognitive disabilities criteria, it wasn\u2019t me who had to explain. The psychologist who was sitting in as part of the re-evaluation team provided the explanation, though he wasn\u2019t a regular part of Alex\u2019s education team. \n His explanation was simple: We don\u2019t know. Considering Alex\u2019s sensory, communication and social delays and difficulties\u2014all part of the autism criteria\u2014we cannot effectively assess his cognitive disabilities; and, so we do not officially attach that label to Alex. All simple and straightforward. \n The bad thing, of course, is that this had to be said. Again. Granted, the therapist in question is new to Alex. But the dominant assumption seems to be that because Alex is placed in a CD classroom he must have cognitive disabilities. We can assume\u2014and many people choose to do so\u2014that because Alex cannot effectively and consistently communicate that he knows how to do something, then he must not be able to do it. Of course, we know Alex knows his numbers 1 \u2013 50, but because he cannot consistently  prove  those abilities through testing procedures, his teachers continue drilling him on them. \n I almost wish we knew that Alex did have cognitive disabilities. First, there\u2019s nothing particularly wrong with cognitive disabilities. You can still live a happy, productive life with cognitive disabilities. You can still be wholly and utterly a person with cognitive disabilities. It is a disability and does pose certain limits, and those limits do tend to put a ceiling on what you can do, but with enough effort from the support personnel and enough acceptance and accommodation, you can attain a pretty awesome quality of life. (I am not suggesting that\u2019s the norm, but that it is possible.) On the other hand, not knowing is very difficult. Imagine being a twelve-year-old boy with a normal or above-average intelligence (distinctly possible since both his parents have above-average IQs), but being unable to express that intelligence in a way meaningful to others and to be drilled daily on the most rudimentary subjects like \u201cWhat color is your shirt?\u201d and \u201cWhat comes after 32?\u201d. If it were me, I\u2019d be very frustrated, very agitated, and sometimes I\u2019d get very angry. \n I can, just barely, imagine Alex\u2019s desire to break through that barrier\u2014and the frustration and anger when he can\u2019t. One thing about typical education strategies that always frustrated me was the rule that you say what you\u2019re going to say, then you say it, and then you say what you\u2019ve said. While teachers generally don\u2019t follow this rigid public-speaking form, they repeat themselves  a lot . As a child, I imagined how much more time I would have to play if they\u2019d just say it once and leave it be. I didn\u2019t need for them to repeat, repeat, repeat the same material over and over and over again. And I didn\u2019t realize how important it was for the other students. It was frustrating. It was annoying. When I imagine myself as Alex with a normal intelligence, stuck in this repeat-a-thon  for years , it makes me want to scream. It\u2019s so pointless, so useless, and so very frustrating. \n And Alex is frustrated. He does scream. He acts out in aggressive fashion. What if it\u2019s not an inability to regulate his sensory system? What if it\u2019s the combined frustration of being unable to communicate and being drilled with simple concepts day in and day out? What if his inability to regulate his sensory system is, in large part, a measure of his frustration in having  knowledge  that he cannot  express  and being drilled over and over on \u201cmeaningless\u201d tasks? \n I worry that this is exactly what Alex is going through, though I cannot prove it and I seem powerless to change it. Every time I try to nudge or push or shove the teachers into experimenting to see if Alex will find more difficult material more stimulating\u2014I hit a brick wall, almost totally immovable. \n So I hope and pray that the next year, the next school, the next attempt will bring about a break-through, either for Alex and his communication abilities or for me and my need to try to up the ante. \n But for all my imaginings, the reality is that Alex\u2019s sensory system is a mystery. We\u2019ve tried just about everything any of us has ever come across and nothing can get him calm and keep him calm for more than a few seconds or a few minutes. Willy can go 0-60 with no apparent transition or cause. Ben can go 0-80. Alex goes from 0 to 150, and he has no in-between. He\u2019s either asleep, at the edge of sensory overload, or over the cliff speeding for the crash at the bottom of the ravine. \n My little guy faces so many barriers and we\u2019ve tried so many things. And we\u2019re stuck waiting\u2026waiting\u2026waiting for someone to figure out what we can do to help him. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/11/waiting-on-transition/", "title": "Waiting on Transition"},
{"date": "November 17, 2014", "body": "\r\n In the United States, we have a culture that perpetuates an ownership mentality. We own a lot of stuff, we own our land, we own our rights, and according to some people we even own our jobs. With ownership comes a sense of entitlement: we have the final say, we make the decisions, we can use what we own however we want. We have many rights, but we recognize few responsibilities. The world owes us a lot, but we don\u2019t owe anyone anything. \n In contrast, quite few of the cultures we interact with practice a stewardship mentality. The stewardship mentality generally takes the longer view. According to this perspective, we don\u2019t own much of anything, regardless of property laws, because these things will last longer than we will. This is particularly important with regards to land usage and community. The stewardship mentality recognizes fewer rights and many more responsibilities. Namely, as stewards, we have the responsibility to take care of\u2014not simply use and certainly not use up\u2014our property. \n As I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve been reading  First Things First  by Stephen Covey and the Merrills, and the issue of stewardship was brought up regarding the roles we choose. Then, after reading this, I watched a news clip about a child that was accidentally vaccinated by the school. In this clip, one of the guest speakers\u2014I don\u2019t remember who\u2014was talking about how parents have the right to decide when and if a child is vaccinated. On the surface, I agreed with her. Personally, I don\u2019t think schools should be vaccinated children at all\u2014it blurs the lines of governmental authority too much for my taste. But, as I listened to her, I couldn\u2019t help but hear the ring of ownership in her voice as spoke about parenting her child. \n This isn\u2019t atypical in the United States. Among the many things our culture tells us we own, we\u2019re told we own our kids. This idea has been with us since the founding of our nation and it lingers to this day, though we have made inroads in recognizing our children as people with human rights of their own. \n For centuries, parents enjoyed the right to treat their children however they saw fit. Slowly, over time, the rights of parents have eroded. Once upon a time, parents could decide whether or not their children worked or went to school. Then, school attendance became more or less mandatory. Once upon a time, parents could decide how their children were punished. Then, certain forms of punishment were labeled abuse and outlawed. Once upon a time, parents could decide whether or not their children were vaccinated. Then, vaccinations became more or less mandatory. Once upon a time, parents could decide whether or not their children received medical attention. Then, medical care became more or less mandatory. \n While there is a part of me that resists the encroachment of government on individual rights, mostly I agree with these shifts, because I firmly believe that children are people with rights of their own. (Though, I can\u2019t help but comment that it seems ironic that as our \u201cold\u201d rights are being eroded, we now have the \u201cnew\u201d right to kill our children via abortion, a mentality that I suspect also leads to  tragedies like this .) \n When it comes to our children, our rights as parents cannot and should not outweigh our responsibilities to our children. This is stewardship, not ownership. We have the right to make decisions, but we have the responsibility to consider our children\u2019s interests when making those decisions. We have the right to direct the courses of their young lives, but we have the responsibility to raise them into people who can choose their own paths. We have the right to resist social and even legal/governmental norms, but we have the responsibility to base our resistance on the best interests of our children and not on our own convenience. \n In the name of cultural diversity, we learn about other cultures and we are exposed to how those cultures are mixing with the dominant American culture. As a child, I learned a great deal about Dia de Muertos in the name of cultural diversity. I\u2019ve acquired a smattering of other cultural nuances from my classroom instruction, too. But it wasn\u2019t in school that I learned about the truly substantial differences in culture. It wasn\u2019t in school that I learned the difference between Native American and dominant American attitudes towards land. It wasn\u2019t in school that I learned the pervasive significance of \u201cancestor worship\u201d traditions among Asian cultures. It wasn\u2019t in school that I learned that there are people whose views of the world are so completely and utterly different from our own that we cannot help but miscommunicate and misunderstand each other. What I learned in school in the name of cultural diversity was decidedly trivial, so as to not even open up the opportunity for us lowly students to challenge the norms of the dominant culture. \n As much as I love this country (most of the time), there are things we  need  to learn from others, and it\u2019s not simply to respect holidays that are different from our own. In grade school, I learned that America takes pride in being the melting pot of so many different peoples. In college, I learned that America could more accurately be described as a salad, because we all don\u2019t end up with the same culture or the same world views and belief systems once we\u2019re mixed together. The irony, which I didn\u2019t learn in school, is that \u201cAmerica\u201d is itself an arrogant misnomer. Canada and Mexico are part of \u201cAmerica,\u201d too. So is the entirety of South America. We may be the  United States  of America, but \u201cAmerica\u201d is not our own to claim. But the dominant culture does not want to be challenged. People en masse don\u2019t want their minds to be opened to ideas that make them question themselves and their beliefs. We don\u2019t want to learn the truly important things. \n The United States has the potential to be that melting pot of yore. But it is not done by making everyone who comes here melt into some longstanding norm. We\u2019ve already figured out that that really doesn\u2019t work\u2014thus, we say \u201csalad\u201d instead \u201cmelting pot.\u201d But the melting pot ideal isn\u2019t, by itself, wrong. We have the potential to take the best of the cultures of the world and to melt these \u201cbests\u201d into something truly exceptional, something truly ideal. What if we could combine the Protestant work ethic with the longer, sustainable view of land held by Native American cultures? What if we could honor our history while working cooperatively for a better future? What if we could balance freedom with responsibility, liberty with equality, self-determination with self-restraint? \n What if we treated our children with the respect, dignity, and humility they deserve from us? What if we raised our children to balance their rights with their responsibilities? What if we were the kind of parents who made the world a better place simply by sending our children out into the world? \n We don\u2019t own our children. They aren\u2019t \u201cours\u201d do with as we please. We are stewards of our children and stewards of our future. We have the power to shape our children into people we will be proud to know, people who will make the world a better place simply by living their lives. We have this power because we can look beyond our own culture and embrace the best of the cultures we discover amongst others. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jillian-mccabe-accused-throwing-autistic-son-oregon-bridge-n240606"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/11/ownership-vs-stewardship/", "title": "Ownership vs. Stewardship"},

I read about how she once had a lot more functioning capabilities, which she lost, and how she attributed that loss to burn-out. \n I admit, when I first read that, I panicked for a good, long while. I wrote a lengthy post in near-hysterics about what Rachel said and what I feared. The post was highly emotional, a bit incoherent, and I asked my husband for his opinion before posting it. He agreed that I shouldn\u2019t post it at this sensitive juncture (a reference you will either understand or not). \n You see, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid of being disabled. I\u2019m not afraid of losing the ability to do things that I can do now. For me, unless I die very young, that\u2019s inevitable. I\u2019m a writer and I\u2019m already showing signs of arthritis. I\u2019m 32 years old. I use my hands and brain, almost exclusively to any other part of my body, for hours at a time several times a day, every day. So, unless I die young or arthritis is cured, I will lose the ability to work as I do now. I\u2019ve looked ahead to that future, acknowledged that it will slow me down, and committed myself to not letting it stop me. If I lose enough functioning to be diagnosed on the autism spectrum, I can do the same. It\u2019s not me I\u2019m worried about. \n There is a powerful, local government agency that has the authority\u2014with few checks and balances\u2014to remove children from the home of their parents. Here it is called Child Protective Services. For most of my teenage and adult life (the parts of my life that I was at all cognizant of their work), I was fully on-board with their mission. I\u2019ve seen abuse. I know what it does to kids. I\u2019ve seen kids have their lives ruined by abusive parents. I\u2019ve seen some kids reclaim their lives, either as children or as adults. I\u2019ve seen some people who struggle with reclaiming their lives every day of their lives. And I\u2019ve seen some people who either don\u2019t know reclamation is possible or have given up or continue to live in abusive situations their entire lives. I\u2019ve seen it.  I know.  So, how could CPS be a bad thing? \n For the same reason that autism advocacy is necessary at all. I was told: \u201cNo family should be burdened with three children with autism.\u201d I was told: \u201cThe goal of therapy is to help your children become indistinguishable from their peers.\u201d The person who said these words had tremendous influence with the local CPS agency, and when we didn\u2019t comply with her \u201csuggestions\u201d to prioritize normalization or clinicalize our home, she called CPS\u2014repeatedly. And they sided with her\u2014completely. If they could, they would have removed the boys and put them in group homes for children with disabilities where they would live until they were normalized enough to be put into foster care. This was explained rather explicitly. Luckily, they couldn\u2019t fabricate a case strong enough to make that happen. \n But what if I burned-out? What if I became sufficiently disabled to qualify for an autism diagnosis? It would all start up again. The person in question would, if she became aware of it, begin harassing my family all over again. And I don\u2019t think the autism advocacy movements have made enough progress for my family to survive the encounter. \n So, I panicked. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Uncharted-Path-Journey-Late-Diagnosed-Autism/dp/0984138803/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1290727803&sr=8-1</a>"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/11/imminent-burn-out-part-3-my-panicky-aftermath/", "title": "Imminent Burn-Out?

This memoir picks up where the other left off, providing new information and insights that will help to put the first book into perspective. Most importantly to me, it follows up on her description of  burn-out . In my opinion, her new understanding and her recovery were what made a sequel essential. Like  The Uncharted Path , this is a self-published book available in soft cover and e-book formats. It\u2019s a text-based book; I do not remember there being any pictures and a quick scan didn\u2019t reveal any. \n In  Blazing My Trail , Rachel approaches autism from a slightly changed perspective. Instead of focusing as thoroughly on her struggles as she did in  The Uncharted Path , Rachel focused on solutions, accommodations and living with autism. The distinction, though subtle, is significant.  Blazing My Trail  is definitely a book about hope and about acceptance; whereas  The Uncharted Path  was a book about understanding and accommodation. In the first, Rachel struggles; in the second she thrives. \n While I find  Blazing My Trail  to be a necessary sequel, and I\u2019m very grateful for the book and its timing, I can\u2019t help but feel that something is lacking from the book. The first book stuck with me. I can close my eyes and I can recall the experiences revealed throughout the book. There is an intimacy and an awareness that seems rather lacking in the second. Perhaps it\u2019s just my experience and the distressing nature of my own fears, but I can remember little from the second book after her medication revelation without flipping through the book for a refresher. There is less cohesion to this second book; each chapter seems more distinct from the others. Yet, as individual essays, these chapters are each significant in and of themselves. \n Perhaps a second reading will reveal that this feeling of disconnectedness stemmed from me and not from the book itself. At the same time, I cannot recommend the book as a stand-alone experience. Its significance is in direct relation to its predecessor. \n Nevertheless,  Blazing My Trail  is a beautifully written sequel that is highly recommended to everyone who wants a continuation of the story they read in  The Uncharted Path . \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journeyswithautism.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Blazing-My-Trail-Living-Thriving/dp/0984138811/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318214337&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Uncharted-Path-Journey-Late-Diagnosed-Autism/dp/0984138803/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1290727803&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/11/review-blazing-my-trail/", "title": "Review: "},

Making and keeping commitments, for example, adds to our integrity. Making and breaking commitments clearly subtracts from our integrity. \n I\u2019ve spent a sizable portion of my life building up my integrity, but there have been times when life gets in the way and I have to choose between an important commitment and an even more important crisis. This time, however, my integrity was depleted by two weeks of no-call-no-shows with my clients. \n Clearly, if my integrity was completely depleted, then my clients would have dropped me. But they didn\u2019t. Still, I felt like a complete failure and that feeling stuck with me as I tried and failed to get myself back on track. Combined with the disability angle, as per the  previous \u00a0 posts , I was digging myself further and further into a hole of incompetence. \n \u201cFirst Things First\u201d is chock full of great advice regarding one\u2019s personal integrity account and other quality-of-life metaphors and methods. The point of this post isn\u2019t to push the book or to pick and choose among the plethora of wisdom I\u2019ve found there. The point is to acknowledge that the way we view ourselves is affected and influenced by many factors. The lies and the truths we tell ourselves have more power to determine what we can and cannot do than anything else. As this book teaches, we need to use our conscience, our independent will, our creative imagination, and our self-awareness to set our courses and, as is currently relevant, to evaluate our progress. \n Sometimes when things go awry we need to pull back, take a good, honest look at what we can do, and build ourselves\u2014and our personal integrity accounts\u2014back up again, albeit more slowly than we\u2019d like. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. The truth is I can handle my life. I can go to school, run my business, take care of my family, and help my mother. I need boundaries and reasonable expectations in order to succeed, but I can do it. Sometimes I need a little extra help and sometimes I need to pull back and reflect, but even then I can do it. \n Sometimes what I really need is a reminder that I can. I\u2019m not simply a product of my culture; I am my own consciousness and I have the integrity to back that up, even if I don\u2019t always feel like it. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/First-Things-Stephen-R-Covey/dp/0684802031/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415640931&sr=8-1&keywords=First+Things+First"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/11/my-personal-integrity-account/", "title": "My Personal Integrity Account"},

Celebrating holidays with three children with autism\u2014or even just one!\u2014can be especially challenging. Over the years, our extended family has grown accustomed to the differences my children\u2019s needs bring to the holiday season. Our family has adapted excellently and I know just how lucky we are for their support and accommodations. \n Many families are not so lucky. Many families struggle with basic necessities and holidays can be especially trying. On the one hand, the expectation is that they must somehow access the mainstay traditions of the season, such as a turkey for Thanksgiving, whether their budgets allow it or not. I\u2019ve been there and I know how trying and miserable that can be. On the other hand, parents can go through all the work to procure the ingredients and make the feast, only to find that their child(ren) with autism won\u2019t touch the holiday meal. Instead, they want something that\u2019s more familiar and comfortable. I\u2019ve been there, too. \n When spending the holidays with extended family, these complications can be further exacerbated. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins can do their best to love the children with disabilities in their family, but if they don\u2019t understand the disability the child has and they don\u2019t understand what the child needs to celebrate the holiday, it can spoil the event for everybody. I\u2019ve been there, too; though, once again, I\u2019m lucky to have an extended family that\u2019s very understanding and accommodating, but it has taken work on all our parts to get there. It is important for everybody to understand and keep in mind that it is not the disability, per se, that spoils a family event; it is the lack of understanding and accommodation that makes the event unsuccessful. That seems to happen in families a lot, and the issue isn\u2019t always a matter of disability, but I\u2019ve found that if people are willing to put in the work to love, understand, and accept one another, then any event can be a success, whether you have little or much. \n So, I want to express my gratitude that Willy will be joining my mom, my husband, and me for a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. And I want to express my gratitude that Alex and Ben will be able to enjoy the special family time of Thanksgiving without having to try any of the traditional foods. I\u2019m thankful we have the choice and flexibility to ensure that our whole family can enjoy this holiday.

{"date": "November 21, 2014", "body": "\r\n I am still in the midst of illness and hardship, but recently there was a bright spot in this time of tribulation. Alex had a very good day on Wednesday. It started with a check-up with his pediatrician. For the first time, Alex sat still while the nurse took his blood pressure and his pulse. When the doctor came in, Alex let him look in his ears  and  his mouth without any problems and without requiring any special maneuvers on the part of his doctor. Then, when the nurse came in to give Alex his vaccinations, Alex only needed help staying still enough for the needle. He endured not one but  three  shots without any kind of fuss. \n After such excellent behavior, Mark and I wanted to give Alex a treat. We discussed the possibilities and decided to take Alex to IHOP, because there are three different meals he likes there and the menu is one he can consistently use to make his own choices. He chose a grilled cheese sandwich, and I requested fries instead of fruit. Alex ate his entire sandwich and all his fries! \n After that, he had some free time at home before I took him to the speech clinic. When we got there, the speech therapist had a new selection of toys so they could explore different areas of the device. Alex was surprisingly cooperative and attentive. He didn\u2019t lose focus until the very end and he used the device beautifully. \n When we returned home, he continued his fabulous day without any significantly disruptive behaviors. (We have also heard that Alex is now proactively extending his hand in greeting and, at home, he\u2019s watching Willy and his friend play together as if he\u2019s trying to figure out how they do it.) While this stellar behavior didn\u2019t roll over into Thursday, I did get another, stronger dose of antibiotics. Unfortunately, my mother required a trip to Urgent Care and was diagnosed with vertigo, which took up all my energy for the day. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/11/a-good-day/", "title": "A Good Day"},

There was a time not so very long ago that the disruption such a change represents would be traumatic. I remember times when each boy (though never all at once) would begin any long weekend by getting ready for school, as best as he could, all by himself as a sign of defiance, if you will, against the change in schedule. \n Sometimes that simply meant putting on his backpack. Other times it meant getting dressed, including snow pants, boots and a winter coat, all by himself. I would coax, explain, and coax some more. Finally, I\u2019d leave him be until he gave up on school and decided to play. One time Alex went around in coat, shoes, and backpack until well into the afternoon. Every time the front door opened, he\u2019d go see if his bus had finally come. Eventually, though, they always gave up. \n Things are very different now. Even though children with autism do not follow the developmental trajectory of their typically developing peers, they do develop\u2014at their own pace, in their own time, and most definitely in their own ways. Now, the boys enjoy the long weekend. They\u2019re perfectly happy to play all day long. So, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll be doing today and for the next two days.

{"date": "November 24, 2014", "body": "\r\n I\u2019m on a new prescription to fight the illness that has been lingering far too long. According to the doctor, it\u2019s still just sinusitis and bronchitis. I haven\u2019t developed any tertiary infections (bronchitis is the secondary one), including and especially pneumonia. So, I\u2019ve got that going for me. The doctor also changed the antibiotic and extended the length of time I\u2019m taking it. So, while I\u2019m not better yet, chances are good that I will be by the time this medicine is through. Meanwhile, I am coughing a bit less and getting a bit stronger. So, I am getting back to work. \n Working has been a problem for several weeks now. My work is very cerebral in nature, which means I have to reach a minimal level of concentration before I can produce quality work. The length of time I\u2019ve been away from my work, along with other complicating factors, has also made it necessary for me to start from zero. \n Basically, along with the concentration (which is improving) and the knowledge (which I\u2019ve retained), my work depends on my confidence (which was depleted) and my skill (which has become rusty). A final ingredient, which is a bit more mysterious, is the creativity factor. \n Creative writers\u2014novelists and memoirists, for example\u2014often speak of \u201cthe muse,\u201d which is a nod to Greek mythology. Personally, I see creativity as being less dependent on external forces (like a demi-godish being whispering in your ear) and more dependent on internal forces, like a bubbling \u201cpot\u201d of a variety of inputs and a willingness to put different things together until you create something fantastically new. Though, I believe there are internal and external forces that interplay and interlay amongst each other, which is what makes creativity such a mystery. \n For me, the biggest factor is that my creativity is most robust when it\u2019s used abundantly. The more I use my creativity the more creativity I can bring to bear on a new project. Concentration tends to work in the reverse: the more I concentrate the less capacity for concentration during a given day. This creates something of an X-factor, where the one is rising, the other is lowering, and the optimal time to perform the hardest work is when they cross each other. Finding my X-factor is a matter of trial and error, because it is dependent on factors that change from day to day. If I spend long periods of time not working, then I get out of practice. My moments of optimal work time become shorter and finding them becomes harder. \n As my strength has improved, I\u2019ve devoted time to getting in the practice I need. So far, my X-factor has eluded me; but, the last few days, I\u2019ve gotten pretty close. This is a sign that I\u2019m ready to get back to producing end-product work for clients. \n It\u2019s about time! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/11/try-try-again/", "title": "Try, Try Again"},

{"date": "September 4, 2009", "body": "\r\n Alex is our most complicated child.\u00a0 The symptoms resulting from his autism are the most significant of our three children.\u00a0 He\u2019s nine years old and still hasn\u2019t found an effective means of communicating consistently.\u00a0 He rarely attempts verbal communication.\u00a0 His sensory needs are difficult to meet, because he experiences a complicated mix of hyper- and hypo-sensitivity that seem to fluctuate without notice or apparent cause.\u00a0 The many trained professionals over the years have made little progress in deciphering the mixed signals we get.\u00a0 We don\u2019t yet know how to help Alex interpret his environment consistently, which frustrates all of us. \n Another ailment which is distinctly Alex\u2019s (of my three boys) is something I don\u2019t have a good name for.\u00a0 Basically, when his adult teeth grow in his baby teeth have this nasty habit of not coming loose and falling out.\u00a0 The adult tooth and the baby tooth compete for space where only one tooth should be.\u00a0 It creates a double row of teeth in one spot that pushes both teeth out of ailment and affects the surrounding teeth.\u00a0 He also has a very, very sensitive mouth.\u00a0 When we first started brushing his teeth, he would occasionally gag to the point of throwing up.\u00a0 Since then he\u2019s learned to control his reactions.\u00a0 When he cannot tolerate having his teeth brushed he just clamps down his teeth and lips so the toothbrush can\u2019t get in.\u00a0 If we catch him at just the right frame of mind and level of sensory management, we can occasionally get a tooth brush in his mouth and clean his teeth.\u00a0 But, it\u2019s not enough and he already shows signs of cavities. \n Due to these complications, taking Alex to the dentist seems very inhumane.\u00a0 To make the experience less traumatic, we go up to the dental clinic in the Children\u2019s Hospital in Milwaukee. \u00a0They have a well-trained staff and special equipment housed in a seemingly ideal setting.\u00a0 We take Alex into a private room with subdued lighting (except for the dentist\u2019s lamp).\u00a0 They have a hug blanket, which is a form of restraint intended to help keep him still and apply pressure that helps keep him calm.\u00a0 But then we have to get the wedge in his mouth so the dentist can poke around in there.\u00a0 The hug blanket isn\u2019t enough, so on comes the happy gas (which isn\u2019t available at the local dentist\u2019s office). \n Last time we took too long turning on the happy gas and Alex experienced such a severe reaction to the cleaning process that he threw up.\u00a0 After that, a lot of happy gas was used.\u00a0 Alex fell asleep or a state of near sleep, which allowed the dentist to x-ray his teeth (revealing the near cavities) and finish some of the cleaning.\u00a0 Even in this state, Alex was uncooperative.\u00a0 Furthermore, I was concerned that he\u2019d had too much of the gas.\u00a0 He lolled a great deal and lay down in the car on the way home.\u00a0 It\u2019s an hour and a half to two hour drive back to our house.\u00a0 I was alone with Alex and as much as I would have liked to watch him, I had to keep my eyes on the road.\u00a0 I felt anxious for his well-being all the way home, and would reach my arm behind me to touch him and feel the rise and fall of his shallow breaths.\u00a0 He was out of it and upset for the rest of the day. \n After seeing how traumatic the experience was for Alex, the dentist recommended putting him under general anesthesia in order to perform all his dental care needs at once.\u00a0 This is a procedure the dental clinic is able to do, but getting MA approval is difficult.\u00a0 Before we can get that approval we have another regular visit to see if just maybe it\u2019ll go more smoothly this time.\u00a0 It\u2019s a week away and I\u2019m not looking forward to it.\u00a0 Luckily this time I will be picking my mother up at the airport on the way back, so I\u2019ll have another set of eyes to watch Alex. \n The question I ask myself is: \u00a0What would be the most humane way to get Alex the dental care he needs?\u00a0 I don\u2019t like restraints, I don\u2019t like doping him up with \u201chappy gas\u201d (which, btw, doesn\u2019t make him at all happy), and I don\u2019t like the idea of putting him under.\u00a0 Yet, without the restraints and the happy gas, dental care would be even more traumatic for Alex.\u00a0 And putting him under may be the least traumatic alternative.\u00a0 If teeth problems didn\u2019t cause so much pain (as I know from my own mouth and through observing others), then I would probably say we should just forget the whole thing.\u00a0 But cavities are painful.\u00a0 Untreated cavities can lead to cysts, which are even more painful.\u00a0 And, while I cannot be sure, I cannot imagine that having two teeth where there should only be one would be all that comfortable.\u00a0 I especially cannot imagine that, since his aggressive behavior started right around the time the first baby tooth refused to come out.\u00a0 It might be coincidence, but he might be in constant pain or maybe just discomfort.\u00a0 That would certainly explain his irritability.\u00a0 But so would the general frustration of being unable to consistently communicate in a manner that is understood by others. \n The most difficult thing for me is the ignorance.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know the best thing to do for my child.\u00a0 If I knew, but was unable to do it, I could at least plan and strategize how to achieve my goals.\u00a0 But, not knowing leaves so few options.\u00a0 At this point, I can only make the best choice possible \u2013 using both my head and my heart to see which way to go \u2013 and hope Alex can forgive me if I\u2019m wrong.\u00a0 As a parent, there is just so much of that.\u00a0 We second-guess ourselves, because some of the choices we make are just wrong.\u00a0 But we never have all the information; we never know all the consequences; and we cannot see inside our children\u2019s minds or ask their future selves to know what they would choose if they were able.\u00a0 We must do the best we can and remember to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d when we\u2019re wrong. \n P.S.

{"date": "November 2, 2009", "body": "\r\n \n The chorus: \n I want a man that stands beside me \n Not in front of or behind me \n Give me two arms that want to hold me, not own me \n And I\u2019ll give all the love in my heart \n \u00a0 \n Stand beside me \n Be true, don't tell lies to me \n I\u2019m not lookin\u2019 for a fantasy \n I want a man that who stands beside me \n I\u2019ve loved this song for a long time.\u00a0 The chorus lyrics ring true for me in so many different ways.\u00a0 For me, these lyrics symbolize equality and mutual respect.\u00a0 Yet, it took me a long time to truly understand them. \n I grew up in staunchly patriarchal household.\u00a0 I married young with that expectation in mind.\u00a0 Even then, I liked the song.\u00a0 Mark and I talked about equality as something we wanted and strived for in our relationship, but the truth was I didn\u2019t know how to lead.\u00a0 I certainly didn\u2019t know how to leader as equal partners.\u00a0 So, Mark assumed the leadership position and all the responsibility the position entails; and it was exhausting. \n In school, I learned how to assume the leadership position.\u00a0 As an excellent student with challenging goals, the leadership position was often mine by default.\u00a0 I knew my way worked, and so I enforced my way in order to achieve my goals\u2014carrying my team mates along with me.\u00a0 By doing this, I closed my way off from other possibilities and other approaches.\u00a0 The grade was my goal and I went after my goal relentlessly. \n I found I had a knack for leadership.\u00a0 I got things done, and my manner of doing things tended to work.\u00a0 So, as Mark grew more and more tired by the steady and weighty demands of leading our family, I took on more and more of the leadership role at home.\u00a0 Whereas once he stood in front of me\u2014a bulwark against the nastiness of the world; now, he stood behind me\u2014with me taking the brunt force of the world around us. \n I found the power of these leadership roles alluring, but not very gratifying.\u00a0 In such a position, power is assumed and is ripe for abuse.\u00a0 Even well-intentioned people find themselves abusing the power of a leadership position, justifying the means via the ends.\u00a0 And the responsibility to face the brunt force of these decisions is exhausting.\u00a0 Yet, ignorance prevailed.\u00a0 I\u2019d never been taught how to lead without assuming the leadership position.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know there was another way. \n Over the last year, I\u2019ve stepped back from these types of leadership positions in school.\u00a0 The pressures of assuming the leadership position at home made assuming the same position in group assignments undesirable.\u00a0 In doing so, I learned how to be the supportive person, the person who achieved the same goal (the grade) while using another\u2019s approach and by facilitating that approach.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a fascinating experience.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t standing in front of my team, nor was I standing behind the leader.\u00a0 I was standing beside the other person\u2014supporting, influencing, helping, and shaping the goals of our team.\u00a0 As I tried to bring these lessons into our home life, something clicked into place between my husband and me. \n Looking back I regret my ignorance.\u00a0 Perhaps fatigue would not plague Mark so much now if I\u2019d known how to lead as a partner from the beginning.\u00a0 When I slipped into the leadership position, I felt the same profound tiredness he faced for years.\u00a0 Now, as we are both learning to lead together, as a team, our capacity to  do  is enhanced greatly.\u00a0 We stand united, neither in front nor behind, we stand beside each other, achieving more than we otherwise could.\u00a0 There\u2019s still a lot of damage from my early patterns of behavior, but we\u2019re together and together we both can heal. \n \u00a0 \n With any form of leadership, there is a tendency to stand in front of those you represent.\u00a0 You call attention to yourself and speak on behalf of others.\u00a0 Our society expects this and encourages this.\u00a0 A spokesperson makes things easier for those who do not know how to lead or who do not want to.\u00a0 A cause or a group can be reduced to easily consumable sound bytes. \n The trouble with a spokesperson is that this behavior does not encourage equality or mutual respect.\u00a0 It creates a focal point of attention. \u00a0It creates celebrities and symbols that dehumanize not only the group the leader represents, but also the leader assuming the position. \n In many ways, this is a good thing\u2014it serves a real, almost-necessary purpose.\u00a0 Martin Luther King, Jr. played a pivotal role in the civil rights movement by assuming this focal position.\u00a0 He also paid a very steep price for his role.\u00a0 But even in death, he instigated action, his voice\u2014suddenly silenced\u2014was a rallying cry for others.\u00a0 Yet, there is also a tremendous amount of power inherent in such positions.\u00a0 And this power can be very seductive. \n Leadership roles are a double-edged sword.\u00a0 Such a position is ripe for abuse.\u00a0 It is also exhausting and difficult to do well.\u00a0 The position is perceived as necessary in our society, because we need people to lead. \n Leading, however, is a different act than assuming a leadership position.\u00a0 It\u2019s a form of leadership, but without as many built-in faults.\u00a0 Leading can be done from any position.\u00a0 It can be done without power struggles.\u00a0 It can be done in a genuinely beneficial manner to all involved.\u00a0 Leading can be an act of equality and mutual respect, and does not have to involve leadership positions. \n Sadly, this distinction seems to be poorly recognized.\u00a0 In our society, we train people to assume leadership positions.\u00a0 We seem enamored with them, assuming that such a position is necessary in order to have leadership.\u00a0 Our government is designed for people to assume leadership positions, and to engage in power struggles between divergent factions.\u00a0 It\u2019s systemic and ingrained into our culture.\u00a0 Yet, with this system, have a profound need for leaders that often goes unfulfilled.\u00a0 We train people to assume leadership positions, where power is the reinforcing element of the leader.\u00a0 We do not train people to lead with influence and cooperation nearly so well. \n Neurodiversity represents a very diverse group of people\u2014a group of people made up of diverse differences, diverse cultures, diverse genders, diverse nationalities, diverse ethnicities, and diverse belief systems.\u00a0 No leadership role can satisfy the needs of this group.\u00a0 Yet, we still need leaders, people who lead as co-equal partners.\u00a0 The great thing about such a partnership is that everyone can join, everyone can lead;

{"date": "July 3, 2010", "body": "\r\n In my  first post  I introduced the concept of engaging and how it relates to prejudice.\u00a0 In my  second post  I discussed how failure to engage leads to miscommunication with people we know well.\u00a0 Now, I will conclude this discussion by discussing engagement in regards to communicating with atypical communicators. \n Recently I was reminded that I am such a person.\u00a0 During my graduation party I was sitting with a circle of friends.\u00a0 My husband, my mother, my brother and I were there along with another couple we\u2019ve known for years and an old friend.\u00a0 These are all people I know well, who I am comfortable with, and who know me in my many idiosyncrasies and accept me as I am.\u00a0 This old friend and I started talking about a topic of mutual interest.\u00a0 I became highly engaged in the conversation.\u00a0 Without meaning to or even being aware that I did so, I focused on this gentleman at the exclusion of all others.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until he pointed out that our conversation was excluding everyone else that I became aware of this.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t a \u201cparty\u201d conversation and it was not appropriate to become so highly involved that I was not aware of where I was and who I was with.\u00a0 Intellectually I know this, but I lack the intuitive sense that most people have regarding such things.\u00a0 Whether he knew it on an intellectual level or an intuitive level, he knew he would have to break open the conversation to get me to re-focus.\u00a0 He did so without making a big deal out of it or making me feel foolish.\u00a0 The other people knew me well enough to realize I did not mean to exclude them and did not take offense that I had. \n This example shows engagement on multiple levels.\u00a0 I was very much engaged in that conversation, but I was not engaged in social context I was in once the conversation had begun.\u00a0 Whereas my friend was engaged in both the conversation and the social context; he was also engaged with me as a person to the extent that he knew I couldn\u2019t pull back on my own.\u00a0 And I need that. \n Adapting to my means of communication requires effort from others; however the amount of effort it requires is relatively small.\u00a0 I talk like an intellectual.\u00a0 For the most part, I use proper grammar when I speak and I use the words that are appropriate, whether or not they are commonly known.\u00a0 I also have focus issues.\u00a0 All of these represent barriers in everyday conversation, but the barriers are fairly easily overcome.\u00a0 If you tell me you don\u2019t understand, I will tone down my language.\u00a0 If you tell me I\u2019m excluding others, I will pull back and try to engage in my surroundings.\u00a0 I am somewhat adaptable, and I surround myself with people who are able to accommodate me in my conversational short-comings. \n There are, however, people whose means of communication are far more atypical than my own.\u00a0 My son Alex is one such individual.\u00a0 As a primarily non-verbal person, he is often left out of conversations and social interactions.\u00a0 He\u2019s very difficult to communicate with because he has a very limited ability to adapt his skills to converse with others.\u00a0 It\u2019s also difficult for him to engage with others.\u00a0 This means that most of the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d has to be done by the other person. \n In contemporary society, Alex\u2019s communication challenges seem to be seen as putting an \u201cunnecessary burden\u201d on others.\u00a0 Two ideas are inherent in this assumption:\u00a0 First, other people are not obligated to put forth the effort necessary to communicate with Alex.\u00a0 Second, Alex needs to be \u201cfixed\u201d in order to communicate effectively.\u00a0 Another assumption is made\u2014awareness of which seems even more fleeting\u2014and that is that  because Alex doesn\u2019t communicate in a typical way and cannot express himself effectively in his atypical way,  he doesn\u2019t have anything to say. \u00a0 The first two assumptions are negotiable\u2014I don\u2019t agree with them, but there certainly is room for intelligent debate on those issues.\u00a0 However, the third assumption, the one people seem least willing to admit they make, is wholly and completely wrong.\u00a0 Those people who make the effort to communicate with Alex on his own terms and within his own limitations will find Alex has quite a bit to say.\u00a0 It\u2019s difficult to understand, of course, but there is definitely a lively, thoughtful child \u201chidden under\u201d the communication and social challenges.\u00a0 Except that he\u2019s not really hidden at all.\u00a0 People perceive that he is hidden, because they filter out his attempts at communication and force him into a template of \u201cthose who do not communicate.\u201d\u00a0 He is there; they just don\u2019t really see him. \n So, now I\u2019ve wandered back into the realm of stereotypes.\u00a0 My point is not to decry those individuals who dismiss my son (okay, so that is a lingering point in much of what I write, but I do have another point to make as well), instead my point is that as a parent I do have an obligation to put forth the effort necessary to communicate with Alex.\u00a0 So does my husband, his teachers, his doctors and his therapists.\u00a0 This is non-negotiable.\u00a0 While the rest of the world may be able to debate why they shouldn\u2019t have to put forth this effort, while they may be able to hunker down and refuse to do so like petulant children; we can\u2019t. \n Now, I could go off on a long tirade about how some parents don\u2019t accept this obligation, or how there are far too many teachers, doctors, therapists and caregivers who neglect their obligation to communicate with the people in their care.\u00a0 But I won\u2019t.\u00a0 Perhaps I\u2019ll do that at a later time\u2014maybe when I have a better idea how to fix that problem. \n Instead, I will return to how engaging is work.\u00a0 Communicating with someone who communicates a little differently, such as myself, requires a little more work than the average engaged conversation.\u00a0 Communicating with someone who communicates in a manner significantly different than your own, such as Alex, requires a lot more work than the average engaged conversation.\u00a0 Except the average engaged conversation is itself a rarity.\u00a0 More often we simply interact with templates instead of engage in conversations. \n For a long time now I\u2019ve known that communicating with Alex is something like speaking to someone in a foreign language you don\u2019t really understand.\u00a0 It\u2019s a learning process full of fits and starts.\u00a0 It requires a lot of effort and sometimes I\u2019m simply not up to the challenge.\u00a0 But I force myself to try, because Alex needs me to make that effort.\u00a0 Recently, the gentleman who was so good at prompting me to be more inclusive in our conversation at my graduation party was living with us.\u00a0 He put a great deal of effort into learning to communicate with my children.\u00a0 He also commented that learning to communicate with my children taught him a lot about communicating with other people as well.\u00a0 This struck a chord with me, because I have discovered the same thing on my own.\u00a0 Recently, my husband Mark commented that he found it very difficult to interact with Alex.\u00a0 While he was referring to play, communication is a big part of that\u2014and that communication is the biggest challenge for Mark.\u00a0 Mark has been able to connect with Willy and Brandon very well.\u00a0 He\u2019s also able to connect with Ben, though sometimes it seems that this is because Ben is so fascinated with Mark that  Ben  overcomes his own challenges to make the connection happen.\u00a0 But a similar connection with Alex eludes him as the communication barrier still looms largely between them. \n I guess my point is this:\u00a0 As much work as it is to communicate with someone who communicates in an atypical manner, the rewards for those who make that effort are often much bigger and much grander than communicating successfully with that one person, though I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty big, grand reward all by itself.\u00a0 Make the effort; it\u2019s worth it! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/07/on-engaging-and-atypical-communication-post-3-of-3/", "title": "On Engaging and Atypical Communication (Post 3 of 3)"},
{"date": "July 13, 2010", "body": "\r\n In my  previous post , I wrote about how prioritization and balance between important and urgent goals is necessary for my organizational process.\u00a0 After I figure out all I have to do, the next most important thing is having an \u201caway\u201d to put both things and projects.\u00a0 First, I must note that having an understanding of what you want to accomplish and what is important to you is essential  before  you determine how to go about putting things away.\u00a0 The decision of what constitutes away will depend a great deal on your priorities and your personality. \n Obstacle 2: To put things away, you must have an away in which to put them. \n While this seems pretty straight forward, it isn\u2019t always so.\u00a0 It can be tempting to resort to clutter piles.\u00a0 I certainly do!\u00a0 The problem with this is that if the clutter piles never get sorted, the tasks buried in the clutter piles rarely get accomplished.\u00a0 Furthermore, documents you\u2019ll need later are harder to find when needed if they\u2019re not stored properly. \n That being said, some vague \u201caways\u201d are fine.\u00a0 Just don\u2019t use them to avoid work that needs to be done. \n Solution 2a: Make an \u201caway\u201d for things. \n Living in a materialistic culture like the U.S., families tend to accumulate things.\u00a0 There are those who avoid this.\u00a0 We are not among them.\u00a0 My family is given many things throughout the year\u2014toys, books, clothes, ect.\u00a0 We are also sent things like bills and documents to fill out.\u00a0 We collect movies, books, and games.\u00a0 We are not as attached to things as our culture tends to encourage, but we have many things and they all need to have an away in which they are put. \n So, the first step to organizing your things is having an away in which to put them.\u00a0 In order to determine how many aways and what kind you require, you have to consider your priorities.\u00a0 For example, we have a playroom where we keep the boys\u2019 toys.\u00a0 There is a big toy chest that is full of rarely used big toys.\u00a0 There is a smaller toy chest that is full of often used big toys.\u00a0 There are two bins for stuffed animals and two bins for plastic toys.\u00a0 There are also smaller bins for particular sets of toys.\u00a0 I used to be rather, um, compulsive about how to put all the toys away.\u00a0 This compulsion didn\u2019t help the boys find their toys\u2014which was how I justified it\u2014and they didn\u2019t appreciate the effort I put into it.\u00a0 So, I stopped.\u00a0 It took a lot of effort, but I stopped.\u00a0 The effort required to put things away where everything was sorted was too much work and too little benefit.\u00a0 Take care to avoid activities that require more effort than the benefit they generate! \n When putting things away, you have to decide how much sorting is necessary and limit yourself to that degree of sorting.\u00a0 Is it enough to put all your books on book shelves or do you need the books arranged in a particular order?\u00a0 The answer will depend on your needs and your priorities.\u00a0 The same question can be asked of any set of objects, but only you can answer it. \n Solution 2a: Make an \u201caway\u201d for projects. \n While there usually are objects associated with projects, projects are categorized differently.\u00a0 What kind of projects do you have?\u00a0 If you are like me, many of your projects are ideas.\u00a0 Between the computer and a filing cabinet or two, I can store most of my projects.\u00a0 But I also have drawings, index cards, and other items to arrange. \n The trick to arranging projects is to have a set of places for each kind of project.\u00a0 I use cork boards to put long projects-in-progress on display.\u00a0 I take a sheet of paper, make an envelope out of it, and store notes on index cards in separate \u201cenvelope\u201d for each segment of the project.\u00a0 I also sort projects (ongoing and past) in file folders, in/out boxes, and the like. \n There are many systems you can try.\u00a0 Or you can mix and match systems to create your own unique system\u2014which is what I do.\u00a0 The purpose is to be able to find everything you need for any project you wish to work on and to keep projects-in-progress safe from destruction.\u00a0 Whether you use stacks of labeled shoe boxes or a tidy set of trays, you can organize your projects in any way that works for you.\u00a0 This may involve some trial and error, but you\u2019ll find that all that effort was worth its while once your system is up and running. \n \u00a0 \n Organizing your work takes time.\u00a0 Sometimes that time can be hard to come by.\u00a0 However, the effort you put into organization saves you even more time in the long-run.\u00a0 Of course, now that we\u2019ve talked about the processes of organization, there\u2019s still one piece missing.\u00a0 How do you turn that organization into accomplishment?\u00a0 That\u2019s the topic of the next post!

Sociology . a process of mutual adaptation between persons or groups, usually achieved by eliminating or reducing hostility, as by compromise or arbitration. \n 4. anything that supplies a need, want, favor, convenience, etc. \n 5. Usually, accommodations. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a. lodging. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b. food and lodging. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 c. a seat, berth, or other facilities for a passenger on a train, plane, etc. \n 6. readiness to aid or please others; obligingness. \n 7. a loan. \n 8.

If we do start from the premise, though, that the experience of being autistic is a discrete phenomenon, a spectrum which *ends* at the edge of a wide, abrupt, and colorless gap rather than shading into the experience of the larger population, then it is we who have cut off the autistic population from the possibility of being understood and accepted as human \u2014 that\u2019s not to be laid at the feet of anybody else\u2019s shallow understanding, or the inscrutability of autism.\u201d \n Luckily, that was not and is not my premise.\u00a0 (My premise, as per the discussion, was that \u201cautistic\u201d should not be used to reference stereotypical traits, like body rocking or heightened focus, that do not describe what autism really is.)\u00a0 More generally speaking, my philosophical premise is that the autism spectrum resides wholly within the human spectrum, that they are connected, interlinked and overlapping.\u00a0 For example, I consider myself to be too autistic to be neurotypical, but too neurotypical to be autistic.\u00a0 (While I am autistic enough to identify quite well with my children, it is very rare for my autistic traits to interfere with my daily life.) \n However, my beliefs regarding what should be seen aside, in our society there is a gap between \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cautistic\u201d that leaves many people cold\u2014under-served, un-assisted and lost in the wilds between unfunctionably autistic and functioning well.\u00a0 (This is not said to suggest that autistics are unfunctionable or that they should be seen as such, but merely to assert that this is a dominant belief in the larger population.) \n As this  news release  states, some of the people who fall in this gap of \u201cbetween\u201d are, in fact, diagnosably autistic.\u00a0 This news release, and the Swedish study associated with it, focuses on the under-diagnoses of girls with neurological differences (my wording, not theirs), including autism and ADHD.\u00a0 In areas of the world or at different economic levels, diagnoses can be difficult for both boys and girls to obtain.\u00a0 Furthermore, there is the obvious gap between how many adults could qualify for such a diagnosis and those who have access to a diagnostician who could give it to them.\u00a0 Thus, some of those who fall in the gap are actually on the autism spectrum. \n Along with those who qualify for the autism diagnosis, this  study  (as found in  NPR ) suggests that there are those, specifically siblings of diagnosed autistic children, who have autistic traits that either do not qualify for or do not receive a diagnosis of autism.\u00a0 This article focuses on language delays and speech problems, but I\u2019ve read elsewhere that sensory processing disorder is also more likely to occur in siblings without an autism diagnosis.\u00a0 This suggests to me that if the language and sensory facets of autism can occur independently in siblings (and probably others), then the social facet of autism likely occurs independently as well.\u00a0 All these facets of autism are not attributed to being traits of autism when experienced independently of each other\u2014which suggests to me that they individuals also fall in the gap \u201cbetween\u201d autism and normality, where services and accommodations are difficult to obtain. \n It is my hope that our society becomes more aware of the way the autism spectrum overlaps and interlinks with the human spectrum, and that the more we do so the more we will appreciate, accept and facilitate neurological differences\u2014both those pronounced enough to be labeled \u201cdisorders\u201d and those subtle enough to fall in the current gaps of awareness.\u00a0 I know my life would have been a bit easier if both I and others were more aware of my sensory processing and social differences earlier in life.\u00a0 For me, it took having three children with autism to discover how close to the autism spectrum I was and to accommodate myself accordingly.\u00a0 Which is not suggest I have any horror stories\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014but understanding oneself and being able to communicate that understanding to others creates a richer, more \u201cright\u201d life for all of us. \n Somehow we need to close these gaps and stop letting people fall through into the abyss of not knowing and not being known. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.shiftjournal.com/2010/09/23/autism-the-word-as-glimpsed-in-the-wild/", "http://www.shiftjournal.com/", "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-10/uog-gwa100410.php", "http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/appi.ajp.2010.09101470v1", "http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/10/04/130324617/siblings-of-a-child-with-autism-often-have-subtler-problems?ft=1&f=1001"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/10/who-falls-in-the-gap/", "title": "Who Falls in the Gap?"},

{"date": "October 9, 2010", "body": "\r\n Next week I\u2019ll be addressing the issue of bullying.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been meaning to do so for weeks, but it\u2019s a complicated and an emotional topic.\u00a0 So I\u2019ve put it off. \n Today, I\u2019ll be putting it off one more time.\u00a0 Earlier this week I spoke to a counselor regarding a matter I\u2019m not going to discuss.\u00a0 However, in the process of this discussion the topic of bi-polar disorder came up\u2014in relation to me, not my husband.\u00a0 I got from this discussion a referral to a psychiatrist, who I saw today. \n Fifteen minutes into the conversation the psychiatrist was convinced I was not bi-polar.\u00a0 In going through her notes and the referral, she determined that a likely point of confusion was my use of \u201ccyclical\u201d to describe my depression.\u00a0 I used cyclical, because I experience depression in semi-predictable cycles throughout the year.\u00a0 My depression follows a pattern that allows me to recognize when I\u2019m getting depressed, know that I\u2019ll get un-depressed, and recognize when I\u2019m coming out of the depression.\u00a0 To me, that implies a cycle.\u00a0 \n Apparently, cyclical means something else to psychologists and psychiatrists.\u00a0 It means seasonal affective disorder, manic-depression, and other disorders that involve a cycle.\u00a0 But, unless the cycle of depression is attached to seasonal differences, cyclical depression is not recognized as such\u2014they call it recurrent depression instead. \n Thus, the interpretations of the experiences I describe can hinge on a single word. \n In discussing what I do with the psychiatrist, I also asked if she was familiar with neurodiversity.\u00a0 She\u2019d heard about it; she\u2019d read about it.\u00a0 But her interpretation of whatever she\u2019d read was that neurodiversity was anti-psychology and anti-psychiatry.\u00a0 Admittedly, some people within the greater neurodiversity community are anti-psychology and anti-psychiatry; but I don\u2019t think that reflects the movement as a whole. \n What I think the movement does reflect, however, is the willingness to question the authority and expertise of medical professionals.\u00a0 I\u2019ve encountered some psychologists who regard this as a personal threat or a personal attack and I\u2019ve encountered some psychologists who welcome the scrutiny.\u00a0 However, in my limited experience, those who resent it seem to dominate the profession. \n Personally, I think it\u2019s important to question all of those in authority, not just those in the medical profession.\u00a0 Not to do so obstinately or just for the sake of being uncooperative, but to do so because human beings\u2014all human beings\u2014are fallible and so are human constructs, including science (and, yes, religions, too).\u00a0 We are fallible.\u00a0 Our authority figures and experts are fallible.\u00a0 And, unless we\u2019re willing to acknowledge that and question beliefs (including our own), we\u2019re going to be stuck with badness\u2014bad science, bad religion, bad societies. \n Luckily, I\u2019m familiar enough with both myself and bi-polar disorder that I was highly skeptical of this hypothesis.\u00a0 I brought that skepticism with me to my appointment today, and found a doctor who was willing to listen.\u00a0 That\u2019s good.\u00a0 But I can imagine a situation where expressions of skepticism are unlikely or where the doctor isn\u2019t willing to listen.\u00a0 I know both happen.\u00a0 And on such a small thing as two different interpretations of a word a wrong diagnosis can be made when all other evidence indicates that the diagnosis is wrong. \n And we\u2019re not supposed to question that?\u00a0 I just can\u2019t buy that. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/10/questioning/", "title": "Questioning"},

I need accomplishments.\u00a0 I by no means wish to belittled people whose lives are contentedly lived on the third-tier.\u00a0 There is something admirable about that\u2014and their households certainly run more smoothly than does my own.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not particularly skilled at the domestic round, nor am I particularly contented with it.\u00a0 I  need  to write.\u00a0 And I  need  that writing to accumulate into big projects\u2014books, novels, collections of short stories and articles and blog posts.\u00a0 And, of course, I could fill day after day after day with second-tier or first-tier work, at the exclusion of all else, but then my family life would be chaotic.\u00a0 I mean, more chaotic than it is. \n So, we\u2019re back to balance.\u00a0 In order to live my life well, I must balance first-tier, second-tier, and third-tier work.\u00a0 Generally speaking, I regard second-tier work as the highest priority and third-tier work as the most urgent.\u00a0 First-tier work is accomplished by breaking it down into second- and third-tier work.\u00a0 In order to write my books, I have to start by writing my first book.\u00a0 In order to write my first book, today I must work on the outline of my first chapter.\u00a0 Another example:\u00a0 In order to help my children achieve independence, I have to build a set of skills.\u00a0 In order to build that set of skills, I have to work on this with Willy, that with Alex, and the other thing with Ben.\u00a0 In short, in order to attain balance, I have to break down each tier until I have a lot of third-tier activities.\u00a0 The difference, of course, is that now many of these third-tier activities will accumulate into the accomplishment of second-tier and first-tier activities.\u00a0 \n By breaking down first-tier and second-tier goals into third-tier activities, I find myself back to having more work to do than I can actually get done. \n Solution 1b: Prioritizing tasks to equal accomplishments. \n With so much third-tier work to do, I must prioritize the many tasks into categories of importance and urgency.\u00a0 The hardest thing is not to be so driven by urgency that you neglect important things.\u00a0 I could easily fill my days with urgent matters. \u00a0The problem is that by spending my time solely on urgent matters my tasks would never accumulate to the achievement of my goals.\u00a0 I could easily fill my days with important matters.\u00a0 The problem is that eventually the neglected urgent matters would eventual compile into an unimaginable monster that consumes me\u2014or I\u2019d trip over that one toy out of the hundreds on the floor that I couldn\u2019t dodge, fall down the stairs and break my neck.\u00a0 Either way it\u2019s a \u201cgame over\u201d for me. \n I don\u2019t want to be consumed by the urgency monster and I don\u2019t want to have to dodge toys all the time.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re back to balance.\u00a0 I balance important tasks, urgent tasks, and tasks that just need to be done whenever I have a spare moment (these tasks are often neglected until they become urgent). \n To do this, I plan my week and create daily to-do lists.\u00a0 Daily,  color-coded  to do lists.\u00a0 This is where effectively managed OCD becomes a good thing.\u00a0 Really.\u00a0 This is also where I become especially grateful for tools like a  Franklin Covey planner  and  Microsoft\u2019s OneNote . \n Then, of course, it\u2019s just a matter of getting to work.\u00a0 Easy, right?\u00a0 Hm. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://store.franklinplanner.com/store/index.jsp", "http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/07/to-organize-part-1-finding-balance-through-prioritization/", "title": "To Organize (Part 1):  Finding Balance through Prioritization"},

or it may be between two playmates. \n The girl bully that is prominent in my childhood was an example of the latter.\u00a0 You see, one of the hardest things about not going to summer camp as a child was that there were long stretches of the summer when all my regular friends were gone\u2014often to the same camp together, which left me feeling even more excluded. \u00a0For one or two agonizing weeks I had to stretch myself socially just to have anyone to play with.\u00a0 This was always difficult; making friends was hard enough without having to do so as the one left behind. \n One summer I played with an older girl who was visiting her grandparents.\u00a0 She was mean.\u00a0 She was bossy.\u00a0 She was also the only one around for me to play with.\u00a0 All my ideas were stupid.\u00a0 But when she put my ideas into her own words they became brilliant games we could play.\u00a0 She was always the leader, always the princess or whatever plumb role our game might happen to have.\u00a0 And the worst part of it all was how she was able to manipulate me into feeling privileged because she was willing to play with me. \n This is bullying.\u00a0 It\u2019s about dominance; but emotional dominance is the stock and trade of girls, not physical dominance.\u00a0 But, don\u2019t let that dissuade you; it\u2019s still bullying. \n When girls\u2019 bullying escalates into harassment, it takes on a more cutting, more heavily targeted tone.\u00a0 Consider for a moment that girls, when conforming to neurological and gender norms, gossip about others.\u00a0 Now imagine for a moment that all that gossip, backbiting, and meanness is targeted on a single individual.\u00a0 Imagine that the victim is targeted not by one girl, but by a clique of girls who travel together and try to one-up each other as they tear apart their victim emotionally.\u00a0 That is harassment, and it happens a lot. \n As a child, I was never very popular.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t travel in the popular circles.\u00a0 But I usually had one friend in those circles who saw me as quirky instead of weird.\u00a0 Such a small thing can make a really big difference.\u00a0 That one friend acted as something of a barrier between me and constant, female-style harassment.\u00a0 But being on the outside, I witnessed that harassment of others and felt powerless to stop it.\u00a0 However much I stood up for or validated the victim, I couldn\u2019t stop the harassment itself.\u00a0 Like the gossiping and the bullying, girls\u2019 harassment tends to be primarily emotional, but nonetheless devastating. \n Finally, girls can be just as abusive as boys.\u00a0 The physical violence is often less obvious.\u00a0 Girls, when conforming to gender norms, do not roll around on the ground and pull each other\u2019s hair as is sometimes portrayed in movies.\u00a0 Cat fights tend to be prevalent in certain sub-cultures, but it is not the mainstream.\u00a0 This does  not  mean girls cannot or are not abusive.\u00a0 The violence, as I said, is subtler, but can often be more dangerous because of that subtlety.\u00a0 The violence girls inflict on each other can range from \u201cpoisoning\u201d with non-lethal (but still dangerous) chemicals\u2014like slipping an overdose of laxatives in a girl\u2019s drink\u2014to reckless endangerment, where a girl chased another girl (who was on foot) in a car, driving on the sidewalk to better make her point.\u00a0 It can also include manipulating the guys in the girls\u2019 clique to sexually harass their victim, which is often with the intent of setting the girl up for public humiliation when it\u2019s revealed the guy(s) didn\u2019t even want her to begin with.\u00a0 (I\u2019ve seen guys try to do this on their own, too, but it never seems to work as effectively.) \n This violence is rarely one on one.\u00a0 It\u2019s often done in a collective manner.\u00a0 The girls who are daring enough to perform these acts are often well-thought-of by the adults in their lives, and feel sufficiently secure in their reputations that, even if their victim were foolish enough to tell she wouldn\u2019t be believed by anyone with the authority to act.\u00a0 (If you\u2019ve seen  Cruel Intentions , then you\u2019ve seen a dramatized version of this\u2014most girls that try it, however, are not quite that successful or resourceful.) \u00a0To further isolate themselves from repercussions, the bully-girls work diligently to maintain their reputation with adults, while performing acts that are attributed to their victim in such a way that puts their victim\u2019s reputation in jeopardy, further eroding the possibility that one \u201ctrouble-maker\u2019s\u201d word would trump their collective word as to what happened. \n The bullying girls inflict on other girls is insidious and subtle, but it is no less brutal, no less tragic for that.\u00a0 In some ways, it is more so.\u00a0 Girls often cannot show off their bruises or their scars.\u00a0 It\u2019s all internal.\u00a0 Even when their life is endangered with abuse, there is rarely any visible evidence to attest to the danger they were placed in by their peers.\u00a0 Girls will be girls.\u00a0 But girls should not be allowed to inflict others with their cruelty.\u00a0 And yet it goes on, because, after all, girls aren\u2019t really bullies.\u00a0 That\u2019s just boy-stuff and it\u2019s all good. \n \u00a0 \n [Coming Next:\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Wonder  Why ?\u201d] \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/10/bullying-part-3-girls-will-be-girls/", "title": "Bullying (Part 3): \u201cGirls Will Be Girls\u201d"},

behavior doesn\u2019t usually look the same.\u00a0 I could stop there and just move onto bullying in the adult world. \n But I can\u2019t really.\u00a0 Bullying is bad.\u00a0 Bullies are behaving badly.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t mean that bullies themselves are  necessarily  bad.\u00a0 Perhaps that seems like an argument in semantics.\u00a0 Perhaps I may come across overly empathetic.\u00a0 But\u2026it\u2019s not, and I\u2019m not. \n My Defense \n Semantics :\u00a0 I try not to tell my kids \u201cyou\u2019re naughty.\u201d\u00a0 Semantics, perhaps, but I believe it sends the wrong message, especially to literal-minded youngsters.\u00a0 Instead, I say \u201cthat\u2019s naughty,\u201d referring to the behavior.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t raised with that distinction, but I believe in making it.\u00a0 Like any other imperfect parent, sometimes I fail, but that\u2019s not the point.\u00a0 My kids are good kids, and they need to know that.\u00a0 Sometimes my kids do bad things, and they need to know that, too.\u00a0 \n It\u2019s more than semantics.\u00a0 The first is a statement of being; whereas, the second is a statement of doing.\u00a0 There is a real difference there, and I believe that this difference can be unconsciously, unintentionally internalized.\u00a0 I can\u2019t prove that.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a psychologist or a sociologist.\u00a0 But I believe if kids grow up hearing they\u2019re bad or naughty all the time, they\u2019re going to believe it so strongly that they become what you said they were (without outside interference).\u00a0 So I do make that distinction. \n Overly-Empathetic :\u00a0 I\u2019ve known, both as an adult and as a child, a variety of children who engage in bullying behaviors.\u00a0 Often, if you delve deeply enough, there is something significantly wrong in a child\u2019s life that leads to bullying, though it is not always direct or readily apparent.\u00a0 If you address what\u2019s going wrong in that child\u2019s life, you may be able to stop the bullying\u2014both as a current behavior and as a coping mechanism.\u00a0 In effect, when one child is bullying another, what you\u2019re often seeing are two children who are hurting badly, not just one. \n My Argument \n Most kids are good kids\u2014they\u2019re good kids who occasionally do bad things.\u00a0 Bullying is one of the many bad things a child may do.\u00a0 Saying it doesn\u2019t make the bullying any less bad, nor does it make it any less important to stop the bullying.\u00a0 But in order to stop the bullying you often need to understand the whys behind the behavior. \n I know a child who used to engage in bullying behavior.\u00a0 It was rather shocking, because this child was young and bullying was not tolerated in the environment in which I interacted with the child.\u00a0 (Yes, I\u2019m being vague to protect the identity of the child.)\u00a0 My first reaction was to try to stomp out the bullying behaviors\u2014and I took a very authoritarian approach to this.\u00a0 The child was young enough for me to pick him up kicking and screaming (literally) in order to discipline him.\u00a0 And I did.\u00a0 His behavior was unacceptable, and he had to know that. \n But it didn\u2019t work.\u00a0 The bullying behaviors, along with other unacceptable behaviors, continued.\u00a0 Sometimes the victims would change, but the bullying didn\u2019t stop, because the need for bullying didn\u2019t stop. \n The calmer, more rational I got, the more I saw that this was a child in pain.\u00a0 Because of my relationship with this child I was able to get close enough to see that pain and identify the cause (it took years, sadly).\u00a0 The child was being emotionally abused\u2014not in the environment in which I interacted with him, but in his home environment.\u00a0 The child\u2019s negative behaviors were coping mechanisms.\u00a0 He was in pain and his world was unstable.\u00a0 He felt he had no control, and bullying was a means of obtaining some control over his world. \n I tried to confront the abuser, but she didn\u2019t see her behavior as abuse.\u00a0 She refused to acknowledge the abuse.\u00a0 I researched parental abuse to see how to report it, and in my research I discovered that the state I lived in does not even acknowledge this kind of behavior as abuse.\u00a0 I talked to as many people as I could, but I could not find a way to make it stop. \n Then, I got creative.\u00a0 I could do nothing about the parent.\u00a0 But I had limited access to the child.\u00a0 I could affect him.\u00a0 So, while his mother tore him down, I built him up.\u00a0 I enlisted others to help me.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to say that he now has a healthy dose of both self-esteem and empathy.\u00a0 He was even brave enough to confront his mother and put a stop to some of the abuse.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud, not of my own cleverness, but of him.\u00a0 He is a good kid, and he knows it.\u00a0 And, yes, sometimes he still does bad things, but he\u2019s not bad and he\u2019s not a bully. \n I have seen other kids who engage in bullying behaviors as coping mechanisms.\u00a0 These kids are, in my experience, often bullied, harassed or abused by adults in their life\u2014adults who they should be able to trust, who should be taking care of them, who are hurting them instead.\u00a0 If bullying is all a child knows\u2014or even just what the child knows best\u2014the child is likely to engage in bullying behaviors.\u00a0 And for a few moments out of his or her day that child is going to be the one on top instead of the one being crushed. \n I say this not to defend bullying behavior.\u00a0 These behaviors are damaging to the bully and to the victim and they should not be tolerated.\u00a0 But addressing the behaviors requires a willingness to explore the root cause(s) of the behaviors.\u00a0 If we do not, we risk the possibility that we\u2019re ignoring warning signs of a serious situation that will, if not address, create worse problems in the future. \n Of course, not all bullies engage in bullying behaviors as a coping mechanism. \u00a0There are other reasons children engage in bullying behaviors.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something I will cover in my next post. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "October 27, 2010", "body": "\r\n Here\u2019s another  distraction  from bullying: \n Indiana\u2019s budget crunch has become so severe that some state workers have suggested leaving severely disabled people at homeless shelters if they can't be cared for at home, parents and advocates said. \n It\u2019s all about the budget crunch.\u00a0 No, really!\u00a0 \n Oh, wait\u2026 \n But some families have been on waiting lists for waivers for 10 years.  The lists contained more than 20,000 names last month, and one advocacy group predicted they will only grow longer because  Gov. Mitch Daniels ordered budget cuts that have eliminated 2,000 waiver slots since July . \n (emphasis added) \n So, is it just me, or does that imply it\u2019s not about the budget cuts at all?\u00a0 Sure, the budget cuts are making for a longer waiting list because Governor Mitch Daniels doesn\u2019t care enough to find another solution.\u00a0 But, really?\u00a0 Waiting 10 years for services.\u00a0 And this is just becoming a problem now?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so! \n Budget cuts also have resulted in the state moving foster children with disabilities to a lower cost program that doesn't provide services for special needs and eliminating a grocery benefit for hundreds of developmentally disabled adults. \n See, maybe it\u2019s just me.\u00a0 But I see this and I don\u2019t start thinking, \u201cOh, Indiana must be really hard-up for cash!\u201d\u00a0 No, I start thinking that Indiana\u2019s government doesn\u2019t care about people with disabilities.\u00a0 That\u2014in Indiana\u2014people with disabilities just aren\u2019t worth spending money on. \n Maybe it\u2019s just me.\u00a0 Or maybe\u2026 \n Maybe  environmentally-friendly roads  are more important than people with disabilities. \n Or maybe  holding onto their cash  is more important than people with disabilities. \n Maybe  the election season  is just too damned important to give the people of Indiana the services they need to survive. \n Some parents said homeless shelters have also been suggested -  or threatened  - as an option by private care providers. \n Daunna Minnich of Bloomington said Indiana Department of Education funding for residential treatment for her 18-year-old daughter, Sabrina, is due to run out Sunday. She said officials at Damar Services Inc. of Indianapolis told her during a meeting that unless she took Sabrina home with her, the agency would drop the teen off at a homeless shelter. \n Sabrina, who\u2019s bipolar and has anxiety attacks, has attempted suicide, run away during home visits and threatened her older sister, Minnich said. Bringing Sabrina home isn\u2019t a viable option, but the two group home placements BDDS offered weren't appropriate, she said. \n \u201cI don't want to see the state of Indiana hasten her demise by putting her in a one-size-fits-all solution that will drive her to desperate acts,\u201d Minnich said. \n Jim Dalton, Dama\u2019s chief operating officer, said he could not comment directly on any specific case but his nonprofit would never leave a client at a homeless shelter - even though it is caring for some for free after they got too old for school-funded services and haven\u2019t yet been granted Medicaid waivers. \n \u201cWe\u2019re talking about youth that absolutely require services, and no one is willing to fund them anymore,\u201d Dalton said. \n (emphasis added) \n Really, this isn\u2019t about money, people.\u00a0 It\u2019s about value\u2014or the lack of value Indiana officials see in people with disabilities.\u00a0 It's government-sanctioned abuse.\u00a0 And it\u2019s got to stop! \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kfvs12.com/Global/story.asp?S=13399963", "http://www.wthr.com/story/13376853/indiana-spending-77-million-to-reduce-highway-impact", "http://www.wane.com/dpp/news/indiana/indiana-spending-down%3B-cash-reserves-up", "http://www.post-trib.com/news/elections/2837516,el-lccouncil56-1027.article"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/10/statement-of-values-indiana-workers-recommend-dropping-kids/", "title": "Statement of Values: Indiana Workers Recommend Dropping Kids"},
{"date": "July 27, 2010", "body": "\r\n First , I wrote about how prioritization and balance between important and urgent goals is necessary for my organizational process.\u00a0  Then , I wrote about how I need a system to put things and projects away.\u00a0 Now, I will write about how I go about accomplishing the things on my to-do lists each day. \n Obstacle 3: There are so many things to do, and so little energy to do them with. \n This goes back to the  spoons theme :\u00a0 My energy (and yours) is always limited, and some days it\u2019s more limited than others.\u00a0 My energy also varies during different times in the day. \n Along with limited energy, two other finite resources affect my ability to accomplish tasks.\u00a0 One is my ability to concentrate.\u00a0 Unfortunately for me, sometimes having energy doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m able to concentrate.\u00a0 Sometimes being able to concentrate doesn\u2019t mean I have energy.\u00a0 The most mentally challenging tasks have to be completed in those periods of time where having energy and being able to concentrate intersect.\u00a0 The other finite resource is time.\u00a0 This is significant, because there are tasks that are time sensitive and those that are not.\u00a0 For example, today \u201ccall re: Alex\u2019s teeth\u201d was on my to-do list.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t get to it before 5:00 PM.\u00a0 Therefore, it had to be bumped to the next day.\u00a0 I cannot schedule a dental appointment for my son after 5:00 PM.\u00a0 A complicating factor is that I have very little awareness of the passage of time while I\u2019m doing something.\u00a0 As long as my energy and concentration holds out, I will not notice as the minutes run into hours.\u00a0 This is why I didn\u2019t notice the time until it was too late to make the call. \n Managing my to-do list with finite energy, finite concentration, and time-sensitive tasks requires its own degree of organization. \n Solution 3a: Prioritize the Day \n The first thing I do with my to-do list is I number it.\u00a0 There are little boxes, courtesy of my Franklin-Covey planner in which I place the numbers in the order I intend to accomplish specific tasks.\u00a0 This order is very flexible.\u00a0 As the day progresses, I do not necessarily do things in the original order.\u00a0 This depends a great deal on the speed with which I accomplish my tasks, my energy, and my ability to concentrate.\u00a0 That being said, there\u2019s a method to which I put things in order. \n I start my day with some very low-pressure activities.\u00a0 In the first one to three hours my ability to concentrate is minimal\u2014I do NOT jump out of bed, ready to tackle life.\u00a0 I\u2019m more the fall-out-of-bed-and-stumble-down-stairs sort of gal.\u00a0 This might have something to do with consistently getting inadequate sleep, but I think it also has to do with the jarring nature of the transition from sleep to wakefulness.\u00a0 I think if I could sleep once a week and be good for the rest of the week, then I\u2019d save a lot of time \u201cwasted\u201d on transitioning from sleep to wakefulness.\u00a0 But, alas, sleep is something I need almost every day.\u00a0 So, I start my day with easy-to-accomplish activities. \n Then, assuming I got at least 4 hours of sleep, I have a period of high-energy/high-concentration that lasts anywhere from two to five hours (depending on how much sleep I got, how noisy things are, and a myriad other factors).\u00a0 This is when I do my mentally challenging tasks.\u00a0 Today, I spent that time working on a professional resume package. \n Furthermore, to maximize this time I also give myself brain-off tasks interspersed between mentally challenging activities.\u00a0 This is when I do things like wash dishes, vacuum, and wash, fold and put away laundry.\u00a0 These activities require physical energy, but little mental effort.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why I have more productive time when I flip back and forth between mentally invigorating tasks and mentally tedious tasks, but I do. \n Then, I have a fall in energy and the ability to concentrate.\u00a0 At this point I\u2019m back to relatively simple, sedentary tasks.\u00a0 This is usually where I do something like take notes on my writing studies (not my homework), go on Facebook, read a book, or watch a movie. \n After a break of this sort, I have a rise in concentration or energy, but usually not both.\u00a0 I either do mentally challenging work or finish household chores, depending on whether I get the energy or the concentration. \n Then, whichever it was, I get the flip-side of that of that particular coin and do whatever tasks relate to this side. \n Finally, during the wind-down part of my day, I\u2019m back to the simpler, sedentary tasks. \n The point is not that my pattern should be your pattern.\u00a0 My point is that by recognizing your own pattern, whatever it may be, you\u2019re more likely to maximize both your productivity and your effectiveness by scheduling your tasks in accordance with your own energy/concentration ratios. \n Of course, you can always supplement with caffeine, ginseng, or other boosters to help you stretch out your energy, your concentration, or both.\u00a0 But, if you do that too much, then you get rather dependent on those things\u2014trust me, I know! \n Solution 3b: Color-Coding Keeps Things in Order \n One thing that should be clear from the description above is that while I only maintain two lists each day\u2014the household list and the professional list\u2014there are sub-lists to each of those lists.\u00a0 I distinguish these sub-lists by color-coding.\u00a0 For example, my tedious professional work is written in black.\u00a0 My high-concentration work is written in red.\u00a0 My writing\u2014referring to my novels, short stories, and my book\u2014is written in purple, not because it\u2019s not high-concentration work, but because it\u2019s easier to make myself do it and therefore less urgent.\u00a0 Other less urgent work is in blue. \n For my household work, the colors are different.\u00a0 Black marks the things I have to do at my writing desk (i.e., the desk my computer is NOT at).\u00a0 Red marks the things I have to do at my computer desk.\u00a0 Blue marks chores, which usually have to be done outside of my office (unless the chore is to clean my office).\u00a0 Green marks things I have to do outside the house. \n Obstacle 4:\u00a0 Getting to Work \n By organizing my to-do lists in this way, I have a tenuous plan for the day.\u00a0 But, it\u2019s still only a plan.\u00a0 To implement that plan, I actually have to get to work. \n This can be difficult.\u00a0 On really bad days it can seem impossible.\u00a0 Sometimes I overcome the feeling of impossibility.\u00a0 Other times I don\u2019t. \n And that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 I give myself permission to have bad days and you should, too. \n Solution 4a:\u00a0 Mark Up Your Progress \n I start my day by checking my e-mail.\u00a0 I don\u2019t necessary  do  anything with the e-mails I received, but I do take stock.\u00a0 It\u2019s like a warm-up exercise before going for a run.\u00a0 After that, I choose one thing on my to-do list\u2014usually my prayer journal\u2014and highlight it in yellow.\u00a0 This means it\u2019s something to tackle right away.\u00a0 Then, I go and read from Daily Guideposts and my scriptures, respond to what I read, and write down a prayer.\u00a0 After that\u2019s done, I use a green highlighter to highlight over the yellow and put a check mark in the box.\u00a0 It feels good.\u00a0 My day is officially started.\u00a0 \n As my day progresses, I choose what I\u2019m going to highlight yellow next based on my energy/concentration ratio.\u00a0 The highlighting helps me focus on only a few of the many things I need to do at a time.\u00a0 I try not to have more than four or five things highlighted in yellow on a side.\u00a0 Sometimes, when I\u2019m having difficulty concentrating, I keep it down to one or two things in yellow on a side.\u00a0 And seeing the accumulation of green highlighted lines is very gratifying for me.\u00a0 Of course, the pesky orange highlights\u2014those items I\u2019ve put off until a different day\u2014can seem rather sad, but sometimes that\u2019s necessary. \n I use highlighters and colored pens because they\u2019re bold and bright and they stand out.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier for me to see those things I want to see\u2014like the next thing on my to-do list\u2014without getting overwhelmed by all the other tasks.\u00a0 It takes a bit of training to see the list this way\u2014at least, it did for me.\u00a0 But with practice, the green and orange lines are \u201cgone\u201d from the to-do list, except when I want to see what I\u2019ve accomplished and what I\u2019ve already put off.\u00a0 While I\u2019m working I can glance at the yellow lines and know what I\u2019m going to do next.\u00a0 It keeps me on track and it keeps me working. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

society has no obligation to provide for the needs of parents of children with special needs.\u00a0 Nor is it to say that those needs are not important.\u00a0 Children need their parents, and their

I have grown up in a very selfish age.\u00a0 Some books I\u2019ve read as a business student cited the 1980\u2019s as a significant shift in focus.\u00a0 Parents who grew up with relatively little found they had an abundance, and they did not want their children to go without anything they desired.\u00a0 Marketers and businesses encouraged this, and the resulting sales fed some of the economic booms over the last few decades.\u00a0 When the abundance was not available, people assumed debts to feed their unquenchable desires\u2014and that led, at least in part, to the recent economic crash.\u00a0 It also created spoiled children that grew into spoiled adults.\u00a0 Those adults are now parenting today\u2019s children\u2014and they (the adults) are still spoiled, selfish, self-absorbed people. \n This is not an accusation against individuals.\u00a0 It\u2019s a societal trend\u2014specific to, but probably not exclusive to, the United States. \n This trend is in-grained into our society\u2014fed by marketers, service providers, businesses, and non-profit organizations\u2014that it pervades just about every facet of our lives.\u00a0 Sure, there are individuals who have not succumbed to this culture.\u00a0 But the cultural shift is so huge it\u2019s hardly recognizable\u2014like trying to identify an elephant under a microscope. \n Our children are those who, above all, must pay the cost of this culture.\u00a0 From liberated women to liberated men, we have families pulled apart by selfishness and self-absorption.\u00a0 And society as a whole caters to this self-involvement\u2014supplies must match demands or the supplies sit unused.\u00a0 It\u2019s an economic law.\u00a0 The demand created by those with the power\u2014that\u2019s us, the adults\u2014is based on this self-indulgent culture. \n I remember (when I was still in junior high) reading about some of the social justice movements of the times.\u00a0 An oft-repeated slogan was:\u00a0 \u201cWhat about the children?\u201d\u00a0 This slogan was used for all sorts of things when I was growing up.\u00a0 From environmental issues to the idea of nuclear war, from organizations determined to equalize the racial divides to charities designed to raise funds for the impoverished countries of the world. \u00a0\u201cWhat about the children?\u00a0 Think about the children!\u201d \n But the children grew up.\u00a0 And now, for so many social justice movements, the call is \u201cWhat about me?\u201d \n It\u2019s a huge shift that affects so many parts of our culture.\u00a0 The impact is devastating.\u00a0 Sure, some social justice movements have profited a great deal from the focus.\u00a0 Green is huge at least in part because the privileged middle-class use being green as a social stepping stone to being worthy of notice.\u00a0 Gay rights movements have flourished, at least relatively speaking, because of the \u201cWhat about me?\u201d focus.\u00a0 The neurodiversity movement exists, at least in part, because of the \u201cWhat about me?\u201d focus. \n But so much of life isn\u2019t about me.\u00a0 And it isn\u2019t about you.\u00a0 It\u2019s about the children. \n There are many programs that have \u201chelping individuals with autism\u201d as their goal, and those programs should focus on those individuals with autism.\u00a0 First and foremost.\u00a0 The needs of their families are a secondary consideration, but a consideration nonetheless.\u00a0 But that is not what we have today.\u00a0 Programs focus on the parents:\u00a0 either directly meeting the needs of the parents or meeting the needs of the children as those needs are expressed by the parents.\u00a0 \n Whether I\u2019m talking to a doctor, to a teacher, or to a social worker, I often have to fight to get them to focus on my children\u2019s needs.\u00a0 I can tell them some of what those needs are, but these observations are always going to be filtered through my own perceptions and my own understanding.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 And, try as hard as I do to learn, there\u2019s so much I will never know.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we have specialists.\u00a0 Unfortunately, parents often encounter so-called specialists who devalue their children; thus, parents have insisted in having more of a say, in order to advocate for their children\u2019s well-being.\u00a0 But the self-absorption and self-indulgence of our culture is very seductive and many parents focus on the wrong things\u2014things that have more to do with themselves than their children. \n My children need those specialists to take a step back from me, my needs, and my perceptions.\u00a0 They need to see my children\u2019s needs as independent from my own.\u00a0 And they need to help me better meet my children\u2019s needs.\u00a0 Often, meeting the needs of my children alleviates needs I had because of my children\u2019s unmet needs.\u00a0 But, the reverse is not true quite as often. \n For example, Ben is staying up late into the night.\u00a0 Tuesday it was until after 11pm.\u00a0 Wednesday it was after midnight before he fell asleep.\u00a0 Thursday it was 11:30 pm.\u00a0 Now, if I were to express my need, I might say something like, \u201cI need a respite worker to sit up with Ben so I can get some work done.\u201d\u00a0 From a purely selfish perspective, that is what  I  need.\u00a0 Meeting my need would not help Ben, who needs more sleep, get his needs met.\u00a0 But at least my need would be met.\u00a0 But wait.\u00a0 What if we could meet Ben\u2019s need?\u00a0 (Yes, we tried that with the melatonin, but obviously that\u2019s not working so well any more.)\u00a0 If Ben got to sleep at a reasonable time, my need would be met and so would his. \n It\u2019s a shift in focus.\u00a0 And that shift is an unmet need for our whole society. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "September 7, 2010", "body": "\r\n Earlier this year, I finished up four years of college in pursuit of a bachelor\u2019s degree.\u00a0 It was a great accomplishment for me, but it also thrust me into uncomfortable territory.\u00a0 During those four years, I went to campus once\u2014and that was just to take the test to get in.\u00a0 Even my graduation ceremony was held off campus.\u00a0 All my classes were online. \n But graduate school will be different.\u00a0 In order to get the graduate degree I want, I will have to take most (perhaps all) of my classes in person, on campus, amongst my fellow students.\u00a0 Yes, that\u2019s right. \u00a0I will actually leave the comfort of my own home and go out amongst strangers. \n Now, I\u2019m not sure how aptly \u201cpassing\u201d applies to my situation.\u00a0 As I\u2019ve said before and will undoubtedly say again, I have no diagnosis of autism and, unless the medical services structure catches up, I\u2019ll probably never be evaluated for a diagnosis\u2014as things are now an adult diagnosis simply requires too much effort.\u00a0 So, I\u2019m not deemed to be on the autism spectrum.\u00a0 However, I\u2019m not neurotypical either.\u00a0 Along with a history of mental health issues (depression and anxiety, mostly), I experience sensory stimuli differently from most people\u2014something I was only able to figure out after my children were diagnosed with autism and sensory integration disorder.\u00a0 Since I have figured it out, I\u2019ve been able to consciously develop coping mechanisms.\u00a0 I\u2019ve thrown off the shackles of not-coping and use the coping mechanisms that allow me to be who I am without being overwhelmed, at least when I\u2019m at home. \n But what should I do about graduate school?\u00a0 On the one hand, part of the purpose of attending a written communications program and getting a graduate degree in writing is to participate in the writing community.\u00a0 You meet people who write and that helps improve your craft and also improves your long-term chances of a making a living writing by finding people who take an interest in your work.\u00a0 That\u2019s the idea anyway.\u00a0 Fitting in (thus blending in) has something to do with that\u2014not that I\u2019ve ever understood what that really means or how one really goes about it, but it seems to be how our society works.\u00a0 \n On the other hand, my odd-seeming coping mechanisms help me concentrate.\u00a0 They help me focus my mind on what I\u2019m listening to instead of being distracted by the background sounds or the sensations of my own body.\u00a0 Strange places can be very distracting with their white noises that aren\u2019t my white noises.\u00a0 If I can\u2019t cope, then I can\u2019t concentrate, and if I can\u2019t concentrate, then I can\u2019t learn\u2014so what\u2019s the point? \n Besides, I\u2019m more or less comfortable being who I am, so why should I hide that when part of being who I am makes me the writer that I am? \n So, I made a conscious decision not to pass.\u00a0 My first day in class, I took off my sandals and sat in my chair with my legs folded under me.\u00a0 I got a few, brief looks, but that was about it.\u00a0 I organized myself using a few different strategies that work for me.\u00a0 People noticed, but nobody seemed to care.\u00a0 I thought to myself that I\u2019d be okay as long as nothing major happened. \n Then, one day, I was talking with one of my peers when there was a malfunction with the multi-media equipment.\u00a0 The equipment emitted a loud, long, high-pitched whir.\u00a0 Everyone was annoyed.\u00a0 I was beyond annoyed.\u00a0 This was a sound I could not tolerate.\u00a0 The sound crashed into my head and shattered every single thought like glass.\u00a0 The shards of glass cut into my brain.\u00a0 And everything hurt.\u00a0 The sound was physically painful\u2014not just to my head, but to my whole body.\u00a0 It cut and cut and cut into me.\u00a0 And when everything was cut to pieces, the sound cut the pieces to pieces. \n I covered my ears just like I\u2019ve seen my boys do so many times and I cowered in on myself.\u00a0 I squeezed my eyes shut as if I could squeeze out the sound.\u00a0 It seemed the whole world disappeared, except for the sound and my need to block it out.\u00a0 But it still made its way into my head\u2014weaker now with my hands over my ears\u2014and it still hurt.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if I made a counter-sound to try to drown it out.\u00a0 I might have, but I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t think.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t plan.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t strategize.\u00a0 For those long, drawn out moments, the rest of the world was just gone.\u00a0 It was like my entire nervous system was in melt down mode. \n And then, after several minutes, the sound stopped.\u00a0 Nobody stared.\u00a0 Nobody did anything.\u00a0 The peer I was talking to simply resumed our conversation where we\u2019d left off when the sound started.\u00a0 However weird my behavior may have seemed, I was accepted just as I was.\u00a0 No snide comments.\u00a0 No put-downs.\u00a0 No weird looks.\u00a0 I was just accepted. \n Maybe it\u2019s that I\u2019d already talked about my kids by then.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s that my peers are, for the most part, older than your average college student.\u00a0 (The median age at my school is 38.)\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s that one of my peers worked with kids on the spectrum and another is a psychology professor.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not worried about whether I made the right decision in not passing any more.\u00a0 I\u2019m much more concerned about making an effort to be social\u2014but that\u2019s a whole different thing. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/09/not-passing/", "title": "Not Passing"},

We are proud of what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish and look forward to continued successes in the years ahead. \n Oh, dear.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t look quite so promising any more.\u00a0 But, I kept reading.\u00a0 Maybe they\u2019re open-minded.\u00a0 But, then\u2026 \n I repeat: \n Anything that will offend Autism Speaks will offend me and will not be considered. \n Honestly, my story would definitely offend Autism Speaks.\u00a0 And, frankly, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00a0 I remember trying to interview someone at Autism Speaks once.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t go well.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t even an advocacy piece, but that didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 Even a piece designed to inform parents of their information options offended the Autism Speaks representative I spoke with.\u00a0 They were only willing to participate if they had full control over what I wrote, which is an ethical no-no in the journalism world. \n So, I took a break from my bullying series to warn my fellow speculative fiction writers and autism advocates that  The Dark Fiction Spotlight  or Lady Luck Publishing might not be publishers you want to patronize or write for.\u00a0 As much as I hate to write off potential markets, I won\u2019t be pursuing any opportunities with them. \n * * * \n For those who read this blog and don\u2019t already know, this last part provides reasons why such an affiliation with Autism Speaks requires me to boycott this company and it\u2019s zines. \n In a sense, all of this is about bullying.\u00a0 \n Autism Speaks claims they exist to advocate for families with autism, but only 4% of the donations goes to those families.\u00a0 They fund research, and one of their major projects seeks a way to diagnose autism in utero, which is a form of eugenics. \n That is why I disagree with Autism Speaks\u2019 agenda.\u00a0 But that, in and of itself, does not warrant boycotting (though it is why I would not donate to their organization). \n Autism Speaks goes even further than this.\u00a0 Autism Speaks is an organization that intentionally spreads fear and despair.\u00a0 They use advertisements that amount to hate speech against autistics.\u00a0 They encourage parents to fantasize on camera about killing their autistic children, and use this as a reason why autistics should be eliminated from society. \n They use \u201cAutism Speaks\u201d as their name to claim that they speak for autistics; they don\u2019t.\u00a0 Autistics can and do speak for themselves, like  these   protesters .\u00a0 On the site for the anthology, there\u2019s this branding slogan: \u201cAutism Speaks. It\u2019s time to listen.\u201d\u00a0 Autistics, in return, says: \u201c Autism Speaks needs to listen .\u201d\u00a0 Instead, Autism Speaks actively tries to silence those not in agreement with their eugenics agenda. \n If this wasn\u2019t bad enough, they engage in unethical business practices.\u00a0 They mislead donors as they raise funds for their research.\u00a0 They try to control media elements, as they did when I tried to interview one of their representatives.\u00a0 And they bully their way through politics and the social landscape.\u00a0 Their message is clear:\u00a0 If you don\u2019t feel bad (or even homicidal) about having an autistic child, then there\u2019s something wrong with you, because autism has stolen your child\u2019s soul.\u00a0 (Yes, the soul-stealing is paraphrased, but with their very words one of their representatives has used.) \n As an organization, Autism Speaks is a bully\u2014a well-funded, politically powerful bully that believes that eugenics is the solution to autism.\u00a0 And that offends me.\u00a0 They use their size and their wealth to attempt to stomp out disagreement. \n And they create anthologies where one point of view is all that can be expressed, because they don\u2019t want their audience to become aware of differing points of view. \n That offends me.\u00a0 Autism Speaks offends me.\u00a0 As a business person who believes in ethical business practices and as a parent of three children with diagnoses of autism, Autism Speaks offends me.\u00a0 And I cannot write honestly and not offend them in turn. \n I wouldn\u2019t change that even if I could. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://writing-world.com/", "http://thedarkfiction.com/", "http://thedarkfiction.com/?page_id=405", "http://aspitude.blogspot.com/2010/10/2010-asan-ohio-protest-against-autism.html", "http://aspierhetor.com/2010/10/13/columbus-protest-against-autism-speaks/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/10/offending-autism-speaks/", "title": "Offending Autism Speaks"},
{"date": "October 15, 2010", "body": "\r\n Boys will be boys, but what does that mean?\u00a0 \n When conforming to cultural gender norms, \u201cboys will be boys\u201d refers to the tendency for young males to enjoy getting dirty, playing rough and doing things that girls (when conforming to gender norms) consider icky. \n In relation to the bullying behaviors attributed to \u201cboys will be boys,\u201d it refers to pushing, fighting and calling each other names.\u00a0 But despite the pressure to dismiss bullying as \u201cboys being boys,\u201d there is a difference. \n Yes, boys will be boys, as my children prove.\u00a0 Brandon and Will don\u2019t always get along, but sometimes they do.\u00a0 Whether they\u2019re getting along or not, they often play roughly with each other.\u00a0 They wrestle.\u00a0 They try to pin each other to the ground.\u00a0 They chase each other and call each other names.\u00a0 They tease and make fun of each other.\u00a0 They poke and prod at each other\u2019s weak spots\u2014mentally, physically and emotionally. \n This is boys being boys.\u00a0 It is also sibling rivalry. \n This is not bullying.\u00a0 This is not harassment.\u00a0 This is not abuse. \n What\u2019s the difference?\u00a0 Despite the persistence of Brandon and Will\u2019s rivalry, they are not doing this to hurt one another or to dominate each other.\u00a0 They\u2019re having fun.\u00a0 Even when one of them is physically or emotionally hurt, they\u2019re back at it in a few moments\u2014laughing and smiling.\u00a0 They  both  enjoy interacting with each other in this manner. \n I remember, as a child, having a bully nearby.\u00a0 The memories are rather vague.\u00a0 I was very young\u2014five or six\u2014and have lived several places since then.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember his name.\u00a0 But I do remember he often tried to intimidate the younger kids, myself included, into doing what he wanted.\u00a0 He would put his shoulders back and puff out his chest, towering over us, and tell us what to do.\u00a0 As much as we tried to avoid him, he seemed to prefer playing with younger kids, because he could make us do what he wanted.\u00a0 His whole demeanor changed whenever my brother or any of the other older kids came around. \n This isn\u2019t \u201cboys being boys.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s bullying.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t physically violent and he didn\u2019t target anyone in particular, besides those weaker and smaller than he was, so it wasn\u2019t abuse or harassment.\u00a0 He was just a bully\u2014unpleasant, but not particularly dangerous.\u00a0 Most of the self-assertive techniques I read about in the papers these days would probably have worked on him. \n In junior high school, there was another child\u2014the same age as me\u2014who was more than a bully.\u00a0 We first met when I arrived at the elementary school he attended in sixth grade.\u00a0 Up until that point, this boy was recognized as the smartest kid in class.\u00a0 He was also cool.\u00a0 He was also surprisingly friendly to me that first day.\u00a0 Having looked at my scholastic record, the principal put me in a differentiated English class, which is the first I\u2019d ever encountered a \u201cgifted and talented\u201d class.\u00a0 That class was in the morning, so I didn\u2019t participate until the second day.\u00a0 This boy was, of course, the star of that class.\u00a0 As I said, up until that class he\u2019d been quite nice to me.\u00a0 Then, as we sat in the circle, I made a mistake.\u00a0 \n The teacher told me that since I had not read the book they were discussing, I wasn\u2019t expected to do more than listen.\u00a0 And for the first twenty minutes I did exactly that.\u00a0 Then, the teacher asked a question about the book that none of the other students\u2014including the star of the class\u2014could answer.\u00a0 They\u2019d (presumably) read the book and they couldn\u2019t answer the question.\u00a0 I waited and waited and waited, but no matter how she tried to lead them to the answer, none of them knew it.\u00a0 So I raised my hand.\u00a0 And I answered the question.\u00a0 I knew the answer from the discussion and because I understood plot and character motive on an instinctive level.\u00a0 I answered a question about a book I hadn\u2019t read that he couldn\u2019t answer even though he\u2019d read the book.\u00a0 And I became the star of the class.\u00a0 \n And that was the start of it all.\u00a0 For the next 3 years he tormented me.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t simple bullying.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t merely intimidation and badgering.\u00a0 It started that way, but it escalated. \u00a0At first, he tried to best me academically, but there were subjects that I always won at (though, I didn\u2019t regard it as a competition).\u00a0 When he couldn\u2019t best me academically, he bullied me.\u00a0 When bullying didn\u2019t make me stop \u201cshowing off\u201d by answering questions and showing my intelligence and creativity, he started harassing me.\u00a0 He tormented me in school and he threatened and chased me outside of school.\u00a0 It was targeted harassment; it was personal; it was revenge for a crime I didn\u2019t even realize I\u2019d committed.\u00a0 I tried standing up to him and I tried ignoring; it didn\u2019t help.\u00a0 He had a very strong, very personal motive for his behavior.\u00a0 He got something out of it, and he wasn\u2019t going to stop.\u00a0 It probably would have continued indefinitely\u2014at least as long as I stayed there\u2014if he hadn\u2019t made a mistake. \n One day when I was walking down a bike path in the woods, he and a group of his friends saw me.\u00a0 They threw rocks at me (though it was obvious that they were not trying to hit me\u2014they all had better aim than that).\u00a0 They taunted and teased me.\u00a0 I ran.\u00a0 They chased me.\u00a0 I hid.\u00a0 They hunted me.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t trying to catch me, but they were trying to make me afraid\u2014and they succeeded. \n Then, I caught up with two other students.\u00a0 One of these guys was friends with my brother; I was friends with his sister.\u00a0 The other was kind-of-sort-of friends with the boy who was tormenting me.\u00a0 They were both the \u201cboys will be boys\u201d type of boys; they weren\u2019t particularly nice to me, but they also didn\u2019t tolerate boys hurting girls.\u00a0 They saw me and they started teasing me about running like I was.\u00a0 Then they realized that I was really afraid.\u00a0 And then the boy who was tormenting me, along with his cronies, topped the rise on their bicycles.\u00a0 My brother\u2019s friend asked me what was going on, and I told him.\u00a0 He asked me why, and I told him I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0 So, my brother\u2019s friend went over to the boys who were chasing me and explained, quite sensibly, that if they didn\u2019t leave me alone, then he would tell my brother what they were up to and my brother (who was three years older than us and quite big\u2014football-muscles big) would get a bunch of his friends together and they\u2019d kick their f***in\u2019 a**es for f***in\u2019 with his little sister.\u00a0 While he did that, the other guy asked me if I really didn\u2019t know why the tormenter had targeted me.\u00a0 I told him I really didn\u2019t.\u00a0 So, he explained it to me; from that moment in sixth grade and all the supposed slights in between\u2014the boy who tormented me couldn\u2019t stand it that a  girl  was smarter than him and didn\u2019t have the decency not to show it.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThat\u2019s absurd.\u201d\u00a0 The guy shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cBut that\u2019s just it.\u00a0 I mean, really.\u00a0 It\u2019s stupid.\u00a0 It\u2019s f***ed up.\u00a0 But no.\u00a0 You say \u2018absurd.\u2019\u201d \n It took me quite a while to fully grasp what he meant by that.\u00a0 I\u2019m still not entirely sure I understand why my tormenter\u2019s self-esteem was such that my being smarter than him was perceived as such a threat.\u00a0 However much I do not understand the misogyny or the neurotypicality that makes my tormenter\u2019s motive make sense, I do know his behavior wasn\u2019t just bullying.\u00a0 It was harassment.\u00a0 And much of what I have heard and read about that is being labeled bullying is this sort of harassment.\u00a0 The motives may be different, but the motives are more complicated and more personal than mere bullying.\u00a0 The children (and adults) who are targeted for harassment are targeted for more than just their relative weakness; they are targeted for their differences, for imagined slights or for other, specific reasons.\u00a0 Harassers get more out of harassing their victims than bullies get out from their victims.\u00a0 When behavior like this starts\u2014targeted, on-going harassment\u2014it\u2019s escalated beyond bullying and we need to acknowledge that in our language and in our remedies. \n I\u2019ve been lucky.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never been beaten up.\u00a0 Personally, I attribute this \u201cluck\u201d to my brother and his superior social skills.\u00a0 Twice I\u2019ve been threatened:\u00a0 once by a guy and once by a girl.\u00a0 The guy stopped chasing me when he learned who my brother was.\u00a0 The girl targeted me because she had reason to dislike my brother (a woman scorned and all of that), and she wanted to show it by beating me up.\u00a0 Fortunately for me, one of my brother\u2019s female friends interfered. \n I can\u2019t share a personal story of physical abuse\u2014at least not of a nature that could be described as bullying.\u00a0 But many stories I\u2019ve read lately have involved children beating up other children on a repeated basis.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t new.\u00a0 I know that.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not bullying; and it bothers me that the stories in the news are reporting it as bullying.\u00a0 Beating someone up is not bullying; it\u2019s abuse; it\u2019s assault, perhaps assault and battery.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard stories where assertiveness has made a difference.\u00a0 My husband has told me such a story.\u00a0 But, whether or not assertiveness is an issue, we\u2019re talking about abuse and assault\u2014where talking about  crimes . \n Boys will be boys.\u00a0 Some boys are bullies.\u00a0 I think bullying is morally wrong.\u00a0 I think bullying should be addressed and that both bullies and victims deserve our attention.\u00a0 We need to find effective ways to prevent bullying and teach solutions to both bullies and their victims to prevent bullying behavior.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t think bullying should be a crime.\u00a0 I really don\u2019t think  bullying  is our problem, except in the sense that bullying is like the \u201cgateway drug\u201d to more serious problems.\u00a0 The solution is not to create anti-bullying legislation.\u00a0 \n The solution is to call all this so-called bullying that\u2019s been in the news what it is: harassment and abuse/assault.\u00a0 If harassment and abuse aren\u2019t already crimes, then they should be crimes.\u00a0 But I believe they are already crimes.\u00a0 And we should treat them as such instead of dismissing it as \u201cboys being boys.\u201d \n [Next, I will write about \u201cgirls being girls.\u201d\u00a0 After all, boys aren\u2019t the only bullies and bullying behavior from girls is often different from bullying behavior from boys.] \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "June 13, 2010", "body": "\r\n Joint Letter on Cross-Disability Representation in Designating Medically Underserved Populations \n To: \n Kathleen Sebelius \nSecretary \nHealth and Human Services \n Mary Wakefield \nAdministrator \nHealth Resources and Services Administration \n Pam Hyde, JD \nAdministrator \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Administration \n We the undersigned disability advocacy groups urge you to include representation of the cross-disability community on the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee (NR) that will establish a comprehensive methodology and criteria for designation of \u201cMedically Underserved Populations\u201d (MUPS) and Primary Care Health Professions Shortage Areas. As a cross-disability community, we are stakeholders in the task you will undertake. However, we do not fit within the geographic census track data that has been used in the past to designate medically underserved populations. More than 54 million Americans with disabilities, including individuals with physical, mental health, sensory, environmental, cognitive, intellectual, and developmental disabilities experience inadequate health care because of a lack of primary care providers trained to treat them. In 2000, Healthy People 2010, cautioned that \"as a potentially underserved group, people with disabilities would be expected to experience disadvantages in health and well-being compared with the general population.\u201d They have and the data is startling. \n Basic primary care is not a guarantee for anyone in the disability community. (Drainoni M, Lee-Hood E, Tobias C, et al., 2006) Three out of five people with serious mental illness die 25 years earlier than other individuals, from preventable, co-occurring chronic diseases, such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and cardiopulmonary conditions. (Colton & Manderscheid, 2006; Manderscheid, Druss, & Freeman, 2007) Inaccessible medical equipment and lack of trained physicians, dentists, and other health professionals prevent individuals with disabilities from receiving the basic primary and preventive care others take for granted, such as getting weighed, preventative dental care, pelvic exams, x-rays, physical examinations, colonoscopies, and vision screenings. (Kirschner, Breslin, & Iezzoni, 2007; Chan, Doctor, MacLehose, et al. (1999); Manderscheid R., Druss B., & Freeman E . 2007). \n People who are deaf or experience significant problems hearing report they were three times as likely to report fair or poor health compared with those without hearing impairments. (NCD, 2009). They have difficulty communicating with primary care providers who don\u2019t want to pay interpreters or \u201cbother\u201d with a Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD). Children with ADD may have difficulty getting examined by primary care providers untrained to treat them. People with significant vision loss are more likely to have heart disease and hypertension, experience a greater prevalence of obesity, and smoke more than the general population. (NCD, 2009). Further, people who are blind often miss out on the prevention handouts and booklets given to patients by primary care providers. Even providers report they have difficulty communicating with patients who are deaf or have severe visual impairments. (Bachman S., Vedrani, M., Drainoni, M., Tobias, C., & Maisels L., 2006) \n 27% of adults with major physical and sensory impairments are obese, compared with 19% among those without major impairments (Iezzoni, 2009). Research shows that individuals with intellectual disabilities must contact 50 physicians before they can find one trained to treat them. (Corbin, Holder, & Engstrom, 2005) \n According to the National Council on Disability (NCD), 2009 report, The Current State of Health Care for People with Disabilities, \u201c[p]eople with disabilities experience significant health disparities and barriers to health care, as compared with people who do not have disabilities.\u201d Further, \u201c[t]he absence of professional training on disability competency issues for health care practitioners is one of the most significant barriers preventing people with disabilities from receiving appropriate and effective health care.\u201d \n Members of the disability community experience a broad spectrum of functional limitations that result from their disabilities. Many experience secondary chronic conditions. As the recent draft \u201cA Strategic Framework 2010-2015 \u2013 Optimum Health & Quality of Life for Individuals with Multiple Chronic Conditions \u201c by the HHS Working Group on Multiple Chronic Conditions\u201d (May, 2010) reported, functional limitations can often complicate access to health care and interfere with self-management. The Institute of Medicine noted there is evidence that patients actively receiving care for one chronic condition may not receive care for other unrelated conditions. \n The 1997 IOM report Enabling America bluntly stated that federal research effort in the area of disability was inadequate. On July 26, 2005, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a Call to Action warning that people with disabilities can lack equal access to health care. Though some funds are available for developmental and intellectual disabilities through the CDC, Maternal and Child Health, and the Developmental Disabilities Act, the 2007 IOM report, The Future of Disability in America states that research spending on disability is miniscule in relation to current and future needs. In this Report the IOM also warns that the number of people with disabilities is likely to rise, fueled by aging baby boomers. \n We need to assure adequate numbers of primary care providers are trained to treat the population of people with disabilities; people with disabilities from across the disability community have access to adequate primary care; and funding is available for research and programs to end the health disparities people with disabilities face. With the passage of health care reform and the formation of the NR Committee to redefine \u201cmedically underserved populations,\u201d HRSA can finally work to rectify the problem for all people with disabilities. Collectively, we are an underserved population and we are not adequately represented on the proposed NR Committee. We urge you to appoint someone to represent the cross-disability community, recognize people with disabilities as a constituency stakeholder within the definition of medically underserved populations, and include subject matter experts who represent the health care needs of the cross-disability community. Our groups are glad to serve as resources for HRSA. Thank you.

{"date": "June 27, 2010", "body": "\r\n Executive Summary: \u00a0 To engage with others we must actively participate in our interactions with them.\u00a0 This requires us to exert mental effort and also risks challenging our thoughts, feelings, and worldviews.\u00a0 Because we do not want to exert the necessary effort or take this risk with people who are very different from ourselves, we rely on stereotypes.\u00a0 This leads to prejudice and discrimination.\u00a0 In order to avoid prejudice and discrimination, we have to engage with others\u2014especially those who are different from ourselves. \n \u00a0 \n Engage  has many definitions; I tend to use it in the more general sense of \u201cto involve oneself or to participate,\u201d which is the context in which I use it now. \n Engaging  is an active state of being.\u00a0 You can engage in a job.\u00a0 Say you\u2019re sorting through information at work.\u00a0 While you\u2019re doing this you could be distracted by whatever is on your mind.\u00a0 Or you could engage in the task, focusing your mental prowess on the task at hand.\u00a0 You will likely produce higher quality work if you engage on the job.\u00a0 You can engage in a conversation.\u00a0 Say you\u2019re talking with your child.\u00a0 While you\u2019re doing this you could be distracted by the mental to-do list running through your head.\u00a0 Or you could engage in the conversation, focusing your attention on what is important to your child.\u00a0 You can engage in a story.\u00a0 Say you\u2019re reading a book or watching a movie.\u00a0 You could go into that \u201cglazed\u201d state where you are absorbing the entertainment and \u201crotting your brain.\u201d\u00a0 Or you could engage in the story by paying attention to the creative work and trying to experience what the artists were trying to express.\u00a0 You bring something of yourself to the experience and come out of it with something truly unique\u2014a communion of sorts between the artist and yourself.\u00a0 In each of these examples, you are bringing something of yourself to the task and making for a richer experience by engaging.\u00a0 It requires both an effort on your part and willingness to open yourself up to something outside of yourself, but in return you get a higher quality experience. \n \u00a0I propose that one of the reasons prejudice (and the discrimination that results from prejudice) is so prevalent in our society is because of a lack of engagement.\u00a0 I propose this lack of engagement can also explain the divisive politics that rages through the U.S. and other examples of polarization. \n Basically my theory is this:\u00a0 To communicate effectively and productively with someone who thinks and feels differently than you do, you need to engage with that person.\u00a0 The more differently that person thinks or feels, the more you need to engage with that person in order to gain the kind of understanding necessary for genuine communication to occur.\u00a0 We fail to do so for two basic reasons.\u00a0 First, engaging is work.\u00a0 It necessitates that we exert a significant amount of mental effort.\u00a0 It is much easier to just be there, not really listening, not really understanding; relying on our assumptions to fill in the gaps left by our failure to engage.\u00a0 Second, engaging can be uncomfortable.\u00a0 When we engage in someone who is significantly different from ourselves we are willfully challenging our own assumptions, ideas, and worldviews.\u00a0 This is inherently uncomfortable and human beings tend to develop self-defense mechanisms to prevent such a challenge from occurring. \n So, instead of engaging we stereotype.\u00a0 These stereotypes can be positive, but are more often negative.\u00a0 Even when positive, these stereotypes are destructive because they prevent understanding and dehumanize the \u201cother\u201d in the process.\u00a0 In this sense, stereotypes are very similar to a template.\u00a0 Imagine you are trying to start a new blog.\u00a0 You find a template that has the right look (stereotype), but after you start using it you realize the content you want to include doesn\u2019t fit the template.\u00a0 The work-intensive method would be to start from scratch and build your own template that has the look you want but also meets the needs of the content you want to provide.\u00a0 A less work-intensive method would be to modify the template to account for the content you want to add but cannot fit.\u00a0 However, it is more likely that you will simply trash the content that doesn\u2019t fit\u2014you don\u2019t really  need  it anyway\u2014and stick to the template you\u2019ve chosen.\u00a0 If people were blogs, then the template would be  what  they are (doctor, Republican, person with disabilities) and the content would be  who  they are (their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and the conclusions they\u2019ve drawn from them).\u00a0 Our failure to engage trashes the content of the person in favor of the imperfect, inappropriate template we chose to interpret their content through. \n This occurs at what I would call the macro level.\u00a0 We stereotype groups of people and put them into the templates we\u2019ve chosen for them.\u00a0 When we meet individuals who belong to those groups, we trash any content ( who  they are) in favor of the template we assume they fit into (our own concept of  what  they are).\u00a0 This also occurs at what I would call the micro level, which constitutes using templates of people we know instead of engaging with them at a particular time and place.\u00a0 That will be the subject of my next post. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/06/on-engaging-and-prejudice/", "title": "On Engaging and Prejudice (1 of 3)"},

{"date": "March 9, 2010", "body": "\r\n Over the last several months I have been exposed to a lot of statements regarding privilege.\u00a0 This concept of privilege has been used to cite \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d \u201cstraight privilege\u201d and \u201cneurotypical privilege,\u201d just to name a few.\u00a0 These concepts seek to describe the discrepancy of treatment between individuals among a majority and a minority. \n From the minority perspective, this language describes experienced differences.\u00a0 In other words, the discrepancy is real.\u00a0 However, this does not make the concept of  privilege  (as used in this context) real.\u00a0 It is this concept I seek to address. \n Consider a few of the  dictionary definitions  of  privilege : \n \n a right, immunity, or benefit enjoyed only by a person beyond the advantages of most \n a special right, immunity, or exemption granted to persons in authority or office to free them from certain obligations or liabilities \n any of the rights common to all citizens under a modern constitutional government \n \n The dictionary definition of  privilege  does not support the use of the word in the context of a discrepancy between the majority and the minority.\u00a0 For example, men tend to be assumed competent in work situations whereas women are more likely to be assumed incompetent in the same situation.\u00a0 The men who are assumed competent are not  privileged ; the women who are assumed incompetent are  disadvantaged .\u00a0 There is a subtle, but significant difference. \n Consider a few of the  dictionary definitions  of  disadvantage : \n \n absence or deprivation of advantage or equality \n to subject to disadvantage \n \n The word  disadvantage  more accurately describes the discrepancy of treatment. \u00a0Being  privileged  suggests that you are getting something you shouldn\u2019t have, that you are being treated as  special  or above the norm.\u00a0 If you are assumed to be competent at your job, you are not being treated special and you are not being assessed as above the norm.\u00a0 You are being treated fairly.\u00a0 On the other hand, being  disadvantaged  suggests that you are being denied something you should have, that you are being treated as  inferior , below the norm.\u00a0 If you are assumed to be incompetent at your job, you are being denied fair treatment. \n The majority is not being given special rights above what most receive.\u00a0 The minority is being denied rights and  privileges  (3 rd  definition listed) that they are entitled to and put at a disadvantage. \n So, the use of  privilege  to describe the discrepancy between the majority and the minority is linguistically and rhetorically incorrect.\u00a0 Perhaps more importantly, it\u2019s also politically damaging.\u00a0 When you  accuse  someone of being privileged, you are saying they have a benefit they are not entitled to.\u00a0 This puts that person on the defensive.\u00a0 Unless they are highly sympathetic to your cause, they are going to resist your  false   accusation  and miss your valid claim of discrepancy of treatment.\u00a0 You are discredited for making a false accusation; the real meat of your message isn\u2019t even heard.\u00a0 On the other hand, if the person is highly sympathetic to your cause, they are going to feel  guilty , because they\u2019ve internalized your  false   accusation  and will feel responsible for having a benefit they shouldn\u2019t or, more accurately, for having the benefit you were denied through no fault of their own. \n Whether the individual you accuse of being privileged is sympathetic or not, a statement regarding privilege implies that individual has done something wrong by being \u201cprivileged.\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019ve done nothing wrong (at least, not by  accepting  their \u201cprivilege\u201d), because they are being treated fairly.\u00a0 The wrong is not in the majority having privileges (3 rd  definition again), but in the minority being denied these same privileges.\u00a0 Thus, the majority isn\u2019t  privileged  (1 st  or 2 nd  definition), the minority is  disadvantaged . \n People need to understand the discrepancy of treatment between the majority and the minority.\u00a0 When you\u2019re in the majority, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that those ordinary, every-day benefits you take for granted are denied to others on the basis of spurious reasons like skin color, gender, sexual orientation, or neurological makeup.\u00a0 People need to learn about the real examples of these discrepancies.\u00a0 Listing the benefits they enjoy and take for granted that are denied to others is an effective way to make people aware of the real discrepancies minority groups experience.\u00a0 But calling them  privileges  is a mistake.\u00a0 It conveys the wrong message.\u00a0 It is inaccurate, because it is the wrong word. \u00a0Leave  privileged  to the powerful few\u2014the senators and CEOs, the princes and dictators, the celebrities and the tycoons\u2014and stick to accurate words that describe the majority, like  benefits ,  rights , and  advantages .\u00a0 The difference may be subtle, but truth is powerful. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/privilege", "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/disadvantage"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/03/on-privilege/", "title": "On Privilege"},

\u00a0 That which is obvious is not necessarily true. \n We are all more able, more empowered, and more effective with the use of technologies and accommodations that help us go about our daily tasks.\u00a0 For example, we are all  impaired  when it comes to talking over long distances\u2014so we use telephones, cell phones, Web cams, chat rooms, and e-mail to communicate over these distances.\u00a0 People who do not have these communication technologies are accommodated through public phones and library computers.\u00a0 We are all  impaired  when it comes to traveling over a long distance in a timely manner\u2014so we use cars, trucks, and bicycles to span these distances.\u00a0 People who do not have these transportation technologies are accommodated with buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation.\u00a0 We are all  impaired  when it comes to learning\u2014so we use textbooks, schools, black boards, Web sites, Power Point presentations, and other technologies to condense and teach the things we all need to learn.\u00a0 People who cannot afford access to these education technologies attend public schools, visit public libraries, and get grants and loans from the federal government to attend technical colleges and universities. \n Because \u201cwe all\u201d have these impairments, the technologies and accommodations we need to improve our effectiveness are readily available.\u00a0 Individuals with disabilities, as a whole, make up a significant sub-section of our population.\u00a0 However, the specific technologies and accommodations that can compensate for their individual differences are not readily available, because the technologies and accommodations that would satisfy their needs are often unique to them.\u00a0 At the very least, they\u2019re not particularly useful to the majority. \n That is the difference.\u00a0 The impairments \u201cwe all\u201d have our alleviated with technologies and accommodations; the impairments \u201cthey\u201d have are not, because the technologies and accommodations \u201cthey\u201d need are of no use to \u201cus.\u201d \n Thus, the pervasive American paradigm is based on the \u201cwe all\u201d standard.\u00a0 If \u201cwe all\u201d need something, then it is normal and \u201cwe all\u201d obtain access to the technologies and accommodations we need; even if it means burying our country under a huge burden of debt.\u00a0 If \u201csome\u201d need something to help them do what most do \u201cnaturally,\u201d then those who with special needs are impaired or disabled and satisfying their needs is a burden \u201cwe all\u201d won\u2019t accept or tolerate. \n Is this the land of the free\u2014where so many are impaired and boxed in by the barriers we create as a society?\u00a0 It\u2019s time to shift our paradigm ( paradigm shift : the internalization of a new belief, teaching or experience that dramatically changes the worldview of an individual).\u00a0 The individual is not impaired because of their physical, mental or psychological difference; the individual is impaired because he or she lacks the accommodations or technologies that would enable him or her to participate effectively.\u00a0 A lack we the people created out of our own ignorance and small-mindedness. \n The truth is this: With the technologies and accommodations that are right for them, individuals with physical, mental or psychological differences can participate in and contribute to our society.\u00a0 They can live not as \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cimpaired\u201d individuals, but as able, powerful, effective people\u2014people whose differences no longer exclude them from the world of the majority.\u00a0 \u201cWe all\u201d would be richer for it, from an economic, cultural and an individual perspective. \n Yet our society is engineered with the majority in mind\u2014the technologies and accommodations we as a people devote most of our energies to are those that the majority requires and the majority demands.\u00a0 Those who engineer our society impair those who need different technologies and different accommodations, often doing so unconsciously and unintentionally.\u00a0 It never occurred to the majority that it should be any other way. \n Is that really what we want?\u00a0 Is that the people we want to be?\u00a0 I know I don\u2019t.\u00a0 Do you? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/05/blogging-against-disablism-on-assuming-impairment/", "title": "Blogging Against Disablism: On Assuming Impairment"},

This goes back to the difference of engaging with your child and half-listening while thinking about that pesky to-do list running through your mind.\u00a0 The problem with failing to engage while talking with people we know is that even our templates of these individuals are faulty.\u00a0 \n However well we know an individual, our perception of them is always filtered through our own biases and our own experiences.\u00a0 We insert these filtered perceptions into our mental templates of individuals, and what we get is a flawed, distorted copy of the person we know.\u00a0 When we interact with the template instead of the person, we are interacting with a distortion.\u00a0 Only by genuinely engaging with the individual are we able to break past our own internal filters to see the person more clearly and understand what the individual is trying to communicate. \n This becomes especially important when we interact with people with atypical means of communication, but that will be the subject of my next post. \n The point of this post is that failing to engage with individuals we know creates miscommunication.\u00a0 If we think we know what someone is going to say, we often fail to listen to what is actually said.\u00a0 Even after we have failed to hear them, we think we know what they said.\u00a0 In our mind, we insert the conversation we think we had into our mental template of that person.\u00a0 Not only does this mean we have miscommunicated in this one instance, it also perpetuates the miscommunication in future conversations.\u00a0 We go back to the conversation we think we had and take it a little further the next time we talk to that person.\u00a0 The second time we get a little further from what is actually being said. \n Only be engaging in the conversation and listening actively and involving ourselves in how our own life intersects with the other person\u2019s life can we truly know what that person is saying. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/06/on-engaging-and-miscommunication-2-of-3/", "title": "On Engaging and Miscommunication (2 of 3)"},

allow Alex to refuse dental care.\u00a0 The difference is that care is being sought for my child\u2019s benefit, and not my convenience. \n The waiting room was okay.\u00a0 Alex bounded from spot to spot, reading as many words as he could find.\u00a0 Then, the dental assistant came.\u00a0 We talked for a few moments.\u00a0 When it was time to go into the back I called Alex to me, but he didn\u2019t come.\u00a0 I took him by the hand.\u00a0 He walked with me and stopped a few paces in front of the door.\u00a0 I tugged gently on his hand, an act that was more communication then force.\u00a0 He looked at me, and took just enough steps forward so he was inside the door.\u00a0 The door closed behind him.\u00a0 Step by step, we moved forward\u2014him resisting, me encouraging. \n I said, \u201cI will carry you if I have to.\u201d \n Alex chose to walk. \n The dentist\u2019s office is a difficult place for Alex to be.\u00a0 He generally resists anything that involves others touching his mouth.\u00a0 He resists brushing his teeth, flossing, and all forms of dental care.\u00a0 He resists us looking at his teeth or checking for wiggly, loose ones.\u00a0 He resists the removal of wiggly, loose teeth or the removal of any miscellaneous particles he decides to chew on. \n I expect resistance, which is why I travel two hours to take him to this clinic.\u00a0 The staff is prepared for his resistance and the facility is equipped to make dental care as safe and as comfortable as possible. \n This particular appointment was a \u201cquickie.\u201d\u00a0 The task was to fill a chip on his front tooth.\u00a0 Easy access.\u00a0 No drilling.\u00a0 No paste.\u00a0 If Alex had cooperated the whole thing would have taken 5 to 10 minutes. \n Of course, Alex did not cooperate.\u00a0 Or, to be more accurate, Alex cooperated as much as he was able to do with his current level of oversensitivity and anxiety.\u00a0 He squirmed most of the time.\u00a0 He cried quite a bit of the time.\u00a0 He got out some good words, through a pry-thing that forced his teeth apart, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want.\u00a0 Don\u2019t want.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want.\u201d \n We acknowledge his words.\u00a0 We told him we understood.\u00a0 We explained as best we could that we had to fix his tooth so the big-boy tooth didn\u2019t rot and break the way his baby tooth had done.\u00a0 He understood.\u00a0 He took a few ragged breaths and was relatively calm (but still squirming) for a few precious moments, which gave the dentist the opportunity she needed. \n The dentist was quick as she could be.\u00a0 She talked to Alex with respect while she worked within his limited range of cooperation.\u00a0 She chided him when necessary and complimented him whenever possible.\u00a0 In the beginning of the session, she joined in as I sang Alex\u2019s special song to him to help him control his anxiety. \n Alexander, Alexander.\u00a0 I love you.\u00a0 Yes I do. \n Really special boy-oy.\u00a0 Really special boy-oy. \n I love you.\u00a0 Yes I do-o-o-o-o. \n Despite not liking the work she does, Alex likes his dentist quite a lot.\u00a0 He made excellent eye contact with her, which is rare.\u00a0 When it was all done, he even smiled for her.\u00a0 But for all that he likes he, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s able to cooperate while he\u2019s in that chair. \n The experience is hard on all of us.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t want to do this.\u00a0 I empathize, because I find the dental experience to be a miserable one myself.\u00a0 I also don\u2019t want Alex\u2019s teeth to deteriorate the way mine have after a childhood (and much of my adulthood) of not receiving proper dental care.\u00a0 I know, in the long-run, the misery of receiving dental care today is much, much better than the misery of decayed teeth with its tooth aches, drilling, pulling, and fake teeth. \n One might think that all of this is beyond his understanding, but Alex gets it.\u00a0 As much as he dislikes this he does get that we\u2019re not trying to hurt him or ignore his wishes.\u00a0 He gets that this needs to be done, and he gets that we try to make it as good for him as we can.\u00a0 There was a precious moment after the filling was put on and set when Alex was calm.\u00a0 He stopped squirming and crying.\u00a0 He took a few ragged breaths.\u00a0 He looked at the dentist\u2019s face and he waited.\u00a0 It was like he was saying, \u201cOkay, what happens now.\u00a0 I\u2019m ready.\u201d \n The only thing that was left at the point was the x-ray.\u00a0 Last time it took an extra person and four tries.\u00a0 This time it only took two tries and no extra assistance. \n We\u2019re making progress.\u00a0 Alex did really well.\u00a0 The dentist and I praised Alex profusely.\u00a0 Alex left with a smile, but he also left as quickly as he could. \n Still, I look back and think about that precious moment of stillness.\u00a0 As a mom, one of my biggest challenges is doing things to my kids that I know they don\u2019t want, but need anyway.\u00a0 Things like dental care, shots, and surgery.\u00a0 These unwanted needs make me wonder how deeply my respect for my children really goes.\u00a0 I strongly advocate the patient\u2019s right to choose the type of care received or to forego care entirely.\u00a0 I advocate these rights for patients who society deems incompetent to make these decisions.\u00a0 Yet I make decisions like this for my children. \n There are times I feel like a hypocrite. \n Then, I think about that moment of stillness.\u00a0 I think about the smile Alex gave to the doctor.\u00a0 I think about the way he cuddled close to me after all of it was over, and how he relaxed after I told him he did a good job and that I was proud of him. \n I think about how there are times, even as an adult, when I don\u2019t want, but still need medical care.\u00a0 I think about how anxiety-laden my own dental appointments are.\u00a0 I think about how much it hurt to regain the mobility of my wrist.\u00a0 I think about how, after the surgery on my wrist, I kept apologizing for needing a heftier dose of pain medication.\u00a0 When I got home I apologized for needing my husband and my mother\u2019s help. \n And I let go of the guilt and the doubt.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a hypocrite.\u00a0 As a parent, I have to make some tough decisions.\u00a0 I have to decide what medical care has sufficient value to force that care on my children.\u00a0 Sometimes this means dosing the child with antibiotics.\u00a0 Other times it means restraining my child so a dentist can fix his teeth.\u00a0 Sometimes it means talking the child through the anxiety of getting blood drawn or getting a shot.\u00a0 But at no time do I do these things for me.\u00a0 At no time do I put my convenience over my child\u2019s care.\u00a0 At no time do I treat my child as if his will doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 I talk, I explain, and I comfort.\u00a0 I give my children choices whenever I can.\u00a0 I refrain from making choices based on my needs or my convenience, but base my decisions on the long-term best interests of my child.\u00a0 And my children recognize the difference.\u00a0 That difference is going to empower my children to make their own decisions in the future. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "May 24, 2010", "body": "\r\n Executive Summary:  A less-than-100%-coherent search for spoons, which represent our daily currency to get things done. \n During the latest Blogging Against Disablism blogswarm, I read a post that mentioned the \u201cspoons theory.\u201d\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t not sure what the author meant and he/she didn\u2019t elaborate.\u00a0 But I did find an  article/post  that described the theory. (Recommended reading!) \n I\u2019d gotten the general gist of the theory based on the context of the original post.\u00a0 In short, spoons represent your energy and ability, like currency.\u00a0 You have a limited number spoons each day and have to spend them wisely. \n (I disagree with the author that healthy people don\u2019t have to worry about this.\u00a0 Perhaps some people don\u2019t think about it, but the reality is we have all a finite number of spoons each day.\u00a0 Some of us just have fewer spoons than others, and some of us require more spoons to accomplish a given task than others.\u00a0 And every day is different.) \n Most days I have sufficient spoons.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get me wrong.\u00a0 I\u2019m not rolling in spoons.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like I have so many spoons to spare that I don\u2019t have to think about how I spend them.\u00a0 Usually I have just enough spoons to get through the day.\u00a0 But I do get through the day. \n Each day I spend some spoons without making a conscious choice.\u00a0 I have compulsive tendencies.\u00a0 If I do not control these tendencies, they control me.\u00a0 Controlling these compulsions requires having spoons to spend.\u00a0 I also spend spoons to deal with the stimuli in my environment. \n Noise costs me some spoons.\u00a0 Interestingly enough, silence costs me spoons, too\u2014just not as many spoons.\u00a0 In order to not spend spoons, I need a manageable level of consistent white noise.\u00a0 Then, of course, listening costs me some spoons, because I have to drown out the white noise to focus on what the other person is saying.\u00a0 Really, when it comes to auditory stimulation, I just can\u2019t win. \n Touching an icky texture costs me a spoon.\u00a0 A smell that triggers my gag reflex costs me some spoons, if I don\u2019t have the spoons I throw up and that will cost me more spoons\u2014even though I don\u2019t actually have the spoons to spend.\u00a0 Processing too many visual elements costs me a spoon.\u00a0 Wearing clothing that requires processing costs me some spoon (itchy clothes, skirts, or tops that dip down if I bend forward are examples), how many depends on how much and how often my clothing requires my attention.\u00a0 Basically, just having to process the world around me costs me spoons.\u00a0 Add human interaction into the mix, and I use a lot of spoons just to exist within an environment. \n Keep in mind I haven\u2019t done any work yet and have already spent quite a few spoons. \n (This is why I consider myself borderline-neurodivergent versus autistic.\u00a0 This is not to say that I actually believe there is a border\u2014I believe autism is a range within the human range of experience and that our choice to make firm distinctions is a value judgment that doesn\u2019t accurately reflect reality, but that\u2019s another post.\u00a0 The point is that my ability to pass for most of my life without anyone suspecting anything was really \u201cwrong\u201d leads me to differentiate my experiences from both \u201cnormal\u201d people and genuine autistics.\u00a0 I seem to have more spoons than most autistics, but I spend my spoons on things that don\u2019t require spoons from \u201cnormal\u201d people.) \n But there are those times when the monster under the bed eats my spoons before I even get up in the morning\u2014or in the afternoon as the case may be when I\u2019m being night-owlish. \n Over the last month I\u2019ve had sinusitis, or maybe it\u2019s allergies, or\u2014well, we really don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve had fewer spoons as the days go by, yet I had just as much work to do.\u00a0 So, I overextended myself, spending spoons I didn\u2019t have.\u00a0 Of course, there\u2019s a cost for that.\u00a0 A steep cost.\u00a0 I end up with fewer spoons the next day.\u00a0 If that wasn\u2019t problematic enough, I have to spend more spoons to do the same tasks, which I still have to do though I don\u2019t have the spoons.\u00a0 Thus, the cycle of spending spoons I don\u2019t have continues and grows. \n Work, of course, requires spoons as well.\u00a0 Play requires spoons too.\u00a0 Taking care of the kids, taking care of the house, and spending time with family and friends all require spoons.\u00a0 Outings of any kind require having plenty of spoons to spend.\u00a0 Getting ready for an outing costs me spoons.\u00a0 The type of outing indicates how many spoons something is likely to cost, but the indication may be off depending on what happens during the outing. \n On most days I have enough spoons to do all the things I need to do, most of the things I should do, and some of the things I want to do.\u00a0 The closer I\u2019m able to stay within my comforting routine, the fewer spoons I usually have to spend coping and the fewer spoons it costs me to complete a task. \n Then, there are those times when I don\u2019t feel well.\u00a0 Having a headache costs me spoons.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just  having  the headache.\u00a0 Treating the headache requires more spoons.\u00a0 Doing something while I have the headache costs me spoons to have the headache, plus the spoons to perform the task, plus a few extra because the task requires more effort.\u00a0 This is true of any bodily discomfort. \n Lately, I\u2019ve had headaches, nasal congestion, chest congestion, coughing, pressure in my head, feelings of disorientation, earaches, tickly ears, and a sense of unbalance.\u00a0 Each of these symptoms necessitates the spending of spoons.\u00a0 Just  having  the symptoms costs spoons.\u00a0 Treating them costs spoons.\u00a0 Doing other tasks while having the symptoms costs the spoons to perform the task plus extra spoons for the extra effort required. \n It\u2019s easy to see why I\u2019ve been running short on spoons.\u00a0 Yet, work needs to be done.\u00a0 So, I spend spoons I don\u2019t have, sabotaging future days and future work, which requires spending more spoons I don\u2019t have.\u00a0 Badness, quite obviously, ensues. \n Now, getting the point, I spend spoons to control my compulsiveness.\u00a0 If I choose not to do so, if I let the compulsiveness win, not only do I not spend spoons to control my compulsiveness, I  get  spoons for allowing myself to be compulsive.\u00a0 So, when I finally admitted I had to stop spending spoons I didn\u2019t have, I recouped by sleeping more and watching La Femme Nikita.\u00a0 Television poses significant challenges for me.\u00a0 Once I start watching something I really enjoy, I don\u2019t want to stop.\u00a0 It costs spoons to  not  watch.\u00a0 The same thing happens with book series.\u00a0 If the series continues, but I don\u2019t have the next book, it costs me spoons  not  to purchase and read the book.\u00a0 So, allowing myself to watch whichever show I\u2019m into is like getting extra health points in a video game.\u00a0 I get more spoons! \n But, in the process, I lose time.\u00a0 If I have a full day scheduled, I won\u2019t be able to do all my work, because it costs time to get the spoons to do the work.\u00a0 Then, I have to choose which work needs to get done, do that work, and let the rest go until I have spoons I don\u2019t have to buy with time. \n But (there seems to be a lot of buts in this post), if I try to indulge myself and am thwarted, that costs a  lot  of spoons.\u00a0 So, when the DVD-drive on my laptop couldn\u2019t find the DVD (hello!\u00a0 It\u2019s in the drive!), I spent four hours trying to make it work.\u00a0 In the process I discovered that this drive has problems\u2014not just mine, but a lot of people\u2019s\u2014and that there was no identified solution, so I ordered an external drive online.\u00a0 Not because we had the money to spare, but because it was costing me far too many spoons and far too much time not having a DVD-drive that would actually, consistently and predictably play DVDs. \u00a0(I don\u2019t cope well with things that don\u2019t work the way they\u2019re supposed to.\u00a0 I mean, really: DVD-drive = drive that plays DVDs.\u00a0 Why is that such a difficult concept for my computer to understand!?!)\u00a0 After that, I took my DVD upstairs and watched it there.\u00a0 Luckily, my husband recognized that watching the DVD had become a need\u2014and I do mean  need , I didn\u2019t have enough spoons left not to watch it\u2014and he abdicated his computer time in favor of my indulgence.\u00a0 (Isn\u2019t he fabulous!) \n So, I guess the point is\u2014do I have a point?\u2014ah, yes, the point is that we must manage the spoons that we have. \u00a0\u00a0We must be aware of how our spoons get spent and what gives us more spoons than is spent doing it.\u00a0 It\u2019s kind of like celery.\u00a0 I once heard that digesting celery consumes more calories than the celery contains.\u00a0 Most activities consume more spoons than the activity provides.\u00a0 But there are spoon-rich activities (i.e., chocolate cake, not celery) that will provide more spoons than performing the activity consumes.\u00a0 Everyone is going to have their own spoon-rich activities.\u00a0 Find yours.\u00a0 Use it to help you manage your spoons.\u00a0 Then all you have to do is manage your time, but at least you\u2019ll have the spoons to do it! \n ", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "January 29, 2010", "body": "\r\n Another thought spurred by my studies starts with this definition: \n Self-efficacy refers to an individual\u2019s convictions (or confidence) about his or her abilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources, and course of action needed to successfully execute a specific task within a given context. \n The Fundamentals of Organizational Behavior,  4 th  ed., by Andrew J. DuBrin, 2007, pg. 126 \n The chapter is on motivation, particularly as it is applied in work situations.\u00a0 It relies heavily on psychology.\u00a0 Two particular applications of this definition of self-efficacy stood out for me. \n First, there is expectancy theory.\u00a0 Basically with expectancy theory, the idea is that people will be highly motivated if they have high expectancy, high instrumentality, and high valence.\u00a0 Expectancy involves the belief that more effort will improve performance.\u00a0 Instrumentality involves the belief that improved performance will improve the outcome.\u00a0 Valence involves the belief that the outcome is worth the effort.\u00a0 If someone does not expect that their effort will improve their performance, they\u2019re not likely to try harder.\u00a0 If someone does not believe performance is instrumental in getting the results they want, they\u2019re not likely to perform.\u00a0 If someone does not value the outcome, they\u2019re not likely to care enough to try. \n (Realize that each of these high/low values are subjective, meaning they rely on  individual belief  not independent reality.\u00a0 For example, trying harder may really lead to doing better, but if I don\u2019t  believe  that it will, I\u2019m not likely to try harder and so I won\u2019t do better.\u00a0 Therefore, belief is a very powerful, especially belief in oneself.) \n One of the things that struck me as I was studying this concept was how it serves, at least in part, to explain some of the issues in relation to autism.\u00a0 So often it is easier to assume someone with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, cannot do something.\u00a0 This assumption is so easy that people often do not stop to question why they  don\u2019t  do something.\u00a0 It\u2019s like the possibility that the individual does not  choose  to perform is never even considered. \n The first time I ran smack into this concept was when I was concerned that Alex could not catch.\u00a0 I understood, at least to some degree, the complexity of the catching action and its association with later skills development.\u00a0 So, that Alex couldn\u2019t catch was something that deserved attention.\u00a0 Sitting with the physical therapist, I learned the distinction between  can\u2019t  catch and  doesn\u2019t  catch.\u00a0 Specifically, if a child does not catch a ball, first you have to discern whether the child has any interest in the ball; if not, you must then find something the child does have an interest in.\u00a0 Alex can rarely be induced to catch a ball, but if you throw a Veggie Tales plush toy at him he\u2019ll probably catch it.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the perspective of this therapist seems rather rare, but I\u2019m certainly glad she shared it with me. \n The next relevant way this concept of self-efficacy is used is in social learning theory.\u00a0 Social learning theory is the process of learning through observing and mimicking others.\u00a0 Many parents of young children with autism will recognize the significance of this, even if they\u2019ve never heard the term.\u00a0 It was drilled in me when the boys were young that children with autism have to be taught to mimic so that they can learn.\u00a0 But, in looking closer at the concept through its business applications, once again the issues of expectancy theory come into play.\u00a0 Expectancy (the belief that more effort will lead to improved performance), instrumentality (the belief that improved performance will lead to a better outcome), and valence (the level of desire for the outcome) are key aspects of social learning.\u00a0 Some of the things that teachers and therapists are bent on teaching my children are of no interest to them.\u00a0 The valence simply isn\u2019t there.\u00a0 Yet, if they watch me use the VCR or the computer, they pick those skills up  quick .\u00a0 And, yes, it is through social learning\u2014observing and mimicking desired behaviors. \n And now, we\u2019re back to self-efficacy.\u00a0 While the significance of instrumentality and valence cannot be ignored (yet seems to be ignored more often than not), when teaching people with autism self-efficacy has its own relevance.\u00a0 Self-efficacy (belief in one\u2019s own abilities) is a component of self-esteem (which also includes the person\u2019s belief that he or she is worthy of happiness, also called self-respect).\u00a0 Having fundamentally different neurological processes, and growing up learning in a million different ways (some subtle, some quite obvious) that your neurological processes are inferior, is going to affect any person\u2019s self-efficacy and self-respect.\u00a0 Yet, when attaining a new skill expectancy is essential, which requires self-efficacy.\u00a0 If one has high self-efficacy, then one is more likely to believe that more effort will improve performance.\u00a0 If one has low self-efficacy, then one is more likely to believe that more effort will not improve performance.\u00a0 If one\u2019s expectancy is low enough, then the individual will not even try to perform. \n And it all comes back together.\u00a0 If we insist on trying to teach people a task for which they have low instrumentality and/or low valence without first successfully raising their perceptions of instrumentality and/or valence\u2014then claim that since they did not learn the task they must try harder or are incapable\u2014we are eroding (and eventually destroying) that individual\u2019s expectancy, self-efficacy, and self-esteem.\u00a0 In the long-run, this erosion creates an environment of systemic disempowerment.\u00a0 Essentially, we are teaching people they can\u2019t, because we are trying to force them to learn something for which they have no interest and for which we create no sense of value.\u00a0 That \u201c can\u2019t \u201d attitude further pervades their lives. \n The more I learn about \u201cnormal\u201d psychology the more I believe that the worse thing psychologists ever did was divorce \u201cabnormal\u201d psychology from \u201cnormal\u201d psychology.\u00a0 I suspect if psychologists opened their minds to the possibility that the assumption that \u201cabnormal = bad\u201d is wrong, the more they would be able to see how \u201cnormal\u201d psychology relates to their own ineffectiveness.\u00a0 Perhaps then more people would get genuine help that repairs and re-builds their senses of expectancy, self-efficacy, and self-esteem, which would lead to improved performance on the behaviors they value. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/01/the-relevance-of-self-efficacy/", "title": "The Relevance of Self-Efficacy"},

{"date": "April 24, 2010", "body": "\r\n Among my busyness, I recently took the boys to a medical appointment.\u00a0 I brought up the issue of medicating Alex, because despite my preference not to do so, I recognize that  he  is experiencing distress and that, like Mark, medication may help Alex smooth out his experience of life.\u00a0 This doctor is not the one who initiated the discussion, nor is this doctor the one who would be prescribing the medication.\u00a0 However, this doctor did have a significant insight that I found invaluable.\u00a0 The medication comes in the form of a bi-monthly shot, so if we choose to medicate Alex we will not also have to choose to put him through the daily trauma of administering medication by mouth. \n This is very important to me.\u00a0 This was a break-through concept that had me thinking  maybe .\u00a0 Then, the doctor spoiled it for me. \n From start to finish, our appointment (taking both Alex & Ben at the same time) took about 2 hours.\u00a0 First, we started in a rather largish appointment room.\u00a0 By the time we were done that big room was getting rather confining for the boys.\u00a0 They\u2019d explored everything that had interested them.\u00a0 They people came.\u00a0 They talked.\u00a0 They left.\u00a0 As far as the boys were concerned, it was time to go. \n But then we move to the smaller exam room.\u00a0 It\u2019s a much tighter space for two active boys and two much less active adults.\u00a0 The boys were tired, they disliked the transition, and they were  done .\u00a0 No more cooperation.\u00a0 No more quiet.\u00a0 They were  done . \n Knowing my children as I do, living with my children as I do, I knew this was to be expected\u2014I planned on it even.\u00a0 The boys were loud, anxious, and  done .\u00a0 Yet the appointment was not done.\u00a0 The conflict was natural.\u00a0 Their impatience was \u201cnormal,\u201d at least for them.\u00a0 Their behavior\u2014turning off lights to communicate they were done, getting frustrated and loud when their request was denied, moving constantly\u2014was completely predictable, understandable, and even necessary. \n The doctor did not appreciate this.\u00a0 \u201cDo they act like this all the time?\u201d \n The question took me off guard.\u00a0 This is hardly the first time this doctor had treated my boys, nor was this the first time they had behaved like this.\u00a0 It happened every time. \n \u201cWell, they\u2019re often loud and active\u2014but we are in a confined space and we\u2019ve exhausted their patience.\u201d \n The significance of this condensed explanation seemed to have no impact.\u00a0 \u201cThis would drive me crazy if I had to deal with this every day.\u00a0 The medication would help with this.\u201d \n I take this concept in and look at it as if it\u2019s a strange species of thought.\u00a0 Then, with a shrug, I toss it in the pile of its familiars.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d I say.\u00a0 What I don\u2019t say, what I would say if I wasn\u2019t just as tired and just as  done  as my boys is, \u201cThat\u2019s no reason to medicate a child.\u00a0 I\u2019m not considering this for my sake.\u00a0 The  only  reason I\u2019m considering this is for what it may do to help  Alex .\u00a0 If you have nothing to add in that regard, say nothing at all.\u201d\u00a0 But that\u2019s rude, so I\u2019m told; and I didn\u2019t have the energy to spare to try to open the doctor\u2019s mind to this paradigm shift. \n So I don\u2019t say that.\u00a0 Not there.\u00a0 Not to the doctor.\u00a0 I save it, knowing that as helpful as this doctor is concerning the issues this doctor addresses, my sons\u2019 autism is not something this doctor can address effectively.\u00a0 The idea that  this \u2014the behavior the doctor found so objectionable\u2014had nothing to do with  that \u2014the mood swings and the increasing frustration and distress that has prompted us to consider medication for Alex\u2014seemed unattainable.\u00a0 The thought\u2014the  this / that  difference\u2014was so obvious and essential to me, I couldn\u2019t think out to express it in words to someone who didn\u2019t intuitively understand it.\u00a0 Beyond that, the philosophy that medication should not be administered for the convenience of others\u2014for any reason that focuses on benefiting others\u2014but for the benefit of the patient is so fundamental to me, and yet so divergent from the contemporary norm.\u00a0 How do you put that into words to someone who probably hadn\u2019t considered the distinction? \n So, I reflect and wonder if I should have scrounged up the energy to make the point.\u00a0 Perhaps I should have.\u00a0 Perhaps not.\u00a0 It occurs to me, though, that some things should just be self-evident. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/04/a-reason-not-to-medicate/", "title": "A Reason Not to Medicate"},

{"date": "February 2, 2010", "body": "\r\n Generally I consider myself pretty open-minded.\u00a0 That being said, open-mindedness is not about lacking prejudice, but the willingness to re-evaluate and discard prejudices when faced with new information.\u00a0 Prejudices and bias are natural human tendencies, resulting from our subjective perceptions and limited ability to process and extrapolate information from our environment.\u00a0 Their naturalness, however, doesn\u2019t justify acting on prejudice.\u00a0 Thus, wrong is not in the holding of prejudices, but in the unwillingness to let them go and/or acting on the prejudices we hold in a way that harms others.\u00a0 As we are subjected to new information, open-minded people re-evaluate and possibly change the prejudices they hold\u2014but they\u2019re still prejudices, because we never have all the pertinent information and never are able to filter that information we do have without bias.\u00a0 For Christians, this statement would fall under:\u00a0 \u201cFor all have sinned and all have fallen short of the glory of God.\u201d\u00a0 Thus is the imperfection of man while in this mortal coil. \n Being open-minded does not prevent one from having strong, even near-immutable beliefs.\u00a0 For me, one of these beliefs is the importance of ethical and moral behavior.\u00a0 For clarification, I distinguish ethical beliefs as being wholly individual and moral beliefs as being those that are formed in conjunction with a socially recognized belief structure (often, but not exclusively, religious in nature).\u00a0 For example, Catholicism is a moral belief system.\u00a0 Ethical beliefs that are formed in conjunction with a belief in and adherence to the Catholic religion are moral beliefs.\u00a0 In kind, science is a moral belief system, which can (but is not always) practiced with the adherence others give to religions.\u00a0 Ethical beliefs that are formed in conjunction with a belief in and adherence to science are moral beliefs.\u00a0 I care less  what  your morals are based on, and more on how  highly  you raise your standards and how much you  strive  to follow them.\u00a0 Any belief system, when practiced with the requisite high standards and effort, makes you a beneficial force (though others may consider your standards and efforts misguided) unto the rest of humanity.\u00a0 And that, for me, is the crux.\u00a0 If your beliefs lead you toward benefiting others, then I would hold that your ethics are good; if your beliefs lead you toward self-gain at the expense of others, then I would hold that your ethics are bad.\u00a0 Having good ethics, of course, is insufficient if you don\u2019t strive to live by them. \n So, one of my immutable or near-immutable beliefs is that everyone can choose to have high ethical standards and everyone can strive to live those standards.\u00a0 For this reason, I have never held developmental disabilities or lack of sanity as a sufficient \u201cexcuse\u201d to justify or explain away unethical behavior.\u00a0 For example, I\u2019ve always believed that a mass murder is no less responsible and no less punishable, just because he happens to be insane.\u00a0 A man is no less responsible and no less punishable for raping another human being, just because he happens to be developmental delayed. \n I have thought for quite a while that my ethical and moral standards were, well, immutable.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t imagine any piece of information that would shake these beliefs.\u00a0 Then, in reading from a textbook, I ran into two little words that carried a punch that knocked me off of my proverbial socks and high-horse all at once:  morally challenged. \n As I started this discussion, I said that I consider myself to be open-minded and this involves re-evaluating my prejudices when faced with new information.\u00a0 Thus, when I ran into this statement I had to stop and re-evaluate my position: \n Another key contributor to a person\u2019s ethics and morality is his or her  level of moral development .\u00a0 Some workers are morally advanced, while others are morally challenged\u2014a condition that often develops early in life. \n The Fundamentals of Organizational Behavior,  4 th  ed., by Andrew J. DuBrin, 2007, pg. 75 \n Hm?\u00a0 Moral deficiencies described in the language of disability.\u00a0 You know, that makes a reasonable amount of logical sense\u2014I can\u2019t just dismiss it out of hand.\u00a0 But, the implications (at least for me) are rather huge.\u00a0 So, what to do?\u00a0  Research! \n From what I can gather, the above passage refer to (without actually discussing) Kohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Reasoning, which I found in  this link  (it\u2019s a PDF of a chapter from a textbook).\u00a0 The link had the following table: \n \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n It does not assert at which level someone would need to be at in order to be considered \u201cmorally challenged.\u201d\u00a0 I also found the following  PowerPoint presentation  online.\u00a0 This explores how contemporary U.S. values (as they\u2019re taught) are affecting society (psst, it\u2019s not good!). \n One thing the PowerPoint suggests, which I\u2019m going to say flat out, is that it does not seem likely that contemporary U.S. society will come to see being \u201cmorally challenged\u201d as a disability any time soon.\u00a0 It seems, rather, that we encourage this state.\u00a0 Yes, I know\u2014you\u2019re shocked (sarcastically speaking). \n But if being morally challenged should rightfully be considered a form of developmental disability, which the above theory implies even if it were never explicitly stated, then should I not take that into consideration when I try to hold others to my standards of ethical development?\u00a0 (I reiterate: this doesn\u2019t mean I believe everyone should share my ethical and moral beliefs, but that they should develop postconventional moral reasoning skills and have high standards of ethical and moral behavior of their own). \n To clarify, I do not believe that someone\u2019s value or inherent worth should be subject to their intellectual development or capabilities.\u00a0 Nor do I believe that someone\u2019s value or inherent worth should be subject to their physical development or capabilities.\u00a0 If moral development can be similarly hindered, impaired, or \u201ccapped\u201d, then should I not extend the same sense of value to those who are morally challenged as I would to someone who his intellectually or physically challenged?\u00a0 My instinctive reaction is  NO!!!! \u00a0 People who are morally impaired, but are not impaired in any other way have done this world great damage; they continue to do so.\u00a0 I resist, on a strong emotional level, giving them any room for \u201cexcuses\u201d like having a disability. \n But, then my own ethics kick in.\u00a0 Ethically speaking, part of the reason for not de-valuing someone with a disability is because having the disability is not their fault (this is only  part  of the reasoning; I\u2019m not suggesting this is the best or most important reason).\u00a0 If someone is morally challenged, and thus commits an immoral act, would it also be \u201cnot their fault?\u201d\u00a0 Not to mention (this is one of those much more important reasons) that, despite the harm they do, they still have inherent value as a fellow human being. \n I\u2019m torn.\u00a0 I really am.\u00a0 Emotionally, I find this \u201cexcuse\u201d unacceptable.\u00a0 Ethically and intellectually, I stand back and look at my reaction and see some of the same unreasonable prejudice flung at the friends and family I care so dearly for and write so much about. \n Is being \u201cmorally challenged\u201d a disability?\u00a0 And how does the social model influence that?\u00a0 Socially speaking, being morally challenged is an asset.\u00a0 It lets people rationalize doing all sorts of things for the sake of self-interest.\u00a0 Therefore, if the social model is exactly right, then being \u201cmorally challenged\u201d isn\u2019t a disability at all.\u00a0 (Otherwise, I\u2019m misunderstanding the implications of the social model, which is entirely possible.)\u00a0 In fact, if the social model were to apply, then being morally developed would be the disability and all those unethical people should offer us accommodations to compensate for our lack of unethicalness.\u00a0 Which, of course, is absurd on two counts:\u00a0 1) I don\u2019t want to gain advantages through mine or anyone else\u2019s unethical behavior, which would include accommodations of this sort; 2) unethical people would not voluntarily offer accommodations of this sort and, were this line of thinking valid, ethical people would lack the power to enforce the accommodations on those uncooperative \u201cunethicals.\u201d \n However, if there is something inherent about the state of being disabled, something that is exacerbated by the social model, then whether it is recognized as such or not being \u201cmorally challenged\u201d would be a disability.\u00a0 If so, then what does it mean?\u00a0 Are people who are morally challenged fully culpable for their actions as is someone who is not morally challenged?\u00a0 If not, then how would we measure that to determine what level of responsibility they hold?\u00a0 Or am I simply taking a theoretical explanation of ethical behavior too far without enough evidence to justify the theory? \n It\u2019s times like these when I almost wished I was a prejudiced, unethical schmuck who could cling to my beliefs even after they\u2019ve been legitimately questioned.\u00a0 This re-evaluation process takes work, and it\u2019s rarely simple.\u00a0 Am I resisting this re-evaluation on a purely emotional level or is there a real flaw with my analysis thus far?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, so I have to pick at it and put it out there.\u00a0 It would be simpler if I just accepted that my prejudice was right and good, and left it at that.\u00a0 But, then again, the sheer number of people who do that is one of the things that makes this world such a difficult place to live. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/equity/NE71902/801128/Ch03.pdf", "http://www.gdn.edu/Faculty/p_terry/Santrock%20Presentations/Santrock%2013%20Moral%20Development,%20Values%20&%20Religion.ppt"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/02/is-being-morally-challenged-a-disability/", "title": "Is Being \u201cMorally Challenged\u201d a Disability?"},
{"date": "February 6, 2010", "body": "\r\n Recently I had a discussion with an individual who described charity as giving that is motivated by pity, and used this definition in a Christian context.\u00a0 I tried to explain to this individual why this was not the case.\u00a0 Yet, this form of \u201ccharity\u201d is so engrained in the American culture that she could not see the distinction I was making.\u00a0 So, I\u2019ll try here in hopes of being understood. \n \u201cCharity\u201d as the word is used in the King James Bible is synonymous with Christian love.\u00a0\u00a0 Specifically, charity is defined as: \n The highest, noblest, strongest kind of love, not merely affection; the pure love of Christ.\u00a0 It is never used to denote alms or deeds or benevolence, although it may be a prompting motive. \n Holy Bible,  King James Version, 1979, published by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. \n \u201cCharity\u201d when defined as Christian love is never pity.\u00a0 Pity involves a sense of superiority:\u00a0 when you pity someone, you look down on them and think they are somehow  less  than yourself; less fortunate, less talented, less valuable.\u00a0  Less . \n Matthew 25:34-40 \n Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: \n For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: \n Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. \n Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed  thee ? Or thirsty, and gave  thee  drink? \n When saw we thee a stranger, and too  thee  in? or naked, and clothed  thee ? \n Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? \n And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done  it  unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done  it  unto me. \n While \u201ccharity\u201d is not used in the Bible as an action, if it were to be an action, then  this  would be the actions of which it would speak.\u00a0 The phrase  the least of these my brethren  is misleading, apparently.\u00a0 Some people associate it with pity, because if they are the  least , then are they not less than us? \u00a0Jesus, who tells the parable, is  NOT  agreeing that those who are in need are, as so many perceive them,  of less worth  than those who give; He is comparing  the least of these  my brethren  with a King and as brethren of the King.\u00a0 Giving unto them is not an act of pity; it is an act of charity.\u00a0 It is not done because you pity them and look down on them; it is done because you love them and feel compassion for them. \n Compare this passage with the following hypothetical scenario: \n A woman walks into the church with a Crockpot of hot, home-made soup.\u00a0 She sets up her offering on the table and gets to work preparing the space for the homeless who will be coming in.\u00a0 It is 5:30 and very cold outside.\u00a0 The doors are locked, but she hears the shuffling of people on the outside.\u00a0 The doors will open at 6, so they have to get busy to get everything ready. \n At 6 pm, the pastor opens the door and the stiff, cold people wrapped in layers of poorly mended and unclean clothes shuffle in.\u00a0 He lines the people up along the buffet so they each can get their dish, while the woman busies herself filling bowls with the hot, savory soup.\u00a0 The gentleman next to her is putting together sandwiches, some turkey and some ham. \n \u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d the soup lady says to the sandwich guy. \n \u201cI know.\u00a0 Everyone\u2019s shivering.\u00a0 We should have opened the door earlier,\u201d the guy says. \n These words startle the lady.\u00a0 \u201cBut we weren\u2019t ready yet.\u201d \n He smiles at the young man who just made it up to them.\u00a0 The soup lady hands him a bowl, and prepares another.\u00a0 The sandwich guy asks, \u201cWould you like turkey or ham?\u201d \n \u201cHam, please,\u201d he says in a gravelly voice that sounds like it doesn\u2019t get much use.\u00a0 The man takes one of the sandwiches heaping with ham, and asks him whether he\u2019d like mayonnaise or mustard.\u00a0 Before the young man can answer, the soup lady pipes in, \u201cYou see, it\u2019s just so sad that all these poor people can\u2019t find work.\u201d \n The young man\u2019s cheeks color, but she doesn\u2019t see him.\u00a0 His gaze goes dark and his shoulders slouch.\u00a0 He takes his sandwich and his soup, his milk and his apple, and even his little cookie into a far corner and eats in silence in the draftiest part of the church hall, while families and individuals gather under the blowing heat from the vents. \n When everyone is served, the sandwich man tries to talk to him.\u00a0 But the young man shakes his head.\u00a0 \u201cShe don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.\u00a0 \u201cShe don\u2019t think.\u201d \n It\u2019s not an accusation, but his voice is full of sorrow.\u00a0 Neither of them will ever know that this man works twelve hours day, six days each week, working two back-breaking jobs.\u00a0 The soup lady couldn\u2019t imagine it.\u00a0 Yet, he comes to the soup kitchen, because he doesn\u2019t leave himself enough to have more than two meals a day.\u00a0 Even working so hard, he cannot afford to because so much of that money he works so hard to earn has to go to his mother\u2019s medical bills and his children\u2019s tuition into the one private school that takes children with special needs. \n The sandwich man tried to show love; the soup lady only felt pity.\u00a0 Pity is not about love.\u00a0 Pity is about making yourself feel  better  by exposing yourself to the misery of those who are so much worse off than you.\u00a0 They\u2019re not people; they\u2019re certainly not brethren. \n This is why I see pity as being the cousin to bullying, not to love.\u00a0 Bullying is about making yourself feel  better , too.\u00a0 Instead of the passive harm you do to people when you pity them, you\u2019re harming people actively, intentionally.\u00a0 That\u2019s the only difference I see between pity and bullying.\u00a0 You\u2019re  harming  people either way; you\u2019re  looking down  on people either way. \n Love isn\u2019t about you.\u00a0 Love is about  giving  yourself to others.\u00a0 You may be called to give your heart or your time, your money or your ear.\u00a0 But you are called to give.\u00a0 Love\u2014the pure love of Christ\u2014is about recognizing the humanity in others and celebrating it.\u00a0 You give not out of obligation, not because you feel sorry for them, but because you recognize their need and want to share yourself and your possessions with a fellow human being.\u00a0 That\u2019s charity.\u00a0 Pity and charity should never be confused. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/02/on-why-pity-isnt-charity/", "title": "On Why Pity Isn\u2019t Charity"},
{"date": "February 10, 2010", "body": "\r\n Alex, who is predominantly nonverbal, has been behaving in a way that indicates that bi-polar disorder or mania may be an appropriate co-label to apply to him.\u00a0 While Alex\u2019s behavior is very different from Mark\u2019s, who has a diagnosis of bi-polar disorder, there are certain similarities.\u00a0 After discussing the matter with one of the few psychologists whose opinion I value and trust, I decided that a mental health assessment may provide useful insights and possible strategies for helping Alex be more comfortable with himself and his environment. \n In pursuit of this assessment, I recently filled out a series of mental health questionnaires.\u00a0 Clearly these questions were not designed to address a child who is nonverbal at the age of ten, which makes me wonder how effective this assessment process will be.\u00a0 Furthermore, a lot of the questions involved internal mental processes, which there is no way for me (or the doctors) to really observe.\u00a0 While I understand there is a certain statistical validity and thoroughness to a set of generic questionnaires, there is also a de-humanizing element to this process.\u00a0 Considering that I had to go through a thorough series of questionnaires to even get this appointment, it seems somehow inappropriate for their data collection efforts to continue to involve questions that are so poorly tailored to my son.\u00a0 It makes me wary.\u00a0 Are they prepared to assess Alex at all, let alone provide me with actionable information in response to that assessment? \n Then again, when it comes to psychologists, I worry about that in a more generalized fashion.\u00a0 My interactions with psychology have left me with a deeply in-grained belief that much of psychology is based on unquestioned, unquestionable biases.\u00a0 One bias is that \u201cdifferent=bad,\u201d which I reject wholly.\u00a0 A more subtle bias is that observation of behaviors equips psychologists to  explain  internal mental processes.\u00a0 Yet, there is something inherently absurd about this bias.\u00a0 First, mental processes cannot be observed, unless you\u2019re observing the brain at the time\u2014in which case the issue is separating the many mental processes one is observing in relation to the many behaviors that are occurring.\u00a0 Second, observation is by its nature subjective.\u00a0 Most of us only  observe  what we look for, and sometimes we see things we\u2019re looking for when they\u2019re not really there.\u00a0 Ironically, this absurdity is made apparent through the study of psychology. \n Allow me to illustrate: \u00a0If someone were to look at my hands, they might think I\u2019m afraid of germs.\u00a0 This is a logical conclusion from a psychological perspective, because my hands have sustained (and continue to sustain) physical damage from excessive hand-washing.\u00a0 I have open crevices in my skin which sometimes bleed.\u00a0 I have scabs over partially healed crevices.\u00a0 My hands look far older than their 30 years.\u00a0 Sometimes my skin is so dry and stiff that it looks like arthritis has stolen their mobility.\u00a0 A common explanation for such a destructive behavior is a phobia, especially when that behavior coincides with obsessive-compulsive disorder (a diagnosis I have). \n And yet, my behaviors have nothing to do with germs.\u00a0 Unless you\u2019re looking for germ-o-phobia you won\u2019t find any real evidence of it.\u00a0 In reality, as subjective as my personal reality may be, the damage to my hands is the result of a combination of raising young children and having tactile sensitivities that makes touching anything sticky, tacky, slime, gritty, sandy, flaky\u2014well, the list could go on, but I think you get the point\u2014an adverse experience.\u00a0 So, sure I wash my hands every time I change a diaper or touch the garbage can or sort dirty clothes or pick up miscellaneous things from the floor.\u00a0 Sure, I wash my hands whenever I sneeze or blow my nose or go to the bathroom or take out the trash.\u00a0 These are basic sanitary actions.\u00a0 What makes it excessive is when I have to wash both my hands all over because the side of my finger touched something tacky, like the glue left behind by a sticker that was stuck one too many times.\u00a0 Or when I do the same thing, because my hand brushed up against something sticky, like the ring left behind by a juice cup. \n Perhaps my behavior isn\u2019t rational.\u00a0 Perhaps it is compulsive.\u00a0 But, far too many people have tried to label my behavior, both officially and casually, without understanding it.\u00a0 Yet, when it comes to people doing this to me, I\u2019m prepared.\u00a0 I\u2019m a highly introspective person and tend to understand myself quite well.\u00a0  I  know why I wash my hands until they literally bleed.\u00a0 When others throw their baseless speculations at me, I can flick them off with the little regard they deserve. \n I\u2019m much more wary when it comes to my children.\u00a0 While I think I understand my boys fairly well, I\u2019m also insightful enough to recognize that there is far more I don\u2019t understand.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how Brandon really feels about being shuffled between two very different households.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why Willy feels so comfortable walking up to complete strangers and starting a conversation.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what Alex is trying to do when he colors the same drawing furiously for a half an hour, discarding page after page after page and starting again.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why Ben closes a book or stops a video at the same part over and over again, yet seems to like that same book or video so very much.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know these things, and I don\u2019t think their behavior alone can provide genuine insights into the behaviors themselves.\u00a0 To truly understand these emotions and these actions and all that goes on in-between you have to understand the experience of the individual.\u00a0 The only way I really know to do that is through communication, but even that is imperfect.\u00a0 What the other says and what I interpret are and always will be two entirely different things, and this isn\u2019t because I am specifically flawed\u2014all of humankind faces the same limitation.\u00a0 What I understand and what is meant may be close; my understanding may be sufficient, but these two separate experiences are always going to be at least slightly different.\u00a0 More importantly, they can be substantially different. \n So, as I prepare myself for this meeting I have tomorrow, I remind myself that they may have a greater understanding of the discipline of psychology than I, but I have a better understanding of my child and an appreciation of the limits of that understanding.\u00a0 For a child who struggles so much to communicate, it may seem natural to rely on interpreting his behaviors to gain insights to his internal processes.\u00a0 But, these insights are far from perfect and that must never be forgotten.\u00a0 Last, but not least, as we seek to understand Alex and to help him, we must remember to ask the right questions, because the questions we ask color the experience for each of us. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "February 16, 2010", "body": "\r\n The question has been lurking in my mind:  Am I on or merely near the \u201cspectrum? \u00a0 When I was gathering some more links for my collection I came across three different quizzes.\u00a0 Here are the results if you\u2019re at all curious. \n First, I took a quiz from  PsychCentral : \n They call theirs an Autism/Asperger\u2019s Screening Quiz.\u00a0 I scored 33.\u00a0 They say if you score 34 or more autism is likely.\u00a0 If you score between 30 and 33 autism is possible (which is where I fit in according to this quiz).\u00a0 If you score 29 or less, no autism. \n This puts me at the cusp of the criteria, however I found their questions to be rather stereotypical than definitive.\u00a0 It makes it rather difficult to feel confident about the results.\u00a0 Particularly, I find this passage to be bothersome:\u00a0 \u201cBased upon your responses to this autism screening measure, it appears that you may be  suffering  from an autism spectrum disorder, or Asperger\u2019s disorder. People who score similarly often qualify for a diagnosis of autism or Asperger\u2019s,\u201d (emphasis added).\u00a0 No test of this nature can indicate whether one is  suffering  or merely  experiencing. \u00a0 This presumption betrays a bias that I find rather untrustworthy. \n Next, I took an  Aspie Quiz  on RDOS.net: \n This site kindly provided HTML code, so I can share the results. \n \n The summary is as follows: \n Your Aspie score: 146 of 200 \nYour neurotypical (non-autistic) score: 58 of 200 \nYou are very likely an Aspie \nYour MBTI type: INTJ \n Next, I went to a site I\u2019m unfamiliar with that offers what it calls an  ASC-Plot : \n They also kindly offer HTML code, so there\u2019s a visual. \n \n And here\u2019s the summary: \n 0 indicates no autistic component, 10 indicates a strong autistic component. The components of this plot are outlined below: \n \n Repetitive or restricted Behaviours and Interests (RBI) - Stereotyped, repetitive behaviours and interests \n Social Impairment (SI) - Social understanding \n Language problems (L) - Speech, words and sentences \n Planning, Organization and Concentration problems (POC) - Cognitive skills related to being able to plan, organise and stay focused \n Imaging and Recall problems (IR) - Visualisation, imagination and remembering past events \n Reasoning and Problem solving problems (RP) - Cognitive skills related to rational deduction and working things out \n Sensory problems (S) - Impact of senses \n Motor problems (M) - Control of own movement \n \n \n And my scores are: \n \n RBI =7 \n SI=8.25 \n L=3.75 \n POC=7 \n IR=8.25 \n RP=4.5 \n S=7.5 \n M=4.25 \n \n I think I can say with confidence that I\u2019m not neurotypical, but I knew that.\u00a0 This didn\u2019t make me want to go out and get a diagnosis though.\u00a0 Not because I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m not an Aspie, but because there are so many barriers to a diagnosis I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the energy. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://psychcentral.com/quizzes/autism.htm", "http://www.rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php", "http://www.pttools.co.uk/asc/asc_wp2.php"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/02/quiz-me/", "title": "Quiz Me"},
{"date": "February 23, 2010", "body": "\r\n There are two basic problems that impede autistics who are able to work from obtaining a job, especially one that suits their skills.\u00a0 The first impediment is that employers, i.e. the managers and human resource professionals whose job it is to hire appropriate personnel, are not adequately (or sometimes at all) prepared to assess the employability of an individual with autism.\u00a0 This issue I intend to address as part of my long-term career as a business writer.\u00a0 Other than continuing with advocacy efforts, there\u2019s little the average concerned individual can do to change this situation. \n The second impediment is that potential employees are rarely trained to market themselves effectively.\u00a0 This is true for most workers or potential workers.\u00a0 This is, perhaps, especially true for potential workers with autism.\u00a0 The latter is an issue you can address directly, which I can assist with indirectly.\u00a0 And that is the purpose of this post. \n What does it mean to \u201cmarket yourself?\u201d \n Simply put, from the point of view of the employer, you are a resource\u2014or a potential resource.\u00a0 Businesses have needs they must fill.\u00a0 Some of these needs are filled by obtaining capital\u2014they turn to investors or lenders to fill this need.\u00a0 Some of the needs are filled by obtaining physical assets\u2014they use funds to buy or lease buildings, equipment, and supplies to fill this need.\u00a0 Some of these needs are filled by obtaining labor\u2014and that\u2019s where you and all the other potential workers come in. \n Your task is to convince the employer that you can satisfy their need effectively.\u00a0 Thus, you must market yourself! \n Where do you start? \n The first thing you need to do is to honestly assess two things: \n 1) What do you have to offer?\u00a0 In other words, what employer needs can you satisfy? \n For example, I am a skilled writer.\u00a0 I have evidence that backs this up in the form of published work and unbiased praise.\u00a0 (This is, of course, not to suggest that there isn\u2019t plenty of room for improvement.)\u00a0 I\u2019m also knowledgeable about business, seeing that I\u2019ve nearly completed my baccalaureate in Business Management with a concentration in Business Administration.\u00a0 My career path is based on these two attributes. \n 2) What do you require in return for your services?\u00a0 Consider the wages and benefits you demand, of course.\u00a0 But you must also consider the working conditions and other factors as well. \n For example, I will not work for an employer who demands I compromise my ethics.\u00a0 I prefer not to work in noisy conditions. \n The next thing you need to do is to look at the jobs available in your area and ask yourself: \n 1) Of these jobs, what category of jobs fits my skills and demands? \n 2) How are these positions filled? \n This step is very important, but also one that is readily skipped over.\u00a0 There are some jobs that are often filled by head-hunters.\u00a0 These are usually professional positions for which the pool of candidates is spread over the entire country or the world.\u00a0 There are other jobs that are filled through ads in papers, online, or at job centers.\u00a0 There are other jobs that are filled through network connections.\u00a0 These jobs are often never advertised.\u00a0 There are jobs that are only advertised with a sign on the proprietor\u2019s door. \n Knowing what jobs you\u2019re qualified for and how those positions are filled is an essential component in knowing how to market yourself for the jobs you can get. \n How do I market myself? \n This step depends a great deal on the steps above. \n What if the position I want is filled using head-hunters? \n Then, you need to make sure head-hunters have access to your professional portfolio.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t know what that means, then you need the assistance of a professional resume writer.\u00a0 That is beyond the purview of this post. \n What if the position I want is filled through a resume/interview/testing combination? \n First, do some research about the company.\u00a0 If all you have is their ad, then use that.\u00a0 Ask yourself: \n \n What are they looking for? \n Am I really qualified? \n How can I communicate that I\u2019m qualified? \n \n The answers to these questions make up your resume.\u00a0 Let\u2019s assume you have a generic resume that has your qualifications, your employment history, and your education on it. \n Don\u2019t send that!!! \n What you need is to tailor your resume to their needs.\u00a0 Don\u2019t start with an objective; instead, start with a marketing statement.\u00a0 Then, go into your strongest section, which will hopefully be your employment history, but may also be volunteer work.\u00a0 Don\u2019t write out your responsibilities; instead, write out your accomplishments.\u00a0 Don\u2019t tell them what you were assigned to do; tell them what you  did  do.\u00a0 Not sure how to do that?\u00a0 Consider talking to a professional resume writer or spending some time with resume writing books.\u00a0 Move on from there.\u00a0 Consider this your sell sheet\u2014you are the \u201cproduct\u201d and you want to describe yourself in such a way that your \u201ccustomer\u201d knows that you are exactly what he or she needs. \n If done right, the resume (and cover letter) will get you the interview.\u00a0 Use the resume to structure your interview.\u00a0 Whenever possible, focus on your accomplishments and your selling points.\u00a0 Practice.\u00a0 Rehearse.\u00a0 Prepare. \n The testing would be scheduled around the time of your interview.\u00a0 Do the best you can.\u00a0 Be well rested.\u00a0 Be prepared.\u00a0 Relax. \n What if the position I want is filled through network connections? \n Then, you need to do the resume stuff, but you also need to talk with people.\u00a0 Let people who might be in a position to help know that you\u2019re looking for work.\u00a0 Ask around.\u00a0 These jobs won\u2019t be advertised, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not available. \n What if the position I want is filled through an application/interview combination?

DuBrin, 2007, pg. 381). \n Diversity goes beyond recognizing that we are different in measurable ways.\u00a0 Diversity goes beyond tolerance.\u00a0 Diversity goes beyond offering assistance to excluded individuals.\u00a0 Diversity is about  inclusion . \n In some sense, I have ignored those diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s who object to being lumped into the same diagnostic category as my children.\u00a0 Their words, their behavior\u2014it\u2019s beneath my contempt, it makes me angry, and it\u2019s so hypocritical, so absurd that it really doesn\u2019t warrant a response.\u00a0 Except it does, because there are those who claim their words represent  neurodiversity .\u00a0 It got that response from people much more influential than I. \n This post is not about them, though the words I write could apply.\u00a0 This about what I consider the fundamentals of  neurodiversity  to be. \n Consider the difference between  cultural diversity  and  affirmative action .\u00a0 Both seek to include people with different racial, ethnic, and national profiles in the workplace.\u00a0 One does so by focusing  on  differences and disadvantages.\u00a0 The other focuses  on  similarities and strengths.\u00a0 One assumes that those who weren\u2019t born white Americans need  help  getting a job.\u00a0 The other assumes that everyone needs  opportunities  and can  add value  to a firm. \n Neurodiversity  is to  cultural diversity  what  empowerment  is to  affirmative action .\u00a0  Neurodiversity  and  empowerment  parallel each other in many respects; but, they are not synonyms, they are not the same.\u00a0 Both have their place, but they are not the same. \n Neurodiversity  is not about services, accommodations, treatment methods, or any of the issues that are often in the forefront of our dialogues.\u00a0 People who believe in  neurodiversity  do not share the same opinion about all of these things.\u00a0 Those issues are not the essence of  neurodiversity . \n Neurodiversity  is about two things: \n 1) People are naturally and normally neurologically different.\u00a0 Some of these natural, normal differences are labeled \u201cabnormal,\u201d \u201cdisorders,\u201d \u201csyndromes,\u201d or other value-laden labels that interferes with our ability to understand the different subsets of human neurology. \n 2) Human beings are valuable, in all their diversity, in and of themselves. \n This means: \n 1) You can not  claim to value diversity and claim to be superior.\u00a0 Those two statements cannot be combined without the use of a logical fallacy.\u00a0 It would not, however, invalidate a claim to value diversity if you are struggling with  feelings of superiority . \n 2) You  can  claim to value diversity and yet desire assistance, accommodations, and/or medical treatments.\u00a0 The use of assistance, accommodation, and/or medical treatments does not invalidate a claim of valuing diversity. \n 3) You can not  claim to value diversity and claim to be inferior.\u00a0 Those two statements cannot be combined without the use of a logical fallacy.\u00a0 It would not, however, invalidate a claim to value diversity if you are struggling with  feelings of inferiority . \n 4) You  can  claim to value diversity and dislike specific people because of the things they say or do that are within their control.\u00a0 For example, you can dislike someone who bullies you and still value diversity. \n 5) You can not  claim to value diversity and dislike individuals or groups based on traits beyond their control.\u00a0 For example, you cannot dislike someone who embarrasses you by having a seizure in public and still value diversity. \n 6) You can support the research of human differences and still value diversity.\u00a0 For example, you can support the research into the various causes of autism and still support neurodiversity. \n 7) You cannot support the forced eradication of a group based on an undesirable trait and still value diversity.\u00a0 For example, you cannot support diversity and research a way to identify and eliminate autistic fetuses. \n 8) You can advocate techniques that minimize or \u201cun-does\u201d challenges and still value diversity.\u00a0 For example, a person can support the inclusion of individuals with spinal cord injuries  and  support researching ways to correct damage to their spinal cords.\u00a0 A person can also support the inclusion of individuals who cannot talk  and  support researching ways to give them access to speech. \n 9) You cannot advocate the \u201ccure\u201d of a diverse group and still value diversity.\u00a0 For example, you cannot support racial diversity  and  try to cure \u201cblackness.\u201d\u00a0 Neither can you support neurodiversity  and  try to cure autism or bi-polar or any other neurological subtype. \n Neurodiversity  is about recognizing that the human race has natural neurological variations, accepting the individuals with all those variations, and including them in society.\u00a0 It is about giving people the power and the opportunity to achieve their own individual potential, not quantifying that potential and dismissing those who do not \u201cmeasure up\u201d from consideration.\u00a0 A belief in  neurodiversity  does not preclude the experience of disability.\u00a0 A belief in  neurodiversity  does not preclude the desire to overcome the experience of disability, either temporarily or permanently.\u00a0 A belief in  neurodiversity  doesn\u2019t even preclude a belief that the government has no business extending entitlements or \u201cspecial rights\u201d to disadvantaged groups.\u00a0 A belief in  neurodiversity  does, however, preclude the belief that you are in any way superior to another on the basis of things beyond your or their control.\u00a0 Being smarter doesn\u2019t make you better.\u00a0 Being more socially adaptable doesn\u2019t make you better.\u00a0 Being more emotionally stable doesn\u2019t make you better.\u00a0 If you want to feel \u201cbetter,\u201d then  use  your abilities (whatever they are) to  help others .\u00a0 Not only will you really feel better, but it\u2019ll be a better feeling than any false sense of superiority could ever give you. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/02/the-true-meaning-of-diversity/", "title": "The True Meaning of Diversity"},

behavior was in response to Willy\u2019s behavior.\u00a0 The doctors told us many things.\u00a0 What they didn\u2019t tell us was how we could  help  our children. \n I never considered the possibility of consigning my son to an institution.\u00a0 Children, no matter how challenged or challenging, are not disposable.\u00a0 I was full of feelings that I could not put into words.\u00a0 The closest I could come was: \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t have my son!\u201d\u00a0 Later, those words developed into: \u00a0\u201cMy children aren\u2019t broken, don\u2019t try to fix them.\u201d\u00a0 On the Internet, I began to hear \u201cwhispers\u201d of another approach.\u00a0 Apparently, there was another way to look at these \u201cproblems.\u201d\u00a0 These \u201cwhispers\u201d came from people who did not support the idea of neurodiversity and did not state the concept itself.\u00a0 These people, when given the opportunity, told me my feelings were wrong and I was harming my child by not trying every treatment available, or at least the treatment they supported as the \u201cmiracle cure.\u201d \n I was a political blogger at that time, devoted to  the anti-incumbent sentiment .\u00a0 In short, I was already something of a rebel \u2013 ready and willing to challenge the status quo.\u00a0 I was quirky, neurotic, and intelligent.\u00a0 I struggled with social relationships and face-to-face meetings; and I already knew I had traits occupational therapists described as Sensory Integration Disorder.\u00a0 I already knew that the best thing for me was to learn how to cope and for others to let me just be myself.\u00a0 Why, oh why, could my boys not get the same respect I wanted for myself!?! \n Sure, I was teased mercilessly as a child.\u00a0 Sure, there were lots and lots of people who tried to marginalize me, and some even succeeded.\u00a0 But it\u2019s my head.\u00a0 It\u2019s my mind.\u00a0 Why should anyone get to mess with that?\u00a0 My husband, too, is neurologically different.\u00a0 With bi-polar disorder, he\u2019s faced a lot of outward pressure to conform to something he is not; and all that pressure seems to do is to make it more and more difficult for him to function.\u00a0 Why should anyone get to change him?\u00a0 Why can\u2019t they just  help  him?\u00a0 And, now, our children, who are so different they need the label \u201cautism\u201d to make them understandable \u2013 a label full of fear and shame and voices calling for their imprisonment.\u00a0 Why should anyone get to mess with my kids\u2019 minds?\u00a0 Why should anyone get to say they are anything less than children? \n All these feelings were denied, put down, and explained away.\u00a0 I was wrong.\u00a0 I was simply wrong.\u00a0 The psychologists were right.\u00a0 I was wrong, and if I were fixed I would know I was wrong.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve read this far, then I suspect you know how that feels.\u00a0 It\u2019s not good.\u00a0 What was worse for me was how my words were twisted and distorted from what I meant.\u00a0 I ask for  help  and people talk  cure .\u00a0 Words are my tools, as a writer, they\u2019re my strength.\u00a0 But all my words were being shot back at me, deformed and malign. \n In the blogging venue, I stumbled on Estee\u2019s The Joy of Adam (the old one) and somehow I got to Zilari\u2019s Processing in Parts (the blog is now gone and I miss her).\u00a0 There my feelings were validated.\u00a0 Even when we didn\u2019t agree, they didn\u2019t say I was wrong for feeling the way I did.\u00a0 And, they gave me a word:\u00a0 neurodiversity.\u00a0 I love words.\u00a0 I collect words.\u00a0 I  understand  words, with all their limitations and capacity for misstatement, I understand them.\u00a0 That word was quite possibly the greatest gift any \u201ccommunity\u201d has ever given me.\u00a0 I could take all the pain, all the rejection, all the hurtful things, and I could dump them into that word.\u00a0 And I did.\u00a0 Suddenly, I was talking to people who didn\u2019t shoot back  cure  when I said  help , and it felt wonderful. \n But, neurodiversity is more than that.\u00a0 Neurodiversity

acknowledgement that being different is okay.\u00a0 And neurodiversity is for my neurotypical step-son, who has unique learning needs of his own, though he can get by in the status-quo society we live in. \n To me, neurodiversity is about questioning what we know and what we think we know about how people think.\u00a0 It\u2019s about discarding prejudices and assumptions about the existence of a \u201cproper\u201d or \u201cappropriate\u201d way to think.\u00a0 It\u2019s about questioning the use of \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cabnormal\u201d to describe anyone\u2019s thinking.\u00a0 To me, neurodiversity is about recognizing and appreciating that everyone has a \u201cdifferent\u201d mind, one that is unique to them, and that nobody should be marginalized, disenfranchised, or violated because their mind doesn\u2019t meet somebody else\u2019s standards or expectations. \n Freedom of thought is a fundamental right that nobody has the authority to take away.\u00a0 We can regulate and legislate against people\u2019s actions.\u00a0 We can regulate and legislate against people\u2019s words.\u00a0 We cannot regulate or legislate against people\u2019s thoughts.\u00a0 Thoughts are our own.\u00a0 You don\u2019t know someone else\u2019s thoughts.\u00a0 You do not understand someone else\u2019s mind.\u00a0 You can also perceive what goes on in someone else\u2019s mind through their behavior.\u00a0 And your observation depends on what the other person communicates and what filters you put on that communication. \n To deem someone\u2019s thoughts or feelings as right or wrong is the ultimate act of hubris.\u00a0 To invade someone\u2019s thoughts or feelings is the ultimate form of rape.\u00a0 To re-write someone\u2019s thoughts or feelings to suit your own purposes is the ultimate form of murder. \n Behaviors and communications are regulated and society chooses which to legislate against.\u00a0 We form rules, both legal and social, to shape what we consider appropriate.\u00a0 This is not going to change.\u00a0 What we can change is the limits and assumptions we place on those behaviors and communications.\u00a0 Being different and expressing oneself differently shouldn\u2019t be against the rules. \n Self-expression is a fundamental right secondary only to freedom of thought.\u00a0 There is one primary reason I know of to regulate or legislate against self-expression and that is immediate or imminent harm.\u00a0 The proverbial \u201cfire\u201d in the crowded building.\u00a0 The clich\u00e9 \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d\u00a0 A picture of someone with a bullet through their head left in someone\u2019s mailbox.\u00a0 A picture of a naked child in a suggestive position.\u00a0 These are threatening, harmful forms of self-expression.\u00a0 They either cause harm or suggest harm will be caused.\u00a0 A secondary reason to regulate or legislate against self-expression is those messages that manipulate for the purpose of or with the result of doing harm.\u00a0 Pornography, false advertising, perjury, and defamation fall under this category. \n Silencing the dissenting voice because it doesn\u2019t fit with others\u2019 expectations should not ever be regulated or legislated against \u2013 not legally and not socially.\u00a0 Nobody should dictate how someone must communicate.\u00a0 Nobody should dictate what someone should communicate on their own behalf.\u00a0 Nobody should dictate when someone can communicate.\u00a0 Nobody should dictate why someone should communicate.\u00a0 Nobody should dictate if someone should be allowed to communicate.\u00a0 Anybody who does these things on behalf of neurodiversity, in my opinion, is distorting, deforming, and maligning the meaning of the word. \n Neurodiversity is about recognizing and celebrating the individual in whatever shape, form, color, creed, brain, or label they come in.\u00a0 Anything less is not \u201cdiversity.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s certainly not neurodiversity. \n ***This post is inspired by the conversations taking place on  The Standard Review , but the thoughts are my own.\u00a0 I do not assume to fully understand

{"date": "November 10, 2009", "body": "\r\n With the threat of swine flu, our local school district is taking extra precautions to remind parents to keep their children home when experiencing flu-like symptoms.\u00a0 This notice was sent home on a bright red flyer with all three boys.\u00a0 The school system has a standing policy, which I\u2019ve known since the first started attending Early Childhood, to keep children home for 24-hours after the symptoms of illness are gone. \n Pretty much since this school year started, Ben has been sent home on a fairly regular basis due to vomiting.\u00a0 Alex has also been sent home due to vomiting, but with less regularity.\u00a0 Due to school policies, each time one of my children vomited, they would lose a partial-day and a full-day of school.\u00a0 Normally, I wouldn\u2019t object to this arbitrary rule.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe it does much to alleviate the spread of contagions, because each contagion has its own window of opportunity.\u00a0 However, at the very least, it is a measure to ensure the child is actually well enough to attend school and benefit from the experience. \n That is to say, normally I would not object, but\u2026 \n 1) Both Alex and Ben have a history of vomiting when they are not ill.\u00a0 For Alex, this history is well-documented and has been observed and verified by medical practitioners and school staff.\u00a0 Ben has exhibited similar behavior, but his experiences are less well-documented because this behavior has occurred with much less frequency\u2014until now. \n 2) I recently received a letter from the school system chastising me for keeping my children home.\u00a0 Despite the school\u2019s demands I keep my children home at any significant sign of illness, despite my compliance with these demands, and despite my telephone calls to report the nature of my child\u2019s absence and the symptoms related to these absences, the school has elected to count the boys\u2019 absences due to illness as \u201cparent excused absences.\u201d \n Parent excused absences are considered discretionary on the part of the parent.\u00a0 If you take your child on vacation during a regularly scheduled school day, then that day counts as a parent excused absence.\u00a0 There are consequences if you use up too many of these days, because you\u2019re interfering with your legal obligation to send your child to school.\u00a0 Days your child stay home due to illness are not supposed to be counted as discretionary days of absence, because your child is not allowed to attend school as per school policies.\u00a0 Yet, I\u2019ve received a letter challenging my choice to keep my children home with such frequency. \n Why were these days mislabeled as discretionary absences?\u00a0 When I kept my children home sick, I called into the school to report the absence, the reason for the absence, and the symptoms my children were experiencing\u2014all done per the instructions I received in the various flyers sent home.\u00a0 What I did not do is drag my children to their pediatrician, expose other patients to the contagion, just so the doctor could say, \u201cYep.\u00a0 Your child is definitely ill.\u00a0 Here\u2019s your note.\u201d\u00a0 Apparently, I\u2019m expected to do exactly that.\u00a0 To avoid this scenario, I have been instructed by a school secretary to call my doctor (versus bringing my children to the clinic) and the doctor will fax over the same note.\u00a0 Thus, I avoid false accusations of keeping my children home at my own discretion. \n The only justification I can imagine for this procedure is the undisclosed psychic training doctor\u2019s receive as part of their medical schooling.\u00a0 Because doctors receive this training, they\u2019ll know I\u2019m being truthful when I say my children are ill.\u00a0 Because school staff does not receive this training, they must assume I\u2019m a lying scumbag who keeps my children home to thwart the school\u2019s master agenda to educate the next generation. \u00a0Since I do not believe doctors receive psychic training in medical school, since I do believe both the doctor\u2019s time and my time is too valuable to waste for the sake of mindless bureaucracy, since I do not believe it is conducive for the school to assume a parent is lying regarding the reasons for absence, and since I do not believe it is ethical for the school to require such a procedure  but not post it with its other requirements , I elect not to comply. \n \u00a0Now, I could simply leave this post here: a rant to a situation that aggravates and frustrates me.\u00a0 On the surface, it\u2019s just that.\u00a0 However, there is an underlying issue not readily recognized.\u00a0 I perceive this as \u201cbureaucratic non-sense,\u201d I find it aggravating, stressful, and unnecessarily time-consuming.\u00a0 I find the need to challenge this situation and bring it to the attention of those positioned in places of authority within the school system.\u00a0 When I look at situations like these, I gravitate to the default I-me position.\u00a0 I see this from my own perspective and I deal with it accordingly. \n I\u2019m not confessing this from a position of guilt, but to highlight a different kind of absence.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one who handles the bureaucratic barriers my family faces and must navigate.\u00a0 When the school makes an unfair decision, I deal with it.\u00a0 When it\u2019s time to negotiate the IEP, I negotiate.\u00a0 When it\u2019s time to fill out paperwork, I enter the information.\u00a0 When it\u2019s time to decide which barriers are worth challenging, I do it.\u00a0 When there are interruptions in services, I fix them.\u00a0 I make the telephone calls, I fill out the paperwork, and I go to the meetings. \n I\u2019m not on some kind of ego-trip here.\u00a0 I do not do these things because I enjoy being the go-to person.\u00a0 I don\u2019t do these things because bureaucracy is just so much fun.\u00a0 I do these things because Mark can\u2019t; or, more accurately, I do these things because Mark chooses not to do them, even when it means being penalized or losing or never receiving services we would otherwise be entitled to receive.\u00a0 I do these things, because as much as these barriers represent a source of unnecessary stress and aggravation for me, they represent near-insurmountable barriers for Mark. \n Bureaucracy places a burden on people within this society in many forms and in many ways.\u00a0 Bureaucracy has a profound effect on daily living, from the medical care we receive to how we pay taxes to managing our reporting requirements.\u00a0 For me, and for most people, these issues represent an annoyance, an inconvenience, and a consumption of time we\u2019d rather avoid.\u00a0 This alone is reason enough to affect change. \n However, for some, bureaucracy represents a substantial burden that  keeps them down .\u00a0 My husband has lost education opportunities, employment opportunities, entitlements, benefits, and even a marginally profitable business due to the burden of bureaucracy.\u00a0 Barriers that I would grumblingly crawl over or around are impassable roadblocks to Mark. \n While I\u2019m sure someone could analyze Mark and describe this reality in the language of disablism and deficits that is not my purpose.\u00a0 My point is that we erect arbitrary, unnecessary barriers that exclude people from necessary systems.\u00a0 In recognition of this phenomenon, government agencies and corporate bodies provide assistants to traverse these barriers.\u00a0 Often, these assistants present yet another barrier: \n 1) Their manner is often condescending and disrespectful.\u00a0 I\u2019ve experienced this myself and have observed this when others deal with my husband.\u00a0 This behavior makes people feel less able and inferior.\u00a0 Whether or not this behavior is intentional, it is pervasive. \n 2) In order to access these assistants, you have to be able to navigate the bureaucracy sufficiently well to communicate the needs for this assistance. \n In the face of these additional barriers, Mark opts out.\u00a0 He chooses not to access necessary services, because he does not want to confront these barriers. \n So, while I fret and stress over these barriers, I\u2019m thankful I\u2019m here to face them.\u00a0 I also grieve for those who are like Mark, but do not have someone who is both willing and able to face these barriers in their stead.\u00a0 I feel the anger and frustration boil, because these unnecessary, poorly planned \u201cservices\u201d are obstacles that reinforce the neurotypical status quo.\u00a0 And I fear that these barriers will not be torn down by the time my children reach adulthood. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

whereas before, if I put the wrong shoe on first, he\u2019d take it off until the other was on. \n One of Alex\u2019s daily expectations is the merry dance between activities he and Willy shares.\u00a0 They are both active little boys who are often like ships passing in the night\u2014they do not directly engage (as part of this routine), but their play parallels each other in a way that Alex expects and enjoys.\u00a0 With Willy lying on the couch, this expectation was undone. \n Alex also engages with Willy directly at intervals throughout the day.\u00a0 His usual ways of engaging with others tends to be a bit invasive.\u00a0 Alex will get right up in someone\u2019s face and put his hands on their mouth or grab at their arms to keep that a very direct form of contact for several minutes at a time.\u00a0 He engages with Willy in this manner throughout the day.\u00a0 Willy tolerates this behavior most of the time\u2014except when it interferes with playing his game or watching television.\u00a0 But when Willy was sick with the flu, he had very little tolerance for Alex\u2019s direct engagement strategies and wasn\u2019t up and playing around. \n Alex, in turn, couldn\u2019t tolerate this change in his routine.\u00a0 He tried many things to make Willy behave normally.\u00a0 He grabbed his face.\u00a0 He tried to pull him up.\u00a0 He bounced on him.\u00a0 He laid on him.\u00a0 He grabbed and pinched his arms.\u00a0 And he hollered at him in a loud, squeaky tone that seemed to imitate the squirrels that like to sit on our fence and scold the stray cats as they pass through our yard. \n We intervened as best we could and tried to explain to Alex that Willy was sick and needed his rest.\u00a0 Alex wasn\u2019t buying it.\u00a0 He persistently and insistently tried to force Willy to behave normally. \n While Alex\u2019s expectations were developed over time, each time a child is born that child is born into expectations.\u00a0 These expectations vary depending on the individual sources of these expectations.\u00a0 Yet it is seemingly universal that a child born will face some set of expectations, and it is relatively rare for a child to meet them all.\u00a0 Some goals that are set may be reached, but others are aborted as the child asserts a will of his or her own.\u00a0 Parents are full of such expectations and each parent reacts to the child\u2019s failure to live up to expectations differently. \n This pattern of expectations, actions, and reactions can be observed with every child I\u2019ve ever known.\u00a0 A child can be neurotypical or neurologically diverse, able-bodied or physically disabled, intelligent or less intelligent, or have any other trait imaginable.\u00a0 The child will be faced with unreasonable expectations, born of a parent\u2019s desire for the child to reflect something about the parent. \u00a0\u00a0The parent will, in turn, discover that the child has a will and a personhood separate from the parent.\u00a0 Often, this behavior and these discoveries happen on a level below conscious thought.\u00a0 Most of us are not so self-aware that we see our behavior in these terms.\u00a0 Yet, it happens.\u00a0 Again and again, it happens. \n Like Alex, the people in our lives have expectations.\u00a0 Like Willy, we are not always willing or able to live up to them.\u00a0 Like Alex, many of us try to  do something  to ensure our expectations are met.\u00a0 Like my husband and I, observers can often see how unreasonable and counterproductive these actions are. \n In reading the works of autistic adults, sometimes I get the impression that this form of parental mistreatment and abuse happens especially or even only to people with neurological differences.\u00a0 This is not true.\u00a0 One thing that sets neurologically divergent people apart is how this sort of behavior is institutionalized and condoned in our culture and in many other cultures. \n Societies, too, have expectations for their members.\u00a0 People who are significantly different\u2014whether those differences are mental, emotional, psychological, or physical\u2014face a great deal of pressure to conform to those expectations.\u00a0 Parents who reinforce those expectations are encouraged; those of us who try to change and adjust those expectations to a set that is more inclusive and less judgmental are discouraged. \n Like the behaviors Alex chose to inflict on his sick brother, our attempts to force others to meet our expectations are fundamentally flawed.\u00a0 They are also natural and widespread.\u00a0 From the parent who tries to force their child to pursue a career-track the child either dislikes or is unsuited for, to the parent who tries to force their child to behave \u201cnormally,\u201d from the government that tries to force its citizens into other-defined habits, to the government that tries to force all its children to learn in a standardized manner, there is the assumption that our expectations are right and that we have a right to enforce them.\u00a0 The harm is real and it, too, is widespread.\u00a0 But like Alex, our behaviors are often persistent and insistent and so many of us consistently fail to understand the harm we do.\u00a0 Sadly, this thing we all have in common is a thing which hurts us all. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2009/10/in-similitude/", "title": "In Similitude"},

and disabilism and the disability discourse shape their futures. \n Neurodiversity is a two-fold concept that can change the public educational system for all children.\u00a0 Neurodiversity refers to a civil rights movement crafted by autistics that seeks true equality for people with cognitive disorders and mental illnesses\u2014founded on the belief that neurological differences are natural human variations and deserve the rights, accommodations, and acceptance any other human difference deserves.\u00a0 Neurodiversity also recognizes that neurological development is not standardized.\u00a0 Everyone develop unique neurological processes that should be recognized, respected, and facilitated. \n Everyone is neurologically diverse.\u00a0 Everyone has unique educational needs our education system fails to meet.\u00a0 Instead of designing an education system that meets the individual needs of our children, we have designed an education system that meets societal needs for measurements, cost-control, and resource allocation.\u00a0 Changes to IEP legislation that require recording strengths as well as needs, separating a grade into groups that study different levels of mathematics or reading, using inclusive language, and telling students that those segregated in the special education system are part of their class address surface issues.\u00a0 But the problem goes much, much deeper.\u00a0 Our education system is fundamentally flawed.\u00a0 It does not meet, nor is it designed to meet, the needs of the students we wish to educate. \n Our children deserve an education system designed to meet their individual learning needs.\u00a0 Our children deserve a learning environment that teaches children, not curricula.\u00a0 Our children deserve teachers that are trained and qualified to teach them as individuals, recognizing and meeting their individual education needs.\u00a0 An Individual Education Plan shouldn\u2019t be a privilege reserved for students with special needs, but should be provided to all students.\u00a0 Our school systems need holistic change.\u00a0 We need to re-think how we teach, what we teach, and who we are teaching.\u00a0 We need to rethink the qualifications our educators need and we need to rethink the needs our schools should be required to meet.\u00a0 \n Change comes slowly and painfully.\u00a0 Holistic change may be easy to envision, but it is very difficult to achieve.\u00a0 It won\u2019t happen this year or next year.\u00a0 But it can happen.\u00a0 Change requires a lot of work, a lot of planning, and often a new allocation of resources.\u00a0 An individualized education provided by well-trained, highly-qualified, and fully-resourced staff doesn\u2019t come cheap.\u00a0 But our children are our future and they are worth the work and they are worth the money.\u00a0 The real question is:\u00a0 Will we afford our children the respect and consideration they deserve? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2009/11/bringing-neurodiversity-into-the-classroom/", "title": "Bringing Neurodiversity into the Classroom"},

Just select \u201cRun for Autism - Organization for Autism Research\u201d from the charity dropdown menu and create your footprint. Be sure to save the jpeg image so you can share your footprint others, inviting them to log-on to create their own footprint and show their support OAR. \n The first 50,000 people to create their footprint will earn $1 donation to charity of their choice, including OAR. You don\u2019t have to be a  RUN FOR AUTISM  participant to make your mark on Chicago this fall; create your footprint today and spread the word. \n Now, I\u2019m not planning on joining the run for autism.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been to Chicago \u2013 twice.\u00a0 I\u2019ll go again, but spending $30 + (not including gas, food, or other expenses) to participate in an event just isn\u2019t in our budget.\u00a0 Especially when I\u2019m not 100% on-board with the organization.\u00a0 However, leaving a footprint sounded worthwhile. \n It\u2019s a little hokey, but it gives you the opportunity to choose from a variety of charities (including OAR, but not them exclusively) for a bank to donate money to, which seems like a good cause just about any way I look at it.\u00a0 If you\u2019re going to do this, you have to design your footprint by October 9 th ! \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chicagomarathon.com/footprint"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2009/09/run-for-autism/", "title": "Run for Autism"},
{"date": "September 16, 2009", "body": "\r\n I work in the basement where, despite its many inconveniences, the boys cannot color on or disturb my work-in-progress.\u00a0 Since the basement does not yet have a working telephone line, I rarely concern myself with phone calls when my husband is upstairs.\u00a0 This call was no different.\u00a0 The phone rang.\u00a0 I paid no attention.\u00a0 Mark answered the call, but it didn\u2019t seem to concern me or he\u2019d have called down the stairs for me to come up.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know my son had been lost and was found again.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know I needed to encircle him in my loving arms once more in order to regain my equilibrium.\u00a0 Blissfully unaware of the almost-disaster, I continued my work despite the Labor Day holiday. \n It\u2019s strange how that feeling of panic and worry can arise even after the danger is over.\u00a0 My boys are runners, meaning they don\u2019t like to be confined to a specific space and will run if given the opportunity.\u00a0 Willy was our most ingenious runner.\u00a0 When he was four years old, and my youngest was just an infant, he would \u201cescape\u201d out the sliding glass door that lead to the sidewalk and the parking lot outside our apartment.\u00a0 Being a problem solver, he would wait until I was feeding Ben to make his getaway.\u00a0 He never went far, but he went outside without supervision.\u00a0 In a diaper.\u00a0 In the winter.\u00a0 We tried everything we could think of and asked everyone we knew to try to keep the door closed.\u00a0 We tried various devices, including tape over the latch and a rod that held the door shut.\u00a0 Each and every time, Willy found a way around our attempts to keep him inside.\u00a0 Eventually, we broke our lease and bought a house, because the landlord would not put in a bolt lock to keep the door closed. \n The advantage of owning our own home was not that we could guarantee the boys didn\u2019t get out.\u00a0 It was that once the boys found a way out we were free to do whatever it took to shut the way as permanently as necessary.\u00a0 Our measures to ensure our children\u2019s safety would abuse the aesthetic sense of just about anyone, but aesthetics is very low on our priorities.\u00a0 For example, we have a big, beautiful bay window in our living room.\u00a0 One window is big and cannot be opened.\u00a0 On either side are two smaller windows (half the width, but the same height) that could be opened when we first moved in.\u00a0 The screens were fairly easy to pop out \u2013 just exert a little pressure.\u00a0 The locks on the windows were stiff and our children had trouble with things like buttons, so I didn\u2019t see it as a potential danger spot.\u00a0 Until, one day, while I was doing dishes, Alex opened the window, popped the screen out, and went outside to get a closer look at the cars.\u00a0 The ones that moved.\u00a0 On a very busy street.\u00a0 By standing in the middle of the road.\u00a0 It took him less than a minute to get from our safe, seemingly secure living room to the middle of the street.\u00a0 I heard the honking and took a peek.\u00a0 There was Alex, happy as he could be close to so many cars with their engines whirring, completely unaware of the danger.\u00a0 After a few attempted solutions, I nailed them shut from the outside.\u00a0 It\u2019s not pretty, but it works.\u00a0 The boys haven\u2019t gotten out that way again. \n They\u2019ve gotten out other ways, though.\u00a0 Through the garage, through the fence, and through a door someone left just a little unlatched.\u00a0 Most times we catch it pretty quick.\u00a0 But there have been times when we\u2019ve called the police for help.\u00a0 If they want to run and they get out, a minute out of sight can mean they\u2019re also out of hearing.\u00a0 It\u2019s always scary and there\u2019s always a period of panic, right under the surface, despite the necessary crisis management.\u00a0 Each time there\u2019s a voice inside me nobody can hear that\u2019s screaming and weeping. \n It\u2019d been quite a while since any of the boys had run, though.\u00a0 The last time was when we were at Willy and Ben\u2019s school (back when they went to the same school) and Alex had slipped away in the press of bodies and gone to the playground.\u00a0 Mark had the boys in the Early Childhood room, while I was filling out paper work.\u00a0 Mark was doing something with Ben when the door opened, shut, and Alex was gone.\u00a0 Within moments the school\u2019s staff was mobilized.\u00a0 People knew Alex, because he used to go to Roosevelt.\u00a0 I heard about it over the loud speaker and rushed back.\u00a0 It seemed like an hour, but was maybe twenty minutes, and he was spotted on the playground and brought to us by one of the therapists.\u00a0 That was about three years ago. \n Then, last week, it happened again.\u00a0 Not at our house.\u00a0 Not at school.\u00a0 Alex was outside in his respite therapist\u2019s fenced yard playing happily.\u00a0 His therapist was inside for the moment.\u00a0 Then, another adult came through the gate in the fence.\u00a0 With a big dog.\u00a0 Leaving the gate open.\u00a0 Alex, who is a bit skittish around dogs, went out through the gate to get away from the dog.\u00a0 The therapist spotted the lapse quickly.\u00a0 He went looking, using his cell phone to call the police.\u00a0 But the police had already found him.\u00a0 \u00a0A couple saw Alex and stopped him from crossing the street against the light.\u00a0 They tried to get Alex into their car, but Alex wouldn\u2019t go.\u00a0 They had no bad intentions, but Alex wouldn\u2019t get in their car.\u00a0 So, they called the police and the police car came and picked up Alex.\u00a0 Apparently he went with the police without a problem.\u00a0 This is good to know.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always worried that Alex, never responding to lessons about strangers, would go with anyone.\u00a0 I was wrong and am glad to be wrong.\u00a0 Safe with the police, they took Alex back to the therapist\u2019s house.\u00a0 It took all of ten minutes. \n Then, the therapist called us to tell us all about it.\u00a0 When I finally came upstairs and learned what had happened the same panic and worry flooded through me.\u00a0 I knew Alex was safe and was with his therapist.\u00a0 But the anxiety didn\u2019t go away until I could take Alex in my arms once more. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "November 20, 2009", "body": "\r\n Last year, starting late autumn and running to about mid-spring, Alex\u2019s frustration and aggression rose to unprecedented levels.\u00a0 Then, these challenging behaviors tapered off\u2014not going away completely, but subsiding to much more manageable levels.\u00a0 For a while, we assumed that it was due to pain.\u00a0 At that time, Alex was having difficulty with his teeth.\u00a0 At two different locations, Alex\u2019s adult tooth was growing in without pushing the baby tooth out.\u00a0 His behaviors began tapering off when the last adult tooth was removed. \n Now, however, I\u2019m not so sure.\u00a0 Once again it\u2019s autumn and Alex\u2019s aggression is on the rise.\u00a0 His behaviors are becoming most pronounced at school environment, which is consistent with the previous year.\u00a0 And, it is starting to carry over at home as well. \n Alex and Willy have a history of being responsive to seasonal changes in the past.\u00a0 When they were young and we were in the earliest stages of learning about autism, Willy would go through most of the summer getting three to five hours of sleep a day.\u00a0 Alex, on the other hand, would go through the same sleepless cycle in winter.\u00a0 Hyperactivity during the day was also a factor.\u00a0 Sensory overload was almost a cost.\u00a0 Anxiety and loss of appetite were also in evidence. \n Adding to the mystery, I\u2019ve also observed responsiveness on a shorter cycle in my children and myself.\u00a0 We respond to atmospheric changes.\u00a0 As a storm system moves in, I can feel the pressure squeezing my head.\u00a0 It\u2019s like a dull, slow tightening.\u00a0 My head is uncomfortable and my mood shifts in a way I find difficult to control.\u00a0 Alex gets grumpy and irritable when a storm moves in; though he hasn\u2019t articulated any particular sensory response to the change in weather, his behavior indicates he might feel something similar to what I experience.\u00a0 Ben responds more strongly when the weather system moves out, as does my mother.\u00a0 Willy and Mark seem unaffected. \n Seasonal affective disorder  indicates that a causal relationship between environmental stimulants and behavioral consequences can exist.\u00a0 According to the Mayo clinic, this phenomenon has three recognized subsets: \n Fall and winter seasonal affective disorder (winter depression) :  \n \n Depression \n Hopelessness \n Anxiety \n Loss of energy \n Social withdrawal \n Oversleeping \n Loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed \n Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates \n Weight gain \n Difficulty concentrating and processing information \n \n Spring and summer seasonal affective disorder (summer depression) : \n \n Anxiety \n Trouble sleeping (insomnia) \n Irritability \n Agitation \n Weight loss \n Poor appetite \n Increased sex drive \n \n Reverse seasonal affective disorder : \n \n Mania or hypomania \n Elevated mood \n Agitation \n Rapid thoughts & speech \n Increased social activity \n Hyperactivity \n Unbridled enthusiasm out of proportion to the situation \n \n Perhaps better understanding this pattern will help us better manage Alex\u2019s challenging behaviors and relieve the distress he is experiencing.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t seem like much to go on.\u00a0 There is no consensus regarding what causes these behavioral changes and while some therapies are proven, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyway to determine which is most likely to work. \u00a0It\u2019s a start. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/seasonal-affective-disorder/DS00195/DSECTION=symptoms"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2009/11/environmental-responsiveness/", "title": "Environmental Responsiveness"},

{"date": "October 1, 2009", "body": "\r\n Marc Sirkin, chief community officer at Autism Speaks, said : \n We believe that all perspectives are valid and need to be heard and respected. No one perspective can ever be the definitive voice of autism. \n I reluctantly agree, though I think it\u2019s sad.\u00a0 Once upon a time, it was common belief that people with dark skin are inferior to people with lighter skin.\u00a0 Even the labels we used reflected these beliefs.\u00a0 We called one black, the other white; we associated black with night, evil, and filthiness; and we associated white with day, good, and cleanliness.\u00a0 This belief is no longer considered socially acceptable by the majority of our society.\u00a0 Yet, some people still cling to this belief to varying degrees.\u00a0 Despite the lack of social acceptability, some people experience racism as a common, even daily occurrence. \n Someday the presumed inferiority of people with neurological differences will no longer be a socially acceptable.\u00a0 Some day saying society should eradicate neurodiversity from the face of the earth will be widely viewed as a call for genocide.\u00a0 And yet, when that day comes, some people will cling to this belief that neurological differences are marks of inferiority, that differences should be cleansed from people like so much filth. \n It\u2019s human nature to disagree.\u00a0 It\u2019s human nature to degrade.\u00a0 It\u2019s human nature to let prejudice, assumptions, and ignorance sway our thoughts and emotions.\u00a0 It\u2019s human nature to have to fight for the rights and worth of minority groups.\u00a0 As much as I believe in the potential for individual human beings to be genuinely good, noble people; I do not believe human beings, as a species, will ever get passed these fundamental flaws. \n Here and now, the inferiority of people with neurological differences is commonly accepted.\u00a0 After all, these traits are \u201cdisorders,\u201d so they are obviously inferior.\u00a0 Not everyone feels this way, of course, but most people need to be awakened to the possibility that the obvious is not the truth before they can make a conscious decision about what they believe.\u00a0 This awakening can and does happen.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen it in the eyes of people I\u2019ve talked to who have listened and understood.\u00a0 There\u2019s a visible transformation that plays out on their faces as they digest this new point of view. \u00a0Their faces reflect first confusion, then understanding, and openness to the possibility.\u00a0 Then, their eyes widen with a moment of inspired surprise.\u00a0 They see the faulty assumptions with new eyes and slough them off.\u00a0 It\u2019s a wondrous moment to watch this awakening transpire! \n But, I\u2019ve also seen cold, deaden eyes from people who closed their hearts and would not listen.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen them turn away in disinterest; I\u2019ve felt them turn on me in an all-out attack; and I\u2019ve watched them smirk in derision.\u00a0 Whatever their reasons may be, they are not open to the idea that someone with a label like \u201cautism\u201d or \u201cbi-polar disorder\u201d or \u201cADD\u201d is equal unto themselves.\u00a0 There\u2019s little we can do for them but keep sharing our message. \n To evoke the change that must occur before people with neurological differences are recognized as equals in society we must win the hearts and minds of as many as we can.\u00a0 We must do so, not through coercion, but through conviction.\u00a0 For each person whose heart burns with the cause of the neurodiversity movement there will be a different strategy and a different set of tasks. \u00a0No way is wrong and I do not presume to dictate anyone else\u2019s approach to sharing this ideal. \n My approach is three-fold.\u00a0 First, I want a better world for my children.\u00a0 My children are autistic, and if they face as adults the same world they face as children, they will spend their lives marginalized, ostracized, and victimized by the callous society which repeatedly fails to recognize their humanity.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want that for my children.\u00a0 I recognize that to truly transform this world one of the things I need to do is converse with those autistic adults who are also trying to change the world.\u00a0 These are those who can help me understand my children better and can help shape the messages I need to share to improve the world for my children. \n Second, I want to help all the traumatized, victimized parents, and  their  children, who are reinforcing the world as it is.\u00a0 This goal is much more difficult for me, but it is my conscious choice to pursue it. \n Once, a long while back, I came across a story about Alison and Ryan Davies.\u00a0 Ryan Davies was a little boy with autism, much like my own children.\u00a0 His mother, however, was nothing like me.\u00a0 She was traumatized by the experience of raising her autistic son.\u00a0 She was so traumatized that she did something I found unthinkable.\u00a0 She took her son to a bridge, held his hand, and jumped, pulling him down to his death.\u00a0 This was the first story of this nature that I had ever read and it is burned into my memory and my soul.\u00a0 It\u2019s a constant, aching brand on my psyche.\u00a0 It was the first story, but it hasn\u2019t been the last.\u00a0 One thing that makes this story so poignant for me is what came after.\u00a0 Alison Davies\u2019 sister actually  defended  the mother\u2019s actions, and described this premeditated murder as \u201can act of love.\u201d\u00a0 Even now those words make me sick to my stomach. \n The story broke my heart.\u00a0 More than that, it made me so very angry.\u00a0 Time and again, I would come across of a parent who took their autistic child\u2019s life and the anger would boil inside me.\u00a0 I condemned these parents whole-heartedly.\u00a0 It was so easy to be angry, so easy to condemn them.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t understand them and I refused to try. \n But the turmoil of these emotions got in the way of raising my own children.\u00a0 I had to let that anger go.\u00a0 I still mourn the loss of these precious children, but slowly I have developed a compassion for their parents as well.\u00a0 Being who I am, it is difficult to imagine someone who just didn\u2019t question the diagnoses and prognoses of the medical professionals.\u00a0 It is difficult to imagine the loss, the hopelessness, and the pain of these traumatized parents who couldn\u2019t fight the precepts society that doomed their children.\u00a0 I sought knowledge and I cling to a very peculiar hope because it is an integral part of who I am.\u00a0 Furthermore, I have loved and married a man who is marginalized by society, who is deemed to be of little worth, simply because he\u2019s not normal.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen how the  way  he is treated has done so much more harm than his neurological differences.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known people who have been dealt a bad hand \u2013 one that, should the precepts of society prevail, would have limited them to menial existences \u2013 yet they triumph over extraordinary circumstances.\u00a0 I know in my heart that my children are precious; and I know in my heart that the child and the autism are forever intertwined, but that the challenges posed by autism will only be a fraction of the challenges they face because of how the autism is perceived.\u00a0 For so long, I couldn\u2019t tolerate anyone who didn\u2019t have this understanding.\u00a0 I assumed that they  chose  to be traumatized, knowing full-well there were viable alternatives.\u00a0 For some that may be true.\u00a0 But for many the ideas society accepts are all they\u2019re really aware of, they cannot imagine another way to perceive their child.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the idea that society accepts is that children with autism are broken and we don\u2019t have any way to fix them.\u00a0 These parents desperately need another message, another voice.\u00a0 They need a voice that helps them break through the trauma.\u00a0 They need a voice that doesn\u2019t victimize them, but empowers them to help their child.\u00a0 My voice will be part of that larger voices that seeks to open their minds to the possibilities, instead of thrusting them down into the depths of despair. \n My third purpose is the belief that the best way to change hearts and minds is to bring this message into the mainstream.\u00a0 For many of the people I talk with in my community neurodiversity is a concept with which they are completely unfamiliar.\u00a0 Teachers, therapists, psychologists, and parents find the idea completely foreign, though not always completely unwelcome.\u00a0 Communicating primarily online creates this illusion that the idea of neurodiversity is wide-spread. \u00a0It certainly has an international following.\u00a0 But that isn\u2019t enough.\u00a0 As wonderful and the Autism Hub and the many bloggers who write about neurodiversity are, you only find them if you know to look and care enough to make the effort.\u00a0 And there are those who are getting this message into the mainstream, but it\u2019s still too few and too far between to have the kind of impact we need to enact the kind of change required. \n Bev of Asperger Square 8  said: \n Unless you are autistic, or your family member is, you probably don\u2019t spend much of your days reading and thinking about what it means. You take the sound bites, read an article or two, watch 60 Minutes or Larry King. Nothing wrong with that, it isn\u2019t your job to figure all this out. \n While I certainly understand what she\u2019s saying, I must disagree.\u00a0 There  is  something wrong with the majority of people remaining oblivious to all the damage being inflicted on neurologically diverse people by the \u201csqueaky wheel\u201d of those who want to eliminate them.\u00a0 There  is  something wrong with a society that will propagate the views of the powerful, while leaving the weaker minority with few means of communicating with the masses.\u00a0 By allowing it, these everyday people provide their implicit approval.\u00a0 By remaining ignorant of it, they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re doing so.\u00a0 It\u2019s not enough for people who have a connection to neurologically diverse people to care about what happens to them.\u00a0 This issue deserves everyone\u2019s attention, because it affects them whether they know it or not. \n The image of puzzle pieces \u2013 scattered and awry \u2013 is associated with autism.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never understood that.\u00a0 For me, the image I associate with autism, or at least my place in association with autism, is that of a bridge.\u00a0 This is not a bridge to be jumped off of, but a bridge between perceptions.\u00a0 I am the bridge between my family and society.\u00a0 I also want to be one of the bridges between society and neurodiversity.\u00a0 The change must happen.\u00a0 The societies in which neurodiversity is strongest are societies based on freedom.\u00a0 If the majority of the people in these societies truly knew, truly understood what is going on under their noses and being done in their names, they would not tolerate it. \u00a0I want to be one of the bridges from the understanding they have and to an understanding of the truth behind the sound bites in order to effect the change that we all need so desperately. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17878-poetic-autism-film-divides-campaigners.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/09/for-you.html"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2009/10/treading-the-muddy-waters-the-divided-communities-of-autism/", "title": "Treading the Muddy Waters: The Divided Communities of Autism"},

{"date": "September 20, 2009", "body": "\r\n Bev, of  Asperger Square 8 , has taken on an excellent project that has opened my mind to many new thoughts.\u00a0 It\u2019s called:  A Checklist of Neurotypical Privilege .\u00a0 While the entire document is worth reading (I highly recommend it) one piece stuck out and pricked me \u2013 mind, body and soul. \n 13. For a child of my neurotype, everyday teaching of the skills they will need to live in this society is called education or parenting\u2014not therapy, treatment, or intervention. \n The implication here is that for neurotypical children education is called education, but because neurodiverse students sometimes require different lessons, different teaching styles, and different techniques, their education is called therapy. \n I consciously try to foster my children\u2019s sense of worth and power.\u00a0 I try to build them up so that they and others can better recognize their potential.\u00a0 I do not, in any way, consider my children \u201cless\u201d because they are not neurotypical.\u00a0 And yet, I never consciously thought about the implications of the use of \u201ctherapy\u201d to describe our efforts to meet their educational needs.\u00a0 The specialists who assist us in designing strategies and \u201cinterventions\u201d to help my children learn are called therapists and they perform services that are funded as therapy.\u00a0 I never once questioned these labels.\u00a0 Now, after reading this document, thinking about it, and letting the issues it brings up fully penetrate my mind and my heart, I\u2019m amazed and chagrined that it never occurred to me.\u00a0 I\u2019d long lost my comfort with the use of \u201cintervention strategies,\u201d which is a common phrase that\u2019s applied to services intended to assist individuals with special needs.\u00a0 But therapy always seemed completely innocuous. \n When I think about the purposes of therapy, however, the point becomes clear.\u00a0 The reason my children require therapy is because they do not learn all the things they need to know in a neurotypical manner.\u00a0 Therefore, to teach them the things they need to know, we need to use different strategies, techniques, and behaviors to help induce learning.\u00a0 Learning is still the goal.\u00a0 So, whatever the means, teaching and educating are still the verbs. \n Comparatively, consider the teaching strategies sometimes used with at-risk youth.\u00a0 There are many, from charter schools to special programs, but they\u2019re not called therapy.\u00a0 These are children who often have neurotypical development, but face challenges not experienced by mainstream society.\u00a0 To educate them as we should, we need to find ways to compensate for those challenges and this requires changes in teaching techniques.\u00a0 In our language, we recognize that these differences and unfortunately we sometimes use language that denigrates the worth of the children, but we don\u2019t call it \u201ctherapy.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s reserved for students with disabilities. \n Just as kids who perform below average or have problems due to their experiences, children who perform above average get specialized educational programs as well.\u00a0 When I was a student, I attended classes that were labeled \u201cdifferentiated.\u201d\u00a0 More was expected from me and my fellow classmates than our regular peers.\u00a0 Specialized lessons were prepared for us and techniques were used to prevent the typical boredom children with above-average intelligence often experience in school.\u00a0 It was differentiated, but still education \u2013 not therapy. \n So, why do we use therapy to describe techniques used to teach students with special needs?\u00a0 One obvious answer is that it hasn\u2019t occurred to well-meaning people that the word might be offensive or inappropriate.\u00a0 This is not a reason to continue using it, but it does explain part of the problem.\u00a0 Like myself, there are others who have never considered the word might be controversial.\u00a0 If this were the only barrier, change would be relatively easy.\u00a0 Not genuinely easy, but more easy than it would otherwise be.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the only reason.\u00a0 There is one good reason I can think not to change the use of the word.\u00a0 Now, I caution you, it\u2019s not a  very  good reason, in that it\u2019s ethical or right.\u00a0 It\u2019s a good reason in that it benefits those the educational services are intended to benefit. \n Simply put, the reason to keep the \u201ctherapy\u201d label is funding.\u00a0 Specialized educational services are expensive.\u00a0 Funds are not readily available for these services.\u00a0 In many American schools, the only reason these services get the funding the need is because it is federal law that they be available.\u00a0 In many American schools, parents have to fight to get school officials to recognize that the services provided must be dictated by the needs of the child, not be the availability of resources.\u00a0 This is a legal right won in the courts.\u00a0 And it\u2019s still an issue.\u00a0 By changing the wording from \u201ctherapy\u201d to \u201cspecialized educational services\u201d one risks losing some of the oomph that \u201ctherapy\u201d has.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s accurate or not, whether it\u2019s ethical or not, whether it\u2019s true or not, \u201ctherapy\u201d has a more respectable reputation with hints of medical necessity that \u201cspecialized educational services\u201d lacks.\u00a0 It\u2019s all about shades of meaning here.\u00a0 The research behind therapy and that supports its use is better funded and better supported than the research behind specialized educational services.\u00a0 Programs for at-risk youth and for children with above average intellects are cut before students with disabilities, because the programs for students with disabilities have been propped up by law through the research that supports the benefits of therapy.\u00a0 By changing the wording, you change the meaning in the minds of some of those you communicate with (which, admittedly is part of the point) in such a way that it\u2019s detrimental to the programs being funded. \n Now, again, I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s a good thing that other programs are so easily cut from school budgets.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe that.\u00a0 I believe that all children, regardless of what their needs are, should get the educational services that fill those needs.\u00a0 Society\u2019s sense of the value of unique individuals has not progressed to that point yet.\u00a0 By pushing for the human rights implications of education over therapy, I perceive a risk in damaging the fundability of those education services.\u00a0 Ideally, the human rights implications would take priority.\u00a0 They should.\u00a0 But, the reality is that these services are often necessary.\u00a0 I\u2019m reluctant to advocate anything that would endanger their availability. \n Which is not to suggest Bev\u2019s  document  does any such thing.\u00a0 I believe the purpose of the document was to open our minds.\u00a0 If that\u2019s true, then it certainly worked for me. \n ", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "October 7, 2009", "body": "\r\n The concept of neurodiversity is very complex and it\u2019s something no one has (or, in my opinion, should have) a corner on.\u00a0 My personal view is that neurodiversity is for everyone.\u00a0 While some people have a greater need for their neurology to be respected and appreciated \u2013 because their basic human rights are taken away when their neurology is  not  respected \u2013 everyone deserves respect and acceptance for their uniqueness.\u00a0 That\u2019s my long-term goal. \n There are more pressing short-term goals.\u00a0 In this respect, neurodiversity refers to a civil rights movement intended to urge or force society to acknowledge, protect, and respect the human rights of people society considers disabled due to mental disorders or mental illnesses.\u00a0 Yet, inherent in that description, there are three labels to which I object. \n Are neurologically atypical people \u201cdisabled?\u201d\u00a0 The answer is \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d depending on how you define the term.\u00a0 I have children who are recognized by the federal, state, and local governments to be disabled.\u00a0 This definition means they are not able to function adequately in society without modifications or accommodations and that this state of being is not likely to go away.\u00a0 This does not mean they are \u201cunable.\u201d\u00a0 They can function in society and they can function more successfully with modifications and accommodations.\u00a0 Nor does this mean that they were  disabled , which is a key point for me. \n The reason I\u2019m not comfortable with the words \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cdisability\u201d is because the shared root of these words is not something I believe to be in evidence.\u00a0 The root word is \u201cdisable.\u201d\u00a0 A  dictionary  definition of disable is: \n 1. to  make  unable or unfit; weaken or destroy the capability of; cripple; incapacitate:  He was disabled by blindness. \n 2. to  make  legally incapable; disqualify. \n ( emphasis added ) \n With these definitions in mind, the question then becomes:\u00a0 \u201cIf neurologically atypical people are disabled, what disabled them?\u201d\u00a0 As a society, we use language that assumes that people with neurological differences were at one point able, but something was done to them to make them unable, thus they are disabled.\u00a0 We assume this.\u00a0 We seek causes for this.\u00a0 We do  NOT  know that something disabled neurologically atypical people, but because they are different we assume something must have made them different and that it is bad for them to be different. \n My \u201cthem\u201ds and \u201cwe\u201ds are kind of screwed up and backwards in that last paragraph.\u00a0 First, I don\u2019t assume there are \u201ccauses.\u201d\u00a0 People are people, and we are all different from each other.\u00a0 That some are more different than others doesn\u2019t surprise me, and I\u2019m not really sure I understand why some people think that\u2019s such a big, scary deal.\u00a0 Second, while I am not autistic and I am (probably) not an aspie, I am also not neurotypical.\u00a0 I have sensory processing issues that are mostly managed, but are sometimes debilitating.\u00a0 I have been diagnosed with both depression and with obsessive-compulsive disorder.\u00a0 In order to make eye-contact, I must consciously force myself to do so \u2013 and I still don\u2019t get why eye-contact is important.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even know I didn\u2019t make eye-contact until the therapists tried to teach me how to encourage my children to make eye-contact (which, as you might imagine, doesn\u2019t work so well).\u00a0 If I\u2019m in a room with more than ten people, I need to consciously manage my reactions, because my fight-or-flight response kicks in \u2013 I feel threatened, even if there\u2019s no danger.\u00a0 If you crowd me in with too many people and too little space, then a panic attack is possible; if people are bumping and jostling me, a panic attack is likely.\u00a0 These are not neurotypical traits.\u00a0 But does that mean there\u2019s a cause or causes of my atypical traits?\u00a0 The way I see it, that\u2019s just part of who I am. \n My problem with \u201cmental disorders\u201d and \u201cmental illness\u201d stems from the same argument.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s take a look at the  dictionary  definition of disorder: \n 1. lack of order or  regular  arrangement; confusion:  Your room is in utter disorder .\u00a0 \n 2. an  irregularity :  a disorder in legal proceedings .\u00a0 \n 3.  breach  of order; disorderly conduct; public disturbance. \n 4. a  disturbance  in physical or mental health or functions; malady or dysfunction:  a mild stomach disorder . \n ( emphasis added ) \n The first, second, and third definitions assume for something to be ordered there is a  regular  standard to base the order by; therefore \u201corder\u201d is subject to the norm and anything that deviates from the \u201cnorm\u201d is disordered.\u00a0 The most applicable is the fourth definition.\u00a0 A mental disorder, such as autism supposedly is, is a  disturbance  in mental health or functions; it\u2019s a malady.\u00a0 Or, so society assumes. \n A  dictionary  definition of illness is: \n 1.  unhealthy  condition; poor health; indisposition; sickness. \n ( emphasis added ) \n And the  dictionary  definition of unhealthy is: \n 1. not in a state of  good  or  normal  health;

The study into the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among adults shows that one in every hundred adults living in households has the condition - broadly the same rate as that cited for children. \n The implications of this research are, in my opinion, nothing short of profound in their implications of the politics of autism.\u00a0 Further relevance is revealed in these findings: \n \n \n While 1.0 per cent of the adult population had an autism spectrum disorder, the rate for men was higher (1.8 per cent) than for women (0.2 per cent). This was in line with studies among child populations which show higher rates amongst boys. \n People who were single were more likely to be assessed with an autism spectrum disorder than other marital statuses. \n Among men, prevalence of an autism spectrum disorder was lower among those with a degree level qualification than among those with no qualifications. \n Men renting their home from a social landlord were more likely than those living in other types of housing to have an autism spectrum disorder. \n Adults with an autism spectrum disorder were no more likely to be using services for those with mental or emotional problems than the rest of the adult general population. \n \n \n If I ever doubted we needed to take a serious look at how we, both in the US and internationally, approach autism this offers a never-before-seen glimpse that shows very clearly that we do. \u00a0Misinformation and assumptions having us looking for causes and solutions to this false \u201cepidemic,\u201d when what we really should be doing (and should have been doing all along) is using our resources to find ways to solve problems people with autism face every day. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/164936.php"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2009/09/revealing-research/", "title": "Revealing Research"},

Some will go so far as to say that these \u201creal\u201d autistics cannot communicate at all. \n My son, Alex, is one of these \u201creal\u201d autistics.\u00a0 He does not speak, at least not in the sense that his vocalizations consistently and effectively communicate.\u00a0 However, that does not mean  he  does not communicate, though it does mean he can be difficult to understand. \n Yesterday, I was speaking with Ben\u2019s therapists who were playing with Ben in his room.\u00a0 We had plumbers over doing smelly things in order to bring our upstairs bathroom back to life \u2013 without the constant sluicing of our kitchen cupboards.\u00a0 So, to release the smelliness we had the windows propped open.\u00a0 One of the things I used to prop open a window was a box (100+) of crayons that were upstairs as part of Ben\u2019s therapy supplies.\u00a0 Alex saw the box of crayons and wanted them.\u00a0 Alex  loves  to color and he goes through crayons rather quickly and removes the paper and breaks them into smaller pieces for his own, unknown reasons.\u00a0 So, Ben has his own crayons that haven\u2019t been Alex-ified.\u00a0 And now Alex wanted them.\u00a0 After all, he hadn\u2019t had new crayons in two whole weeks. \n I told Alex I had other crayons for him and these were Ben\u2019s.\u00a0 Alex accepted that answer and we both went downstairs, and I went all the way to the basement to get a little work done. \n A few minutes later, Mark came down with our merry little catch phrase: \u201cJust in case you didn\u2019t know, our kids are weird.\u201d\u00a0 This is not said to be derogatory.\u00a0 It\u2019s just one of the things we say to capture the chaos that is our lives.\u00a0 It could just as easily be me saying, \u201cJust in case you didn\u2019t know, my brain is weird,\u201d with me then launching into one of the strange places my thought patterns had taken me this time.\u00a0 So, Mark came down to describe an oddity to me. \n This time it involved Alex, who regularly leads people to things he wants in order to communicate.\u00a0 Alex took Mark by the hand and led him to the living room (which happens to be by the stairs that lead up to Ben\u2019s room).\u00a0 Then, Alex pulled Mark across to the other side of the house to get a piece of paper off the pile in the den.\u00a0 Then, he pulled Mark back to the living room.\u00a0 Knowing nothing of the exchange Alex and I shared moments ago, Mark was understandably baffled. \n I knew exactly what Alex meant, however, so I handed Mark the box of new crayons I had tucked away for Alex.\u00a0 Then, Alex contentedly peeled, broke, and colored away for most of the evening. \n It certainly would have been easier if Alex could have said, \u201cDad, Mom said I could have new crayons and I would like them now, please.\u201d\u00a0 But Alex cannot say that.\u00a0 That does not, however, mean he cannot  communicate  it.\u00a0 The key to communication is not what you say, it\u2019s what the person you\u2019re trying to communicate with hears or observes.\u00a0 Because Alex communicates in a way that is difficult for others to \u201chear,\u201d we often need interpreters to understand him.\u00a0 In this case I was the interpreter, but other times I\u2019m the one who needs the interpreter.\u00a0 Someday, when he\u2019s ready, Alex will try to communicate with a bigger audience.\u00a0 Hopefully there will be people willing to \u201clisten\u201d no matter how he is tries to communicate. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/09/for-you.html", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/seinfeld_springsteen_concert.php"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2009/09/bev-and-bruce-say-it-well/", "title": "Bev and Bruce Say It Well"},

thus, there is either no communication or faulty communication coming from the autistic people.\u00a0 Those who have studied communication, however, know that communication is a difficult process.\u00a0 Even \u201cnormal\u201d people rarely communicate effectively.\u00a0 What I say, you may hear, but you\u2019re likely to interpret it differently than what I mean \u2013 if you\u2019re listening at all.\u00a0 Truly effective communication is rare.\u00a0 People hear, but they don\u2019t listen; people read, but they don\u2019t seek to understand.\u00a0 We talk, but that doesn\u2019t mean we communicate. \n When an autistic person is trying to communicate, this problem may be exacerbated by the different ways some autistic people use to communicate.\u00a0 For example, Willy is heard more often than Alex, because he communicates in a way that neurotypical people are familiar with; whereas, Alex communicates in a way that is all his own, and most people have no experience listening to him and assume he\u2019s not communicating anything. \n In this sense, it is true that some autistics do not communicate effectively.\u00a0 In order to effectively communicate, the hearer has to listen and try to understand.\u00a0 That does not mean it\u2019s true to say that autistics do not express themselves or their emotions. \u00a0Whether they use words or not autistics do express themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 Some use a set of verbal and body languages very different from our own.\u00a0 Others learn the set of verbal and body languages we use daily, but it is as if these means of communication are foreign to them, like French or Spanish is foreign to a native English speaker.\u00a0 Even if they become fluent in the ways we communicate it will still be more challenging for many autistics to communicate unless we learn their verbal and body language as well.\u00a0 Communication is a two-way street, and we shouldn\u2019t expect them to do all the work. \n * * * \n A while back my brother came to visit.\u00a0 He can rarely afford to make such a trip, so it\u2019s always something of a shock when he\u2019s here (for him, not us).\u00a0 He loves his nephews dearly and tries very hard to communicate with them, but it requires a period of adjustment, especially with Alex.\u00a0 Willy is verbal and very physical and adores his Uncle Pat to no end.\u00a0 It requires very little work for them to re-establish their connection.\u00a0 Benjamin Patrick, my brother\u2019s namesake, loves to be lifted high and tossed around.\u00a0 That and an unconscious sense of trust (that\u2019s doled out selectively, but uncanny wisdom) is enough for Ben to build a bond with someone.\u00a0 Alex is more puzzling for most people.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that he adores his Uncle Pat any less, or that he doesn\u2019t appreciate the physical play that my brother is so good at, but Alex communicates in a way uniquely his own.\u00a0 Understanding Alex can be difficult even for those of us with a lot of practice.\u00a0 For someone without that practice, sometimes it\u2019s simply impossible; often an interpreter is necessary.\u00a0 Alex is also more wary than his brothers.\u00a0 He likes to stay back and observe before he joins in any action.\u00a0 He\u2019s also adapts more slowly to major changes, but handles minor ones more easily.\u00a0 So, when my brother came Alex held back at the first.\u00a0 But once Alex regained his sense of equilibrium while having Patrick in the mix he was able to interact with Uncle Pat as well as he can, but it still was difficult for Patrick to understand him.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t that Alex didn\u2019t express his love or his enthusiasm in having Uncle Pat around, but that it was more challenging for Patrick to understand him.\u00a0 Patrick knew this, accepted it, and did the best he could to understand.\u00a0 Most people don\u2019t bother. \n In order to connect with people socially, communication is required.\u00a0 In order to have communication, there needs to be an expression, a \u201clistening\u201d period, and comprehension.\u00a0 To say autistics do not express love or that they do not try to make connections with others is wrong.\u00a0 The expression is there, but may come in different forms than most of us are familiar with.\u00a0 The questions becomes:\u00a0 \u201cAre you listening?\u00a0 If you are, are you trying to understand?\u201d\u00a0 From what I\u2019ve seen, the answer is often no.\u00a0 We hear, but we do not listen.\u00a0 We talk, but we do not communicate.\u00a0 When communication fails, we blame others because they didn\u2019t  speak  to us.\u00a0 Most of us don\u2019t stop to ask, \u201cDid I listen?\u201d \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2009/08/making-the-connection/", "title": "Making the Connection"},
{"date": "August 27, 2009", "body": "\r\n According to  Dictionary.com , advocacy is the act of pleading for, supporting, or recommending; an  advocate  is an intercessor who pleads on the behalf of another or a cause.\u00a0 Advocates have worked hard to reshape the way societies view disadvantaged minority groups.\u00a0 Individuals within those groups have also stood up to fight for themselves and their right to be treated with respect and dignity as human beings.\u00a0 Individuals with developmental disabilities are no different.\u00a0 Except, for them, we\u2019ve had to coin a new word before we could accept the validity their actions. \n Thus, the concept of self-advocacy was born.\u00a0  Self-advocacy  is a civil rights movement that advocates for the right of people with developmental disabilities to speak for themselves on their own behalf.\u00a0 For typically developing people, the act of self-advocacy would simply be called standing up for their rights or self-defense.\u00a0 Yet, society feels we need another word or phrase to describe this same behavior in individuals with developmental disabilities.\u00a0 Our society still clings to the belief that people we label as developmentally disabled cannot decide how to live for themselves, and we find it rather remarkable when they try to do so. \n As much as this need for a separate term offends me, I have a responsibility to teach my children to advocate for themselves and for each other.\u00a0 Growing up, I knew I could rely on my brother in this capacity.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have the need for advocacy my children have, but my brother stuck up for me and defended me when I lacked the power to do so for myself.\u00a0 He saw value in me that I often couldn\u2019t find in myself, but I learned to stick up for myself by watching him.\u00a0 I want my children to have the same close relationship and the same desire to stand with each other.\u00a0 I want my children to grow into strong individuals who will stand up for themselves and the people and causes that matter to them.\u00a0 I want them all to be advocates and self-advocates. \n How do you teach children who struggle to socialize to grow and wield their influence on behalf of their own interests and the causes they believe in?\u00a0 As I\u2019ve learned with my stepson, this is a difficult thing to instill in young minds even when communication is relatively easy.\u00a0 My stepson Brandon faces many challenges uniquely his own.\u00a0 Many people in his life either refuse or are unable to see his potential.\u00a0 He struggles to believe in himself and his abilities.\u00a0 He\u2019s starting to understand that he has a right to stand up for himself, for what he believes, and what he can do.\u00a0 At the tender age of twelve, he risks seeing many doors close to him if he doesn\u2019t stand up to those who would hold him down.\u00a0 His father and I, and others who believe in his potential, can help.\u00a0 But, in the end, he must believe in himself, speak for himself, and act on his own behalf.\u00a0 This is a regular part of growing up. \n The same will be true for my other children, Willy, Alex and Ben.\u00a0 They will face even greater challenges, because more people will see them as limited with little or no potential to grow and develop, to do and be.\u00a0 Now they are still young enough that my husband and I can shelter them from most of the doubters.\u00a0 Alex and Ben are mostly unaware that there are those who would limit their potential.\u00a0 Willy is becoming aware of this, though, as he gets older and interacts more fully with his peers.\u00a0 Many of his fellow students have grown up with him since pre-school.\u00a0 They accept Willy, but they also regard him as less capable than themselves, even in areas where he excels. \n I attended one of Willy\u2019s field trips to one of this city\u2019s many parks.\u00a0 When they were playing on the playground equipment, Willy wanted to climb up the biggest slide with the rest of his playmates.\u00a0 One of his classmates said, \u201cNo, no Willy.\u00a0 This slide is too big for you.\u00a0 You might get hurt.\u201d\u00a0 The child meant well, but he was wrong.\u00a0 This activity was no more dangerous for Willy than it was for the other children.\u00a0 Willy struggles with the intricacies of language and socialization and processes sensory stimuli different than his peers.\u00a0\u00a0 Willy excels as an athlete, but struggles with sportsmanship.\u00a0 So, I took the child aside and talked to him.\u00a0 The idea that Willy, who struggled with things he and their other classmates did so well, could play their game and climb the big slide just like them was novel to him.\u00a0 \u201cBut he might fall.\u201d\u00a0 I nodded.\u00a0 \u201cHe might.\u00a0 But you might fall, too.\u00a0 Any of you might fall.\u00a0 Willy is autistic, which means he can\u2019t do some things as well as you do.\u00a0 But he can do this.\u201d\u00a0 So, we watched as Willy climbed up the big slide.\u00a0 His foot slipped once, but he made it to the top.\u00a0 There was a new look in his friend\u2019s eyes as he watched Willy slide down \u2013 a look of wonder and pride, but also incredulity. \n Though he speaks, Willy still has a hard time getting others to listen when he tries to stick up for himself.\u00a0 However, he\u2019s learning to advocate for his little brothers.\u00a0 Neither Alex nor Ben have an effective means of communication with those outside their circle.\u00a0 Willy often acts as their intercessor.\u00a0 \u201cMy brother won\u2019t ask for it, because he doesn\u2019t talk, but he wants a drink.\u201d\u00a0 Or, \u201cYou can\u2019t make fun of him.\u00a0 It\u2019s not nice.\u00a0 He can\u2019t help it if he can\u2019t talk.\u201d\u00a0 Brandon, too, is learning to stick up for his younger brothers.\u00a0 Still, self-advocacy eludes us.\u00a0 Perhaps it will come in time.\u00a0 But, perhaps, you must learn to stick up for others and appreciate them for all their differences, before you can truly stick up for yourself. \n ", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "November 1, 2010", "body": "\r\n After a few distractions, I\u2019m back to the issue of bullying.\u00a0 I started with  a description of bullying , where I attempted to distinguish between bullying, harassment and abuse.\u00a0 Then, I discussed  boys  bullying and  girls  bullying.\u00a0 I left off with a  thought for bullies , because it is my experience that many bullies are victims themselves. \n Now, I would like to explore some of the other reasons for bullying. \n Two Basic Reasons \n There are two basic reasons children engage in bullying behavior: (1) to buoy the self-esteem of the bully, and (2) to sink the self-esteem of the victim.\u00a0 These are two different, distinct motives. \n Victims of bullying and abuse often need to boost their self-esteem.\u00a0 There are many ways people attempt to do this.\u00a0 One way, as I mentioned earlier, is to engage in bullying.\u00a0 Those surrounding this individual\u2014parents, teachers, other supportive adults, and their own peers\u2014can help this person find productive ways to build self-esteem, and thus eliminate the need to bully.\u00a0 It\u2019s not always easy, especially when the abusive situations that trigger the need cannot be resolved, but it\u2019s worth the effort. \n Not all bullies are like that, though.\u00a0 Not all bullies are needy children stuck in an unendurable situation they don\u2019t know how to deal with.\u00a0  Some kids bully for fun .\u00a0 These people bully not to boost their own self-esteem, but because they like to witness the effects on others\u2019 self-esteem. \n In my lay opinion, I consider this behavior pathological.\u00a0 Perhaps there is already a psychological diagnosis for this kind of behavior, but I suspect our society is too enamored and forgiving regarding bullying for this to be the case.\u00a0 Disabilities and disorders, after all, are determined on the basis of what society considers normal or acceptable.\u00a0 If being  morally challenged  isn\u2019t pathological, why would bullying be so? \n America Loves Bullies \n The increase in bullying (or, perhaps, the increase in our attention on bullying) has been called \u201cepidemic.\u201d\u00a0 And part of that epidemic is that bullying is an acceptable pastime in our culture.\u00a0 \n I would say most kids are good kids.\u00a0 But not all kids are good.\u00a0 Some kids are bad.\u00a0 Kids who take pleasure in other peoples\u2019 pain and suffering and inflict pain and suffering for the sake of their own fun are not good kids.\u00a0 (If this behavior is pathological, however, that \u201cbadness\u201d can be addressed and remedied, much like the bad behavior of addicts can be addressed by addressing their addiction.) \n And yet we not only tolerate this behavior, there are forces in our culture that actually encourage it.\u00a0 Bullying is celebrated in television, in movies, in music, in advertisements, in books and short stories and even in news articles.\u00a0 Bullying pervades our culture.\u00a0 Adults, kids, corporations, public organizations, and even non-profit organizations and civil rights movements engage in bullying because it  works .\u00a0 Not only does it work\u2014meaning that bullying can help you achieve the results you want\u2014but for those willing to take pleasure in other people\u2019s suffering, it feels good.\u00a0 It makes you feel powerful.\u00a0 And that feeling is honest, if not true.\u00a0 (You are exercising power, but the power wasn\u2019t rightfully yours.) \n So, What Can We Do? \n For bullies that use this behavior as a coping mechanism, the \u201csolution\u201d is to discover why and to stop it, if possible, while providing the child with other coping mechanisms.\u00a0 It\u2019s not easy, but it is rather straightforward. \n For bullies that use this behavior because they enjoy it or because they perceive bullying as the cultural norm, the \u201csolution\u201d is neither easy nor simple.\u00a0 Assuming that we\u2019re not going to get these kids in therapy any time soon, we can only do so much.\u00a0 We can attempt to change the culture.\u00a0 And that = HARD and LONG-TERM COMMITMENT.\u00a0 There are those who have been making that effort and investing their time.\u00a0 I applaud them, especially  Bullying Stories .\u00a0 The recent emphasis in the news is also a good thing, or it could be if less attention was paid to why the victims were bullied (i.e., the implication that bullying = homophobia) and more attention was paid to the fact that the problem isn\u2019t new and that people with many kinds of differences are the victims of bullies. \n We also have to be vigilant .\u00a0 As parents (of the bully or the victim) and as \u201cthe village\u201d (i.e., the bystanders), we have to notice bullying and we have to take steps to stop it.\u00a0 We have to assert that these behaviors are not acceptable.\u00a0 We have to acknowledge that bullying is not a rite of passage.\u00a0 We have to allow our minds to acknowledge that bullying, harassment and abuse are different and that none of these behaviors are acceptable. \n Next, to \u201cprove\u201d that bullying is not a rite of passage, as some claim, I will demonstrate that bullying continues on into the adult world.\u00a0 And, as much as I appreciate  Joel Burns  willingness to speak out, I have to say, sometimes it doesn\u2019t get better as you get older.\u00a0 Sometimes it gets worse \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2010/10/oh-my.html", "http://bullyinglte.wordpress.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2010/10/r-word-revisited.html", "http://bullyinglte.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/joel-burns-speaks-of-bullying-at-city-council-meeting/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/11/bullying-part-5-why-do-children-bully/", "title": "Bullying (Part 5): Why Do Children Bully?"},

\n Yesterday (Saturday, April 30 th ), my husband had some friends over to do some role-playing.\u00a0 This is something they try to do every weekend.\u00a0 Like a guy\u2019s night in, instead of a guy\u2019s night out.\u00a0 So this, in and of itself, was nothing extraordinary.\u00a0 One of the guys is a long-time family friend.\u00a0 He was at our wedding.\u00a0 Our kids are good friends; they\u2019ve grown up together.\u00a0 His wife has been a therapist for our children.\u00a0 They\u2019ve babysat.\u00a0 Or, to be brief, he knows what he\u2019s getting into when he comes over.\u00a0 The other two are newer.\u00a0 They\u2019re both a bit odd (for me, that\u2019s a compliment), but they\u2019re odd in ways that are not our ways (which is just fine with me).\u00a0 And so, again to be brief, they still really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting into when they come over to our house, but they\u2019re willing to risk it. \n We usually have a bit of preparation for these nights.\u00a0 We know the day is coming.\u00a0 We build up to it.\u00a0 It\u2019s usually on Fridays.\u00a0 And, well, this time we really didn\u2019t and it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 Or, to be brief, it was not an ideal situation. \n Mark\u2019s sleep-cycle was wonky and the kids were a bit wild.\u00a0 Usually, this would be a problem.\u00a0 For your random individual (or group), this would be a problem.\u00a0 Surprisingly, this time, it was all okay.\u00a0 It worked.\u00a0 The night was a success.\u00a0 (The gaming was not so much, but that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother thing for a whole \u2018nother blog, which I\u2019m not going to write, but hey\u2014role-playing can be tough.\u00a0 It is, after all, storytelling, but with free will.) \n This is not to say there weren\u2019t problems.\u00a0 Mark fell asleep twice during the night.\u00a0 The boys\u2019 had issues that needed to be dealt with, including Willy not wanting to play anymore, including Ben trying to push a chair down the stairs, including Alex pinching our guests.\u00a0 And, well, a complete list isn\u2019t the point.\u00a0 There were issues. \n But they weren\u2019t a problem. \n Novel, I know, but it\u2019s true.\u00a0 The boys\u2019 needs were discussed, as they often are around people who haven\u2019t known them long enough to be fully versed, but they weren\u2019t an \u201cissue.\u201d\u00a0 Everyone just sort of went with the flow and it worked.\u00a0 When explanations were necessary, they were given, they were accepted, and we moved on. \n It wasn\u2019t:\u00a0 WOW!\u00a0 YOU PEOPLE ARE WEIRD!\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t even:\u00a0 MY FAMILY IS DIFFERENT AND THAT\u2019S OKAY.\u00a0 It just was. \n And, for me, that\u2019s success.\u00a0 Explanation.\u00a0 Acceptance.\u00a0 Move on. \n Maybe it\u2019s lack of imagination, but I really don\u2019t envision a time where everyone just understands.\u00a0 I communicate with a lot of people with a lot of different kinds of differences, from disability-related differences to faith-based differences, cultural, racial, life-style\u2026and on and on.\u00a0 I try hard, but I don\u2019t just understand.\u00a0 I need things explained to me.\u00a0 I need the stories.\u00a0 I need the shared-experiences.\u00a0 I need those moments of insight.\u00a0 And I expect that I always will.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s just me, either. \n The thing of it is, I do believe there will come a time when everyone\u2014or at least the majority of people\u2014will be  open  to having things explained, to listening to others\u2019 stories, to sharing experiences, to moments of insight.\u00a0 I think that will happen. \n And it\u2019s going to look a bit like last night did.\u00a0 An easy, comfortable exchange; welcome to my life, beware of the pinching; yes, we have alarms on our doors, because our children will go out to look at the cars\u2026the ones that are moving.\u00a0 This is our life.\u00a0 We\u2019re open to sharing it.\u00a0 But it\u2019s so nice when our differences are not a big deal.\u00a0 They just are. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/badd11"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/05/badd-2011-a-glimpse-of-success/", "title": "BADD 2011:  A Glimpse of Success"},
{"date": "June 4, 2011", "body": "\r\n Next week is my last class in my  Reading & Writing the Short Story  course.  During the last several weeks, I have been writing a literary short story using a different methodology than I usually use.  Instead of thinking the project through first, and then writing it, I was asked to write a little at a time and let the project develop without a plan and without a whole lot of forethought.  It was an interesting experience to say the least. \n The end result was flawed.  I haven\u2019t even figured out how much work will be involved in order to turn the project around.  But the flaws themselves provided a remarkable amount of clarity. \n Autism was a major feature of this short story.  Typically, I write speculative fiction, and autism or autistic characters creep into my stories even there.  But this piece was supposed to be written in the literary style, and thus I wrote a story about something a bit more mundane.  I remembered a writing teacher once telling me that people don\u2019t write stories about \u201chousewives,\u201d because they never do anything worth telling.  So, as per my contrarian nature, I wrote a story about a housewife\u2014particularly the mother of two children with autism who is also almost autistic herself. \n The clarity came, not from the story itself, but from the various reactions to my story.  My readers\u2014those individuals who are part of my life and who read most of my work\u2014found the story compelling, clear, and approachable.  My classmates\u2014individuals who are not immersed in the world of autism\u2014found the story compelling, but not as clear or approachable as they would have liked.  The difference, of course, is how familiar the reader is with autism. \n Thus the flaws.  As a writer, I cannot rely on my readers being familiar with my subject matter, especially when the \u201cpoint\u201d is to show a different perspective concerning the subject matter.  Which is not to say that this story is an advocacy piece.  Nor did I intend it to be.  But, in a way, of course, it is.  In a way, everything I write about autism is an advocacy piece, because most of the dialogue on autism is still so\u2026wrong.  But, whether an advocacy piece or just a story, the point is to communicate to the reader on behalf of the characters, and relying on a shared perspective doesn\u2019t do that. \n Sometimes I forget how much I have changed, how much my perspective has changed, how much the way I see the world has changed, since I fell into the world of autism.

I also devoted a post to thoughts for the  bullies , who may be victims of abuse and bullying themselves.\u00a0 Finally, I asked  why  children bully before I moved onto bullying in the  adult world . \u00a0I touched on bullying people who are  perceived as different  and  what we can do  about it.\u00a0 I also discussed  power , its  misuse , and  status . \n Through these posts, I hope I established that bullying, as well as the attitudes and beliefs that make it possible, pervade our culture.\u00a0 While some nations, like the U.S., seem to embrace bullying more readily, we are not alone in our dependence on bullying to support our social structure. \n As autism is a state of being that pervades how the individual thinks and interacts, bullying is a state of doing that pervades how human society thinks and interacts.\u00a0 While autism is reviled against, because this state of being doesn\u2019t fit social norms, bullying is embraced, because these behaviors do fit social norms. \n When autism is treated as a developmental disorder, we are told that \u201cnormal\u201d people are socially competent and that autistic people are socially incompetent.\u00a0 But \u201cnormal\u201d social competence often relies on insincerity, bullying, and manipulation.\u00a0 Social insincerity, bullying and manipulation are accepted social norms\u2014however, they are also destructive tools used to force power dynamics between individuals, groups, organizations, and nations. \n Not so long ago, bullying made the news in the U.S., because the victims of bullies were dying.\u00a0 Leaders\u2014politicians, celebrities, parents, teachers, social rights groups, and bloggers\u2014called for the bullying to stop.\u00a0 While I agree with the message, it seems hollow upon further reflection.\u00a0 The U.S. is a nation that has a well-earned reputation as a bully in the international community.\u00a0 American businesses and politic groups thrive on bullying.\u00a0 Even our social rights groups use bullying tactics to make their points.\u00a0 Bullying may not be all we do, but we do it extensively.\u00a0 We rely on it.\u00a0 And\u2026we teach it to our kids as an effective means to get our way. \n This is normal.\u00a0 This is social competence.\u00a0 This is the way for things to be.\u00a0 This is what we rely on at the individual, group, and national level to make our social systems work.\u00a0 And, yet, it is autistics we call dysfunctional. \n Bullying isn\u2019t something we have to tolerate.\u00a0 We do not have to sit back and let these behaviors grow more accepted.\u00a0 We do not have to accept this social norm. \n But in order to fight bullying, we have to see it for what it is.\u00a0 Bullying behaviors are not \u201cboys being boys.\u201d\u00a0 It is not simply a natural behavior engaged in by the immature, and it certainly isn\u2019t something our children outgrow.\u00a0 Bullying is a learned behavior, a social tool used to enforce social structures.\u00a0 It is pervasive.\u00a0 \n To fight it, we have to fight the attitudes and beliefs that make it possible.\u00a0 We have to fight these attitudes and beliefs where they live and thrive.\u00a0 We have to fight them in ourselves, in our groups, and in our governments.\u00a0 We have to fight them in our homes, our schools, and our places of work.\u00a0 We have to fight them in our systems\u2014educational systems, health care systems, economic systems, and government systems.\u00a0 We have to fight these attitudes and beliefs amongst our friends and our families. \n Bullying may be normal, but it is not good, it is not right, and it is not acceptable.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t have to accept it.\u00a0 We do have a choice.\u00a0 And I choose not to bully.\u00a0 I choose to teach my children not to bully.\u00a0 I choose to encourage others not to bully.\u00a0 There are other tools that can be used\u2014tools that respect the rights and personhood of others.\u00a0 I choose those tools.\u00a0 I choose to teach the use of those tools to my children. \n And, if only in a small way, I will make the world a better place by doing so. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/12/bullying-part-13-final-entry/", "title": "Bullying (Part 13): Final Entry"},

{"date": "January 3, 2011", "body": "\r\n There are a few in the autism community that thoroughly investigate any studies they find interesting.\u00a0 I\u2019m not one of those.\u00a0 But once in a while I do find a study that strikes a chord with me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t latch onto that study as gospel truth, but I do reflect on it once found. \n One such study relates to  visual skills . \n Children with autism may lack certain visual skills needed to be independent in adulthood, new study findings suggest. \n For example, they might find it harder than other adults to find shoes in the bedroom or apples in the supermarket, according to researchers at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom. \n The study authors asked 20 children with autism and 20 typical children to press buttons to find a hidden target among multiple illuminated locations in a room. One side of the room had more targets than the other side. \n The children with autism took longer to recognize patterns in the test structure that would help them choose where to search for the targets. The findings suggest that the ability to search for objects in a large-scale environment is less efficient and less systematic in children with autism compared to typical children, the researchers pointed out in a university news release. \n Personally, I\u2019m a little skeptical that the findings (concerning finding hidden targets in multiple illuminated locations) can be generalized to finding shoes or apples, or that the delays in these skills identified in autistic children necessitates a similar lacking in autistic adults.\u00a0 However, it does strike a chord with me. \n One responsibility that seems to be primarily mine in my household of men is keeping track of things and finding them once they go missing.\u00a0 To me, it\u2019s always seemed to be a skill of thoroughness.\u00a0 You put things back into their place, and when they\u2019re not there you look  everywhere  until you find it.\u00a0 But, perhaps, there\u2019s more to it than that. \n Perhaps I am able to identify things in a manner that my husband and children cannot.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s a perceptual ability or a skill, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I mean, if you literally cannot see what you\u2019re looking for\u2014and by see, I mean differentiate the object you\u2019re looking for among the clutter\u2014, then how can you find it?\u00a0 But, perhaps it is a skill.\u00a0 Perhaps it is one of those skills that neurotypical individuals (and some neurodiverse individuals like myself) pick up more or less naturally to the extent that they don\u2019t know how to teach it to those who do not acquire the skill in a similar manner. \n It\u2019s worth some thought.\u00a0 Perhaps if I spent less time being annoyed that I am expected to know where everything is  even after they\u2019ve moved them  and more time helping them develop this skill of minding and finding that I take somewhat for granted, then perhaps we would all be better off.\u00a0 \n On the other hand, from what I\u2019ve heard from other mothers (and not just mothers of autistic kids), this seems to be a common complaint among women.\u00a0 Perhaps it\u2019s a male/female thing.\u00a0 I mean, if the study didn\u2019t account for the imbalance between boys and girls with diagnoses of autism, but had a balance between boys and girls in their typical peer group, then perhaps the difference they recorded could be less about typical/autistic development and more about male/female development. \n So, what do you think?\u00a0 Is it a skill or an ability?\u00a0 Is it related to autism or something else? \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=123907"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/01/mommy-minder-mommy-finder/", "title": "Mommy Minder, Mommy Finder"},

The key there, of course, is the  positive  support. \n Part of that is being surrounded and accepted by a lot of great people.  But that alone isn\u2019t enough.  In my experience, you have to teach people how to help you.  Because the help people want differs from person to person, from family to family, from need to need. \n There are a lot of people who are great about offering their assistance and their support.  This is great!  But, the thing of it is, this often comes in the form of \u201cThe Golden Rule.\u201d  They offer the assistance and support they think they\u2019d want if they were in your shoes.  Usually, they\u2019re not in your shoes.  And they are most certainly not you. \n But here\u2019s another interpretation of \u201cThe Golden Rule.\u201d  Instead of offering  what  they think they\u2019d want, they can offer  the respect  they\u2019d want, which translates into giving (to the extent that they are willing and able) you what you want, which is what they\u2019d really want you to do. \n This brings us to another problem.  They don\u2019t know what you want.  They don\u2019t know what help you need.  They don\u2019t know what would work for you.  So, you\u2019ve got to tell them!  This works best if you take the pressure off.  Don\u2019t make it: DO THIS, DON\u2019T DO THAT!  Start a conversation.  \u201cI know you\u2019d really like to help, and I could sure use it, so why don\u2019t we talk about some things I can use some help with and we\u2019ll see if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to do.\u201d \n Of course, this assumes you know what you need.  There are times when you don\u2019t.  But start the conversation anyway.  Exchange ideas.  Find what works for the both of you.  If they really want to help, they\u2019ll work with you on finding helpful ways to help. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/09/the-thing-about-help/", "title": "The Thing About Help"},

{"date": "August 7, 2011", "body": "\r\n As parents, especially parents of children with autism, we need support from others to get through the big and little crises of our lives. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Actually getting that support, however, can be a challenge. \n For some, the problem seems to be an unwillingness to ask. For others, the problem seems to be a lack of sources for support. There are many sources for support available, but accessing any of them requires effort. Whether it\u2019s asking for help from those in your support system or building the support system that will meet your needs, it\u2019s not easy. But that doesn\u2019t make it impossible. \n The first thing we need to do is to change the way we look at support. Communities exist to provide support. There\u2019s no shame in accessing that support. Whether the potential source is personal or societal, ask for the support you need. While there are exceptions, usually you won\u2019t get it unless you ask. \n The second thing we need to do is find out what is available. Resources will differ depending on the community in which you life and the support system you have built. Ask around. There may be established programs that provide assistance you\u2019re unaware of. A good place to start is your local First Call program (if such a program exists) or your local disabilities office. Teachers, social workers, and volunteers may also have leads on possible sources of support. Again, they may not realize you need to know unless you ask. Don\u2019t assume programs that provide the support you need don\u2019t already exist simply because nobody has mentioned them. Ask. \n The third thing we need to do is build on what we already have. You have family, friends, co-workers, neighbors. Reach through them to reach out to others. You do this by letting people know what you need and asking them if they know anyone who might be able to help. In professional circles, this is called networking, but the benefits of networking are not limited to professional circles. You might be surprised at what you find. Churches, clubs, and other organizations are often excellent resources. They might not have established programs that meet your needs, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not willing to pitch in however they can. \n The last thing we need to consider is building the programs we need. Government organizations should not be our only, or even our primary, recourse for changing the levels of support available. Most programs start with charitable organizations. They\u2019re started by people with passion. If you can be that person with passion, you can probably find a charitable organization to help you help yourself and others. Creating a program from scratch isn\u2019t easy. Planning, fund raising, and program implementation are time-consuming. When you\u2019re already stretched so thin you need to ask for help and build a program from scratch, it may seem an insurmountable responsibility. But this is how things start.

{"date": "March 5, 2011", "body": "\r\n Previously, I have published to short synopses\u2014in blog post style\u2014of chapters for the non-fiction book I\u2019m working on,  Neurodiversity at Work: A Manager\u2019s Guide .\u00a0 First, I wrote a post introducing the  neurodiverse workforce , and then I addressed the need to cope with the challenges of inclusion, and the possibility to  capitalize  on a diverse workforce.\u00a0 Here I will explore the rhetoric of business in contrast with the language of inclusion. \n The Rhetoric of Business \n One of the hallmark linguistic requirements of the contemporary business environment is the use of politically correct language.\u00a0 The emphasis on an externally set linguistic standard betrays a vital fact that most seem quite unaware of, namely that respect is not dictated from the outside in. \n Personally, I find that if you genuinely respect people, then respectful language will naturally flow through your use.\u00a0 If, on the other hand, you are inclined to devalue people, then an externally enforced linguistic standard only seeks to cover up that disrespect.\u00a0 While the purpose of politically correct language is to express tolerance, the reality is that an externally enforced standard does not breed tolerance, merely compliance. \n By following the strictures of politically correct speech and further by attempting to enforce a distant, fa\u00e7ade of respect through public and employee relations programs, business cultures convince themselves they practice tolerance.\u00a0 And yet the problems of internalized prejudice continue.\u00a0 In gender, race, and disability relations, equality is not attained despite our legislation and the enforcement of politically correct language.\u00a0 The language used in businesses becomes empty rhetoric that is not played out in the culture of the business or in the everyday choices where prejudice holds its greatest power. \n The Language of Inclusion \n The language we choose to use can influence the way we think about the world and the way we perceive each other.\u00a0 Choice is a significant factor, however.\u00a0 Underlying the choices we make is the respects we hold.\u00a0 I often refer to my children as children with autism, autistic children, autistic or even, though I try not to,  Silly Willy .\u00a0 According to political correctness, this is wrong; yet my regard for my children does not change.\u00a0 Recently, Dave Hingsburger of  Rolling Around in My Head  wrote a post about the  language we use .\u00a0 There are some words and phrases that are truly offensive.\u00a0 However, most terms can be used with respect.\u00a0 Disability is not an ugly word, nor is it an ugly state of being.\u00a0 It is only ugly when we have no respect for those who are disabled. \n The language of inclusion is less about the words we choose and more about what we mean when they use them.\u00a0 If you think an autistic person is worthless, it does not matter that you use people-first language. \u00a0You can call autistics \u201cpeople with autism\u201d all you like, but if \u201cautism\u201d means \u201cinferior\u201d to you, then everything else you say and do is going to communicate your prejudice loudly and clearly no matter how politically correct you are. \n The Transition \n The language of inclusion is not about political correctness or the fa\u00e7ade of tolerance.\u00a0 It\u2019s about genuine respect.\u00a0 You can\u2019t fake it.\u00a0 But you can shape it by making new choices for new reasons.\u00a0 It can be shaped within a culture by people who use words with respect.\u00a0 In order to make this transition, you need to incorporate respect into the culture of your business.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just about the words you use, but the ideas and beliefs you express.\u00a0 This respect must come from a force within that organization, and it must be disseminated throughout the organization.\u00a0 Respect diverse workers.\u00a0 Respect diverse partners, suppliers, and customers.\u00a0 Respect the diverse world we live in.\u00a0 Inclusive language will naturally follow. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2011/02/statement-of-fact.html"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/03/inclusion-vs-rhetoric/", "title": "Inclusion vs. Rhetoric"},

{"date": "September 5, 2012", "body": "\r\n So, what would the ideal IEP meeting look like for you?  Would you get everything you asked for?  Everything you wanted?  Or would the team collaborate\u2014discussing your child\u2019s needs and how the school could help meet those needs\u2014to determine what was best for your child? \n How about both? \n To be fair, this meeting was simply to revise Willy\u2019s IEP to address the needs raised by his new diagnosis of epilepsy.  We did not revisit goals at this time.  We simply discussed his new needs and how to accommodate those needs.  Even so, it went surprisingly well! \n Lately, I\u2019ve been working with a co-author on a book about special education.  I have also been editing his book on IEP collaboration.  I\u2019ve learned a lot working with him, and I\u2019m confident I have taught him a lot as well.  It\u2019s a very fruitful, effective partnership (though, not in the traditional, legal, business sense of the word). \n I brought that knowledge to bear as I prepared for this IEP.  I even brought along two advocates\u2014one especially familiar with Willy and one especially familiar with epilepsy.  I was prepared to negotiate.  I was prepared to advocate for my son\u2019s needs. \n And I did\u2014no negotiation needed.  I was simply \u201cgiven the floor.\u201d  I explained what has happened over the summer, what I knew Willy needed, what I suspected would be beneficial, and that\u2019s what was the team agreed to do.  There was a lot of discussion, but it was collaborative and productive and focused entirely on Willy\u2019s needs\u2014including the training the staff would need to meet Willy\u2019s needs. \n The meeting went beautifully! \n Afterwards, I thought a great deal about how that happened.  The \u201ctraining\u201d I\u2019d received by working with my co-author had certainly enhanced my advocacy skills\u2014and I\u2019m going to provide him with a quote for his book to that effect.  But, as much as my modesty would like to give him all the credit, I also have to acknowledge that there was a lot of solid groundwork that made this possible. \n You see, when I go into an IEP meeting, my focus is on my children.  This means that I don\u2019t always get what I want or even what I think is right.  Instead, I work with the trained professionals to get (to the best of our ability) what my children need.  Some battles are longer than others\u2014and feel very much like battles\u2014such as the years it took to convince school staff (in thought, word, and deed) that neither Alex nor Ben were/are intellectually disabled.  (Again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being intellectually disabled, aka retarded; but there is something wrong with assuming that a child who cannot talk is intellectually disabled and there is also something wrong with providing inappropriate services because of such an assumption.)  Some battles aren\u2019t battles at all, like graduating Willy from a one-on-one aide to a team-teaching environment.  The point is, if you start with your child\u2019s needs, then discuss how to meet those needs, and finally ensure that the services provided satisfy those needs, well, sometimes you don\u2019t like what you get, even when you get exactly what your child needs. \n I didn\u2019t like the idea of Ben switching schools in the middle of his elementary school education.  But, as the year starts and I\u2019ve had a chance to meet with his new teacher and help prepare everyone involved for the transition, I\u2019m confident it\u2019s the right choice for Ben.  Ben\u2019s needs will be better met at the new school and that\u2019s all that matters. \n When you go into an IEP meeting with that attitude, when you work with staff to achieve those ends, then you build a reputation in the school district and you build a relationship with the school staff.  When you provide useful input and make reasonable recommendations\u2014versus asserting your opinions as facts and making unattainable demands\u2014you build a foundation of trust.  You respect the professionalism of those on your child\u2019s team and you show your own \u201cprofessionalism\u201d as a parent and as an advocate for your child. \n That groundwork made this ideal IEP possible.  The case manager trusted me to provide useable information to the IEP team and to make reasonable recommendations.  In this case, they had more questions than answers, and my answers (and the answers provided by the advocates I brought to assist in providing answers) were respected and trusted.  That trust empowered them to accept all the recommendations we proposed and to propose recommendations of their own that would completely accommodate the needs we identified.  We worked together, collaboratively, with Willy\u2019s needs in mind. \n In a few months, when his baseline is re-established with a new, comprehensive three-year evaluation and we sit down for a full-blown IEP meeting, things might change.  By then, we\u2019ll know more about how Willy\u2019s epilepsy effects his education.  But, for now, we\u2019ve done all we can and we\u2019re confident Willy\u2019s going to have a great year! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/09/the-ideal-iep-meeting/", "title": "The Ideal IEP Meeting"},

{"date": "January 4, 2013", "body": "\r\n The development of a worldview and a belief system is one of the most important of our lives.  This usually occurs from some default process\u2014an accumulation of what we learn at home, at school, among our family and friends, and from the entertainment we consume\u2014and influences our decisions for the rest of our lives.  Once our worldviews and belief systems are formed, they tend to be difficult to change.  When we live our lives in conflict with our beliefs, we experience internal dissonance that causes stress and we\u2019re not always consciously aware of why this is happening. \n My worldview and belief system, rather my priorities as they are formed by my worldview and belief system, look something like this: \n Ethics \nFamily \nGod \nSchool \nWork \nExtended Family \nFriends \nCareer \nHousehold Management \n\u2026 \nSelf \n I do not put this forth as something that is \u201ccorrect,\u201d but (with minor fluctuations based on urgency) this is how I prioritize my life.  The dot-dot-dot represents minor things that, while not essentially priorities, tend to be considered before I think of myself and my own needs.  Self-care is something I rate, as per my worldview and belief system, as a rather low priority. \n I\u2019ve resisted the wise and reasonable counsel that has warned me\u2014for years\u2014that this series of priorities doesn\u2019t work.  I\u2019ve talked about it with family and friends.  I\u2019ve read the testimony of my fellow parents of children with special needs who have posted about their own struggles with self-care.  I\u2019ve read about it in countless books, from nonfiction to fiction.  In short, I\u2019m far from the only who has been taught to regard self-care as an act of selfishness and to regard selfishness as an undesirable trait.  I\u2019m also far from the only one who has figured out that regarding self-care in that way doesn\u2019t really work. \n On the one hand, there\u2019s that old saying, \u201cIf Momma ain\u2019t happy, then ain\u2019t nobody happy.\u201d  Despite the deplorable grammar, the saying rings true.  As a caregiver, our moods and emotions impact (either positively or negatively) those we take care of.  Of course, the same could be said of either parent, regardless of their role (caregiver/financial provider/both), and could be said of those who are being taken care of, too.  In a family, the moods and emotions of each individual family member affects the family unit as a whole.  Therefore, if the goal is to provide one\u2019s family with a happy, stable, healthy home environment, then it is important to meet the needs of every member of the family. \n However, this brings us back to the difficulty of changing someone\u2019s worldview and belief system, even when that someone is yourself.  While it\u2019s easier to change one\u2019s own worldview and belief system than it is to force someone else to change theirs, it can still be an immense struggle to change what you believe, even when you have a reason not to believe it any longer. \n For me, it has to do with the holistic nature of the way my mind works.  Learning something that throws my ideas out of balance\u2014that proves that something I\u2019ve held as true isn\u2019t true after all\u2014creates a need to have a true replacement  that fits with everything else  before I can have a stable whole once again.  Something as fundamental as the essential nature of my priorities is intertwined with just about everything else I know and think.  In order to reassess and reassert my priorities, I need a whole philosophy that incorporates the new information. \n I\u2019m still working on that.

Embracing the Chaos of Autism  is the working title of this speech.  The premise of the speech is to use stories to teach others the importance of individual-focused treatments, with empowerment and development (versus cure and normalcy) as the goals of those treatments. \n Basically, as a society we\u2019ve focused a lot on principles\u2014principles of parenting, principles of education, principles of self-development\u2014which suggest that a universal approach or structure works (or should work) for everyone.  In raising my three children with autism, I have had to set aside most of these principles.  Instead, I focus on my child, his needs, and the strategies and techniques that work for him\u2014each of them require a different, individual focus. \n My goal is not to get my child to a point where those \u201cuniversal\u201d principles can become successful.  Instead, my goal is to empower my child\u2014as he is, for who is he\u2014to reach his unique, individual potential. \n This individual focus seems so simple, and yet the difference is remarkable.

Though it\u2019s rarely an issue now (admittedly, we had some echoing of it early this summer), once upon a time I regularly got between three to five hours of sleep, and that\u2019s it.  (When I included that in a fiction story, my professor circled it as a potential \u201cfactual error.\u201d)  At that time, five hours was the most Willy would sleep at a time (and if he napped, his brothers were almost always awake, so I still couldn\u2019t sleep).  At that time, my husband was working, and he was depressed, so he could rarely help me get more sleep.  In fact, those crazy-making months were one of the major reasons I started building a better support network. \n One of the strangest things about this is that my body learned (my mind happens to disagree, but that\u2019s another matter entirely) that it could function on three to five hours of sleep.  When the need arises (as it occasionally does, even now) my body will revert back to that time-frame, over my mind\u2019s strenuous objections. \n You see, as I said, my mind disagrees with how much sleep is required.  For mind to function\u2014which, btw, is necessary for a professional writer, go figure\u2014I need at least six (preferably seven) hours of sleep.  So those times when my body kicks into sleep-dep mode, my mind is deprived of sufficient rest to do its tasks, even while my body can keep up (more or less) with the boys and the chores. \n Another detrimental effect of all of this is the lack of a regular sleep pattern.  I cycle between day and night, sleeping when I can and working when I can\u2019t.  I\u2019ve tried melatonin, sleeping pills, and herbal remedies, but I can\u2019t seem to regulate my sleep cycle for more than a week at a time. \n This makes scheduling certain things rather difficult.  I can\u2019t really plan ahead and know I\u2019ll be awake and ready to go.  BUT that\u2019s also where the 3 to 5 hours of sleep and the sleep cycle irregularities kick in.  If I have something scheduled and need to be up, even if I have not succeeded on getting myself on a schedule that makes it seem right, I can usually make the temporary switch. \n Predictably is the key, however, to getting certain things done, and it\u2019s the key I lack.  For instance, when I first wrote this post I slept Friday night to Saturday morning like a \u201cnormal\u201d person.  I got a good amount of sleep and was asleep at night and awake during the day.  Then, I pushed myself a little late to spend some quality time with my mom, and Mark had a sleepless night, and so I went to bed at 1 a.m. Sunday morning, slept for two hours, and woke up and stayed up, because I couldn\u2019t get back to sleep.  I didn\u2019t make it a full day.  When Mark was ready to be up, I went back to sleep, and got back on the \u201cnight shift.\u201d  ***I, unintentionally sabotaged my mom\u2019s sleep Friday night, so I wouldn\u2019t blame her in the least for the \u201coops\u201d in my sleep.  Besides, it was my choice.*** \n The funny thing is, after my two hour nap, I was productive.  I got some household work done, some writing work done, some miscellaneous work done, and I was okay.  I was effective.  So, basically, my body and brain are semi-erratic and rather unpredictable.  But it works!  Sounds kind of like my life raising children with autism. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/08/the-elusiveness-of-sleep/", "title": "The Elusiveness of Sleep"},

He\u2019d watch me stir the noodles, drain them, and sauce them. \n He wouldn\u2019t eat them.  He wouldn\u2019t touch them.  If I offered him noodles, he\u2019d run away giggling.  Occasionally he\u2019d gag.  Despite his interest in their preparation, I figured noodles and Alex were a lost cause. \n Then, a few days ago, a guest in our house made himself some noodles.

{"date": "October 17, 2012", "body": "\r\n As the mother of three children with special needs, I kill more than my fair of trees.  Not by choice, mind you, but by necessity.  In the United States, having children involves a lot of paperwork.  When those children have special needs, then that paperwork seems to quadruple. \n Along with the paperwork comes the need to navigate bureaucracy.  I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that I get tired of it.  There\u2019re only so many ridiculous forms you can ask me to sign before I lose my patience, and then my temper. \n It\u2019s pretty early in the school year, but I\u2019ve already hit my mark.  For those with a different experience, the first day of school in my area involves a long, snake-like line of paperwork.  Some of it is electronic, but that does little to make it more bearable.  In this long line, one of the last things was an off-hand request for updated vaccination information. \n It had been a difficult summer and I didn\u2019t know if Alex\u2019s vaccinations were up to date.  While there are those autism parents who are adamantly against vaccinations, I\u2019m not one of them\u2014I recognize that even though Willy regressed around the time of his vaccinations (18 months), he was clearly autistic before then, had we only known what to look for. \n So, it\u2019s not that I was against vaccinations; it was simply that I didn\u2019t have time to take care of them nor was I sure that he was not up to date.  Either way, it could wait until his check-up. \n Nobody mentioned a deadline. \n I heard nothing more about it until I received a letter from the school.  Because I don\u2019t open my mail immediately (with a few exceptions), the letter went into a pile.  When I got to it, I read the request and saw that I wouldn\u2019t be able to fit another appointment into my schedule, and didn\u2019t think much more about it. \n On the request was a waiver I could fill out.  For religious reasons or for medical reasons\u2014and I think there were one or two others\u2014I could refuse to give my child the shots.  All I had to do was sign.  Except, I didn\u2019t refuse.  I just didn\u2019t have time at the moment.  So, I didn\u2019t sign the waiver. \n The week went by and I didn\u2019t think anything about it.  Until my husband got the call, that is.  He had to wake me up, because I\u2019d only gotten two hours of sleep the night before, and I had to get out of bed, get dressed, and get Alex from school.  He wasn\u2019t allowed to be there.  If he were to stay, I would have to sign paperwork that wasn\u2019t true.  I hadn\u2019t even verified that Alex hadn\u2019t gotten his shots last year (since they\u2019re usually done by age, not grade, and Alex is behind a year). \n So, after a minor fuss, I took Alex home.  Once the need for them was verified and the proper paperwork was signed, he was fine to go to school.  Today he got his shots and the electronic paper trail can take over. \n And that\u2019s the thing that gets me.  This paperwork has absolutely nothing to do with improved immunity or what-not.  With so many exemptions, how was Alex and his non-vaccinated self a danger to anyone?  There\u2019s no current outbreak to protect him and others from.  This was  NOT  urgent.  Yet, Alex missed a day of school because our bureaucratic ducks weren\u2019t in a perfect row and that\u2019s just absurd. \n And that sums up my \u201clove\u201d of bureaucracy:  Rules are created that must make some sort of sense on paper when you\u2019re the legislator on high, but make no actual, practical, real-world sense when you\u2019re funneled through a system that is more concerned with paperwork than the original issue the paperwork is designed to address. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/10/for-love-of-bureaucracy/", "title": "For Love of Bureaucracy"},
{"date": "October 19, 2012", "body": "\r\n Last Saturday, Mark, Willy, and I attended a wedding.  The bride was one of Willy\u2019s first therapists and the only therapist from that time that is still in his life.  (Because I don\u2019t share names without express permission she will be known as \u201cthe bride\u201d for the sake of this post.) \n The bride has been a big part of Willy\u2019s life for over half his life, so I wasn\u2019t too surprised when we received an invitation to her wedding.  Along with the invitation, we received a handwritten note that said that though the invitation requested a \u201ckids-free\u201d wedding and reception, Willy was a special exception.  Willy was the only child invited to the wedding and the reception.  That was something of a surprise. \n When I sent the RSVP card back, I\u2019d selected from the dinner choices available for the three of us.  Then, the bride sent a message via Facebook, offering to request the caterers prepare a special meal for Willy, which I readily accepted.  (I don\u2019t think I mentioned it at the time, but Willy had been near tears when we told him he wouldn\u2019t be able to order a hamburger and he grinned when he found out that, as it turned out, a plain hamburger on a bun without seeds would be provided for him.  He also got a bowl full of sliced apples and sliced green peppers, instead of a salad, which he gobbled up as fast as he could stuff the pieces in his mouth.)  So, once again, Willy was a special exception, and all things considered it was a very good idea.  I was very touched that the bride was so thoughtful and accommodating, even though I\u2019m sure she had her hands full with all the different pieces that go into pulling off a wedding. \n Willy was excited and he was determined to make a good appearance.  So, I took Willy to the store to pick out an appropriate outfit.  I wanted to make sure he was dressed appropriately for a wedding, especially considering the bride has a knack for style.  Willy, on the other hand, had a mind to be \u201ccool\u201d for the wedding.  We compromised.  I guided him to the appropriate dress clothes and he picked out a colorful dress shirt (bright blue), a sports coat (dark blue), and dress slacks (also dark blue, because I insisted).  He also picked out a hat.  I\u2019m not much up on hats, but I think it\u2019s called a \u201cbowler\u201d hat.  Anyway, it has a brim that goes all the way around and is rather like the ones you see in old detective/mobster movies, except this one had a band that had bright blue zigzags on it (because I made him put back the one that had a band with skulls and skateboards on it).  I also used this as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to convince Willy to get a new pair of shoes (he went up a size and a half!), which he\u2019d been resisting for months.  (I also bought myself a new dress and calf-high boots, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m a \u201cgirl\u201d and into clothes a little bit more than I should be, even if I\u2019m not nearly as good at it as some of my peers.  Besides, I checked and I didn\u2019t have anything to wear to a wedding.) \n All decked out in his new duds, Willy made a striking addition to the celebrants.  I was a bit surprised when the bride\u2019s mother welcomed us so profusely when we arrived, but then I\u2019m not quite as social as the mother-of-the-bride role calls for.  Let\u2019s just say, when it came to my own wedding I \u201cfought\u201d to keep the party as small as possible, while my mother and my mother-in-law-to-be kept adding to the guest list and still didn\u2019t invite as many as they\u2019d have liked. \n During the ceremony, the father-of-the-bride gave a speech, kind of like a sermon about the couple who were being joined in holy matrimony.  Once again, I was surprised.  In this speech about the formative years of the bride and the groom, about their coming together, and about their future together, Willy was mentioned as a key milestone in the bride\u2019s life.  I was floored and Willy was astounded (and slightly disruptive.  \u201cHe just said my name!\u201d).  Then again, when the minister asked, \u201cWho gives this bride?\u201d Willy raised his hand and tried to stand up.  (This was Willy\u2019s first wedding, after all.) \n I knew that Willy and the bride had had a profound impact on each other\u2019s lives.  This lovely young woman has seen our family at some of our most difficult moments and she\u2019s still here.  She\u2019s coaxed Willy through some of life\u2019s major milestones.  With her help, Willy regained the use of his words and became the remarkable, capable, and functional young man that he now is.  She came into Willy\u2019s life because it was her job, but became a friend that Willy will carry with him for the rest of his life because she is the remarkable, wonderful, compassionate, and loving young woman that she is. \n I knew this.  I really did!  But, I guess, until her wedding I didn\u2019t realize quite how mutual this impact has been. \n The groom was someone we had not met before\u2014by \u201cwe\u201d I mean Mark and me.  So, during the pre-reception drinks and appetizers, I was once again surprised when the mother-of-the-groom realized who Willy was, and thus who we were.  (I\u2019m used to being recognized by people I don\u2019t remember, but that\u2019s just because I\u2019m bad at remembering faces and names; it\u2019s usually people we\u2019ve met before.)  I was even more surprised by her reaction.  She asked us to wait where we were while she tracked down the photographer, saying she knew the couple would want a picture of us. \n This was their special day, but in a way it was Willy\u2019s special day, too.  The bride made time to spend with Willy on her very special day.  She made sure Willy had a meal that he would find appetizing\u2014and he enjoyed it very much.  We stayed a little longer than we intended, because the bride wanted a dance with Willy\u2014and we weren\u2019t going to miss that.  (She even pulled me onto the dance floor, which is how I realized that I am way out of practice when it comes to maneuvering in heels!) \n Willy was mentioned in toasts, his picture was in the slide show, and it just became abundantly clear that Willy was a minor star in their major event.  And I can say he needed the boost to his esteem.  He\u2019s had a rough time lately.  At one point, even before the toasts and the slide show, Willy was so touched by all this attention, he said, in a rather surprised voice, \u201cI guess [the bride] really does care about me!\u201d  Her response?  \u201cDuh!\u201d  Classic! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/10/a-special-wedding-guest/", "title": "A Special Wedding Guest"},

{"date": "October 12, 2012", "body": "\r\n I have this quirk, though I\u2019m not sure how much this particular quirk is shared by others.  I live most of my life in my own head.  I\u2019m surrounded by stimulation.  Most of it is mundane and easy to navigate, so I can go about my business on auto-pilot.  Inside, however, there\u2019s a narrative going on that is quite removed from what my external body is experiencing.  It\u2019s like an advanced form of daydreaming, and I have been told that it goes along quite well with my life as a writer.  I have heard other kinds of artists share similar experiences. \n Maintaining a semblance of outward normalcy while keeping this inner narrative inside is a skill I learned in school.  Teachers repeat things.  I would guess that over two thirds of my class time (before college) was \u201cwasted\u201d with repeated information.  I realize that most people learn better this way.  But, for me, repeating information orally doesn\u2019t really work.  Either I got it the first time or I won\u2019t get it at all.  Repeating it\u2014unless I didn\u2019t actually hear it\u2014doesn\u2019t increase the chances of my consuming the information.  So all this repetition left me bored \n To alleviate that boredom my brain entertained itself, which it was inclined to do anyway.  I learned that if I maintained the appearance of paying attention, then I\u2019d be left to ignore the repetitions.  If I slipped\u2014smiling at something that amused me while the teacher was being serious, for example\u2014then I would be called upon to participate.  Blah.  I must admit, however, that I didn\u2019t really perfect this technique until the eighth grade\u2014and the memory of  that  incident still makes me smile.  Just in case anyone is under the impression that I don\u2019t have a mischievous side. \n I\u2019m quite familiar with my own inner narrative, and I\u2019ve adapted this skill so that I can continue my narrative while living out my rather mundane (relative to that narrative) existence. \n Here\u2019s the thing:  I have three children and I know two of them are \u201clike me\u201d in this regard, except that neither of them has yet learned to internalize this narrative.  Both Willy and Ben are as I was when I was little\u2014sharing their inner narrative orally with anyone who will listen, whether the timing is appropriate or not.  So much so that they have trouble turning it off.  I can relate\u2014I still have trouble turning it off, especially when I\u2019m trying to fall asleep. \n Then, there\u2019s Alex.  Alex is my dear boy, my conundrum.  While I\u2019m not fond of the puzzle piece as a symbol of autism, Alex is the child of mine that gives the most credence to its validity.  Nobody really \u201cgets\u201d Alex.  It\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t made connections with him.  But there\u2019s a part of Alex\u2014a big part\u2014that continues to be out of our reach.  Without the communication component in place to a greater degree than it is, Alex cannot share his inner narrative with us.  And, because words are something of a \u201cforeign language\u201d to Alex, I\u2019m not even sure  talking  would empower him to share that narrative\u2014his narrative may very well be experienced in a totally different form. \n I think about Alex and puzzle pieces.  It seems to me that Alex has a \u201clanguage\u201d all his own and that to communicate with us requires translation.  He struggles to translate for us and we struggle to translate for ourselves.  But it\u2019s more than just the language, it\u2019s like he has a culture all his own, too.  And this is rather easy to explain:  We consume language and culture by absorbing what is around us, and it shapes and influences who we become.  I\u2019m not an American because I was born an American; I\u2019m an American because I\u2019ve lived my entire life as an American.  But Alex doesn\u2019t absorb language and culture the same way, so he hasn\u2019t been shaped and influenced the same way. \n The question, then, is how do we bridge the gap?  How do we learn to communicate with him, to share who we are with him, and to help him share who he is with us?  How do we help him to his internal narrative? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/10/the-inner-narrative/", "title": "The Inner Narrative"},

Every hour I spend on my book takes away time I can write to support my family.   So, I\u2019m raising money to offset the difference. \n But that\u2019s just my immediate motivation.  There\u2019s a whole \u2018nother dimension to this fundraising business that I want to talk about. \n In my community, we have a big fancy library that is full of books and movies and CDs and CD-ROMs and books on tape and all sorts of good stuff.  Nothing wrong with that!  But, when the boys were first diagnosed with autism, there was very little \u201cgood\u201d stuff on autism in that library.  Last time I checked, there\u2019s still not.  It\u2019s not that they didn\u2019t have any books on autism, but they were all skewed away from anything remotely pro-neurodiversity.  I typed \u201cneurodiversity\u201d into the computerized card catalog and it just laughed at me.  Actually, it tried to redirect me to something that didn\u2019t even start with \u201cneuro.\u201d  If I remember correctly, it was \u201cnecromancy.\u201d  Sound like fun? \n Sometime after that, it was Autism Awareness Month and the boys\u2019 school had set out a selection of books about autism that were available through the Family Resource Center.  Jenny McCarthy\u2019s latest book (I didn\u2019t bother to look at the title) was prominently displayed.  Nothing remotely pro-neurodiversity was available. \n I\u2019ve looked at various collections available in my community since then.  I\u2019ve read some books that I found intolerable, others that I found misguided, still others that I\u2019ve found merely unhelpful.  All the books that I have found useful and appropriately respectful of the subject matter have been books I\u2019ve had to buy for myself. \n So, here\u2019s my plan:  I\u2019m going to donate copies of my books to as many of the places I looked for loaners as I possibly can.  I\u2019m going to assume the full cost of donating in my own community, but I\u2019m asking for your help donating books to other communities.  I\u2019m targeting public libraries, Family Resource Centers (both in the community and in the schools), and any similar lending library families use to learn about autism.  It\u2019ll take time for me to hit them all, of course, and I\u2019m not even sure I could  locate  them all.  But I\u2019ve got to start somewhere. \n I\u2019ve already pledged that any donation of $250 or more will earn a donation of five books.

{"date": "October 26, 2012", "body": "\r\n In an effort to prepare for Willy\u2019s appointment with the geneticist, I pulled the major records from all three boys\u2019 medical files.  Each packet of documents in these old files corresponds with a story point on the memoir I\u2019m writing, but I hadn\u2019t pulled any of them yet.  For a while, I just re-read what had been said and what had been determined.  I spent a little longer on Ben\u2019s, because getting an accurate diagnosis was a bit more difficult with him.  I thought about the moments and the hardships that had gone along with each of those packets of papers. \n Reading them again, I was surprised at the hidden prejudice I saw so clearly.  Alex, who is the most severely autistic of my children, was diagnosed with PDD-NOS, not autism.  Though his verbal and nonverbal communication delays are extreme, he\u2019s more socially-inclined than expected of an autistic individual.  His  ability  to engage socially is impaired, but his  desire  to engage socially (with adults) is not.  For this reason, he did not meet the criteria of autism. \n As time has passed, as their skills have improved, neither Willy nor Ben showed this dramatic decreased  desire  to socialize that was expected of Alex in order to obtain an autism diagnosis.  Their  ability  to socialize is impaired, and this ability is impaired in some different ways than Alex\u2019s is, but the  desire  is there and it has always been there with all three boys in one way or another.  Just not the \u201cnormal\u201d ways. \n One thing my husband and I learned early on is that if we wanted to engage our children in a social way, we\u2019d have to do so where they are, which wasn\u2019t where we\u2019d expected them to be and it certainly wasn\u2019t where we were.  So, we adapted.  With Willy, we were able to adapt the most successfully, because we could understand what motivated him.  With Ben, we were able to adapt with moderate success, because we could understand enough of what motivated him to do so.  With Alex, we\u2019re still trying to figure out what motivates him.  We\u2019re still adapting.  He\u2019s still very much where he is, and we have to come to him to make the connection\u2014but sometimes he just seems out of our reach. \n The motivation is there, but with such a severe communication disability, we can\u2019t quite make the fully satisfying connection that Alex craves. \n The possibility exists that part of the reason that Alex struggles as much as he does is because he\u2019s having seizures that we\u2019ve failed to recognize.  Until we saw this neurologist, the possibility of seizures\u2014of Alex having seizures \u201cnow,\u201d instead of developing them later\u2014was never mentioned.  He was never tested for \u201chidden\u201d seizures, because we didn\u2019t know that he should be.  The more I read about epilepsy, the more I wonder:  Is this the missing piece?  Is this the key? \n We won\u2019t know until after a few more appointments\u2014one for the initial evaluation and one for the video EEG and one for the post-evaluation, and possibly more in between\u2014the first of which has been scheduled for early December. \n Flipping back through these packets of information, I read the doctors\u2019 words and there are passages that slap me in the face.  These assessments that we endured to get where we are now were wrought with prejudice:  Everything about them is underwritten with the assumption that it is wrong to be autistic.  And what\u2019s worse, the answers these assessments provided might not even be enough. \n Since almost the beginning, I recognized my children as  neurologically different  or  neurodiverse , and yet it\u2019s only within the last few months\u2014with the onset of epilepsy\u2014that I\u2019ve taken any of my boys to a neurologist.  Always, it\u2019s been psychologists.  When I define autism for publication, I start by referencing the DSM-IV, a psychology manual.  Throughout this time I\u2019ve been suspicious of psychology, of the nature of the discipline, of its start with Freud, of its connection to eugenics, of its overzealous classification of \u201cdisorder.\u201d  And yet, here I am, realizing with not a small bit of guilt, that I\u2019ve been enabling them to define autism for my children, for my family, and even for my writing.  I\u2019ve been enabling them to define, despite my resistance, the nature of my children\u2019s being.  I\u2019ve been enabling them to set value (rather, lack thereof) on their worth. \n I can justify it.  The neurologists were always too difficult to get to.  The referrals were always for psychologists.  The system funneled me in this direction, and to get my boys\u2019 the services and accommodations they needed I had to work within the system.  I  know  why I did what I did. \n But it all sounds hollow now.  Empty.  Mistaken and misguided. \n What if, this whole time, Alex was having untreated seizures?  What if treating those seizures empowers Alex to make the connections that have so long eluded us all? \n Whether that\u2019s true or not, I can\u2019t help but feel that, despite my best efforts, I\u2019ve failed my sons. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/10/our-hidden-history/", "title": "Our Hidden History"},

Somehow or other he\u2019d gotten on a Google page that was requesting he choose a language and he was frustrated because he didn\u2019t know how to make the page do what he wanted\u2014which was search for something fun to look at. \n I tried to help him and he pinched me. \n This surprised me. \n If you\u2019ve been reading my posts for long enough, then you know that Ben has behavioral issues.  He\u2019s aggressive.  He throws tantrums regularly.  He pinches, bites, kicks, hits, pushes, and otherwise misbehaves regularly.  He\u2019s gotten suspended for school for these behaviors. \n But that was last year. \n This year he\u2019s going to a new school, with new teachers, new students, and a whole new approach to his programming. \n I\u2019ve been so wrapped up in Willy\u2019s epilepsy and so wrapped up in Alex\u2019s lack of progress and so wrapped up in the onset of bullying and so wrapped up in working on my book and so wrapped up in being sick from all the stress and poor sleeping habits that I didn\u2019t notice that Ben\u2019s behaviors had changed, not consciously. \n Then, he pinched me.  And it surprised me.  It surprised because it had been a regular occurrence, and it surprised me because it was no longer regular. \n Wow.  This is big.  This is huge! \n And I almost missed it. \n On Thursday, when I attended his school conference, I also learned something else surprising.  Ben is now reading sight words at grade-level.  That\u2019s the phrase his new teacher used:  \u201cat grade-level.\u201d \n Perhaps this seems like a small thing, but none of Ben\u2019s other teachers have ever used \u201cat grade-level\u201d before, because none of Ben\u2019s other teachers thought he could do anything \u201cat grade-level.\u201d  Obviously, he can! \n And this is just the first conference at the new school!

I buzzed in my co-author\u2019s ear (who is writing a book about IEPs, which I\u2019m editing) for I don\u2019t know how long. \n See, the few times Alex\u2019s work was sent home it looked altogether too much like what Alex has been doing for years.  And I do mean  years .  Year after year, Alex was doing the same thing.  Nothing I did to try to change that seemed to make a difference.  During the last year of Alex\u2019s elementary school career, I\u2019d begun making some impact.  At that final IEP before he transitioned to middle school, I thought I\u2019d made a pretty strong argument that the new team took to heart.  But the work that was coming home made me question that. \n I put a lot of effort into preparing for the meeting, but as usual I held back to let the staff show me what their intentions were.  I was surprised.  Quite quickly, my concerns evaporated.  My initial impression during that last IEP was correct.  So, instead of working through my prepared plans, we talked.  We shared our ideas, came up with new strategies to problems both new and old.  I came away satisfied. \n The solutions we came up with does mean more work for all of us, but it also means that we\u2019ll pursue the opportunities Alex needs us to pursue to help him accelerate the progress he\u2019s already making and not lose the gains he\u2019s already achieved. \n It\u2019s time for a break-through and I think we finally have the team to make it happen! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/11/another-iep-post/", "title": "Another IEP Post"},

There\u2019s no censor.  There\u2019s precious little moderation.  I know, in this realm, I\u2019m far from the angriest of writers who write about autism and neurodiversity. \n Lately, however, I\u2019ve been doing a lot more professional writing.  Seeking a wider, more diverse audience requires a moderation of tone.  Luckily for me, I have a co-writer on some of my projects who doesn\u2019t hesitate to tell me when I\u2019m writing from an angry place.

Those pieces are shorter and for a more select audience (which is part of the reason it works so much better on a blog).

{"date": "November 19, 2012", "body": "\r\n I got a call to pick up Ben.  Apparently, over the last few weeks, Ben has been pinching, hitting, and biting.  It had gotten bad.  He was inconsolable.  I needed to pick him up and bring him home. \n As soon as I entered the room I knew why. \n I\u2019d been to the classroom before and it seemed like a good fit for Ben.  There was a lack of certain sensory accommodations, but I gave them recommendations on how to change that.  The room was a bit isolated, which meant that it would be quieter than his previous classroom, especially since it would also have fewer students and less traffic outside. \n For the first few weeks, Ben did beautifully.  He made some progressed and was able to show abilities that his previous school would never have expected of him.  But something had changed. \n I knew what it was as soon as I entered the classroom.  I could hear it.  The heat had been turned on.  Now, the room was full of a loud, angry-sounding buzz. \n For those without sensory processing disorder, this might not seem like such a big deal.  Sure, you hear it, but you don\u2019t  listen  to it.  Your brain recognizes the sound, determines that it is not important, and filters it out from your conscious experience of the room.  Ben can\u2019t do that and that makes all the difference in the world. \n Ben hears it, he listens to it, and the sound causes him pain.  Every moment of every day he\u2019s in the classroom, he\u2019s being harassed by a sound he cannot tolerate, but one which he cannot control.  To make matters worse, he doesn\u2019t have the words or the communication skills to explain what he\u2019s experiencing to those who don\u2019t share in them. \n I\u2019ve seen this time and time again.  My sensory processing disorder is much milder than Ben\u2019s, but I knew that if I had to stay in the room, the stress of that sound would cause me a headache within an hour.  I can empathize with Ben, because I can understand what he\u2019s experiencing on a personal level. \n Ben can\u2019t say he hurts.  He can\u2019t say the sound is too loud.  He can\u2019t express this with words or pictures or any other form of easily recognized communication.  So, he covers his ears.  If you make him take his hands off his ears to do work, then the sound hurts him.  He will quickly grow frustrated and angry.  His ability to cope will lessen as he\u2019s continually exposed to the painful stimuli.  He\u2019ll act out.  He\u2019ll melt down.  It\u2019s inevitable.  It\u2019s cumulative.  It wears him out and his behaviors wear out the patience and tolerance of those around him. \n It\u2019s not enough to understand the theory of sensory processing disorder.  For Ben, it\u2019s not a theory at all.  It\u2019s an experience.  The pain the sound causes is very real.  That it \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d hurt doesn\u2019t matter.  It does hurt.  That\u2019s all Ben knows.  But he can\u2019t say that.  So, I have to say it for him.  I have to teach others to empathize with the way Ben experiences the world.  That sound is the trigger that will set Ben off like a bullet from a gun.  Without intervention, that bullet is going to hit a powder keg and explode. \n In fact, metaphorically speaking, that\u2019s just what happened. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/11/triggers/", "title": "Triggers"},
{"date": "November 28, 2012", "body": "\r\n As part of my new-found determination to engage in self-care, I thought a good first step was to take a closer look at some of the health concerns I was experiencing and to take corrective action.  I would take the time to take my own health seriously. \n It started with researching the symptoms that I believed were associated with my history of gallstones, to see if there were better ways to avoid, alleviate, or eliminate the time-consuming, energy-draining pain and discomfort.  I was surprised and a bit taken aback when my searches consistently led, not to gallstones, but treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  In comparing symptoms, the IBS seemed more consistent with my experiences. \n Then, I discovered that IBS is strongly correlated with fibromyalgia.  I remembered learning, during my early research into autism, that children with autism were strongly correlated with mothers with fibromyalgia.  So, I clicked on the link to fibromyalgia to see what the symptoms were. \n I was amazed to find, between the list of symptoms for IBS and the list for fibromyalgia, all but one of my health \u201ccomplaints.\u201d  (The suspected diagnosis was a bit of a surprise for a lot of people, because I\u2019d been trying not to complain.)  I already knew the cause of the other one and had already started addressing that problem. \n I admit to spending a rather lengthy night trying to talk myself out of these discoveries.  Fibromyalgia and IBS are both among a set of disorders that are only recently acknowledged by health professionals and are also among those where there\u2019s no real \u201cfix\u201d for the problems.  And one of the problems is chronic fatigue. \n I was prepared to discover that I was \u201cstuck\u201d with chronic pain; I was not prepared to discover that I was equally stuck with chronic fatigue. \n I have four children, three with diagnoses of autism, two (soon to be three) teenagers, and a husband with chronic depression.  Add to that my high motivation, my business, my classes, and my desire to expand my writing projects.  The math clearly states that I cannot afford chronic fatigue. \n The whole point of all this research, after all, was to  increase  my productivity, which has been in a downward spiral, tanking after the latest discovery of epilepsy.  I had absolutely no interest in  coming to terms  with my limitations.  Nope.  Not gonna happen.  I was resolute. \n That lasted until a family member who is also a medical service provider, who happens to have some expertise in fibromyalgia, came over the next evening.  I discussed my suspicions with her.  She touched me in two places and I didn\u2019t provide a fibromyalgia-type reaction.  For a moment I thought I was in the clear.  But I kept talking and she decided to test the other trigger points. \n I\u2019d felt the pressure she exerted against the first two points.  It was a poke.  When she \u201cpoked\u201d my shoulders, my back, my hips, and my chest it felt like she was jabbing me instead.  The pain was sharp, intense.  It faded slowly\u2014far more slowly than I would have expected.  She tested me around 7 PM.  I was still awake with a dull, aching pain in each of those areas until 2 AM.  A piping hot bath helped a little, but the pain lingered in a dull, lazy sort of fashion until well into the next day. \n Slowly, with a sinking feeling in my stomach, this new reality set in.  My first response was to talk to my husband about the tests, because he\u2019s the most likely (aside from me) to be impacted.  Then, I shared the probable prognosis with my co-author, who is another person who is likely to see a considerable impact.  Next, came my mother, but only because she was sleeping and prefers to talk; so, I had to wait until the next day; whereas, I communicate with my co-author mostly (but not exclusively) through e-mails, so I could blast our suspicions off for him to read at his convenience with the specification that this convenience be after his vacation had concluded. \n Then, as the pain continued into the wee hours and I still couldn\u2019t sleep, I thought back.  The first time I could remember Alex \u201cjabbing\u201d me with his finger in a tender spot was two years ago.  That\u2019s also around the time the \u201cgallstones\u201d got less occasional and the associated discomfort stopped responding to the sarsaparilla.  That\u2019s also around the time I started feeling \u201cold,\u201d meaning that I would wake up stiff and sore, requiring longer and longer periods of time in the morning, creeping from fifteen minutes to two hours, to work out the \u201ckinks.\u201d \n After finally getting some much needed sleep, I took a good, close look at those symptoms again.  Damn.  Damn.  Triple damn.  I\u2019d already given up the denial, but now I was convinced.  That doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/11/discovering-fibromyalgia/", "title": "Discovering Fibromyalgia"},

At least, that\u2019s our experience. \n This is true of the big issues, of course.  For example, the longer Mark is depressed the harder it seems to be for him to recover from that depression and the harder it becomes for him to imagine a future point in his life when he\u2019s not depressed.  The longer Alex goes without an effective means of complex communication, the further behind his peers he gets, and the less likely he is to have anything resembling a \u201cnormal\u201d future, which means his projected outcome is \u201cworse than\u201d his brothers\u2019. \n But it is also true of the small issues.  For example, Ben is still having a rough time at school and we\u2019re still at the \u201cfiguring things out\u201d stage, so he\u2019s accumulating stress all week long.  So, the at-home strategies that have been in place and have been working are no longer enough to help him cope with the additional stress.  In turn, Ben\u2019s lack of coping results in more outbursts, particularly more outbursts targeting Alex.  Alex, then, has a rougher time, more stress, and more outbursts of his own.

{"date": "November 30, 2012", "body": "\r\n I was first introduced to  the spoons metaphor  in 2010, so when the family member who \u201cdiagnosed\u201d me with fibromyalgia (it\u2019s not official, because she can\u2019t do the treatment plan) started talking about the implications and used a metaphor involving a jar of marbles, I knew exactly what she was talking about. \n For those who don\u2019t know and don\u2019t want to follow the links, here\u2019s a brief description:  Everyone has a finite amount of resources with which to get things done in a given day.  For most people without disabilities, the primary finite resource is time\u2014we don\u2019t have enough time to do everything we want to do.  For many people with disabilities, the primary finite resource is energy, partly because we may have less energy than the average person and partly because the things we need to do require more energy of us than they require of the average person.  This energy can be seen as a form of currency\u2014the original example was spoons, but marbles or anything works just as well.  If you don\u2019t manage your spoons, you run out of energy before you run out of time.  A person with fibromyalgia may have fewer spoons to spend due to their fatigue.  A person with fibromyalgia may also have to spend more spoons to get a given task completed than the average person.  So, in short, a person with fibromyalgia can get less done. \n Even without bring up the marbles/spoons analogy, I knew that with fibromyalgia I would need to come to terms with productivities levels that were less than what I used to be able to do.  The last few months bear that out. \n Along with finding that first spoons post, I also unearthed some others. \n The first one that caught my eye was  the third in a three-part series of posts  in which I acknowledged back in 2010 that I was noticing a decline in my abilities: \n My energy (and yours) is always limited, and some days it\u2019s more limited than others. My energy also varies during different times in the day. \n Along with limited energy, two other finite resources affect my ability to accomplish tasks. One is my ability to concentrate. Unfortunately for me, sometimes having energy doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m able to concentrate. Sometimes being able to concentrate doesn\u2019t mean I have energy.

Unfortunately, as dolls go,  American Girls  were always rather expensive and I never actually got one.  I can\u2019t really complain, though.  My parents did buy me less expensive dolls.  Beside, my mom actually  made  me dolls\u2014sewing them by hand and with her sewing machine. \n When I recently received a catalog for  American Girl  toys in the mail, I felt a bit nostalgic.  It\u2019s not that I\u2019m going to buy one or anything.  After all, I don\u2019t collect dolls and I have sons, not daughters.  (Yes, my sons owned dolls and they each played with them, but nothing like these dolls; nor would they want anything like this.) \n Anyway, believe it or not, I do have a point.  I flipped through the catalog, because I was feeling nostalgic.  I noticed how extensive their line of toys has grown.  You can customize your doll as well as buy history-related dolls that come with books.  They have a lot more accessories than I remember, including pianos, chateaus, and doll-sized horses\u2014not to mention matching clothes for both doll and girl. \n I also noticed something even more unexpected.  Among the possible accessories there is a service dog set with a bag of fake treats.  Several pages later there is a page full of small accessories.  There is a purse and a doll hair brush, a violin and case and a doll stand, and other perfectly ordinary doll accessories.  But there\u2019s more than that.  There\u2019s a healthy smile kit that includes \u201cbraces\u201d for the doll and there\u2019s a  wheel chair  and a  hearing aid . \n I stared at the page for a while.  I thought back to my own childhood and the complete lack of anything (in the category of toys) that validated the existence and acceptability of children with disabilities.  I couldn\u2019t help but see this as a sign of progress.  After all, if a toy company like  American Girl  is making disability-related accessories for dolls, then there is almost certainly a demand for these accessories, and furthermore, the people demanding these accessories are being  respected  by the company. \n It\u2019s such a simple thing, and yet it shows respect and validates the existence and worth of children with disabilities.  Now, little girls all over America who want dolls who look like them (and whose parents can afford to spend a hundred dollars on a doll, plus more for the accessories) can have a doll that looks like them, regardless of skin or hair or eye color, and regardless of several common disabilities.  There\u2019s something about that that just warms my heart. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/11/american-girls/", "title": "American Girls"},

{"date": "July 19, 2011", "body": "\r\n American culture prioritizes self-sufficiency\u2014one form of independence\u2014when assessing human value, and by doing so our culture denies both the belief in equality and the importance of self-determination.  I suspect this switch has a lot to do on the American eugenics program, but I\u2019m not going to dwell on that.  For now, distinguishing between self-sufficiency and self-determination is enough.  Both are aspects of independence, but their place in our society has flipped in significance. \n So, where does that leave us?  What will  independence  look like for my family as my children grow up? \n In order to try to project that I first have to consider what independence looks like for my family now.  Will is the most independent of my three autistic children.  At the age of twelve, he can do many things his peers can do.  Alex needs a lot of assistance.  While he\u2019s becoming more self-sufficient in matters that do not involve communication, he difficulty communicating is still a significant barrier to independence.  Ben is, as usual, somewhere in-between.  In some ways, he\u2019s very much the \u201clittle brother,\u201d and is thus not self-sufficient.  But his communication skills have out-paced Alex (he\u2019s no longer considered non-verbal) and his get-into-trouble skills show a great deal of self-sufficient stubbornness, if not a great deal of compliance and understanding.  (Why, oh, why must he play with my  hand towels !?!) \n Looking at the boys, however, is insufficient to properly project their levels of independence in the future.  Mark and I are big factors in this.  We are both capable of living independently, if it were just ourselves we had to care for.  We don\u2019t need personal care workers to meet our personal needs.  Yet, I would not consider us self-sufficient.  Of course, the money thing is an issue, because we\u2019ve chosen to prioritize our children\u2019s needs over the high-paying, 100-hour-a-week marketing jobs I am otherwise qualified for and because we don\u2019t have the typical dual-income many American families have, we tend to run short on liquid funds when something big happens.  More than that, we also need help meeting our children\u2019s needs.  We tend to have, between ourselves and among others, inter-dependent relationships. \n So, if we wanted our children to live independent\u2014meaning self-sufficient\u2014lives, we\u2019d have to become better examples of self-sufficiency ourselves.  On the other hand, both my husband and I are examples of self-determination.  I expect Willy will grow up to lead a life that is both acceptably self-sufficient (by society\u2019s standards) and self-determined.  Ben may need more assistance than is socially acceptable to be self-sufficient, but he will be self-determined.  It\u2019s Alex I worry about.  Without an effective means of communication, his self-determination is at risk and so is his self-sufficiency. \n It may not be the priority of our culture, but I am personally more concerned with empowering my children to be self-determined. \n \u00a0 \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/07/independence-part-3/", "title": "Independence: Part 3"},
{"date": "July 17, 2011", "body": "\r\n So, what does  independence  really mean?  What is its significance in American culture? \n Independence  is \u201cfreedom from the control, influence, support, aid, or the like, of others.\u201d  In American history, independence was primarily a political matter.  As a fledgling nation, we wanted independence from the control and taxation of the British Empire.  I support this kind of independence.  In our Constitution, we have also ensured another kind of independence: Independence from the government, which is manifest in the freedom to speak openly, to organize, to arm oneself, and\u2014all together\u2014the freedom of self-determination.  All these are good things. \n But I can\u2019t help but think our obsession with independence is a bit misguided.  Sure, independent thought and free-will, with minimal governmental obstruction, are foundations of this nation\u2014which I wholly support.  But our obsession with independence has gone far beyond that, while at the same time neglecting the basic tenets of our founding beliefs.  We focus less on self-determination and more focus on self-sufficiency.  The less self-sufficient you are, the less valued you are, and the less respected your legal rights become. \n I could write a political post about how government encroaches on independent thought and free-will, and how as a democratic republic we should actively resist.  But that\u2019s not the focus of this blog and my past side-steps into politics on this venue haven\u2019t gone so well.  Besides, I\u2019m more concerned about the ways we distract ourselves with assumptions of human value based on a person\u2019s independent living status.  As if whether or not you can hold down a job, button up your coat, or drive a car are the true indicators of your human worth\u2014rather than a belief that we\u2019ve all been endowed with unalienable rights and we are all created equal. \n I\u2019ve been told that this focus on independent living is rooted in our colonial history.  If people weren\u2019t independent, they didn\u2019t survive.  But is that really true?  Granted, I\u2019m a bit removed from colonial days, but as I understand it neighbors actually helped each other back then.  That doesn\u2019t sound very independent to me.  You need a barn built?  Sure, you could take weeks or months and do it yourself.  Maybe you could, depending on your access to assistive technologies, such as winches and levers.  Or you could pass the word along to your neighbors and get a bunch of people together and get the barn built in a day.  Which do you think they did?  I\u2019m sure some people made rudimentary barns and houses without help, but when help was available they used it.  Why?  Because life is better when you can and do get the help you need, whether it\u2019s from technology, other people, or both \n I believe in independence.  I believe people should be empowered to do the things they can do, and that often means providing them with technologies and education to get them to a point of actionable power.  Then, once they reach the point of success, it means stepping back and letting them do it.  But, before you get to that point of success, you do need help.  You need to learn, you need tools, and you need people to help you.  That\u2019s true whether you have a disability or not. \n Ah, but the difference is some people, when given the tools and assistance they need, can become more independent then others!  Really?  How much of that is genuine potential, or lack thereof, and how much of that is appropriateness of tools and education?  We assume some people are more able\u2014or have more potential for \u201cableness\u201d\u2014than others.  Yet, as a culture, we resist providing those who are deemed less able with appropriate technological and educational adaptations.  How can we really know what people are capable of if we only provide a certain set of standardized tools and we only provide those to the people we think can use them?  Does that reflect a belief in independence or a belief in standardization? \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/independence"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/07/independence-part-2/", "title": "Independence:  Part 2"},

{"date": "July 31, 2011", "body": "\r\n This post is in response to Rachel\u2019s  recent post  at  Journeys With Autism  about taking care when expressing our experiences of disability. Her post was, in turn, a response to  another blogger . \n While I\u2019m not going to try to touch on everything Rachel covered (It\u2019s a good post, and I highly recommend you check it out.) there\u2019s a particular passage that got me thinking about an issue that\u2019s been a concern of mine for a long time. \n It all started with this: \n My concerns on this score only increase when Ms. Baird launches into some of the most fear-inducing words about autism that I have ever read: \n Autism is where marriages and parenting partnerships come to die on the rocks of exhaustion, despair and blind self-interest. Autism wears down families, severs familial bonds with sharp and bitter recriminations, blame and guilt. \n I absolutely cannot tolerate it when people indulge in these kinds of generalizations about a condition that exists on a very, very wide spectrum. I understand and have compassion for Ms. Baird\u2019s experience, but it is  her experience . Yes, it is an experience shared by other families, but it is by no means the universal experience of autism. \n I highly recommend reading Rachel\u2019s post, because she makes some very important points that are specific to autism, and apply more generally to discourse on disabilities. However, in this post, I would like to address this from a perspective beyond autism and beyond disability. Simply put, what Ms. Baird is experiencing within the context of the quoted passage has nothing to do, specifically, with autism. \n For those immersed in the world of parenting an autistic child, this may seem counterintuitive. After all, those of us with autistic children, especially children with \u201csevere\u201d autism, know it\u2019s almost always challenging, often exhausting, and very, very stressful. But that\u2019s just it. It\u2019s not  autism  that wears down families, severs familial bonds, or creates blame and guilt. It\u2019s stress. More specifically, it\u2019s our poor or inadequate reactions to stress that have these consequences. \n Stop and think about it for a moment. If  autism  were the cause, then we\u2019d only be seeing these effects in families with autism. But that\u2019s not the case. Nor is it the case that we only see these effects in families with disabled children. No. We see these effects in families that are impacted by a wide variety of stressors, and currently one of the most notable stressors is finances. How many parents have killed their children or their whole families in reaction to financial crises? I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve lost count. How many more succumb to abusive behaviors? How many people have walked away from their marriages and their children because they lost their jobs, because they couldn\u2019t pay their bills, because they were going to lose their home? Is anyone even counting? \n Sure, some families with autistic children experience exactly what Ms. Baird described. But so do families with no autistic children. Autism is not the cause. We have a tendency, as parents of children with autism, to falsely blame autism for our struggles and our challenges. We blame autism for experiences that we think are, at least to some degree, exclusive to ourselves and our \u201ckind,\u201d because we get so caught up in  autism  that we fail to see our similarities to others outside of ourselves. \n People can, and frequently do, react badly to stress. These reactions are to  stress , or the experience of  being stressed . The cause of that stress is, for the most part, irrelevant when the issue is our reactions to that stress. There are many causes, and there are many reactions; but the causes do NOT dictate the reactions. \n What is the difference between the mother who kills her child because her child is autistic and the father who kills his child because he\u2019s broke? Certainly the first evokes great concerns about the perception of autism and disability in this country; certainly the later evokes great concerns about the psychological effects of our economic downturn. But, despite these differences, both are tragedies; both involve the deaths of innocent children at the hands of their stressed-out parents; both are bad reactions to stress. \n I\u2019m not a psychologist, a sociologist or an anthropologist. I cannot tell you how different or unusual this reaction is from reactions to stress over hundreds or thousands of years of human society. I\u2019m just a mom. I\u2019m a mom who looks at my kids and is horrified at the thought of a parent willfully killing their own children. It\u2019s outrageous. It\u2019s horrifying. And it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s not just happening to autistic kids. It\u2019s not just happening to kids that are disabled or sick. The phenomenon is bigger than a single stressor. It\u2019s bigger than autism. It\u2019s bigger than disability. I see this and I can\u2019t help but think that something has gone very, very wrong. For all I know this has always happened. I don\u2019t know. But, even if this is some sort of incomprehensible \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just wrong. \n When I brought this up in a briefer form on Rachel\u2019s post, she evoked the word \u201csupport.\u201d For those of us within the autism community,  support  is a major buzzword. It\u2019s a major buzzword in the greater disability community as well. My question is this: why isn\u2019t  support  a major buzzword in the community at large? The concept of support is not exclusive to disability. We all need support. We all need  community support ; in fact, that\u2019s the reason why communities exist. \n Families disintegrate due to stress, or rather due to poor reactions to stress. The nature of the stress is not what needs to be fixed. There are too many stressors in the world to fix them all. If it wasn\u2019t autism, it could be poor finances; if it wasn\u2019t finances, it could be something else. The cause of the stressor isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is how we respond to the stress. If people get the support they need, I believe responses would improve\u2014again, I\u2019m neither a sociologist nor a psychologist, so my statement is intuitive not factual. My point is that blaming the stressor does not get you the support you need. You cannot choose whether or not your child has autism. You cannot choose whether or not you\u2019re laid off. You can choose how you respond. You can  choose  to let your family disintegrate. You can  choose  to take them out with a shotgun. You can also  choose  to cope, to get support, to reach out, to build community, to help and be helped. \n That choice has nothing to do with autism. You can lay the blame for all your woes at autism\u2019s anthropomorphized feet if you\u2019d like, but it won\u2019t do you or anyone else any good. How you deal with the stressors in your life is your choice and your responsibility. Choose wisely. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2011/07/20/on-language/", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/", "http://www.fiftyisthenew.com/2011/05/12/naked-motherhood/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/07/false-blame/", "title": "False Blame"},

It\u2019s hard to admit that all these challenges are just  too much ; it\u2019s somehow easier to believe that I am not doing enough. \n I can\u2019t control how much time I have.  I get the same 24 hours everyone else does, and I can\u2019t change that.  For the most part, I can\u2019t control how much I can accomplish in the time that I have.  Sure, I can make myself more productive, but there\u2019s only so much leeway there. \n Right now it feels like I\u2019m lost in the limited time I have, with more to do than I can possibly get done, and more people anxiously waiting for me to produce.  I live with it, because I can\u2019t see any way out of the situation.  I\u2019ve got to catch up and it\u2019ll take as long as it takes.  What choice do I have? \n But I\u2019m also trying not to feel guilty for my limitations.  I will get it all done.  I know that.  Many of the people I work with know that, too.  I just need more time.  And I need room to breathe so I can keep working.  Guilt is just a waste of energy that will slow me down. \n Are you holding onto anything that\u2019s getting in your way?  Are you ready to just let it go?  Perhaps that sounds overly simplistic.

{"date": "November 3, 2012", "body": "\r\n I\u2019m reading a book called  Initiate  by Tara Maya  and I recently encountered a passage that felt very autistic.  She described a magical being that was forced to interact in a human world, using sensory disorientation, sensory seeking behaviors, and social inappropriateness and confusion that seemed to me very much like an outward expression of autism. \n So, I got curious.  I found two posts on her blog that mention autism.   First , back in 2008, she wrote a post that connected \u201ctheory of mind\u201d to novel reading and writing.  She quoted Lisa Zunshine\u2019s book  Why We Read Fiction: Theory of Mind and the Novel : \u201c\u2026it is our ToM [Theory of Mind] [which] makes literature as we know it possible.\u201d \n Maya then writes: \n Perhaps novel writers suffer not just from hypergraphia, but from over-excitable mirror neurons as well. Thus we have a compulsion to both imagine what other minds are thinking and to then write about it. This could constitute a sort of inverse of autism, which renders it difficult to imagine what other people are thinking and feeling. \n I wonder if Maya or, for that matter, Zunshine and Baron-Cohen (whose research is used in Zunshine\u2019s book), realize that there is such a thing as an autistic author?  That people with autism and Asperger\u2019s do write fiction? \n This post implies that Maya may have a curiosity regarding autism, but relies on non-autistic \u201cexperts\u201d to form her impressions of the disorder.  If so, this wouldn\u2019t be an example of \u201cautism in art,\u201d but an example of \u201cunconscious prejudice in art.\u201d \n But there\u2019s a  second post .  In 2009, she wrote: \n According to the cognitive science \u2018theory of theory of mind\u2019 (sic) we are all mind readers, to a greater or lesser extent. Those of us closer to the autistic side of the spectrum may prefer genres which tend to have flatter, easier-to-read characters, whereas those with highly honed hyper-acute mind reading skills may find flat characters painfully boring. \n This almost suggests that she might include herself as among \u201cthose of us closer to the autistic side,\u201d and yet she\u2019s writing and reading fiction and still, seemingly, buying into the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d bit. \n Either way, it seems to me that if Maya wants to understand the autistic side of things, then she\u2019s better off talking to people with autism than relying on non-autistic \u201cexperts\u201d to interpret what it means to be autistic for her. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://taramayastales.blogspot.com/p/the-unfinished-song-series.html", "http://taramayastales.blogspot.com/2008/11/meditation-on-personality.html", "http://www.amazon.com/WHY-WE-READ-FICTION-INTERPRETATION/dp/0814210287/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225921592&sr=8-1", "http://taramayastales.blogspot.com/2009/06/why-character-driven-fiction-can-be.html"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/11/autism-in-art/", "title": "Autism In Art?"},
{"date": "November 5, 2012", "body": "\r\n Fox\u2019s new show  Touch  just started its second (hopefully full) year.  When it was first introduced, there was some early buzz due to  Touch \u2019s autism connection.  I watched the show and enjoyed it, even after the supposed autism connection was dispelled. \n Now, with the first new episode of the season available online (I don\u2019t actually watch television, at least not on purpose), I wanted to take a moment to comment once again on this show. \n First, if you want to watch the show for anything resembling a realistic portrayal of autism, don\u2019t.  Jake is not autistic.  The creators of the show didn\u2019t want him to be labeled (whether that\u2019s out of respect people with disabilities or out of fear that such a label would be \u201cbad\u201d is unclear) and the show has stated quite clearly that he doesn\u2019t fit autism criteria.  Furthermore, watching a show for a realistic portrayal of anything is rarely a good idea.  Whatever they\u2019re showing, they have an agenda.  Agenda, perception, and other human traits skews the \u201crealism\u201d shown with any art in favor of the worldview of its creators. \n If you don\u2019t want to watch the show because the show is related in some way to autism, then I strongly suggest you reconsider.  The concept behind the show is basically this:  Human beings (yes, all of us) are connected with each other and the world around us in ways that most of us don\u2019t see, but in ways that cause \u201cdistress\u201d in the world if they\u2019re set awry; there are a limited number of people who are gifted with the ability to see these connections and manipulate them to set things that have gone awry to rights; Jake is one of those people, which forces Martin to cope with having a truly extraordinary (much more than he ever knew) son. \n Here are a few reasons not to watch the show: \n \n  You thought  Friends  was an emotionally deep and intellectually stimulating portrayal of life in the big city. \n You think  Family Guy  is wholesome, family entertainment. \n You\u2019re the kind of s.o.b. who wants to cling to your prejudices with your very last breath. \n You think American shows should be exclusively about Americans. \n You absolutely abhor subtitles. \n A story with more than five characters per episode confuses you. \n Wrinkles offend your aesthetic sensibilities. \n You often wonder if  Nikita  couldn\u2019t be a bit more action-packed. \n You reject anything that questions reality as you know it. \n You honestly believe reality television is the best thing on the tube. \n \n Touch  demonstrates an incredible belief in the potential of humanity and an inspiring belief that what is wrong can be set right.  If you enjoy heart-warming (and occasionally heart-wrenching) drama and can juggle multiple storylines in your mind across multiple episodes, then I suggest giving  Touch  a try.  Be warned:  It\u2019s not for the vacuous. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/11/touched-by-touch/", "title": "Touched By "},
{"date": "September 19, 2012", "body": "\r\n I take Willy back to the neurologist today.  We should get the results of the video EEG, the MRI, the blood tests, and whatever other observations were made.  We already know the diagnosis is epilepsy, but I\u2019ve learned over the last few weeks that this is kind of like an umbrella diagnosis, so it isn\u2019t very informative.  There\u2019s a lot more we need to know about what\u2019s going on. \n I\u2019ve been doing a little bit of foreshadowing with Willy about the upcoming visit, but I learned from the previous visits there\u2019s such a thing as too much foreshadowing with such things.  It\u2019s not that I tried to make too big of a deal about it.  I just wanted him to know what to expect. \n Unfortunately, knowing what to expect gave him too much fodder to worry over.  I\u2019ve done better this time\u2014and the relative successes of the recent visits and the relative ease of the upcoming visit help.  He\u2019s not very anxious about the upcoming visit, but he does know it\u2019s going to happen.  He\u2019s just not dwelling on it. \n Unfortunately, I am dwelling on it.  Mark took a call from the clinic, in which they informed him in a vague sort of way (at least, the information that was relayed to me was vague) that they found something on the MRI.  Mark compared it to what was found on Alex\u2019s MRI. \n The material regarding epilepsy that was provided to me by the Epilepsy Foundation contains a lot of general information about surgical treatment options.  And the combination of something on the MRI, the EEG showing seizures starting in one area of the brain and then spreading, and the material I\u2019ve been reading has me worried.  Apparently, there\u2019s a stronger push for pursuing surgery early as a treatment for epilepsy. \n We\u2019re talking brain surgery here.  And my gut reaction is  NO!  My more thoughtful reaction contains an expletive.  In short, I\u2019m not at all comfortable with the thought of anyone mucking about with my son\u2019s brain. \n If a medication doesn\u2019t work or if it has too many side effects, you can always stop taking it.  There\u2019s going to be a chance that the damage isn\u2019t permanent (though it can be).  If you  remove part of someone\u2019s brain  that\u2019s it.  It\u2019s done.  If it goes wrong or doesn\u2019t have the anticipated effects, you\u2019re stuck with the results.  After all, it\u2019s not like you can  put it back!!! \n And so I\u2019m worried.  And it\u2019s premature.  I know it\u2019s premature, but that doesn\u2019t really change anything.  Nobody\u2014outside of the literature\u2014has really seriously discussed brain surgery.  But still I worry, because, well,  it\u2019s his brain!!! \n You knew Willy had to get his overdeveloped sense of worry from somewhere, right? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/09/anticipating-results/", "title": "Anticipating Results"},
{"date": "November 8, 2012", "body": "\r\n So, November is Epilepsy Awareness month and, apparently, the color is purple.  Well, I think I\u2019m covered there! \n At this point in our epilepsy adventure it\u2019s all about control.  Last time we went to the neurologist, he upped Willy\u2019s dosage of Trileptal.  Since then, Willy has had only one seizure (that I can remember being told about) and it was after he missed a dose.  I\u2019ve gotten him a fancy pill box that holds a whole week\u2019s worth of pills, with boxes for both morning and evening doses and with extra boxes if he gets mid-day doses added to his medication schedule. \n It may be too soon to feel so confident, but I think this medication and this dosage will continue to be successful with seizure control.  Willy has enough medicine in his system now that even if he does miss a dose it doesn\u2019t automatically mean he has a seizure.  Though, I\u2019m getting better about checking to make sure he doesn\u2019t miss a dose and he\u2019s getting better about remembering to take his medicine so he doesn\u2019t miss a dose.  None of us want to take that chance. \n While controlling the seizures is a major victory, other issues of control have arisen.  I recently attended an IEP for Willy.  We discovered that the periods when Willy\u2019s anxiety and depression-like symptoms have seemed to get better at home, they\u2019ve gotten worse at school, and vice versa.  So, there\u2019s not a reduction of anxiety.  It\u2019s simply being displaced between his different environments.  Along with the anxiety and depression, we\u2019re seeing decreases in his self-control and impulse-control.  Now, after two years of not needing one, we\u2019re going to have to create a behavioral intervention plan for school. \n Unfortunately, there are too many unknowns.  Is the re-emergence of these behaviors and the increase in emotion instability a result of the onset of epilepsy?  Is it a side-effect of the medication?  Is it the result of puberty?  Is it a combination?  Or is it its own thing?  To try to get answers and help, we\u2019re going to seek out a therapeutic psychologist with experience with children with autism and we\u2019re going to try to make sure the psychologist, the neurologist, and the school can work together effectively. \n On the up-side, bullying no longer seems to be an issue. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/11/epilepsy-awareness-the-buzz-word-is-control/", "title": "Epilepsy Awareness:"},

On the upside, Ben is no longer wandering into Alex\u2019s room and scratching up his face.  Instead, Ben wanders into the upstairs bathroom and tries to flush miscellaneous items down the toilet.  Since the toilet up there has been blocked for the past two weeks\u2014 probably another milk cap \u2014and nobody has had time to pull up the toilet and fix it, Ben satisfies his urge by stuffing clean washcloths down as far as he can get them.  We discourage this.  We try to prevent it.  And, so, instead of putting him to bed and hoping for the best, I\u2019ve been sitting outside his room, doing what little work I can from that location, and stewing in my own idleness\u2014oh, and telling him to go back to bed every few minutes until he finally falls asleep. \n Overall, it\u2019s a bad system.  It doesn\u2019t actually help the boys get a good night sleep and it does horrible things to my stress levels.  Me + idle = badness. \n In the past, we\u2019ve tried melatonin (to be ingested) and we\u2019ve tried lavender oil (like perfume).  Both worked, for a time, but the effects wear off and I\u2019m not comfortable just upping the dosage.  So, I haven\u2019t used either in quite a while.  But now, with the summer (and their sleeplessness) revving up, I\u2019m going to try again, starting with the melatonin. \n Last night, Alex took his melatonin very well, and he went to sleep very nicely.  Ben, on the other hand, fought with everything he had.  He wouldn\u2019t drink down the crushed pill in Dr. Pepper, which he used to do.  So, I tried to give him the pill by mouth.  About \u00bc of the pill dissolved in his mouth.  The rest ended up smeared on his face, on me, and on the surrounding bedding.  Then, he made himself throw up, on purpose, as a protest.  Tonight was a bit better.  Alex was a bit more reluctant, but cooperative with just a tiny bit of coaching.  Ben struggled, but he didn\u2019t throw up, and he ended the whole battle by giving me kisses\u2014after I let him go.  Then, Ben fell asleep within half an hour, but Alex is still up, still bouncing.  So, you win some, you lose some, and as long as I win with one of the boys each night, I\u2019m good to go! \n The thing of it is, when the boys take their melatonin (assuming the effectiveness hasn\u2019t been reduced due to frequency of use), the boys sleep better and have better days.  Once the boys gets used to taking the melatonin, they\u2019re happier and more functional and they like that\u2014go figure.  It\u2019s just a matter of getting them used to it again, and helping Ben remember that sleep is actually good for him. \n \u00a0 \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.orlandofamilymagazine.com/index.php/archived-articles/how-to-handle-a-little-flushers-curiosity/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/06/back-to-bed/", "title": "Back to Bed"},

In short, he\u2019s being bullied.  He\u2019s being bullied about his glasses, about his coordination, and about his speech.  I suspect other aspects of himself are being attacked, too, but like most kids, Willy isn\u2019t particularly comfortable talking about it. \n That\u2019s a change, too.

Even the doctor doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.  Yay!  On the other hand, it means Willy will probably be on anti-seizure medication for the rest of his life.  So, there\u2019s that. \n I learned quite a bit from this visit.  First, I learned that all the seizure activity recorded by the EEG started in the same spot in Willy\u2019s brain and that they also saw spikes in this location even when the spikes didn\u2019t become seizures.  After a seizure started, it became generalized throughout Willy\u2019s brain.  Second, I learned that several anomalies were identified in Willy\u2019s MRI.  The main one concerned his ventricals, which are structured atypically so that they \u201cleak\u201d cerebral spinal fluid into a part of the brain that isn\u2019t common.  Near this site, there are also \u201cextra\u201d folds in Willy\u2019s brain.  And, Willy also has a cyst that is not considered significant. \n This data has led Willy\u2019s neurologist to suspect that there is a genetic factor, so Willy will be seeing a neurogeneticist to see if we can learn more.  Identifying a genetic cause may just be a \u201cpoint of curiosity\u201d that does researchers more good than it does us, but it may also indicate other associated anomalies to watch out for, like heart conditions or something. \n Due to the possibility of a genetic factor (which may or may not be hereditary), the neurologist is also concerned about Alex.  There is a possibility that Alex experiences subclinical seizures that we don\u2019t know how to identify, so I\u2019m to get his pediatrician to refer Alex to the doctor and the doctor is going to order Alex\u2019s MRI to see if there are similar anomalies that the other doctors missed because the ones identified on Willy\u2019s MRI were subtle and because Alex\u2019s doctors weren\u2019t looking for it. \n While I\u2019m not overjoyed at the possibility of 24-hour video EEG round two, I realize that it would be better to catch any seizure activity earlier rather than later.  I also read an article that suggests (though the article admitted the data was insufficient to be conclusive at this point) that treating children who have autism and who also have irregular EEGs, even when they don\u2019t have observable seizures, can improve the child\u2019s quality of life, including their autism symptomology.  An extreme example was a child with autism who was non-verbal before starting seizure medication, but who was able to use verbal communication afterwards. \n All in all, it was a lot of information delivered in a relatively short amount of time.  We\u2019re all still processing what this means. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/09/back-to-the-genetics-of-it-all/", "title": "Back to the Genetics of It All"},
{"date": "June 11, 2011", "body": "\r\n So, I\u2019ve been working with an individual over the last few months that made some big promises and failed to follow through.  (I knew it was a risk going in, and I was willing to take that risk.)  Suffice it to say, we won\u2019t be moving out east, even if he comes through with the promised payments (which will probably require a court order).  While I\u2019m very disappointed in this individual\u2019s unethical behavior, I find I\u2019m surprisingly not disappointed with staying put.  As much as I\u2019d like a better house, I\u2019d prefer that house to be in the same area with the same schools.  I\u2019d prefer to stay by our friends and sort of close to much of our family.  Travel one direction, and in a few hours or less we can reach one batch of family.  Travel in the opposite direction, and in a few hours or less we can reach another batch of family.  Travel in another direction, and in a few more hours we can reach even more family. \n Of course, we rarely travel and we have family that is even further away, but that\u2019s not the point.  The point is that relocating to the East Coast would put us further from all of our family. \n Besides, for all the occasional complaints I have about my little park-filled city\u2014which has a serious drought of some of the big-city restaurant and shopping choices, but also doesn\u2019t have the big-city crime and inconvenience\u2014I like it here. \n So, we\u2019re not moving, at least not far.  And that\u2019s good. \n Speaking of staying put, though, there\u2019s this other thing.  The thing where Willy is behind in his reading skills, the thing where they wanted him to go to summer school, the thing where, when I filled out the paperwork and turned it in, I was told he would not be getting the supports he needs.  Hm.  So, basically we\u2019re going to make Willy go to his most difficult class over the summer and not give him the support he had throughout the school year, the support with which he made insufficient progress to keep up?  Maybe it\u2019s just me, but that sounded a lot like a recipe for failure\u2014which would not improve Willy\u2019s attitude towards reading. \n Turns out it\u2019s not just me.  His speech and language pathologist, who is also his case manager, agreed that it was cause for concern and that a home-based strategy might be better.  So, instead of summer school, Willy and I will be reading books together, talking and writing about what we\u2019ve read, and working on comprehension skills.  Instead of the \u201cpunishment\u201d of summer school, he\u2019s rewarded with extra-focused Mommy-time, the flexibility to use alternative approaches, and a whole summer of skill-building that is wholly individualized.  Now, that sounds like a recipe worth following! \n \u00a0 \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/06/staying-put/", "title": "Staying Put"},

{"date": "June 21, 2011", "body": "\r\n Often, when I try to inform people about our unsavory history\u2014particularly the eugenics programs practiced here in the United States of America and their similarity to those practiced by Nazi Germany\u2014I\u2019m met with skepticism.  I\u2019m told it couldn\u2019t happen here. \n But it did. \n In this news article, Renee Elder and Tom Breen report on North Carolina\u2019s efforts to \u201cmake amends to thousands of people who cannot have children because of eugenics-inspired theories about social improvement.\u201d \n The leading paragraph states:  \u201cNext week, victims and their relatives will tell their stories to a state task force considering compensation to victims of sterilizations that continued into 1974.\u201d \n Not only did I want to post this to show those who might doubt that there is factual evidence\u2014publicly recognized, even if not well known\u2014that proves that the United States did practice eugenics and did inflict harm on real people in their pursuit of some kind of social ideal, I also wanted to highlight the lingering effects of this ideology. \n Particularly, there are some choice quotes from Paul Lombardo, a professor at Georgia State University's College of Law, which highlights how these programs are still being justified. \n He starts off saying, \u201cThe argument was, anybody who generates social costs shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have children.\u201d \n Of course, this statement ignores the fact that we all generate social costs.  The schools we attend, the roads we use, the courts we use to pursue justice or to change our legal status\u2014these services all come with social costs.  The assumption, therefore, is that some of us generate social costs and contribute to paying those costs by paying taxes, whereas others don\u2019t.  And this makes the lives of some more valuable than those of others.  Those who fail to generate sufficient income for the government to fund the services they use are subject to penalties.  One of the penalties the government used to inflict on people was sterilization. \n Further along in the article, Lombardo says, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a bunch of evil people running around. Many of these people really wanted to alleviate suffering.\u201d \n I can\u2019t be the only one to see the arrogance in this statement.  We \u201calleviate suffering\u201d by denying the reproductive rights of individuals whom we\u2019ve already devalued?  How does this \u201calleviate suffering?\u201d  How does the government assuming the power to control reproduction \u201calleviate suffering?\u201d \n Besides which, evil is not merely a factor of our intentions\u2014as the clich\u00e9 goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions\u2014but a product of what we do.  When we do evil things and justify these things to ourselves by devaluing those we do these things to\u2014well, that\u2019s evil.  It just is. \n But, of course, Lombardo is not alone in his willingness to continue justifying these abhorrent practices.  Mary Kilburn, a retired psychologist who worked for the North Carolina\u2019s Social Services Department from 1969 to 1980, said she and her co-workers believed \u201cwe were doing a really helpful thing.\u201d  She doesn\u2019t seem to understand that her belief doesn\u2019t make it so.  According to this article, \u201cShe said it has been a shock to see their work vilified because so many families welcomed the procedure at the time.\u201d \n Families are often convinced by doctors they trust to do things they shouldn\u2019t.  We can\u2019t all be experts on everything that could be medically significant in our lives.  We have to rely on those who are experts for sound advice.  But sometimes those people are wrong.  Sometimes the doctors are wrong, sometimes the parents are wrong, and sometimes the state is wrong. \n \u201cI looked at it not as something being done to them, but something being done for them,\u201d Kilburn said. \n And that\u2019s how we justify the evil we do.  We turn people into \u201cthem,\u201d and the \u201cus\u201d knows what\u2019s good for \u201cthem,\u201d so we do it to \u201cthem\u201d whether they want it or not.

{"date": "May 20, 2011", "body": "\r\n Waiting for Superman  is a thought-provoking documentary.\u00a0 Artistically, I think the filmmaker did a good job of creating a narrative arc and providing a dense piece, full of information. \u00a0However, I would caution any viewer from \u201cbuying\u201d the message entirely.\u00a0 The film was full of information; some of that information was factual and some of that information was opinion. \u00a0The danger is that much of the opinion was presented as facts.\u00a0 It\u2019s difficult to sort the two out without extensive research, so the entirety should be viewed with skepticism. \n One thing I find very important in this film is that they stress how essential  good teachers  are to the education of children, but how the system\u2014including, but not limited to the teachers\u2019 unions and politicians that keep bad teachers in their positions\u2014is dysfunctional.\u00a0 That focus, that differentiation is very important. \n Before writing this, I read quite a few scathing critiques.\u00a0 Not surprisingly, many if not all of these critiques were written by people who have a vested interest in the status quo.\u00a0 I would recommend against \u201cbuying\u201d their messages as well, for much the same reason.\u00a0 Facts and opinions are not the same, and yet both sides present their opinions as if they were facts.\u00a0 This is unethical and it is not done in the best interests of the recipients of these services, namely the children.\u00a0 Furthermore, over-simplifying and filtering an opponent\u2019s message in order to set up a straw-man\u2014which is what most of the critiques I read did\u2014is unethical and logically fallible.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking Critical Thinking 101 here, so it\u2019s especially sad that it was done by our teachers and administrators who should know better.\u00a0 Finally, while these critiques occasionally would admit the problem is real, none of them offered a solution besides pushing forward with what we know doesn\u2019t work.\u00a0 These people are barriers to change and, for the sake of our children, change is necessary. \n That does not mean that the changes proposed in the film are as solid and successful and  inclusive  as the makers of  Waiting for Superman  would have us to believe.\u00a0 The narrator of the film referred to \u201cevery child,\u201d meaning that even poor children and children \u201clost\u201d in the worst neighborhoods should have access to a top-quality education.\u00a0 And that\u2019s fine.\u00a0 I\u2019m on-board with that message.\u00a0 BUT that message does NOT include every child.\u00a0 This film failed in addressing the needs of every child with the filmmaker\u2019s choice to exclude special education from the discussion and from his documentary.\u00a0 The discussion of quality education  must  address the needs of all children!\u00a0 That not only includes the poor performers, but also children with special educational needs that require educational services other children do not need.\u00a0 \n Granted, that issue is not the point of the documentary.\u00a0 However, it is my opinion that it should not be a separate issue.\u00a0 Successful schools are schools that can meet the needs of all their students.\u00a0 Changes in education cannot exclude the needs of children with special educational needs, including those who are behind due school failure and those who need special services to succeed in any school setting.\u00a0 We must acknowledge that \u201cwhat works\u201d for many children will not and cannot work for ALL children.\u00a0 There is no single SOLUTION.\u00a0 \u00a0This presentation, this complete absence of all things special education, damages the credibility of the entire documentary in my opinion; and yet, reading so many negative critiques of the film that offer no solutions, no alternatives, and no change leaves me feeling that we\u2019re right back where we started.\u00a0 It was even in the film.\u00a0 This dialogue is not about the kids.\u00a0 Instead, it\u2019s about the adults, each with their own bias and their own self-interest and their own ideas. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/05/review-waiting-for-superman/", "title": "Review"},

they are not interested (or, maybe, not able) to share their pretend or imaginative games.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t mimicking us; which, to be honest, would not involve tea parties anyway.\u00a0 They are playing the way they want to, whether that\u2019s retelling stories they love or coming up with their own intricate little scenarios.\u00a0 It\u2019s still play. \n Last week, I saw Ben camped out in the front window with a toy train, piles of dried beans, and an egg beater.\u00a0 He was playing:\u00a0 He held the egg beater over the train and tried to drive the train in a straight line without hitting the piles of beans (which were directly on the \u201ctrack\u201d).\u00a0 I have no idea what was going through his head, but it was definitely play.\u00a0 There was no way for me to join in\u2014when I tried, he flashed me one of those looks that said \u201cyou\u2019re invading my territory, Mom, go away\u201d\u2014but it was  still  play.\u00a0 It was still imaginative.\u00a0 It was still pretend.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t appropriate or acceptable or whatever. \n The heart of imagination isn\u2019t what\u2019s acceptable, appropriate, familiar or recognizable.\u00a0 It\u2019s the unknown, the new, the changed, the wondrous.\u00a0 So, yeah, my boys\u2019 play can be kind of rigid.\u00a0 But their rigidity serves their play.\u00a0 The idea of \u201cappropriate play\u201d is equally rigid, but only seems to serve adults\u2019 comfort zones\u2014not a child\u2019s imagination. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/05/what-does-play-look-like/", "title": "What Does \u201cPlay\u201d Look Like?"},

\n Throughout the reception, I had the opportunity to spend quality time with both of my cousins, which is what I wanted most, and it was wonderful to reconnect.\u00a0 I got to meet the groom and I also got to meet my other cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and it was just a wonderful experience.\u00a0 They\u2019re both great guys and I\u2019m happy for my cousins\u2019 happiness with their lives. \n That night, we went home and I also got to spend some time with my uncle and aunt.\u00a0 I got to see a side of my uncle that I never really saw, which was also wonderful.\u00a0 He\u2019s kind of a gruff man and\u2014considering my take-them-as-they-act sense of perception\u2014I never really saw the subtle undertones to his personality.\u00a0 Seeing him dancing with his daughter (not well, but joyfully and proudly) was a window into something else entirely.\u00a0 By that point in the evening I\u2019d already suspected that there were those undertones that I had missed, but seeing them dance and seeing him smile was like watching a window opening.\u00a0 After that, I was able to pick up a lot more of those undertones, and it was kind of like getting to know my uncle all over again. \n The next morning, I saw even more of that.\u00a0 We got to talking about the boys, and while my mother struggled to get him to understand a particular detail, I was able to step in and express it in another way, a way that allowed him to understand.\u00a0 It felt good to watch the shift from ignorance to understanding.\u00a0 Not that I blame him for the ignorance\u2014He has never met the boys nor has he had any professional experience with people with autism, so how could he know?\u2014but seeing that opening\u2026priceless. \n On our way back, we took a leisurely route that my mother called an \u201cadventure.\u201d\u00a0 It was different, outside the comfort zone, but hey\u2014I associate \u201cadventure\u201d with an adrenaline rush, and I get more adrenaline from playing with my boys\u2014but to her it was an adventure, and I respect that.\u00a0 She was outside her comfort zone.\u00a0 It kind of made me realize that I\u2019ve lived so long outside my comfort zone lately that I\u2019m not even sure where it is any more.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if that means my comfort zone has expanded that much, or if I\u2019ll have to re-find it one of these days.\u00a0 This, of course, was Mother\u2019s Day, so I was able to spend some leisurely time driving with and talking with my mother.\u00a0 Precious. \n Then, we came home.\u00a0 The boys were so glad to see me!\u00a0 All the sweeter for the missing-them part of the trip.\u00a0 The hugs, the kisses, and all the ways they show their love were just perfect.\u00a0 Willy made me a card and Alex and Ben had PECS cards for me in their backpacks.\u00a0 So, they made it through, not just me being gone but also through the adaptations that were necessary. \n The boys are getting older.\u00a0 They are more able to adjust.\u00a0 And seeing how they\u2019re growing and maturing is the best Mother\u2019s Day present of all. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/05/mothers-weekend/", "title": "Mothers\u2019 Weekend"},

Vince, another  wheelchair-bound  youth, watches wistfully nearby.\u201d \n \u201cThe doctor dodges Olivia and Peter, who find the thief's partially dissected corpse ... and a walk-in freezer containing more bodies. All had toxic levels of osmium in their blood - and  suffered from muscular dystrophy .\u201d \n I\u2019ll give them credit for trying\u2014I think the creators of the show really did try to express something of value\u2014but, they failed to overcome their own ablist assumptions, which spoiled the final effect.\u00a0 In essence, it is not the father\u2019s motivation or his assumptions that are questioned, but the lengths to which he would go\u2014sacrificing other people\u2019s sons to save his own\u2014that are discouraged.\u00a0 The final confrontation between father and son cannot make up for the majority of the episode, which reinforced the assumption that people with disabilities are dying to become able-bodied and justifiably so. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fox.com/fringe/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1396022/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005045/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633604/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1896248/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714698/", "http://www.fox.com/fringe/recaps/season-3/episode-16/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/03/review-fringe-os/", "title": "Review: "},
{"date": "March 18, 2011", "body": "\r\n ASAN  has issued a warning and a call for action. \u00a0You can read a brief overview  here  if you did not get the message. \n ASAN has many valid concerns and complaints about this proposal.\u00a0 Generalizing any behavioral pattern based on poor research is unwise and irresponsible.\u00a0 From a social justice perspective, attributing a diagnosis to a group of people for whom the diagnosis is accurate to an unknown percentage of the population is an act of stereotyping, which further demeans a minority group and raises serious doubts about the integrity of the medical community.\u00a0 Furthermore, \u201cwandering\u201d as a medical diagnosis seems questionable in and of itself. \n However, as a parent of three children who have exhibited wandering behaviors, I must also object with the language ASAN used to motivate their supporters.\u00a0 First and foremost, I think it is inaccurate to assume this diagnosis will \u201cencourage\u201d schools to use restraints and isolation.\u00a0 These activities do occur and they are dangerous.\u00a0 They should be stopped.\u00a0 But they are used by unethical schools and staff for the sake of their own convenience; a diagnosis will not justify the use of these methods to otherwise ethical and caring individuals.\u00a0 Wandering is a safety risk and schools have a responsibility to address that risk and accommodate children who wander.\u00a0 All three of my boys have wandered at one point or another, and their schools have addressed those risks and found ways to accommodate them, not with restraints or seclusion, but by ensuring their safety and giving them appropriate opportunities to explore their environments.\u00a0 Parents and schools share responsibility for formulating an adequate and appropriate plan to address these concerns in a child\u2019s IEP.\u00a0 I also object to the suggestion that wandering is a reaction to \u201cabusive or sensorily overwhelming environments.\u201d\u00a0 While this can be the case, wandering is a behavior with many causes. \u00a0All the wandering I\u2019ve seen associated with autism has been about curiosity and lack of danger awareness.\u00a0 Children are curious.\u00a0 Those who lack danger awareness may seek to satisfy their curiosity in unsafe ways, including wandering.\u00a0 Associating wandering with abuse is far too reminiscent of the \u201crefrigerator mother\u201d theory and other ways that have been used to suggest poor parenting as the culprit for complex behaviors.\u00a0 Such a generalization can be just as dangerous as the one ASAN seeks to prevent. \n It can take less than 30 seconds for a potential wanderer to get out and away from an unsecure environment.\u00a0 Hyper-vigilance does not equal safety in such an environment.\u00a0 Measures need to be taken, but they need to be taken in a respectful manner, i.e. not relying on restraints and seclusion.\u00a0 Attention should also be paid to the environment itself.\u00a0 If the environment is uncomfortable, then corrections should be made to that environment.\u00a0 But caregivers must also be aware of other factors, like curiosity and limited awareness of dangers, when addressing safety concerns for a child who wanders. \n Wandering is a real problem, and it can be terrifying.\u00a0 Some children who wander go missing for days before he or she is found, if he or she is ever found or found alive.\u00a0 That\u2019s terrifying and harmful for everyone involved.\u00a0 Even if a child is missing for only a few hours or even a few minutes, it\u2019s terrifying.\u00a0 Yet it serves no good purpose to turn this challenge into a stereotype.\u00a0 It\u2019s an individual issue and the solutions are individual and specific.\u00a0 It is irresponsible for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to attempt to make wandering\u2014a behavior attributable to many factors\u2014a medical diagnosis.\u00a0 It is irresponsible for schools and other organizations to use such a diagnosis to justify harmful practices.\u00a0 It is also irresponsible of ASAN to attempt to motivate their supporters by noting possible worst-case scenarios from a social justice perspective without also noting that there are real concerns about the safety of some individuals with autism. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=130", "http://www.shiftjournal.com/2011/03/14/wandering-a-dangerous-new-proposal/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/03/wandering-a-warning/", "title": "Wandering: A Warning"},

{"date": "March 7, 2011", "body": "\r\n The phrase \u201cmaking friends\u201d never really worked for me.\u00a0 It evokes thoughts of imaginary friends or maybe Frankenstein\u2019s monster.\u00a0 Procreation aside, you don\u2019t make people and friends are people\u2014complete and separate beings in and of themselves. \n I\u2019m not much more comfortable with the idea of \u201cmaking friendships\u201d either.\u00a0 When you make a cake, you do it and it\u2019s done.\u00a0 You can even have your cake and eat it, too.\u00a0 Of course, then you run out of cake and have to make another one.\u00a0 If you run out of friendship, one of you is likely doing something wrong.\u00a0 \n Anyway, my point is that I prefer to build friendships, to grow them.\u00a0 So, when I hear school staff use the word friend as synonymous with \u201cclassmate\u201d or \u201cpeer,\u201d it bothers me.\u00a0 They really aren\u2019t synonymous.\u00a0 Peers and classmates are something you have no control over, whereas you choose who your friends are, and you build relationships with those people. \n Of course, Alex and Ben don\u2019t really do that.\u00a0 They still prefer to play by themselves or play with adults.\u00a0 They show little genuine friendship to peers or classmates. \n Not so for Willy.\u00a0 While his teachers and other school staff still use \u201cfriend\u201d in this false-synonymous manner, Willy has some real friends.\u00a0 Some of these friendships have been nurtured in safe environments, like our home and the homes of our friends. Others have been nurtured in more typical environments, including school.\u00a0 Last week I saw some of the fruit of Willy\u2019s efforts to grow his friendships. \n Shortly before the bus was supposed to arrive, we got a phone call.\u00a0 It\u2019s Willy.\u00a0 He\u2019s calling from school.\u00a0 Meaning, he\u2019s not on the bus.\u00a0 At first, I was a bit put off by this.\u00a0 But then he explained that he\u2019d been invited over to a friend\u2019s house and he wanted to go.\u00a0 This was a first.\u00a0 He\u2019s spent time at the homes of friends he\u2019s made in safe environments, but he\u2019s never gone over to a friend\u2019s house when he only knew that friend from school. \n It seemed something of a first for his friend, too, so I had to coach them both in how it works.\u00a0 For example, the friend should get permission to have someone over first.\u00a0 Then, I give Willy permission.\u00a0 Then, we discuss travel arrangements.\u00a0 In the end, both kids got approval and I picked the boys up and took them both to the friend\u2019s house. \n Willy had a lot of fun, though the experience was not without struggles.\u00a0 All things considered\u2026it was a big leap in development.\u00a0 Up until now, Willy\u2019s out-of-school contact with his classmates has been limited to the occasional birthday party.\u00a0 But this\u2026Wow! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/03/growing-friendships/", "title": "Growing Friendships"},

{"date": "January 10, 2011", "body": "\r\n On October 26, 2010, I wrote a scathing  post  about  The Dark Fiction Spotlight  for hosting an autism anthology that stated in the guidelines, \u201cAnything that will offend Autism Speaks will offend me and will not be considered.\u201d \n I didn\u2019t really expect a response from the magazine.\u00a0 I certainly didn\u2019t expect the response that I received from Stephen Roberts: \n I stumbled upon this blog by chance and it pains me that this is the image you\u2019ve gained of myself, my associations and my magazine, The Dark Fiction Spotlight. \n I wish to tell you about the autism anthology that will never be.\u00a0 \n [You read the rest of the  comment here .] \n Well, to say the least, this required a retraction.\u00a0 But I was curious.\u00a0 I wanted to know more.\u00a0 So, I contacted Stephen Roberts, and was granted an interview. \n You stopped participating in the autism anthology you were working on with Autism Speaks.\u00a0 Where did this project come about and what ultimately made you make the decision to pull out of the project? \n Well, to be honest, I\u2019m new to the politics and such of autism. All I knew was what I learned from my nephews as I watched them grow. I was tapped by a publishing company preparing to launch that was to be run by a good friend of mine and she said she wanted to do the occasional charity anthology, to which I immediately thought of autism and my nephews. \n Once announced, I received a great deal of support from the literary community, but also an outcry as to whom I\u2019d associated myself with and more so my nephews, as they were to be involved in the cover art. \n I immediately hit the web and started looking up every forum on autism I could and I found out that autism speaks.org didn\u2019t represent my views on autism to say the least. \n You are still interested in pursuing a similar project.\u00a0 What are you looking for in recipients to the funds you raise? \n I would still love to do something to help out the families touched by autism, namely the education of children and even the continued education of adults. I have found that many people write off those with autism, whereas all they need is a bit of patience from us to show us how brilliant they are. \n I\u2019m open to collaborate with somebody that has the vision and perhaps even the connections to get the funds earned to the proper place. \n I also feel like we need more sites that represent the community of those touched by autism and not just the same biochemical explanations. More communication, less misinformation. \n You are helping your sister raise your nephews, who have diagnoses of autism.\u00a0 How has that changed or shaped your views on autism?\u00a0 \n Frankly, I knew little to nothing about autism several years ago, but when my oldest nephew was diagnosed (he\u2019s 8-years-old now, his brother is 6-years-old), I sort of understood it, but mostly just did what I had to do for them on a day to day basis. I know their autistic, but to me they\u2019ve never been \u201cspecial\u201d or hindered by anything. \n I guess we (my family) must be doing something right, as their schools consider them to be gifted and they grow both socially and academically in leaps and bounds.\u00a0 \n What do you consider the most important areas for research in autism? \n Again, to me I believe it to be all about education. Isn\u2019t it a magical idea that my nephews could be given a shot that would immediately \u201cfix them\u201d, giving them perfect speech and altered personalities? \n I do not mean to insult anybody on their views, but I just personally feel that education is key to the benefit of an autistic child as to ensure a healthy and prosperous adulthood. \n I\u2019m always open to learn more about the study of autism and welcome all opinions and websites to learn from. \n If you had the opportunity to interact autistic adults, what would you most like to learn from them? \n \u00a0If I could ask anything, it would be what I can potentially look forward to in the growth of my nephews. I\u2019d love to know their views on the political stances taken on autism and the politicians who seem to be asking everyone but them. \n I know that autism doesn\u2019t make you \u201cslow\u201d or anything to the like, but in fact simply one who views this world from a different perspective. That\u2019s something special in itself and anybody should want to converse and learn from them. \n I hold my nephews to the highest of standards as far as their futures go and I\u2019d just love to be able to know the stories of others and what they\u2019ve achieved as individuals. Much like how a high school student might want to know what to expect in college, I\u2019d just love to see what\u2019s next.\u00a0 \n What change do you consider most important in how we, as a society and a world, address the challenges presented by autism? \n I think we all just need to listen more. For one, I think that the whole puzzle piece symbolism is absolutely insulting. I don\u2019t know if this is the consensus of the community, but once I really thought about it I didn\u2019t like it. It implies that they\u2019re not human or just don\u2019t fit with us as a society. \n What I\u2019ve seen with my nephew\u2019s teachers is that patience is key; all students are different, but they will tell you what they need if you\u2019re willing to listen. No assumptions, no exceptions.\u00a0 \n For my readers who also write speculative fiction, can you give any tips on how to break into The Dark Fiction Spotlight?\u00a0 (Also, do you have any idea when submissions will open again?) \n Well, I wouldn\u2019t say it takes much more than a love for your craft and the darker side of fiction to fit in with us folk. We\u2019re open to most concepts as long as it\u2019s dark in nature and the only thing we do not like are those who don\u2019t take writing seriously. \n We as a group do not believe in writing to be a hobby anymore than it is a talent to be born with. All the best writers I know don\u2019t sleep some nights as their so obsessed with their craft. \u00a0Unhealthy? Perhaps. Does it pay off at times? Yes. \n But all in all, Daniel, Stacy, Thadd and I are pretty easy folks to work with, at least I think so. \n Unfortunately The Dark Fiction Spotlight is on hiatus, but not in a negative sense. We\u2019re developing a solid game plan to take our 4theluv/contest money e-zine and evolving it into a print/digital magazine at pro rates. This is something we take very seriously and do not wish to rush just yet. We\u2019re also considering anthologies, contests and things to the like on the site until said launch, so please do keep in touch with us and or visit the site to see what\u2019s going on. \n The site: \n www.thedarkfiction.com \n TDFS submissions/query e-mail: \n tdfspublication.subs@gmail.com \n While I cannot apologize for my gut reaction, I sincerely apologize to Stephen Roberts,  The Dark Fiction Spotlight , and my readers for not researching the proposed anthology more extensively.\u00a0 I know I\u2019ll be check in with  The Dark Fiction Spotlight  from time to time, and I hope you do as well.\u00a0 And I hope Stephen Roberts gets to edit the anthology he was hoping for! \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thedarkfiction.com/", "http://www.thedarkfiction.com/", "http://stephanieallencrist.com:2095/3rdparty/squirrelmail/src/compose.php?send_to=tdfspublication.subs@gmail.com"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/01/retraction-interview-with-stephen-roberts-from-the-dark-fiction-spotlight/", "title": "Retraction"},
{"date": "March 25, 2011", "body": "\r\n We were in the waiting area at the doctor\u2019s office. \u00a0Ben needed a check-up before the doctor could sign the liability release form, which was required by the special horse-back riding center Ben and Alex are going to visit with their classmates.\u00a0 While I\u2019m rather doubtful that they\u2019ll get either Alex or Ben on a horse\u2026it\u2019s important that the boys go.\u00a0 It\u2019s important that they try. \n So, we were waiting.\u00a0 A young man in a wheelchair who also had visible disabilities of the cognitive/developmental variety was also waiting.\u00a0 Ben squirmed past him to scooch as close to the fish tanks as possible.\u00a0 The young man smiled and laughed, gesturing at a fish in the tank.\u00a0 Ben peered closely at another fish.\u00a0 They shared the same space and the same interest and they were both fine with that. \n Another little boy also occupied the waiting room.\u00a0 He seemed quite normal: talkative, inquisitive, and sociable.\u00a0 I watched Ben (while also giving him room to explore) from my place on the other side of the room to ensure he didn\u2019t become a threat to the young man.\u00a0 I overheard, from the other side of the room, the little boy\u2019s mother answer a question in a not-quiet-enough voice, saying, \u201cWell, there\u2019s probably something wrong with his brain.\u201d\u00a0 I cringed.\u00a0 The young man\u2019s mother didn\u2019t even flinch.\u00a0 Maybe she didn\u2019t hear.\u00a0 Maybe she was so absorbed with her son that she didn\u2019t listen.\u00a0 Maybe she was so used to it she\u2019d learned not to react.\u00a0 Before I could come up with a response, Ben was off and so was I. \n Later, after the young man had gone in to his appointment, the little boy came up to Ben and started talking to him.\u00a0 While Ben will speak on occasion, he does not engage in these random social exchanges yet.\u00a0 I told the little boy that Ben doesn\u2019t talk much.\u00a0 The little boy was rather disappointed.\u00a0 He seemed to want someone to engage him\u2014like entertainment, but with people.\u00a0 And the little boy compared Ben to \u201cthe big one.\u201d\u00a0 \n I suppose there are worse things he could have called the young man, but I couldn\u2019t help but cringe again.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but it seemed a very inhuman way to refer to another person. \n \u201cThe big one.\u201d\u00a0 Not \u201cthe big guy\u201d or \u201cthe older boy\u201d or even \u201cthe boy in the wheelchair.\u201d\u00a0 The little boy called the young man \u201cthe big one.\u201d \u00a0So impersonal, so dehumanizing, so much like a thing instead of a person. \n However busy Ben was being, I felt like this was a moment I couldn\u2019t pass up.\u00a0 So, I agreed that Ben was a lot like the young man\u2014neither of them talked much, but they both had their own interests and they liked to play.\u00a0 I told him Ben was autistic and that meant that he was still learning to talk.\u00a0 I also prompted Ben to say, \u201cPlease let me go,\u201d which is one of the phrases we\u2019ve been working on and one I knew Ben would be motivated to say, since I pulled him away from the spinning circles he had racing each other for the few seconds it took to give him the prompt, have him speak, and then let him go. \n Ben continued to play.\u00a0 The little boy continued to ask questions.\u00a0 I answered, building the concept of respecting people with differences slowly and subtly into our conversation.\u00a0 Neither the little boy nor his mother seemed to understand what I was doing; they weren\u2019t \u201cagainst\u201d it, but the idea of making \u201cothers\u201d seem familiar and likable seemed foreign to them. \n Behind me a mother sat with a boy who was too old to play with the preschool toys, but not quite as old as the young man.\u00a0 This mother engaged in our little exchange, adding her own comments and observations to reinforce the subtle message I was trying to share with the little boy.\u00a0 Her son didn\u2019t participate directly, but his smiles and facial expressions seemed to indicate that he \u201cgot\u201d it. \n Then, the little boy was called to his appointment and the moment was over.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if my efforts did any lasting good.\u00a0 But I hope so.\u00a0 For a moment, someone who was different was a person in this little boy\u2019s eyes.\u00a0 Ben didn\u2019t talk, but he played and singed and liked things the little boy could understand.\u00a0 All the while Ben played on, seemingly unaware.\u00a0 Perhaps it\u2019s a coincidence that Ben flashed a smile for the other mom sitting in the background.\u00a0 But maybe not.\u00a0 Ben doesn\u2019t speak much, but he understands a lot more than most people give him credit for (and I suspect the young man does, too).\u00a0 So, perhaps I taught my son a little about self-advocacy while reaching out to a little boy who needed a little help to see a person in someone who couldn\u2019t talk like him. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/03/the-big-one/", "title": "The Big One"},
{"date": "January 14, 2011", "body": "\r\n I recently read a post by Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg over at  Journeys with Autism  entitled \u201c Autism Parents: It\u2019s Time to Stand Up With Us .\u201d\u00a0 My reaction to this post was mixed. \n Rachel starts off addressing a very specific issue, namely parent who make comments like: \n How disappointed the person is to have an Autistic child \n How angry the person is that his or her Autistic child isn\u2019t \u201cperfect\u201d (and yes, that word gets thrown around a lot) \n How altogether unfair it is not to get the child the person dreamed of \n How getting an autism diagnosis is like finding out that someone has died \n How autism is analogous to a fatal disease \n Regular readers of this blog (and probably most irregular readers, as well) know I am not one of those parents.\u00a0 I do not make those comments.\u00a0 I believe those comments stem from parents focusing on themselves when they should be focused on their child.\u00a0 Self-centered parents make for maladjusted kids, regardless of their diagnosis or lack thereof.\u00a0 So, know that I am not defending these parents in any way. \n Rachel goes on to ask: \n Why do these people say these things? Do they think we\u2019re not listening? Do they think we don\u2019t have feelings? Do they think, in some secret place in their minds, that we really are second-class citizens, of no particular importance? Or do they consider us such a burden that they\u2019ve decided that their feelings trump ours? \n I\u2019m totally on board with that.\u00a0 Those questions\u2014and the way she develops them\u2014are important, worthwhile questions that stem from a very painful experience.\u00a0 I get that.\u00a0 I really do. \n Then, Rachel turns this reflection around by asking: \u201c What can we do to stop this from happening? \u201d\u00a0 Considering the title of her post, \u201cAutism Parents: It\u2019s Time to Stand Up With Us,\u201d I think we can assume the conclusions she draws. \n But\u2014and this is where I obviously stray from total agreement\u2014the trouble is it\u2019s much, much more complicated than that.\u00a0 See, the questions Rachel asks and the conclusion she draws creates the same line in the sand that those parents create.\u00a0 \n It\u2019s us/them thinking.\u00a0 And  that  is the problem. \n The challenges autistics present to society and the challenges society presents to autistics are  situational .\u00a0 A great big part of this awful situation is us/them thinking.\u00a0 The us/them thinking starts in the form of bigotry and misunderstanding, which leads in turn to us/them thinking in the form of autistics versus non-autistics.\u00a0 \n It\u2019s not us versus them.\u00a0  It\u2019s all of us. \u00a0 \n You see, I am not neurotypical.\u00a0 I do not identify as neurotypical.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not quite autistic either.\u00a0 And, you know what, I\u2019ve stopped going on certain autism blogs because of all the hate directed at  me  for not being one of  them .\u00a0 And I am one of those people Rachel hasn\u2019t seen calling out to other parents of autistic kids and telling them they language they\u2019re using is demeaning!\u00a0 Yet, I\u2019ve been hated off autism sites for not being autistic.\u00a0 That\u2019s us/them thinking. \n Rachel cites many other social movements.\u00a0 She states that it takes people on the inside and the outside of those groups to evoke the kind of social change that is necessary.\u00a0 She\u2019s right, but that doesn\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 And it doesn\u2019t happen by saying \u201cstand with us.\u201d\u00a0 It happens when the people involved\u2014both the people within and the people outside the minority group\u2014identify more with being people than they do with being inside or outside the minority group! \n So, when Rachel says, \u201cstand up with us,\u201d the \u201cus\u201d should refer to fellow advocates.\u00a0 Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t seem to be what she means.\u00a0 Rachel ends her post: \u201cSo if your heart is broken by the way the world treats your children, stand up for them by standing up with us. Their fate is inseparable from ours.\u201d \n I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 I don\u2019t agree.\u00a0  Our fate is inseparable. \u00a0 No  us , no  them , and no  yours .\u00a0 You cannot unite by dividing.\u00a0 You cannot join by categorizing.\u00a0 You cannot call together by alienating.\u00a0 The issues we all face are situational; it\u2019s not them versus us or us versus them. \n *takes a deep breath* \n See, I prefer stories.\u00a0 Stories can show, and showing can teach, and that just makes it all the more real, at least for me.\u00a0 So, let me leap back a few years and show you what I mean. \n Years ago, my children were in Early Childhood classes and the Birth to Three program (pre-school for children with special needs), because they had demonstrated developmental delays.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t know why, and nobody was very forthcoming with recommendations on where we could get additional help or *gasp* explanations.\u00a0 As my husband and I saw it, our children were developmental delayed and we were working hard to address those delays; since no more help or information was forthcoming, we did the best we could with what little we had. \n Then comes my sister-in-law\u2019s wedding.\u00a0 We were at a special dinner with \u201cjust the family,\u201d which happened to include a lot of people, including people I\u2019d met only at my own wedding and some others who I didn\u2019t remember ever meeting at all.\u00a0 The dinner was held in a long dining area at a local restaurant.\u00a0 It was loud, dark, busy, chaotic, and smelly (not bad smells, just a lot of them).\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t figured out how to cope with these situations very well myself yet, so you can imagine it did not go over very well with my un-accommodated autistic toddlers. \n *sigh*\u00a0 I look back at times like that and I cringe.\u00a0 I want to kick the self I was back then.\u00a0 I want to scream at me, saying, \u201cCan\u2019t you  see  what this is doing to your kids!?!\u201d \n The truth is I saw, but I didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0 I rely very much on words to process information.\u00a0 I can process ideas and feelings, but I rely on words to ground them in expressible reality.\u00a0 I  knew  I needed to get out of there and that my kids needed to get out of there, but I couldn\u2019t explain  why  we needed to get out there\u2014not to myself and certainly not to my family.\u00a0 So, I was stuck with the obligation of being there and keeping my kids there\u2026until we were all thoroughly melted down and had an excuse\u2014I mean, a  justifiable reason \u2014to leave. \n So, I look back and I want to kick myself, but I also forgive myself for my ignorance.\u00a0 I DID NOT KNOW.\u00a0 I COULD NOT KNOW.\u00a0 So, I rest assured I did the best I could, however poor my best happened to be at the time. \n Anyway, the really momentous thing did not happen until after we left the room.\u00a0 My mom, who was invited to help with the kids, and I took the boys out into the chilly, blissfully quiet outdoors, so my lovely children could scream their bloody heads off in peace.\u00a0 Because, of course, they were past the point of consolation; they were thoroughly melted down.\u00a0 \n First, my mother in law came out, full of concern.\u00a0 Then, my grandmother-in-law came out, full of concern.\u00a0 After a little while with us, my grandmother-in-law took me aside, with someone else holding the fussy child, and said very softly, very gently: \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u00a0 You  need  help.\u201d\u00a0 \n Yes, I knew that on some level.\u00a0 Yes, we\u2019d tried and failed to get that help.\u00a0 But this woman was the matriarch of my husband\u2019s family, and had lived her life as a nurse to boot.\u00a0 This woman had authority, and the soft, gentle way she said those words added more impact to the words than shouting could have done. \n Now, I want you to think about what she said for a moment. \n *\u2026.thinking\u2026thinking\u2026thinking\u2026* \n Okay, how \u2018bout I put it this way:\u00a0 She didn\u2019t say \u201cyour kids are monsters and you need to get them fixed.\u201d\u00a0 Believe me, the way they were acting there are a lot of people who would have said something to that effect and they all seem to hang out in grocery stores. \n \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d\u00a0 Not: \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with your kids\u201d or \u201cyour kids are broken\u201d or any of the number of insensitive, painful ways the subject is broached to many, many parents of children with autism.\u00a0 \u201cYou  need  help.\u201d\u00a0 Not: \u201cTake them to the doctor\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t you give them a pill or something\u201d or \u201cyou really need to teach your kids some manners\u201d or the many other painful things parents of children with autism hear on a regular basis. \n Those precious words\u2014\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u00a0 You  need  help.\u201d\u2014were the foundation for us.\u00a0 We were very, very lucky to have that as our foundation. \n I\u2019m not saying all the good we\u2019ve done for our children can be laid at my grandmother-in-law\u2019s feet.\u00a0 Mark and I certainly have done our parts, and the information we\u2019ve gotten from many parents of autistic children and many autistics themselves has helped a great, great deal when it comes to us having done/continuing to do our part.\u00a0 \n But she gave us the foundation we needed to look at the  situation  as the problem.\u00a0 Very, very lucky, for us and for our kids. \n *another deep breath* \n I agree with Rachel that it is intolerable that people with autism have grown up and continue to grow up believing they are some kind of tragedy.\u00a0 That has to stop.\u00a0 But, it\u2019s not going to stop with us/them thinking.\u00a0 It stops when we force ourselves to look at the situation as the problem, and how we\u2014all of us who care about autistics\u2014can address that problematic situation. \n The problem is not the autistics.\u00a0 The problem is not the parents of the autistics, who may or may not be neurotypical.\u00a0 The problem is that we divide ourselves, because we believe we are fundamentally different.\u00a0 We\u2019re not.\u00a0 We are fundamentally the same with individual differences that make each and every one of us special, worthwhile human beings. \n We can stand together, as advocates and as emissaries.\u00a0 But we cannot stand with you; we are you and you are us.\u00a0 Some of us just haven\u2019t figured that out yet. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journeyswithautism.com/", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2011/01/08/autism-parents-its-time-to-stand-up/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/01/stand-with-whom/", "title": "Stand With Whom?"},
{"date": "September 3, 2009", "body": "\r\n Comparing and contrasting Willy\u2019s educational experience with that of his brothers always makes me a little sad.\u00a0 Willy is fortunate in that he\u2019s found a way to take the world as it is and interacts on a level that most people understand.\u00a0 He\u2019s very much autistic and still faces many challenges in how he interacts and what he\u2019s considered able to do and what he is able to do (which are not always the same).\u00a0 But, he has a strong support system at Roosevelt and is able to compensate for most of his differences to succeed in a socially recognizable way.\u00a0 Alex and Ben are on a different track.\u00a0 They do not demonstrate a sufficient amount of self-control, communication, or interaction to participate (as per the Janesville school system) in an integrated environment.\u00a0 Their educational needs are met in a segregated classroom called the CD room \u2013 for cognitively disabled.\u00a0 The fact that they are not, in fact, cognitively disabled plays little significance in this designation, because they are not able to communicate their intelligence in an academically recognized fashion.\u00a0 Roosevelt is not equipped to meet their needs, so they are sent to attend school together at Kennedy. \n I don\u2019t mean to slam Roosevelt or Kennedy.\u00a0 The decision here is made at a level neither school can change.\u00a0 Both are goods schools with good people and both try to service their students as they are able.\u00a0 But I cannot help but remember my own time in school. \n In one of several grade schools I attended there was a student with Down \u2019s syndrome.\u00a0 I only saw her on the playground and many of the students made fun of her.\u00a0 She first came to my notice when I saw another child push her for no apparent reason other than her poor balance meant she\u2019d fall with only a little push.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t usually see things like that, because a friend and I would go off as far in the field as we could to play our own games of make-believe.\u00a0 This girl would always come out a few minutes later than us, so we\u2019d already be gone.\u00a0 After seeing our classmate push her down, we went to her an invited her to come play with us.\u00a0 She couldn\u2019t quite follow our game, but enjoyed our company.\u00a0 \n In junior high, I was somewhat segregated.\u00a0 They called the classes I took \u201cgifted and talented\u201d or \u201cdifferentiated.\u201d\u00a0 They were the opposite of CD classes, designed for students who excelled instead of those who struggled.\u00a0 I enjoyed these classes, because I was challenged academically for the first time in a long while.\u00a0 Yet, integrating with non-differentiated students in the regular classes was difficult.\u00a0 I was set apart, and they knew it.\u00a0 Most of my fellow differentiated students had the social skills to compensate, but I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I was an outsider.\u00a0 Not like any of them and being segregated for most of my classes seemed to make that worse. \n In all my time going to school and in all the different schools I attended, I was only aware of the one girl with cognitive disabilities.\u00a0 The rest were kept out of sight, but I know now there had to have been more.\u00a0 Kennedy doesn\u2019t try to keep Alex and Ben out of sight.\u00a0 Each child is assigned to an age-appropriate classroom with their typically developing peers.\u00a0 Each will visit this classroom as their schedules allow.\u00a0 And, at my recommendation, last year on Fridays one of Alex\u2019s peers would come to the CD classroom to visit him.\u00a0 This became a special treat that his peers looked forward to and enjoyed. \n So, progress is being made.\u00a0 Yet, I know fully integrated schools exist and that they can work for the benefit of all the students.\u00a0 I know that children with special needs should not be kept out of sight for the comfort of the bigots.\u00a0 I remember sitting in school, surrounded by my predominantly white peers, and learning about the history of segregated schools.\u00a0 I remember when I first learned what happened in Little Rock.\u00a0 I remember raising my hand and asking, quite honestly, \u201cBut why would they be angry that the kids wanted to go to the good school?\u201d\u00a0 I didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0 In a way, I still don\u2019t.\u00a0 I can wrap my head around racism and bigotry.\u00a0 I see it as wholly illogical, but I understand that it is driven by emotion not intellect.\u00a0 I cannot wrap my heart around it.\u00a0 I cannot understand those emotions that drive racism and bigotry, however well I can label them:\u00a0 hatred, fear, disgust.\u00a0 I understand that people crave a sense of commonality and that those outside that commonality face prejudice.\u00a0 That it is so, and understanding that it is so, doesn\u2019t help me to understand why. \n I\u2019m thankful for the progress that has been made and look ahead sadly to how much more must be done.\u00a0 But, my boys are lucky.\u00a0 They have a chance.\u00a0 So many have their chances stolen from them by prejudice and hatred.\u00a0 I cannot help but think my failure to understand leaves me powerless to affect needed changes.\u00a0 But I will try.\u00a0 Everyone deserves the chance to live, to be educated, to grow, to develop \u2013 without artificial roadblocks keeping them from their own potential. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "January 18, 2011", "body": "\r\n The first proposed chapter for my book, tentatively entitled \u201c Neurodiversity  at Work: A Manager\u2019s Guide,\u201d is designed to introduce the concept of neurodiversity in a business-friendly context. \n Most of what is written about neurodiversity is from a social justice perspective.\u00a0 While there are very real reasons for this, a consequence is that information about neurodiversity is not presented in the language most business people speak.\u00a0 So this first chapter will ground the relevance of the social justice issue to the business world by translating the social justice language to the business language. \n What does it mean to be  neurologically diverse  or  neurodiverse ? \n As used in this book,  neurologically diverse  and  neurodiverse  are two different terms.\u00a0 Understanding both is important to understanding how neurodiversity impacts the workplace. \n Neurologically  references the structures and mechanisms of the nervous system, including the brain, and the effects the nervous system has on how people experience life.\u00a0  Diversity  references the fact that there is no one neurological state.\u00a0 We all are neurologically diverse. \n Neurodiverse , on the other hand, represents a sense of identity.\u00a0 Someone is  neurodiverse , in this sense, rather than being  neurotypical .\u00a0 Societies tend to prefer a certain set of neurological traits; this set of preferred traits is perceived as neurotypical.\u00a0 In some societies, including the United States, traits that deviate from this preferred \u201cnorm\u201d are perceived as damaged or insufficient.\u00a0 This creates stigma and an environment of prejudice against anyone who demonstrates  neurodiverse  traits.\u00a0 This prejudice can be extreme, such as the prejudice faced by people with so-called low functioning autism, which is considered an extreme deviation from the norm.\u00a0 This prejudice can also be relatively mild, such as the prejudice faced by people with depression, which is considered a less extreme deviation from the norm. \n So, what does it mean to be neurologically diverse?\u00a0 It\u2019s means you\u2019re a human being.\u00a0 Humanity is neurologically diverse.\u00a0 What does it mean to be neurodiverse?\u00a0 It means you are part of a perceived \u201cundesirable minority\u201d and will face stigma and prejudice as a member of the workforce.\u00a0 This prejudice and stigma will continue unless managers learn to manage a neurologically diverse workforce or you learn to hide your undesirable differences.\u00a0 It also means you may carry a label of mental disorder, as your neurotype may have been medicalized due to its undesirability.\u00a0 \n At least an  estimated  26.2% of the American adult population could identify as neurodiverse, or one in four adults.\u00a0 According to the 2004 census, that\u2019s an estimated 57.7 million people in America alone.\u00a0 This minority is too large and too important to ignore, but the business world often ignores the needs of this population. \n What is  neurodiversity ? \n Neurodiversity  is about the confluence of two distinct beliefs: \n 1) People are naturally and normally neurologically different.\u00a0 Some of these natural, normal differences are labeled \u201cabnormal,\u201d \u201cdisorders,\u201d \u201csyndromes,\u201d or other value-laden labels that interferes with our ability to understand the different subsets of human neurology. \n 2) Human beings are valuable, in all their diversity, in and of themselves. \n As such,  neurodiversity  is a social justice movement that is affiliated with the disability rights arm of the civil rights movement.\u00a0  Neurodiversity  is also strongly tied to autistic advocates, who advocate for acceptance and accommodations for autism, so they can better interact with societies that devalue the autistic ways of being.\u00a0 As used in this text,  neurodiversity  is not exclusive to autistics, but encompasses the wide set of neurodiverse individuals who participate in the workforce.\u00a0 This includes individuals with autism, mood disorders, attention deficit disorders, and other neurotypes that may or may not involve a medical diagnosis. \n How does this social concept apply to the business environment? \n Consumers are neurologically diverse.\u00a0 Workers are neurologically diverse.\u00a0 Business is, by extension, an interaction of neurologically diverse individuals for profit. \n Understanding, respecting, and accommodating neurological diversity is an important business survival strategy as the world changes in the face of social pressures from neurodiversity advocates.\u00a0 Businesses have long struggled with issues stemming from a neurologically diverse workforce, but have yet to come to terms with these issues. \n The time is now; because, as pressure mounts, if businesses cannot or will not respond, consumer and legislative pressure will  force  businesses to respond in ways that suit bureaucratic form rather than the flexible business environment and the needs of your workers. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america/index.shtml"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/01/the-neurodiverse-workforce/", "title": "The Neurodiverse Workforce"},

{"date": "January 21, 2011", "body": "\r\n I am currently taking a course on writing poetry.\u00a0 Writing poetry is how I gained my teachers\u2019 interests in my writing ability when I was in grade school.\u00a0 The first piece I had published for pay was a poem.\u00a0 While I want to improve my understanding of poetry forms and improve my craft, I\u2019m not under-confident in my ability to write poetry. \n So, it was a surprise when I read the following passage from my textbook: \n At the pedagogical heart of this book is the notion that no matter what kind of poetry anyone wishes to write (whether it\u2019s free verse, narrative, formal, spoken word, ect.), a poet must paint a picture in the mind\u2019s eye of the reader. \n ( The Mind\u2019s Eye  by Kevin Clark, 2008, pg. xii) \n Furthermore, Kevin Clark relates imagery\u2014a writing device used to evoke sensory experience in writing\u2014directly to the experience of a mind\u2019s eye. \n You might be asking: What\u2019s the big deal? \n Well, to be entirely blunt, had I read a statement like that when I was in middle school, I would never have tried to write poetry.\u00a0 Had I read it in high school or in the first five years after I graduated high school, I would never have written the poem that I had published.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because my mind has no eye.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see images in my mind.\u00a0 I cannot call up an image of my children\u2019s face by mental will power, let alone imagine an  image  of something I\u2019ve never seen.\u00a0 \n As this textbook is written, Kevin Clark assumes \u201cthe mind\u2019s eye\u201d is a universal experience.\u00a0 It may be a common experience, but it\u2019s not universal.\u00a0 By relating the mind\u2019s eye to effective imagery, he risks alienating anyone who doesn\u2019t experience mental pictures.\u00a0 Someone like me. \n It is incorrect to assume that because I do not experience mental picture that I cannot this read, write, or evoke imagery.\u00a0 Imagery is an important writing tool, but the mind\u2019s eye is not the only way to experience it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think in pictures; I think exclusively in words, emotions, and ideas.\u00a0 Written imagery translates words into images in the mind\u2019s eye; my mind requires no such translation.\u00a0 Visual imagery, on the other hand, requires translation for me.\u00a0 For example, impressionism is an artistic genre that I require translation to understand, and often cannot appreciate. \n I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find Kevin Clark\u2019s book useful.\u00a0 In fact, I already have.\u00a0 However, there\u2019s a risk of alienation when a person in authority assumes a common experience is universal, and then leaps to connect that common experience with  the  way to do something.\u00a0 Clark made this mistake.\u00a0 \n I proved to myself I could write effective poetry before I ever read this book.\u00a0 I also gained an understanding of myself as a neurodiverse individual, and have learned not to accept the limits others try to attribute to my abilities.\u00a0 (Which is entirely different from recognizing and accepting my own limitations.)\u00a0 \n While Clark\u2019s assumption will not alienate me from poetry, I worry that it might prevent others who experience sensory impressions the way I do from writing poetry.\u00a0 I imagine that if I had been more vulnerable to the author\u2019s influence\u2014because I was less sure of my own potential\u2014I might have foregone my poetic goals as unattainable. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/01/the-minds-eye/", "title": "The Mind\u2019s Eye"},
{"date": "April 5, 2011", "body": "\r\n There are some \u201cbig\u201d changes underway in our household.\u00a0 Mostly, at least from my point of view, these changes revolve around me working a lot more.\u00a0 This is good, because it means my business is succeeding.\u00a0 This is bad, because it means I\u2019m spending more time away from my family.\u00a0 It\u2019s all an adjustment, and Alex is having the hardest time with it.\u00a0 Just about every time he sees me, he grabs at me, often lovingly but sometimes out of frustration.\u00a0 As much as he\u2019s used to me working so much, he\u2019s not used to me working  so much !\u00a0 He wants more mommy time, and I\u2019m trying to give it to him, but I also have to do the work I\u2019ve agreed to do.\u00a0 On the plus side, he\u2019s also connecting a bit better with daddy (Mark), so that\u2019s helping him to adjust to my new schedule. \n Along with this, something unexpected has \u201chappened.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m putting \u201chappened\u201d in quotes, because it hasn\u2019t actually happened yet.\u00a0 It might though, and it\u2019s looking promising.\u00a0 This something isn\u2019t \u201cbig,\u201d it\u2019s HUGE.\u00a0 Basically, if it happens, it involves moving.\u00a0 Not just to a new neighborhood, but to a new state\u2014across the country.\u00a0 It means a new house\u2014a nicer house.\u00a0 It means, eventually, rebuilding this house.\u00a0 It means having more money and more \u201ctoys,\u201d like an iPad and/or a laptop for each child.\u00a0 It means more space and separate bedrooms (instead of Willy and Brandon sharing the living room, because Alex and Ben CANNOT share a room and neither of the big boys want to share a room with either of the little boys). \n Like I said:\u00a0 HUGE.\u00a0 A kind of success I wasn\u2019t even planning on, didn\u2019t even consider until it was (tentatively) dropped in my lap. \n So, how does a family with three autistic boys deal with such big changes? \n A lot of foreshadowing, even though it\u2019s only tentative, is the biggest thing.\u00a0 We talk about it.\u00a0 We think about it.\u00a0 And we talk some more. \n Planning is a really big thing, too.\u00a0 Not only would we be up-rooting our three boys; we\u2019d also be leaving my step-son behind, except for the summers.\u00a0 Leaving him physically behind.\u00a0 Painful.\u00a0 Hard.\u00a0 And that by itself requires a lot of planning, making sure we have enough safeguards and stuff in place that he\u2019ll be okay and won\u2019t feel  left behind , even though he\u2019s choosing to stay here.\u00a0 Plus, of course, trying to make the whole thing as easy on the three boys as possible.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t even come close to figuring that one out yet. \n But what else?\u00a0 It\u2019s too soon to act.\u00a0 We can\u2019t make any picture for the little boys and it seems too soon, too tentative to make a social story for Willy.\u00a0 So we talk and we plan and we worry and we hope. \n Changes are hard.\u00a0 Dealing with the relatively small change of my new work schedule is a challenge.\u00a0 Preparing, even tentatively, for the big change\u2026huge change...that\u2019s something else. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/04/big-changes/", "title": "Big Changes"},

{"date": "January 31, 2011", "body": "\r\n Sullivan at  Left Brain, Right Brain  just  posted  the proposed DSM-V criteria for autism. \n It states: \n Severity Level for ASD \n Level 3 \u2018Requiring very substantial support\u2019 \n Social Communication \n Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause severe impairments in functioning; very limited initiation of social interactions and minimal response to social overtures from others. \n Restricted interests & repetitive behaviors \n Preoccupations, fixated rituals and/or repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres. Marked distress when rituals or routines are interrupted; very difficult to redirect from fixated interest or returns to it quickly. \n Level 2 \u2018Requiring substantial support\u2019 \n Social Communication \n Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions and reduced or abnormal response to social overtures from others. \n Restricted interests & repetitive behaviors \n RRBs and/or preoccupations or fixated interests appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts. Distress or frustration is apparent when RRB\u2019s are interrupted; difficult to redirect from fixated interest. \n Level 1 \u2018Requiring support\u2019 \n Social Communication \n Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments. Has difficulty initiating social interactions and demonstrates clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions. \n Restricted interests & repetitive behaviors \n Rituals and repetitive behaviors (RRB\u2019s) cause significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Resists attempts by others to interrupt RRB\u2019s or to be redirected from fixated interest. \n So, if these proposed criteria are not further revised, then I can say I have a child on each level of the autism spectrum disorder as defined by the DSM-V.\u00a0 I\u2019m actually kind of pleased.\u00a0 See, up until now it\u2019s been \u201chigh functioning\u201d or \u201clow functioning.\u201d\u00a0 Yet, I have one child who is \u201chigh functioning,\u201d one child who is \u201clow functioning\u201d and one child who is definitely in-between.\u00a0 These new labels actually account for that.\u00a0 So, yeah, I prefer that. \n Which is not to say I approve of the medicalization of autism.\u00a0 I don\u2019t really like that, but I am also somewhat resigned to this being the state of our world today.\u00a0 Maybe we\u2019ll find a better way\u2014at least, I hope we find a better way!\u2014to account for differences that require accommodation other than describing them solely in the terms of deficits and dysfunction. \n In the meantime, I\u2019d like to share why I believe each of the boys fit in the categories I would place them in and see what y\u2019all think. \n Willy: Level 1 \u201cRequiring Support\u201d \n Willy attends school in a mainstreamed environment and he progresses nicely in this environment, but he does so because he receives twice-daily coaching, speech and occupational therapy, and other modifications, including breaks, picture schedules and social stories. \n He is twelve years old, which is technically the age at which a child is legally able to stay home alone for less than a full day.\u00a0 Willy lacks the skills necessary to stay home alone safely. \n Willy is doing very well, especially considering the doctor who originally diagnosed him recommended institutionalization.\u00a0 However, he needs support to succeed as well as he does. \n Alex: Level 3 \u201cRequiring very substantial support\u201d \n Alex is baffling.\u00a0 Alex\u2019s needs considerable support, both as a non-verbal child and as a sensory-seeking/sensory-avoiding child.\u00a0 Yes, he both seeks sensory stimuli in dramatic ways and avoids other stimuli in dramatic ways.\u00a0 His behaviors may be co-morbid, but nobody is willing to say for sure.\u00a0 The therapists, doctors, and other professionals are somewhat stumped by his complex array of needs and behaviors.\u00a0 The modifications, accommodations, and supports we have established for Alex are not effective, at least they are not enough, and nobody seems to have a clear idea what we can add that would work. \n Alex requires support for just about every facet of his life and that\u2019s probably not going to change any time soon.\u00a0 Alex wants to be more independent\u2014he has the drive and the spirit of independence\u2014but he is not able to succeed independently of the very substantial supports he receives, and even with those supports his success is sketchy at best. \n Ben: Level 2 \u201cRequiring substantial support\u201d \n Ben is not Alex, but he\u2019s not Willy either.\u00a0 He\u2019s in-between.\u00a0 He struggles with many of the same behavioral issues Alex does, but to a much less severe degree.\u00a0 He\u2019s not non-verbal, but he lacks Willy\u2019s ability to communicate effectively all or even most of the time.\u00a0 The modifications, accommodations and supports we have in place for Ben are mostly effective and frequently adequate.\u00a0 Like Willy, there are times when his needs surpass our preparations, but those are not daily occurrences, as they are for Alex. \n Ben requires support for many facet of his daily life, but he is much more independent\u2014as per ability, not in spirit\u2014than Alex is. \n And, so, while I have issues with the proposed criteria and the idea of this whole thing, I also think this is something of an improvement.\u00a0 Not enough, but it\u2019s forward motion. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/01/proposed-dsm5-autism-diagnostic-criteria-made-public/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/01/dsm-v-severity-on-the-autism-spectrum/", "title": "DSM-V: Severity on the Autism Spectrum"},

\n Yep, after two years of seemingly little progress, Ben has made leaps and bounds and the therapists are still challenging him, still helping him progress even further.\u00a0 This, in and of itself, makes for some exceptionally wonderful therapists.\u00a0 But there\u2019s more\u2026 \n After three years with both Will and Alex in therapy, our house tended to feel invaded.\u00a0 I mean, this was our home, but sometimes it didn\u2019t feel at all like home\u2014not for Mark and me, and not for our boys.\u00a0 After three years with Ben in therapy with different providers, our house is a home.\u00a0 Therapy is not an invasion.\u00a0 Therapy is something that  helps  all of us. \n And there\u2019s still more\u2026 \n Will and Alex were abandoned by their last providers.\u00a0 Alex was completely abandoned.\u00a0 Will retained some of this therapists, but not the leads\u2014i.e., not those who had the extensive training to do programs and stuff.\u00a0 For Will, this was mostly fine.\u00a0 The advice, guidance, and therapy we get from the school system is completely applicable at home.\u00a0 But, as regular readers will know, Alex hasn\u2019t been so lucky.\u00a0 Alex has many needs which we cannot figure out, let alone meet.\u00a0 We\u2019ve asked a lot of people for advice and guidance\u2014a lot of trained professionals.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a lot of people who don\u2019t have any answers not be forthcoming enough to tell us they don\u2019t have any answers.\u00a0 It\u2019s very frustrating. \n In steps the new set of therapists.\u00a0 Generally, these leads do not take on post-intensive kids.\u00a0 It\u2019s not particularly cost-effective and it\u2019s not particularly  effective  to do so.\u00a0 But, they\u2019ve been here for three years and Alex needs help.\u00a0 So, they\u2019re stepping up. \n What\u2019s better is that despite the many professionals who didn\u2019t have any answers, I\u2019m totally comfortable with their contributions and I\u2019m already excited about some of the things we\u2019ve discussed off-the-cuff. \n So, what does the  right  provider feel like?\u00a0 Someone you know you can trust, who is willing and able to help, who\u2019s willing to learn and teach  the child  and not simply the disorder, someone who can be there without being an intruder, someone who is rooting for your child and your family to succeed, to adapt, and to progress as you are so you can be who you have the potential to be.\u00a0 And it\u2019s amazing!

{"date": "February 11, 2011", "body": "\r\n Human societies have this nasty habit of needing something long before they figure out how to meet that need.\u00a0 The  need  creates the motivation to fulfill that need, which, by necessity, means we  hurt  until that need is filled. \u00a0The hurt grows until it motivates us to develop the means to meet the need.\u00a0 This is a natural, normal process which has led to a great deal of human progress. \n Bureaucracy is one socio-technological system we\u2019ve devised to meet certain needs, mostly related to managing the volume of work created by our massive societies.\u00a0 In theory, bureaucracy is efficient.\u00a0 In reality, bureaucracy often sacrifices effectiveness for efficiency by divorcing decisions from reality. \n Consider health care:\u00a0 Many of us believe health care is a basic human right.\u00a0 From a social justice perspective, I would agree.\u00a0 It is unjust to have health care and not to disperse it to the whole population.\u00a0 From a more pragmatic perspective, the idea is problematic.\u00a0 The freedom of speech, the freedom of ideas, the freedom of association\u2014these are basic human rights.\u00a0 Health care cannot be a basic human right any more than food or education can be a basic human right.\u00a0 You see, from a pragmatic perspective, the freedom to communicate, share ideas, and choose with whom we associate requires others not to hinder us.\u00a0 Whereas, the supposed rights to health care, food and education requires others to  provide  for us.\u00a0 These are two very different concepts.\u00a0 On the one hand, the freedom to communicate would best be described as a right we naturally have unless we are deprived of that right.\u00a0 Whereas, health care would be best described as an entitlement we\u2019d like to claim. \n Furthermore, providing these entitlements require us to be technologically advanced enough to develop systems that can effectively provide these goods and services.\u00a0 No such systems exist.\u00a0 We have health care systems, but they do not provide health care goods and services to everyone.\u00a0 We have food systems, but they do not provide food to everyone.\u00a0 We have educational systems, but they do not provide education to everyone. \n To help compensate for the lack of an effective system, we use bureaucracies to allocate limited resources.\u00a0 These bureaucracies choose who gets what goods and services.\u00a0 Currently, our health care system relies on a hodge-podge of bureaucracies with different goals.\u00a0 There are federal bureaucracies that regulate the resources themselves\u2014further limiting the resources that are available in attempt to ensure those resources are safe for use.\u00a0 There are federal and state bureaucracies that provide limited resources. \u00a0There are private bureaucracies that provide limited resources for profit.\u00a0 There are private bureaucracies that provide limited resources without the pursuit of profit.\u00a0 There are federal and state bureaucracies that distribute access to the limited resources that are available.\u00a0 There are private bureaucracies which distribute access to the limited resources that are available for profit.\u00a0 There are private bureaucracies which distribute access to the limited resources that are available without the pursuit of profit.\u00a0 In effect, these bureaucracies are often at cross-purposes and make a mess of things. \n These cross-purposes make a mess of things all by themselves.\u00a0 This mess is exacerbated by the fact that the nature of a bureaucracy often sacrifices effectiveness for efficiency by divorcing decisions from reality.\u00a0 You see, in a bureaucratic system you have someone sitting at a desk with a piece of paper or information on a computer screen. \u00a0That person has to make a decision based on that information.\u00a0 This person makes hundreds of decisions like this a day.\u00a0 It\u2019s a job.\u00a0 It can be a tedious and thankless job.\u00a0 That decision is influenced or dictated by decisions made by other people sitting at other desks.\u00a0 None of those people are connected to the provider or the recipient.\u00a0 The decision is divorced from reality.\u00a0 For the decision maker, the significance of the decision resides in how it will affect the person\u2019s job, not in how it will impact the provider or the recipient.\u00a0 The real impact of the decision is unknown and unimportant to the person responsible for making it. \n That is our system.\u00a0 That will remain our system after Obamacare is enacted.\u00a0 To solve our problems, we need new systems that can supply the entitlements we\u2019re demanding.\u00a0 Obamacare doesn\u2019t do that.\u00a0 Right now, we lack the technological sophistication to do that.\u00a0 In the meantime, while we\u2019re waiting and hurting for the progress that will make that possible, to satisfy the requirements of social justice, we need to dismantle the broken systems and replace it with systems designed to meet the needs to the best of our abilities.\u00a0 Obamacare doesn\u2019t do that.\u00a0 The system itself is broken and Obamacare adds layers of bureaucracy to a system already broken by bureaucracy.\u00a0 Bureaucracy is the best we can do, because we haven\u2019t devised something better.\u00a0 But Obamacare is not the best we can do.\u00a0 Obamacare complicatedly adds more cross-purposes, not fewer.\u00a0 Obamacare further divorces decision makers from the people their decisions affect.\u00a0 And, worse still, Obamacare turns the entitlement we want\u2014that which we want to be provided\u2014into a legal obligation we cannot avoid.\u00a0 It gives more power to the government.\u00a0 It takes away the freedom of choice\u2014the choice not to pay into a broken system\u2014and forces people to entrust their health care into the hands of bureaucrats who are, of a necessity, divorced from their reality. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/02/the-bureaucratic-failing/", "title": "The Bureaucratic

{"date": "January 25, 2011", "body": "\r\n Recently, I came across two movies I watched a long time ago with my cousin in my Netflix recommendations.\u00a0 One of those movies was  The Boy Who Could Fly , which I decided to make a priority when I realized\u2014from reading the Netflix blurb\u2014that it was about a boy with autism.\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t remembered that. \n In retrospect, that\u2019s understandable.\u00a0 Though the character in question, Eric, is non-verbal and socially aloof, there are no other autistic traits that make him stand out as on the spectrum.\u00a0 Perhaps that is a failing of the writer or the actor, but the diagnosis of autism is also questioned in the movie itself, so it might have been intentional. \n This movie is a surprisingly complicated drama with a popcorn-flick feel.\u00a0 The story starts with the relocation of a mother and her two children after the death of the father.\u00a0 The family is struggling and the boy next door proves to be a heart-warming distraction for the girl, Milly.\u00a0 While the mother struggles with re-entering the workforce and the brother struggles with a neighborhood bully, the girl befriends this boy whose odd behavior sets him apart from his peers.\u00a0 This is encouraged once it becomes apparent that the boy is willing to connect with her in a way he\u2019s never connected with anyone before.\u00a0 Of course, the boy has problems of his own, including the looming possibility of forced institutionalization and the semi-neglect of his drunken uncle, who is his legal guardian due to the tragic deaths of both the boy\u2019s parents. \n There are things I really liked, like how the teachers made an effort to include Eric, even though it required effort.\u00a0 I like how they show a balance between the forces that respect Eric and those that do not.\u00a0 But there was also little resistance to the ablism that persisted throughout the movie, and that I didn\u2019t like so much. \n One scene I really like is when Milly, by chance, discovers that connecting with Eric has a lot to do with following  his  lead, much the same way he connected with  her  by following her lead.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know whether this was realized by the movie makers, but it was clear from the story\u2014at least to me, but of course I\u2019ve done that myself with my own children.\u00a0 This is spoiled, however, when Milly tries to make Eric perform like a trick pony.\u00a0 When he fails to perform, she tells him \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me, Eric,\u201d as if his unwillingness to perform is an intentional effort to humiliate her. \u00a0She never seems to realize that she is doing anything wrong to  him . \n So, it\u2019s iffy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t love it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t hate it.\u00a0 It has potential that could have been better realized, but it\u2019s also a movie from 1986.\u00a0 If that seems like an excuse, so be it. \n Still, I\u2019m trying hard not to be disappointed.\u00a0 Is there no place in society for a boy who can re-ignite our ability to dream?\u00a0 Find out for yourself.\u00a0 Me, I think there\u2019s room for a sequel. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090768/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/01/review-the-boy-who-could-fly/", "title": "Review: The Boy Who Could Fly"},

The meeting was triggered by the government\u2019s apology last fall for federal doctors infecting prisoners and mental patients in Guatemala with syphilis 65 years ago. \n U.S. officials also acknowledged there had been dozens of similar experiments in the United States -- studies that often involved making healthy people sick. \n This ugly history of unethical human experimentation is not news to me.\u00a0 American doctors conducted many studies using eugenically defined \u201cundesirables\u201d\u2014convicts, disabled people, and the mentally ill\u2014to test their scientific theories.\u00a0 The AP article cited some horrific  examples , which I\u2019ll let you check out at your leisure. \n Strikingly, though it was never considered particularly outrageous, once it was considered eccentric: \n Prisoners have long been victimized for the sake of science. In 1915, the U.S. government\u2019s Dr. Joseph Goldberger - today remembered as a public health hero - recruited Mississippi inmates to go on special rations to prove his theory that the painful illness pellagra was caused by a dietary deficiency. (The men were offered pardons for their participation.) \n But studies using prisoners were uncommon in the first few decades of the 20th century, and usually performed by researchers considered eccentric even by the standards of the day. One was Dr. L.L. Stanley, resident physician at San Quentin prison in California, who around 1920 attempted to treat older, \u201cdevitalized men\u201d by implanting in them testicles from livestock and from recently executed convicts. \n Newspapers wrote about Stanley\u2019s experiments, but the lack of outrage is striking. \n I suspect eugenics theories made it more socially acceptable here, just as it did in Germany.\u00a0 However, there\u2019s a chance that it is NOT over\u2014perhaps these unethical activities have simply been moved off shore to target different vulnerable populations: \n Last year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 inspector general reported that between 40 and 65 percent of clinical studies of federally regulated medical products were done in other countries in 2008, and that proportion probably has grown. The report also noted that U.S. regulators inspected fewer than 1 percent of foreign clinical trial sites. \n Monitoring research is complicated, and rules that are too rigid could slow new drug development. But it\u2019s often hard to get information on international trials, sometimes because of missing records and a paucity of audits, said Dr. Kevin Schulman, a Duke University professor of medicine who has written on the ethics of international studies. \n So now President Obama has ordered an investigation.\u00a0 Has research ethics really progressed?\u00a0 Or is it just that society has progressed enough to express the outrage that\u2019s due? \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ksla.com/Global/story.asp?S=14150187", "http://www.ksla.com/Global/story.asp?S=14150187"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2011/02/testing-then-and-now/", "title": "Testing: Then and Now"},

ten to twelve, we call the \u201ctweens.\u201d\u00a0 Willy\u2019s at the older edge of this, yet he\u2019s just starting to catch up socially and emotionally to what it means to be a \u2018tween.\u00a0 He\u2019s pressing forward, resisting being seen as a child, but not ready to be an adult.\u00a0 Yet, even as he presses forward, wanting to do more and more of what his peers do, his childish nature lingers on.\u00a0 Later than his peers, he\u2019s now a \u2018tween to the core. \n Symbolically, whether he realizes it or not, Willy has asserted his \u2018tween-y-ness.\u00a0 For a long, long time, he\u2019s been my \u201cSilly Willy.\u201d\u00a0 It was never intended to be derogatory.\u00a0 He\u2019s silly, and he\u2019s my Willy, and it rhymes and it\u2019s fun.\u00a0 For most of his young life, he loved being called \u201cSilly Willy.\u201d\u00a0 Now, suddenly it seems, that\u2019s too childish of a nickname for him.\u00a0 \n I have been forbidden to call him \u201cSilly Willy,\u201d or even \u201csilly\u201d any more.\u00a0 I respect that.\u00a0 I try to remember, but years of habit are hard to erase.\u00a0 When I forget, he reminds me good-naturedly, but adamantly.\u00a0 \n This, of course, has required a change of ritual.\u00a0 Ever since he became sufficiently skilled in verbal exchanges, I\u2019ve been asking him: \u201cWho is the silliest Willy in the house?\u201d\u00a0 To which he enthusiastically responded, \u201cI am!\u201d\u00a0 Now, I ask him: \u201cWho is the smartest, sweetest Willy in the house?\u201d\u00a0 He likes the change.\u00a0

Children change.\u00a0 It\u2019s in their nature.\u00a0 And so we adjust.\u00a0 As parents, we have to struggle to keep up with their rush to grow up.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying.\u00a0 But, I admit, I have doubts. \n I remember the \u2018tween and early teen years as intensely uncomfortable.\u00a0 Part of that is just the way things are for all kids.\u00a0 Part of that, for me at least, was being misunderstood and misunderstanding in return.\u00a0 I scorned the childish ways of my peers, and for that I was often seen as being \u201cmature for my age.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody suspected that I scorned those childish ways more from a lack of understanding than a lack of appreciation.\u00a0 My vocabulary and scholastic abilities contributed.\u00a0 I did well in school and spoke like an adult, so often I was seen as mature.\u00a0 The side-effect, of course, was that my social and emotional delays weren\u2019t recognized, nor did I get any of the assistance I needed.\u00a0 I squeaked through adolescence in the shadows, and still feel more comfortable when I go unnoticed. \n But Willy is not growing in the shadows.\u00a0 Willy is in the bright light, having fun and enjoying life.\u00a0 For that I am very grateful.\u00a0 But I also know he\u2019s somewhat on the edge of things.\u00a0 He\u2019s able to co-exist academically with his typically developing peers, with the help of some modifications.\u00a0 But he still isn\u2019t able to keep up with their social and emotional development.\u00a0 He\u2019s growing and changing, but he\u2019s also just a few steps behind.\u00a0 And that puts him at the edge of things. \n He\u2019s old enough to want to grow up faster, but young enough to enjoy being a child.\u00a0 He\u2019s old enough to want more responsibility and independence, but not mature enough to handle as much of it as he wants.\u00a0 He\u2019s my \u201cmedium boy.\u201d\u00a0 No longer little, but not quite a big kid either. \n But there\u2019s still that question:\u00a0 How much of the responsibility and independence he wants can he really handle?\u00a0 If I had thought that we wouldn\u2019t face this so much with Willy as we do with Brandon, I was wrong.\u00a0 And perhaps I did think that.\u00a0 Brandon has always tried to grow up faster than he could.\u00a0 Willy never did, or so I thought.\u00a0 More so, I realize that Willy was doing it in his own way, with his own lack of understanding.\u00a0 He was always a step behind, and reaching for things he thought were \u201cgrown-up,\u201d while those things really represented the still-childish nature of his peers.\u00a0 So, I do hold him back.\u00a0 I try to help him understand.\u00a0 But, then, there are times when he\u2019s so clever and so helpful and so, well,  mature , and then I have to wonder if I\u2019m holding him back too much. \n I wonder how this will unfold\u2014this thing we call growing up.\u00a0 I wonder if we\u2019re prepared.\u00a0 I wonder if parents are ever really prepared to see their children become the adults they will be.\u00a0 And then, I let go.\u00a0 We can only do the best we can.\u00a0 And, for as long as I can, I\u2019m going to balance trust and caution\u2014trust that Willy may be able to do more than he\u2019s credited with, and caution that we give him enough room to grow without so much room he\u2019s lost in it.\u00a0

{"date": "November 12, 2010", "body": "\r\n In my  previous post , I discussed the problem.\u00a0 It is my opinion (it would by a hypothesis if I had the means and training to test it), that much of bullying based on prejudice stems from systemic flaw:\u00a0 A \u201cforeign\u201d element is introduced into an environment that is perceived to be homogenous without the people within the environment having the skills to cope with the disturbance.\u00a0 (This intentionally excludes the harassment and abuse that stems from prejudice, which involves much more violent intentions and, presumably, must stronger feelings and weaker morals.) \n Two things stand out to me in this statement.\u00a0 First, it is based on perception.\u00a0 A group is perceived to be homogenous, and the \u201cforeign element\u201d is perceived to not fit within that homogenous group.\u00a0 The reality is that we\u2019re all different.\u00a0 Homogenous groups are a matter of perception, not reality; thus if we change the perception of those individuals within the group and open their minds to the differences that already exist within the seemingly homogenous group, then I expect \u201cnew\u201d differences would seem less threatening\u2014after all, they\u2019ve already worked with people who are different, they just were not aware of all the differences.\u00a0 Second, the people within the seemingly homogenous group lack the skills to cope with other differences.\u00a0 I believe both are cultural problems, or problems that have been culturally reinforced. \n Rugged Individualism  is a standard concept in American culture.\u00a0 We cherish our individuality, or so it\u2019s claimed.\u00a0 But, personally, I\u2019ve never really understood that claim.\u00a0 The American Melting Pot isn\u2019t about difference, but about sameness and integration.\u00a0 While we are a nation of immigrants, those immigrants are expected to conform.\u00a0 The individuals raised in public education are taught to conform.\u00a0 Conformity and homogeneity are prized values that make our social system run; yet, our beliefs in freedom are in direct conflict with those values of conformity and homogeneity.\u00a0 Instead of addressing that conflict and finding a harmonious way to create a nation based on diversity, we convince ourselves we\u2019re \u201crugged individualists\u201d despite the evidence to the contrary. \n Difference is bad.\u00a0 We fight differences.\u00a0 We try to find a way, either by forcing \u201cforeign elements\u201d to change or by tricking ourselves that differences aren\u2019t real.\u00a0 We want to think everyone is the same or should be the same.\u00a0 But equality, the value we espouse, isn\u2019t about sameness; it\u2019s about rights, opportunities and responsibilities. \n Recently, Dave Hingsburger addressed a  related topic : \n Why do I mention disability so much in my workshop? Cause I want to say, \u2018but ya are Blanche, ya are!\u2019 Difference, Diversity, Disability ... all part of the vastness of the social world, all part of the vastness of the human experience, all part of the whole community. Difference, Diversity, Disability ... we make community and the community would be less without us. Difference, Diversity, Disability ... we bring with us challenge and demand for change, just like every single other member of every single other community. We are the same in what we want, but we are proudly different of who we are when asking. \n We shouldn\u2019t have to hide our differences or whisper about them in dark corners.\u00a0 The differences are real, and we\u2019re all richer for it\u2014if we\u2019d just let ourselves be. \n I believe that if we can bring our differences to the conscious level\u2014if we can look at them and see them for what they are\u2014then maybe we could see them without regarding them as a threat.\u00a0 Instead, as a society, we try not to see them.\u00a0 We ignore them whenever and however we can.\u00a0 And when we can\u2019t, we fight them, disparage them, and exclude those who force us to look at them. \n We need to be able to deal with differences.\u00a0 We need to be able to see them, to cope with them, to tolerate them, and to accept them.\u00a0 We need to be able to work together\u2014in our communities and in our workplaces\u2014without being threatened by the diversity that is all around us. \n And our society\u2014our school systems and our social values\u2014have failed us in this regard.\u00a0 But awareness is rising and changes are demanded from many groups and many sectors.\u00a0 Changes are happening.\u00a0 Diversity training is part of that change.\u00a0 It is, when done effectively, a very important part of that change. \n And yet we resist.\u00a0 Because so many of us don\u2019t want to have to change.\u00a0 I mean, why should we change?\u00a0 Really?\u00a0  Can\u2019t he just stop wearing glasses? \n For so long, our society has relied on changing those who were different or hiding and excluding those they could not change.\u00a0 But that solution won\u2019t be tolerated any more.\u00a0 Instead, we must brave face our differences and find it within ourselves to embrace them.\u00a0 After all, those differences are in each and every one of us.\u00a0 If we could only let ourselves see them. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.allabouthistory.org/rugged-individualism-faq.htm", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2010/11/questions.html", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2010/11/four-eyes.html"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/11/bullying-part-8-bullying-differences-the-solution/", "title": "Bullying (Part 8): Bullying Differences \u2013 The Solution"},
{"date": "November 8, 2010", "body": "\r\n One of the things that spurred my series on bullying\u2014before the news decided that bullying was a hot issue and before I realized October was Bullying Awareness month\u2014was a  post  written by  Clay . \n The post is about some of the challenges that autistic adults face in the working world, specifically some of the challenges Clay has faced as a working adult on the spectrum.\u00a0 Among those challenges is workplace bullying and harassment.\u00a0 In the comments, he said: \n It does take a lot of inner strength to persevere against those who would \u2018take you down\u2019, just for the hell of it. \n My response was: \n For some, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s accurate to say they would \u201ctake you down, just for the hell of it.\u201d For many, it is a coping mechanism. People they don\u2019t understand seem elevated\u2014the mystery itself is intolerable\u2014so, they do what they can to depreciate that person, because they think that makes the person understandable. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s logical or it makes sense, but that\u2019s the way sociologists and psychologists describe the behavior. Of course, as someone who was picked on throughout childhood, I never found their feelings of inferiority very consoling, even in retrospect. But what I do take from that is that it is important to share knowledge to change behavior\u2014if people who are different could still be different, but also be more understandable, that would presumably help those people to cope with that difference without resorting to physical or emotional violence. \n Clay said: \n I thought it was just for the hell of it, but now I think I want to know more about that coping mechanism thing. Sometimes, I had thought that some people were jealous, but couldn\u2019t understand why.  Please , make this a topic for your blog. \n I went the long way around to get back to this, but I haven\u2019t forgotten. \n Common victims of bullying in the adult world are those who are different, particularly those who are different in a way that seems to make them less successful by social standards.\u00a0 This measurement of success may be based on career goals, financial means, appearance, or just about any other standard.\u00a0 Often the disadvantage of being bullied is even greater than the disadvantage(s) that hamper success; meaning that the bullying hampers success even more than the difference. \n As is true for children, adults bully for two basic reasons:\u00a0 1) because they enjoy it, and/or 2) as a coping mechanism.\u00a0 In regards to bullying as a coping mechanism, some do it because they are being bullied (this is often true of bullying that pervades hierarchical organizations), but they may be coping with something else\u2014such as prejudice, fear and misunderstanding.\u00a0 \n As I suggested to Clay, bullies within an organization or system who are bullying someone at the same level as them because of perceived differences may do so just \u201cfor the hell of it,\u201d because they enjoy hurting others or enjoy the feeling of having power over others.\u00a0 This enjoyment is both a human failing and a culturally reinforced trait. \n However, that is not the only reason adults bully. \u00a0They also do so in order to cope with the sudden emergence of a foreign element in their environment.\u00a0 Whether the difference is racial, gender, neurological, intellectual or ability, the bullies perceive the different individual as a threat (at least, on an instinctual level), and they respond with physical, emotional or verbal violence.\u00a0 I\u2019ve read theories (though I don\u2019t know how strong the evidence that supports these theories are) that if these bullies were somehow de-sensitized to the differences, then they would not respond to those differences by bullying. \n In short, opening up an organization to diversity creates an environment ripe for bullying; but by training individuals on diversity, equipping them to cope with and get past their discomfort with differences, and integrating diversity into the organizational system, the organization creates an environment ripe for mutual success.\u00a0 Responsible businesses are pursuing this approach, often after failed attempts to open their organizations up to diversity without an effective means of transition. \n Diversity training is often derided, but it is most often derided by people who falsely believe they work in a homogenous environment and are entitled to continue to work in their homogenous environment.\u00a0 The foreign elements are supposed to conform to the environment or leave. \n And that\u2019s a problem, because diversity is far more real than the myth of homogeneity.\u00a0 But homogeneity is reinforced by bullying.\u00a0 The greater demand for fair workplaces without the proper training to make fair workplaces possible, the more bullying we\u2019re likely to see. \n I do recommend you read  Clay\u2019s post .\u00a0 I also recommend you read this example of  workplace bullying .\u00a0 The bullying is very real.\u00a0 It\u2019s not something you just grow out of. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://cometscorner-clay.blogspot.com/2010/08/for-those-85-of-us-who-cant-work.html", "http://cometscorner-clay.blogspot.com/", "http://cometscorner-clay.blogspot.com/2010/08/for-those-85-of-us-who-cant-work.html", "http://bullyinglte.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/empathy-and-adult-bullying/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/11/bullying-part-7-bullying-differences-the-problem/", "title": "Bullying (Part 7): Bullying Differences \u2013 The Problem"},

because my status changed, how I was perceived changed. \n The difference in how I was treated was shocking. \n As an adult, struggling to deal with the realities of a society that revolved around status, I have been bullied by those whose status was oh-so-superior to mine.\u00a0 From doctors to social workers, from administrators to council members (i.e. local government), and from all sorts of people in between.\u00a0 My status meant I didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, the system is designed to provide for people like me, for families like mine.\u00a0 But, who I am, what I think, what I know, what I\u2019ve experienced\u2014none of that matters. \n Of course, now that I have a graduated Summa Cum Laude from Herzing University with a degree in Business Administration, now that I have been admitted as a graduate student at National-Louis University, now that I have started my own business, things are changing.\u00a0 Once again, I am among those with merit, or at least the potential for merit.\u00a0 My status is heightened.\u00a0 My self\u2014the essence that is me\u2014is unchanged. \n Yet, once again, the difference in how I am treated is shocking. \n *** \n We live in a society where people with differences\u2014particularly, but not exclusively, people with disabilities\u2014have status points deducted from them just for those differences.\u00a0 For people who are perceived as having merit, this is another challenge to overcome\u2014an unfair challenge, but only a challenge.\u00a0 For people who are perceived as not having merit, this can mean something entirely different.\u00a0 It can mean a forfeiture of basic human rights.\u00a0 It can mean a life-time of oppression\u2014always being at the bottom with no way up.\u00a0 It can even mean forced imprisonment for the crime of being unvalued. \n We live in a society with class.\u00a0 We live in a society where merit (as perceived by that society) can be rewarded with wealth for those who seek wealth.\u00a0 We live in a society where wealth elevates class.\u00a0 We live in a society where contributions made to society by those who forego the pursuit of wealth also elevate class.\u00a0 But we also live in a society where the people who have neither wealth, nor class, nor merit (as perceived by that society), have no opportunity to elevate their class, and where some of those are treated their whole lives as if they as are something \u201cless than.\u201d\u00a0 Less than worthy.\u00a0 Less than right.\u00a0 Less than human. \n Systemic bullying enforces this social regime.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t bred into our bones.\u00a0 It\u2019s learned.\u00a0 We learn it every day, since they day we first became aware.\u00a0 Perhaps, before even that\u2014at least, before our society recognizes awareness.\u00a0 Bullying is built into the fabric of our culture.\u00a0 We rely on it to keep people in their places.\u00a0 Only those who can rise above it can advance.\u00a0 Separating the wheat from the chaff.\u00a0 And those who are left behind\u2014the many who are left behind\u2014know not this \u201cland of opportunity\u201d that is supposed to be so much better than all that came before. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/s/skulls-script-transcript-joshua-jackson.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/11/bullying-part-12-bullying-reinforces-status/", "title": "Bullying (Part 12): Bullying Reinforces Status"},

It\u2019s a tool the US public school system uses to analyze behaviors that impact educational performance.  The inputs consist of various analyses, performed by various people, all of which are intended to identify and explain problem behaviors; this is similar in nature to the analysis that should be done throughout an ABA program (autism treatment).  The idea is to determine what  function  a child\u2019s behavior serves in the mind of the child; thus, you are assessing the function of a behavior, i.e.,  functional behavioral assessment . \n The FBA culminates in a team meeting (or several), during which the team discusses what was learned through the FBA process, what may still need to be learned, and makes decisions on what can be done to prevent/reduce/eliminate these behaviors.  These decisions make up the BIP or  behavioral intervention plan , or the planned strategies to intervene to address problematic behaviors. \n The concept itself seems pretty self-explanatory, and yet it seems that a real FBA is hard to come by.  The reason for this is because it\u2019s far too easy for people, including special education staff and parents, to assume that a behavior is \u201cnaughty\u201d and to focus on ways to \u201ccorrect\u201d that naughty behavior.  Unfortunately, this often leads to punishment, which doesn\u2019t really correct the behavior.  You see, behaviors\u2014even undesirable behaviors\u2014serve a purpose.  If you don\u2019t understand that purpose, then you cannot teach a more appropriate behavior.  If you don\u2019t teach a more appropriate behavior, then chances are the child\u2019s needs will go unmet and the child will either persist with the undesirable behavior or develop a new behavior to attempt to meet the need\u2014i.e., to fulfill the function of the behavior. \n All three of my boys are having a rough winter.  All three boys have needed FBAs, but these FBAs were not all equal\u2014meaning they didn\u2019t all meet the definition of FBA at the first go. \n I was already exhausted and stressed before the FBAs started.

People tended to steer me in other directions.  I\u2019d need a day job, they\u2019d say, like being a secretary.  I\u2019d need a real career, they\u2019d say, and if I wanted to write for a living I should think about becoming a journalist.  Nobody ever really took me all that seriously when I said I wanted to be an author. \n Don\u2019t get me wrong.  My parents fed my voracious appetite for books.  They let me expend endless amounts of paper writing.  They even let me use up their envelopes and stamps sending out my manuscripts, starting at the tender age of twelve.  They didn\u2019t keep me from trying.  They just wanted me to be realistic.

{"date": "August 9, 2013", "body": "\r\n When we first bought our house, we chose it in part because we loved the lay-out and we loved the woodwork.  Enter the front door and go straight to go upstairs or turn left to enter the living room.  But right there, between the living room and the front door, is a heavy wooden door tucked away in a pocket in the wall.  Slide that door out and put a barrier between the upstairs and the downstairs, which can be very handy for our family. \n A lot of people think that because we have three children with autism we have three children with the same needs.  They don\u2019t realize that the boys\u2019 needs often conflict.  For example, there are times when Ben needs quiet and Alex needs to make noise.  We put barriers between them so both boys can have their needs met.  Otherwise, fighting ensues.  At times like these, that door is a blessing. \n Other times, however, the door just seems like a barrier.  Like when I come home with my arms full of groceries and I manage to enter the front door, only to be blocked further by the sliding door.  Or when I\u2019m coming downstairs, still more asleep than awake, and (almost) walk in to the sliding door, because I don\u2019t quite see that it\u2019s closed to me. \n We have another sliding door on the main level.  This one is between the playroom and the bigger boys\u2019 new room (formerly the den).  To keep his younger brothers out, Willy often shuts the door at night during those rare times when he goes to bed first.  The problem is that we only have one bathroom on the main floor and it\u2019s on the bedroom side of that sliding door.  And that door has gotten rather noisy and uncooperative after Brandon and Willy roughed it up.  So, when I have to go to the bathroom, I have to disturb Willy getting through that barrier. \n It occurred to me that there\u2019s a metaphor in these doors.  Disability advocates are concerned with barriers.  As advocates, we talk about how barriers most people in society can navigate easily can become overly limiting or even hazardous to people with disabilities.  As advocates, we talk about tearing down barriers. \n Once again annoyed that I had to navigate the sliding door with an armful of groceries, I resented the barrier.  Once again annoyed that I had to navigate the sliding door when I needed to use the bathroom rather urgently, I resented the barrier.  But after a day of resenting these barriers, I remembered that they serve a purpose.  Not only that, but we bought this house because these sliding doors\u2014these barriers\u2014serve a purpose, a very important and valued purpose in our family. \n Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m reading Dale Carnegie\u2019s  How to Win Friends and Influence People , which is a strangely enlightening look at neurotypical thinking.  Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been thinking so much about what I\u2019d like my future non-profit organization to do for people.  Whatever the reason, it occurred to me that all these things we advocates refer to as barriers are also sliding doors.  They serve a purpose.  They are navigable to the people who designed them. \n The barriers are a problem, because they are not inclusive and because they do keep people out.  Our society is full of such barriers/sliding doors and the sum total is more disabling than the disabilities of those people who are kept out.  But keeping people out is not their function.  It\u2019s not their purpose.  Navigating barriers like these asserts a level of control over events and puts that control in the hands of the people who designed and used these barriers.  So, when we talk about tearing down barriers we are rejecting not only the barrier, but the purpose the barrier was designed to serve and the people who designed what is from their own perspective a sliding door. \n In short, it\u2019s an attack.  We\u2019re saying they are wrong, selfish, thoughtless, and exclusive.  Whether that\u2019s true or not, from our perspective, it\u2019s not true from their perspective.  Even if they recognize that there is truth to the attack from our perspective, they\u2019ll have trouble admitting it because we\u2019ve put them on the defensive. \n Instead of tearing down barriers, maybe what we need to do is work together to build better sliding doors. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/08/barriers/", "title": "Barriers"},

{"date": "April 8, 2013", "body": "\r\n Kathleen  and  Kim  wrote a  post  for  The Autism Channel  about aggression.  I followed it with an initial  post  of my own about my son Ben.  Now, I want to focus on Alex. \n Alex is a more difficult \u201cpuzzle\u201d to solve when it comes to aggression.  For those who\u2019ve been following along with my family for a while, you may remember that Alex used to be a very happy, contented child, who was also rather oblivious to his surroundings.  When Willy and Alex were little and would \u201ccompete\u201d over the same stuff, Alex refused to compete.  If Willy took a toy from Alex, then Alex was content without it or would simply get something else.  If we tried to give it back to him, he\u2019d often simply set it aside and Willy would claim it.  The only thing Alex was ever particular about was VeggieTales videos\u2014which ones to watch, which parts to watch, ect.  (He was also particular about touch, sound, and people, but not things.)  Alex was genuinely, consistently happy. \n At first, Ben\u2019s birth changed little.  Willy soon outgrew the toys that captured Alex\u2019s interest.  They veered further apart developmentally.  Meanwhile, Ben was slowly catching up to Alex.  At some point, Ben\u2019s and Alex\u2019s interests overlapped and there was once again \u201ccompetition.\u201d  Ben would take from Alex and Alex would turn to something else. \n Then, one summer, from seemingly nowhere, a switch was flipped.  Alex started asserting himself.  We encouraged this, because we had become quite concerned about how easily Alex could be taken advantage of without adult oversight and interference.  A little assertiveness would be a good thing for Alex.  Except, with Ben and Alex both having very limited verbal and social skills, this battle of assertiveness escalated rather quickly.  At first, Ben was always the aggressor.  The strife between them continued to escalate despite our interference and Alex \u201cfigured out\u201d that aggression could help him get his way.  Now, they both act aggressively when they want the same thing.  They can go from being completely uninterested in each other to full-scale battle in a few seconds, skipping all the steps in-between. \n We\u2019ve developed strategies\u2014mostly separating them and ensuring we have two of any highly desirable items, like Kindles\u2014that reduce these incidents.  Though they\u2019re both still significantly delayed, Ben has surpassed Alex in language and social skills development.  So, unless he\u2019s having a bad day, Ben is usually able to avoid instigating incidents.  Unfortunately, Alex is intentionally (or so it seems) instigating incidents, and not only with Ben. \n Several months ago, Alex took up pinching\u2014seemingly as a pastime.  Even though we are people who understand that behavior=communication, we\u2019re stumped as to what Alex is trying to communicate.  Sometimes the message is obvious:  You\u2019re bugging me, get away.  But sometimes it\u2019s not:  Like when he \u201cgreets\u201d me by grabbing the underside of my arm and pinching me with his whole hand.  I\u2019m not the only target, but at home I seem to get the brunt of the \u201chappy pinching,\u201d meaning him pinching me when he\u2019s happy and smiling as if in greeting.  He\u2019ll even echo \u201cstop, no pinching.\u201d  It doesn\u2019t seem as if he understands the words, but as if that\u2019s the response he\u2019s trying to get and he\u2019s happy to have gotten it. \n It\u2019s not just happening at home, either.  He\u2019ll pinch anyone, from people who are helping him to random strangers.  In the last few months, he\u2019s added biting.  If he can\u2019t pinch, he\u2019ll try to bite.  I\u2019m at a loss of what to do with this.  I\u2019ve worked with the school, but they don\u2019t seem to be making any progress either.  We don\u2019t know what Alex is trying to communicate, nor do we really understand the function(s) of the behaviors.  The only resource in our area that we haven\u2019t tried that I\u2019m aware of involves signing my child over to CPS, which is not going to happen.  Ever. \n I look back on the Alex we used to know, who was always happy, always peaceable, always so easy to please.  It\u2019s not that I really thought that could last, but\u2026  Aggression can escalate and become an even bigger problem than it already is, especially with puberty, and that\u2019s exactly where Alex is right now\u2014starting down the path of puberty.  I fear if we can\u2019t solve this problem soon, then it\u2019s going to get worse, possibly much worse. \n The lack of support is a big problem, but what\u2019s worse is the lack of understanding and the tendency to place blame.

{"date": "September 6, 2013", "body": "\r\n I was chatting with one of my online friends (she\u2019s in Australia) about why neither of us identify with the feminist movement, despite being personally empowered as women. \n Being older than me, she grew into the person she is in a different time than I did.  Being Australian, she also grew into the person she is in a different place.  Therefore, she had different reasons. \n My friend explained that she just never got how you can legislate an attitude.  What good could their efforts do if they were focused on changing the laws? \n I explained that legislation doesn\u2019t change attitudes, but it can change behaviors.  In comparison, I said that if there were not employment laws protecting the interests of employees with disabilities, then we would have even fewer people with disabilities employed.  We knew this, because when we didn\u2019t have those laws, few people with disabilities could obtain employment. \n I also explained that where legislation ends, awareness and advocacy begins.  In the case of feminism, when I was growing up the most prominent feminists seemed adamantly anti-male.  And I couldn\u2019t align myself with that. \n There are factions within the neurodiversity movement that make the same mistake.  Because they\u2019ve been belittled and made fun of, they in turn belittle and make fun of others.  Perhaps they think that if they portray \u201cnormal\u201d as flawed, then people will be more able to see the value of being different.  Perhaps they honestly believe they are superior to others. \n Either way, it amounts to building oneself up at the expense of others.  If this doesn\u2019t sound familiar, it should.  That\u2019s what bullies do. \n Social advocacy and social change can certainly be built using bullying tactics.  Feminists have succeeded in introducing a belief in the inferiority of males into our culture.  But those tactics and those beliefs don\u2019t solve problems and they don\u2019t create functional communities.  They entrench opposite sides in conflicting beliefs, reinforcing negative stereotypes of both genders. \n The irony, of course, comes with the definition of feminism that prompted my response to my friend.  My friend was discussing feminism on a discussion board (I was just looking, not lurking), and a feminist defined feminism as  believing in the equality of the sexes . \n That may be what feminism should be, just like neurodiversity should be  believing in the equality of neurological differences ; but that\u2019s not how feminism and neurodiversity are being practiced in reality.  Check that.  There are people who do practice that, but there are also prominent segments in both groups that practice supremacy of their disadvantaged type instead of equality of all types. \n As long as self-advocates rely on bullying to achieve their goals, they will ensure there is a battle to be fought.  You cannot bully others into changing their attitudes in positive ways. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/09/where-legislation-endssocial-advocacy-begins/", "title": "Where Legislation Ends\u2026Social Advocacy Begins"},
{"date": "January 13, 2014", "body": "\r\n I started the New Year with a vacation in honor of my brother\u2019s visit for the holidays.  From the week of Christmas through last week I think I got a total of maybe three work days in.  The rest of the time I either rested or socialized.  Housework, of course, doesn\u2019t take vacations, so it\u2019s not like I did nothing.  I just didn\u2019t do much writing. \n One of those days was spent cleaning Alex\u2019s room, including removing the jumped-to-bits mattresses and boxsprings from his room and downsizing to the one bed.  I bought him a new mattress\u2014no boxspring\u2014and we placed it on the floor in anticipation of a special kind of bed that will be made up for him.  We spent most of the school day at that project and Alex was very pleased with the results.  In the coming months, we hope to do something similar for Ben\u2019s room and maybe even Willy\u2019s room.  The goal is to give their spaces a facelift and leave it with a more personal touch. \n Another way we kicked off the New Year was to meet our new social worker.  Under the autism waiver, we\u2019ve worked with the same fantastic lady for the entirety of our term.  She\u2019s been at least on the periphery of every major event in our lives for the last decade.  Luckily, we don\u2019t have to say goodbye, but we did have to say hello to someone new.  The new lady brings different skillsets and different knowledge.  After talking with her briefly, we began to consider some new prospects for the boys, especially Alex and Ben.  For one thing, there is now a school for children with exceptional special needs, i.e. autism, which may be a better place for Alex and Ben to attend school.  It\u2019s only about 15 to 20 minutes away, and since both boys are \u201csegregated\u201d from their regular education peers anyway, it might be best for them to be in school dedicated to their needs.  On the other hand, we\u2019re also on the lookout for local art classes/instruction sessions for students with special needs.  In short, she took me seriously when I said the boys have talents we\u2019d like to foster and nurture for the sakes of their future. \n Alex\u2019s communication needs are still very much in the forefront of our thoughts.  While he\u2019s growing and expanding his interests (more about that later), his communication challenges still hold him back in significant ways.  Ben, on the other hand, is becoming more communicative on his own.  For example, when the nail on the toe he almost broke a while back tore below the quick, he made this fact known by saying, \u201cBand-Aid please.\u201d  This being a first for Ben, I asked him if he had an \u201cowie\u201d (something I wasn\u2019t convinced he\u2019d recognize) or if he wanted to play with it.  He said, \u201cOwie.  Band-Aid please.\u201d  Then, he moved his foot to draw attention to his bloody toe.  Needless to say, he got his Band-Aid.  The remarkable thing is that he\u2019s not only left it on, he\u2019s let me change it and left the new ones on while his toe nail heals.  His toe is doing much better now, and he\u2019s not limping nearly as much as he was.  Pretty soon it will be entirely healed! \n The main focus of this New Year will be on transition planning for the two older boys.  Despite his initial reluctance, Willy is now interested in going to college so he can learn cool things like his Uncle Patrick.  (Apparently, the things I\u2019ve been learning for the last seven years of college just aren\u2019t cool enough for Willy.)  As Alex\u2019s interests expand, they gravitate more towards the visual arts, including multi-dimensional arts, and that continues to be my hopes for him in lieu of the school\u2019s plans.  The eye of this year is fixed on the future, doing what we can to make sure our children\u2019s futures are as luminous as they are. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/01/looking-ahead-2/", "title": "Looking Ahead"},

{"date": "March 14, 2014", "body": "\r\n Self-help and life skills are all a part of raising a civilized child.  There\u2019s a sense of conforming to the norm, because it is normal for a child of a specific age to be able to dress, feed, and wash up by himself, as well as performing regular hygiene and grooming tasks, like brushing hair and teeth.  In addition, when raising a child with autism, obtaining these skills is important for independence and quality of life purposes.  So, yes, we are conforming to society\u2019s expectations in a way that the child may not initially appreciate. \n The problem comes into play when we expect or even  demand  that these skills be developed in the same way and/or on the same timetable as more typical peers.  Such expectations and demands only lead to mutual disappointment and frustration.  I\u2019ve seen parents who have, at least for the most part, maintained the same timetable by make significant adjustments to the way the skills are developed.  I\u2019ve also seen parents sacrifice the timetable by waiting for the child to develop these skills at his or her own pace.  I\u2019ve tried both routes with mixed success, resulting in a rather mixed approach. \n In the end, the question is not whether we need to conform to society in these regards; the question is how much we are willing to conform to society.  Where we draw the line, as parents, matters.  It impacts how we perceive our children and how our children are perceived by others.  More importantly, it impacts how our children perceive themselves.  It impacts the levels of chaos and order that exist within our homes.  It impacts the comfort and adaptability of our children.  It impacts their quality of life with regards to how expectations and methodologies relate to their frustration, their aspirations, their self-direction, and their self-authority. \n In the end, our children will become adults.  In the end, our children will find ways to communicate their own ideas, their own beliefs, and their own experiences.  As we judge where our own parents drew their lines in the sand, so too will we be judged by our children.  If you doubt that for even a moment, take a look around at the dialogues of autistics adults that pervade the blogosphere. \n So, whatever struggles you face today, I caution my fellow parents to keep this thought in the back of your mind:  What do you want your children to say about you when they can?  Don\u2019t forget that respect others\u2019 personhood is part of civility, too.  The way you teach your children to do that is to do unto them what you would have them do unto others.  Autism doesn\u2019t change that. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/03/grooming-civility/", "title": "Grooming Civility"},

If I was lucky, the first pant leg had stayed on.  If not, then the child had pushed it off again in the struggle.  Socks were the worst, however, with the occasional kick to the face.  The biggest trouble with shirts was the hassle of getting the front of the shirt aligned with the front of the child.  Then, the biggest difficulty was ensuring the child  stayed  dressed.  Of all three, Ben was the most resistant to clothing and he\u2019s now the only holdout.

The primary result of Alex\u2019s meeting is that Alex still baffles those of us who are entrusted with his care and education.  Big surprise, huh?  In discussing our need to grapple with Alex\u2019s needs, once again a resource was brought up for consideration. \n This resource first arose when Alex was ending his elementary school education.  The facility houses a considerable number of professionals who, over a period of two months, analyze and assess a child more thoroughly than would otherwise be available to determine unmet needs and unknown solutions.  It\u2019s an in-patient facility, which means Alex would be living there temporarily. \n The first time this came up we were told that it involved signing over temporary custody (or something like that) to CPS.  That put a stop to that.  This time when it was brought up that was the first thing that came to mind.  I told them if that was still the case, then it would never happen, because CPS representatives have already expressed an interest and an intention to institutionalize Alex. \n OVER MY DEAD BODY!!! \n I mean that literally.  There is no way I will allow Alex to be institutionalized for being a mystery while there is a breath left in my body.  As long as I am alive, Alex will not be institutionalized.  And, to be perfectly clear, a lot more people than just me would have to die before the government would gain enough traction to enforce that option. \n Granted, in-patient care is dangerously close to institutionalization.  But it\u2019s not the same thing.  The differences make it a potentially viable option if the benefits would be sufficiently substantial.  But the benefits won\u2019t even be considered if it involves signing Alex over to CPS. \n OVER MY DEAD BODY!!! \n And, just so there is no doubt about the strength of my feelings on this matter, I\u2019ll let you all know right now that I intend to  HAUNT  anyone  who dares to institutionalize my child after my death. \n Yes, my son is a mystery.  I\u2019ve accepted that.  I understand the drive to better understand this mystery and I share it.  If that means we must be deprived of Alex\u2019s company for a month or two, then I can live with that.  But I no longer have the luxury of idealism when it comes to trusting the government.

{"date": "March 10, 2014", "body": "\r\n When we first learned about autism and sensory integration disorder, we learned (among many other things) why haircuts seemed so traumatic for the boys.  Simply put, they  seemed  traumatic because they  were  traumatic. \n I remember how the boys would writhe under the scissors or the buzzer (an electric hair clipper).  It used to be that I would sit down and hold one of the boys on my lap, while my mom cut their hair as quickly as possible.  We\u2019d all get covered in hair, the child would cry, and it would end with us in a breathless, exhausted tumble of remonstration, remorse, and reconciliation. \n Once we understood that, yes, they acted like haircuts hurt because, to them,  it did !  When we understood the impact of sensory integration disorder and ineffective communication skills, we changed how we did things.  Mainly, we performed haircuts in short bursts and separated each burst of haircutting with intense sensory regulation strategies.  The result was a little less trauma, but otherwise the same.  As the boys grew older and stronger, it seemed\u2014at first\u2014that the only thing that really changed is that Mark was the one to get covered in hair instead of me. \n Then, something miraculous happened.  It started with Willy.  You see, he started becoming adept at self-regulation.  He gained more self-control.  So, while he still put off haircuts as long as possible and continues to dislike haircuts, he became able to endure them to the point that he could sit for them himself, he could tell us when he needed a break, he could regain his own self-control, and could tell us when he was ready to come back. \n Alex\u2019s journey is this regard was a little less straightforward and isn\u2019t as progressed, but he can also sit for haircuts by himself.  He\u2019ll let my mom know when he\u2019s had enough.  He\u2019ll come back when he can tolerate more.  He can self-direct his participation.  And they can both tolerate the buzzer! \n In Ben\u2019s case, the story is a bit different.  Becky, Ben\u2019s therapist, took over the responsibility of cutting Ben\u2019s hair.  She volunteered herself and has kept it up over the years.  The results are satisfactory and we trust Becky completely, so we\u2019ve let her choose when to cut Ben\u2019s hair, how to cut his hair, etc.  So, she manages the entirety of the project.  Ben still cannot tolerate the buzzer, but seeing as Becky does it all by herself\u2014controlling the environment in which the hair is cut is one of her strategies\u2014Ben, too, must be doing better. \n When the boys were little, I despaired of ever reaching this point.

{"date": "March 19, 2014", "body": "\r\n It\u2019s spring break from my classes, so I wanted to use this time to share a few of the things I\u2019ve learned in my ethics class last week.  In administrative ethics, the dual focus is organizational ethics and individual ethics.  Ethical autonomy is where this dual focus collides. \n Apparently, there are a variety of theories that try to explain how organizations erode the individual ethic of their members.  We see the results of this erosion in our government sectors, our business sectors, our nonprofit sectors, and even in our advocacy groups.  I find the theories, as I understand them, of Alberto Guerreiro Ramos most compelling, because of all the theories covered in Terry L. Cooper\u2019s  The Responsible Administrator  it is the only one that seems to see this tendency in the larger culture, instead of restricting it to within the organizational environment. \n Essentially, human beings become compartmentalized in order to fit into society by placing themselves in one of society\u2019s defining boxes.  In order to combat this tendency, we need to emphasize our whole personhood and hold onto that, which will allow us to make individual ethical judgments, even when they go against the assertions of the organization(s) we participate in.  In more loaded words, we have to remember that we are individual people\u2014whole people\u2014in order to keep ourselves from unwittingly selling our souls to the organizations we choose to work for/with. \n Last week\u2019s studies made me think of some of my previous employment experiences and the effort trainers and managers made to bring me into the fold.  Cooper, citing Milgram (1974), describes this process as the  agentic shift , which involves diminishing one\u2019s conscience in order to conform to an organization\u2019s hierarchal structure.  I realized, quite readily, that I was never any good at this.  I may \u201cbuy in\u201d to an organization\u2019s message, but as soon as it involves compromising my own ethical standards I disengage, reexamine, and reassert my sense of self. \n I don\u2019t know how extensive this is, but I\u2019ve found a similar tendency among many people on the autism spectrum, and it\u2019s one of the autistic \u201ctraits\u201d I tend to admire most.  Perhaps part of the social \u201cdeficiencies\u201d associated with autism is an inability or an unwillingness to submit oneself to a collective conscience or ethic.  Being neither a psychologist nor a sociologist, I wouldn\u2019t know how to test this theory and I\u2019m not even sure I would know what to look for to see if someone else had already done so.  What I do know, however, is that, from my point of view, if this is true of all or part of people on the spectrum, then I must say it\u2019s a good thing and may even be an adaptive measure to correct some of the corruption rampant in our societies. \n I am conscious of my individual responsibility:  It doesn\u2019t matter who tells me to do something, if I think it\u2019s wrong and I were to do it, then I know I would be responsible for having done it.  So, I don\u2019t do it.  Apparently, this consciousness is unusual.  Ethics researchers are actually investing resources in discovering how to make people conscious of their own culpability.  They talk about building an ethic of awareness, which means that people need to be aware of ethical situations in order to choose ethical action.  They also talk about limiting organizational loyalty, meaning they\u2019re looking into ways to prevent people from submitting themselves completely to their organization(s). \n These are things I do naturally.  I haven\u2019t always had the courage to stand up for what I knew was right, nor have I always known how to go about it, but I\u2019ve always  felt  it.  What does it mean for our societies that ethical autonomy is abnormal?  I think the answer goes far to explain the rampant corruption in our politics, our governance, our businesses, and our culture.  Perhaps the real question is this:  Why, in such a society, would anyone  want  to be normal? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/03/ethical-autonomy/", "title": "Ethical Autonomy"},

They learn it from their parents, from other kids, and from the entertainment industry.

Brandon learned to lie much earlier, but he also learned that telling a lie and getting caught was cause for added punishment.  Telling the truth, even if it was a \u201cbad\u201d truth, meant leniency; sometimes his punishment was limited to a lecture.  Still, Brandon would try to lie when he thought he could get away with it.  I\u2019m sure some of the time it worked, but not always. \n Now, Willy\u2019s learned to lie.

{"date": "March 26, 2014", "body": "\r\n Parenting brings about some pretty strange super powers.  One of mine is the ability to  smell  when my children are getting sick.

It\u2019s not unpleasant and it\u2019s not strong, but it certainly catches my attention. \n I don\u2019t make my decisions about keeping the boys home from school due to illness based on this smell alone, but the smell does give me a warning to pay closer attention to the signs that the boys might be getting sick.  Since the boys don\u2019t necessarily tell us when they\u2019re sick, this can make the difference between keeping the boys home in comfort and getting a call to come pick them up from school. \n Alex was grumpy this weekend.  Several times I saw him get up, start to do something, and then seem to give up or forget and go back to what he was doing before, which required less energy.  I do that all the time, usually because I have too much on a mind disengaged by too little sleep.  Alex sleeps pretty well and usually is more focused, in his own way, than that.

The episode \u201c Samuel Rising \u201d stood out to me as a testament of the integrity of the show.   Roswell  is the story of three human/alien hybrids who are trying to live their teenage human lives while finding out why they were created and sent to earth by their alien parents; it is also an exploration of what it really means to be human.  These human/alien hybrids have diverse gifts and one of Max\u2019s gifts is the ability to heal.  An on-going conflict in the show is how Max should use his gifts:  merely to hide the truth of his identity or to help others in need? \n Earlier in the series, Max conceived a son who taken from earth before birth and is now trying to contact him.  When Samuel, a child with autism, comes up to him in a restaurant and says, \u201cDaddy,\u201d Max believes his son is using Samuel as a conduit to contact him.  After a failed attempt to achieve mutual communication, Max\u2019s human girlfriend suggests that maybe Samuel talked to Max for Samuel\u2019s sake, not for Max\u2019s. \n In an effort to help Samuel for his own sake, Max sneaks into Samuel\u2019s house late at night and tries to heal him.  Afterwards, he expects Samuel to talk to him, but he doesn\u2019t.  Frustrated, Max returns to his girlfriend at a loss.  This is what happens next: \n She says, \u201cSo, what happened?\u201d \n \u201cIt didn\u2019t work,\u201d he says.  \u201cI couldn\u2019t heal him.\u201d \n \u201cWell, maybe he didn\u2019t need to be healed.  You heal people who are sick or hurt, but Samuel isn\u2019t sick or hurt.  He\u2019s just different.\u201d \n After some thought, Max says, \u201cMaybe I was trying to heal the wrong person.\u201d \n The next thing Max does is have his sister, who can walk in people\u2019s dreams, try to bring his parents into it Samuel\u2019s dream.  Samuel\u2019s dream proves he does know what Christmas despite his father\u2019s earlier assertion that he didn\u2019t (represented as a tree, train, presents, and love).  When the dream-version of his parents arrive in his dream (versus the \u201creal\u201d ones watching) he says, \u201cI love you, Mommy.  I love you, Daddy,\u201d just as he would do if he could use words outside his own head. \n When they wake, Samuel\u2019s daddy calls his (ex-)wife and asks to come over.  Samuel gets to live a part of his dream and he gets his daddy back. \n I\u2019ve watched many television shows that include an episode on autism or another disability.  Most are disappointments.

{"date": "March 31, 2014", "body": "\r\n As an inactive Latter-Day Saint, there are times when the missionaries come around for a series of visits intended in reconnecting with me and my family and to encourage us to be more active in the church.  Right now, there are two lovely ladies who are fulfilling this role.  They are bright, cheerful, and enthusiastic.  I enjoy my time with them and the extra spiritual focus in these difficult times.  I\u2019ve shared my passion for changing the world to make it a better place for my children and for the many others who are like them throughout the world.  They are encouraging and supportive. \n But when it comes to my children, there is a recurring statement I find rather misguided and disturbing.  You see, in our church, being \u201csaved\u201d is about being \u201caccountable.\u201d  If you haven\u2019t reached the \u201cage of accountability\u201d by the time you die, then you are already saved by Christ\u2019s grace.  Nothing is really required on your part.  This is in contrast with the doctrine of many other churches, including the Catholic church, in which babies are baptized shortly after birth (and definitely before death) to give them the benefit of Christ\u2019s grace.  In the case of my children, who have disabilities that impact their ability to be held \u201caccountable,\u201d the same assumption applies\u2014they\u2019re already saved. \n Now, from the perspective of many Latter-Day Saints, our time on earth is a trial period.  What we do here impacts our lives for eternity.  We must prove our commitment to God, even in relative ignorance, through the lives we live.  By assuming that my children are already saved, they are assuming my children aren\u2019t here to be tried.  The natural extension of which is that my children are part of my trial.  This, in turn, reduces them from the role of willful actors on the world stage to mere objects to be acted upon. \n Before a whirlwind of criticism rains on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I\u2019d like to point out that they are not the only Christian group that holds similar beliefs and that I\u2019ve yet to see any of these Christian groups, including members of my own church, follow the logic of this particular belief.  In fact, this belief is usually expressed as, \u201cGod loves them so much He made sure they\u2019ll make it back home to Him.\u201d \n It\u2019s a nice sentiment and I understand why a church that is so concerned about accountability and choice, and the importance of communicating an understanding of God, would be satisfied with a doctrine which recognized those who aren\u2019t able to meet the church\u2019s standards in traditionally recognized ways by covering them with a blanket of grace.  In short, they mean well. \n Now, I believe that we are all sons and daughters of God.  I believe we lived with our Heavenly Father in a pre-mortal, spiritual existence.  I believe we were given a choice to come down here and that, when we made that choice, we knew what kind of life we would be given and the choices we would face, at least in part.  I believe our conscious knowledge of this is hidden by a \u201cveil,\u201d because if we knew now what we knew then it wouldn\u2019t be much of a test.  I believe we will all die and return to our Heavenly Father in some form or other, though not all of us will be able to stay.  I believe we will all be held accountable for who we choose to be here on earth.  All of us, within the scope of our choices, will be held accountable. \n For me, the difference is this:  God is not limited.  Sure, despite my best efforts, I cannot communicate the teachings of the Church to Alex and determine whether or not he wants to participate in the Church.  Nor can I do so for Ben, at least not yet.  Willy learned the basic teachings of the Church and chose to be baptized.  He, however, does not choose to attend church.  Mark and I have respected each of the choices Willy has made.  Mark and I respect the fact that we cannot successfully communicate these choices to Alex or Ben.  The reason is simple:  Mark and I are limited and so are Alex and Ben.  God is not limited. \n I believe that God has a relationship with each of my children.  They may not always be conscious of this relationship; then again, I\u2019m not always conscious of my relationship with God either.  They may not always be able to communicate about this relationship; then again, I\u2019m not always able to communicate about my relationship with God either.  But I know it\u2019s there.  I know it\u2019s there and I know that God will be able to hold Alex and Ben accountable, within their own limits, just as He will be able to hold me accountable within mine. \n The Church may never know what choices Alex and Ben make.  When it comes to their faith (or lack thereof), I may never really know what choices they make.  But they do have a choice and God knows what choices they make and what they mean.  Because God does not operate with the same limits we do.  He understands us, even when we don\u2019t have the words or when the words we use don\u2019t make sense, because he is not limited by our language.

{"date": "February 14, 2014", "body": "\r\n Ben\u2019s IEP meeting went better than expected, just as I hoped.  When I invited the gentlemen from the Richardson School, I informed Ben\u2019s teacher that I was doing so.  I knew the school\u2019s reaction would be to have someone with especial authority from the district attend as well, and that\u2019s what I wanted to see.  It wasn\u2019t a manipulation, I assure you.  I genuinely wanted the gentlemen to attend and I genuinely wanted their input.  I knew, however, that the IEP team would need more authority than usual in order to make a truly effective placement decision.  So, the extra authority was necessary and welcome, even if other parents might feel the district was stacking the deck against them. \n You see, I wasn\u2019t going into the meeting with the intention of \u201cwinning\u201d what I wanted from the district.  If I learned anything from  editing Vaughn\u2019s book , it\u2019s this:  What I want isn\u2019t important, what the school district wants to provide isn\u2019t important, the only thing that\u2019s truly important is what the child needs.  Getting Ben what he needed was my only goal. \n They opened the meeting by telling me their objectives:  determining whether Ben continued to qualify for special education services (he does); reviewing past progress (which we did); and setting his goals for the next year (which we also did).  They then asked me what my concerns were, since it was obvious that I had at least one.  I told them that my main concern was regarding Ben\u2019s academic progress compared to state standards and his placement. \n I was then given the opportunity to address these concerns and basically build a platform that would be addressed throughout the meeting.  I explained that, as I saw it, Ben had reached the point where he was especially open to learning.  My fear, then, was that if this window of opportunity wasn\u2019t taken advantage of, he\u2019d grow frustrated and the window would close.  I knew that was a real possibility, because that\u2019s what seems to have happened with Alex; which is not to say there will never be another window, but that it is an opportunity too precious to miss.  My goal was to make sure Ben was placed in an environment where this window would be taken advantage of, where he\u2019d learn and be challenged. \n We talked about the progress Ben has made so far this year.  As it turned out, he was making a lot more progress with social skills and language than had previously been reported to me.  He was no longer spending his entire day in an isolated environment.  He would have visitors and he would go around visiting, using practical language skills throughout the day.  He had also made significant academic progress and his goals were either attained or emerging.  As I put it, Ben tends to get stuck on a frequency.  If the adults around him can tune into his frequency, they can access what he\u2019s really capable of and help him develop that.  His new teacher can! \n It was great to hear.  As the meeting progressed and the accomplishments piled up, I knew that we wouldn\u2019t be changing Ben\u2019s placement.  I wasn\u2019t disappointed the way a few seemed to expect.  The point was not to get Ben \u201cwhere I wanted him to be,\u201d but to make sure Ben got to be where he needed to be.  With the new teacher, he was right where he needed to be! \n We talked about past goals, we talked about new goals, we talked about formal testing and accommodations and upcoming changes to state testing instruments.  We talked about Ben\u2019s services and what he needed to achieve his goals.  There was a lot of excitement in the room, because Ben was doing quite well, and there was no hostility. \n Then, we started talking about placement.  I made it clear (directing my comments to the senior district representative) that this discussion shouldn\u2019t be about what the district had available (she nodded) or about what I wanted (she nodded again), but that the decision was supposed to be based on what\u2019s best for Ben (she nodded and smiled).  I described briefly how the decision to transfer Ben from Kennedy to Wilson was made, how the decision was presented to me as \u201cIt\u2019s either Kennedy or Wilson and Kennedy doesn\u2019t work, so it\u2019s Wilson.\u201d \n At this point, someone from Wilson broke in and asserted how much Wilson had done for Ben, basically defending the school.  The hostility was suddenly palpable, and it was obvious to the right people that the hostility wasn\u2019t coming from me.  So, when I had a chance to speak again, I reiterated my point that this wasn\u2019t about Wilson, but about making sure Ben was placed where he needed to be to take advantage of the open window.  I made it clear that I wasn\u2019t \u201cagainst\u201d Wilson and that I definitely recognized the teacher\u2019s skill and connection with Ben.  My point was that, for Ben\u2019s best interests, we needed to have an open, honest discussion about where Ben needed to be, knowing there were real options (like the Richardson School), instead of anyone telling me there was only one choice. \n That\u2019s exactly the kind of discussion we had.  And, in the end, considering the dramatic progress Ben is making, we decided\u2014as a  team \u2014that Ben would stay at Wilson.  The people from the Richardson school even said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great team here and while, a year ago, yeah, Richardson might have been the right place for him, but he\u2019s already making the kind of progress we like to see in our students.\u201d  I agreed.  The point, however, was this time around it was a team decision made with real options, which is what it\u2019s supposed to be. \n I can handle the hostility.  I\u2019m especially glad I\u2019m not the only one who saw it\u2014I was looking at the senior district person when the person in question started her \u201cdefense\u201d and her face was sufficiently expressive considering I was looking for her reaction.

You see, Alex has talent.  Alex has had many disadvantages and has foregone the typical art instruction children receive in the United States for many years, yet he has an extraordinary interest and talent with visual arts. \n These aren\u2019t just the words of a proud mother.  I know that I have little skill in assessing any form of visual art and even less aptitude in creating them.  So, the best I could discern was to recognize that Alex\u2019s art\u2014indeed the art of all four of our boys\u2014is better than anything I can produce, and to recognize (from the art training I have received) certain qualities that seemed rather remarkable.  But, even to me, this didn\u2019t mean much.  So, I obtained the opinions of others who have more skill with assessing and creating visual arts.  Turns out, I wasn\u2019t wrong.  In fact, the reactions I\u2019ve gotten to Alex\u2019s artwork (not to mention the other boys\u2019) has been quite enthusiastic. \n Now, as a professional writer, which is a form of art, I know how difficult it can be to make a career out of a talent and interest in a particular art form.  Even when you have the advantages of encouragement, advanced schooling, and more or less \u201cnormal\u201d interpersonal skills, advancing a career in the arts is a huge challenge.  Many people try and more fail than succeed.  The automatic conclusion is that it would be ridiculous to pursue such a path for Alex, because the odds are very much against him. \n Yet, I also know that there are people with disabilities, even profound disabilities, who do pursue art as a career and do succeed in their endeavors.  I also know that Alex experiences joy when creating his art and he experiences joy when sharing his art with others.  Now, Alex experiences joy doing several different things\u2014watching videos and swimming are prime examples.  But art is one of the few things that he experiences joy when  sharing it with others .  This is significant in ways I can\u2019t even articulate.  If you get it, good; if not, well, then, I guess you\u2019ll just have to take my word for it. \n So, yes, the odds are long.  Yes, it\u2019s not something that will earn him a living right out of school.  Yes, it\u2019s something that will require special support just to make it possible.  But it\u2019s worth it.  It\u2019s worth pursuing.  It\u2019s worth it, because  everybody  deserves the opportunity to at least try to do what they love for a living. \n So, you see, I\u2019m not just looking for backdoors to open up a more acceptable tract for my son.

All three boys like to jump\u2014a lot.  All three boys need to jump a lot to stay regulated.  We provide them with a trampoline at home so they can jump a lot. \n Unfortunately, we have yet to find a trampoline that can last longer than a month with three boys who jump a lot using it every day, several times a day.  I estimate that the trampoline is subjected to somewhere between three to five hours of jumping per day in 5 to 15 minute intervals.  Keep in mind that we\u2019re talking about an indoor trampoline here.  Generally, the trampolines we get are designed for occasional (2-4 times per week) bouts of exercise (30 minutes per time).  They usually come with a 90-day warranty if used as indicated, but the use my boys put the trampoline to is considered abusive. \n Usually, springs start popping off by the end of the first week.  Either that or the tri-prong bars that connect two of the springs to both the mesh and the metal ring start snapping.  We keep the old trampolines for spare parts and can usually stretch the parts for up to a month, depending on what broke with the last one and what\u2019s breaking with this one.  Sometimes other things break that aren\u2019t interchangeable, and then the trampoline is considered unusable for anything but spare parts. \n Does anyone know of any brand of indoor trampoline at any price and (almost) any size that can truly stand up to the kind of use three boys with autism will put it through?

{"date": "September 30, 2013", "body": "\r\n Sleep is a peculiar thing.  You\u2019d think it would come naturally.  I\u2019m sure, for some people, it does.  But not for me and not for many of the people I know. \n A  circadian rhythm  refers to a natural, biological process attuned to the 24-hour day/night cycle of the earth.  In theory, human beings sleep according to a circadian rhythm that attunes them to the day/night cycle.  We sleep best at night and are most alert during the day.  The night shift, of course, changed that for some.  Others, myself included, faced life challenges that disrupted their circadian rhythms. \n Though the boys have gotten much better at sleeping at night, not to mention sleeping long enough to get a good rest, I have found restoring my circadian rhythms much more difficult.  My body tends to slide through the week. \n For example, last week I was so far behind on my work and coursework, I shorted myself on sleep and tried to be awake during the nights so I could have a longer period of uninterrupted work.  I was firmly entrenched in this cycle by the end of Wednesday, which had repercussions I\u2019ll discuss in my next post.  I spent the week working at odd hours, sleeping at odd hours, and my sleep was definitely not cyclic in nature. \n This week I\u2019ve committed myself to a day schedule.  I spent my day of rest (Sunday), resting up from my wee-hour work day on Saturday, eschewing caffeine, and going to bed early (for me) on Sunday night.  I woke refreshed this morning and ready for a full day\u2014at least, I hope so!  Yet, despite the best of intentions, I suspect I\u2019ll slide back into an irregular schedule by the end of the week. \n What\u2019s decidedly worse is that I tend to rely on external chemicals in order to get to sleep regardless of when I do it.  I take between 6 \u2013 10 mg. of melatonin and a full-strength OTC sleeping pill (the equivalent of two Tylenol PM pills, without the acetaminophen).  And that\u2019s when I\u2019m already quite tired and feeling \u201cready to sleep.\u201d  When that is insufficient, I usually add a third melatonin to push me over the edge of consciousness into sleep.  Most of the time, it works.  But sometimes it doesn\u2019t.   Usually, I\u2019m up and alert after 5 \u2013 7 hours of sleep.  Only when I am unwell can I get the 8 or 9 hours people tend to claim we need. \n Mark, on the other hand, will take a full-strength OTC sleeping pill on the nights he can\u2019t sleep and sleep for 12 hours straight\u2014and he\u2019ll sleep hard!  I find myself facilitating from envy to resentment, wondering how he can manage to stay asleep so long.  Seeing that neither envy nor resentment are good qualities/emotions, I try to put off such feelings and instead embrace with gratitude his willingness to cope with my sleeping peculiarities, so that (most of the time) I can sleep when I need to regardless of the time of day. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/09/night-and-day/", "title": "Night and Day"},

{"date": "January 15, 2014", "body": "\r\n So, my brother came for Christmas, stayed through the New Year, and returned to his own college in New York City last week.  It\u2019s difficult to put into words what such a lengthy visit did for the rest of my family.  On the one hand, my brother and I do a fairly good job keeping in touch.  We\u2019re both very busy.  I have work and school and family.  He has work and school, but his school is much more demanding than mine.  So, weeks go by that we don\u2019t communicate at all, but there\u2019s still a connection between us.  Usually, that seems like enough. \n Having him here for such a long time\u2014three whole weeks!\u2014made me feel how disconnected we\u2019d become.  On the one hand, it is necessary.  It\u2019s even inevitable.  On the other hand, this time together was a stark reminder of how much we miss by not being a regular part of each other\u2019s lives. \n Part of it is the intellectual stimulus.  My brother is immersed in studies that are very different from my own.  He also supplements his studies with additional interests beyond my own.  I do the same with interests and studies that differ from his.  When we get together, we both have a lot to talk about that enriches each other\u2019s worlds. \n Beyond this boon, Patrick\u2019s studies and his interests enable him to connect with my boys in a way that Mark and I cannot.  While we see their talent, we cannot grasp it or nurture it as well as we\u2019d like.  Patrick has an eye for things we cannot see.  Whereas we recognize their talent, at least in part, on the basis that their visual arts have already surpassed our abilities; Patrick sees and appreciates their art as only a fellow artist can.  Of course, Patrick is an architect, which is a kind of art, whereas their art is less functional.  But still, he has an eye for it that we lack, but has the words to bring us further into it. \n The bigger part of it is, of course, the emotional stimulus.  It\u2019s not that I\u2019m lonely by any stretch of the imagination.  With a loving husband and three loving not-so-little boys, my days are full of emotional connections.  On the other hand, aside from my mother, my days are rarely shared with others outside my family unit.  I don\u2019t have much in the ways of \u201clocal\u201d friends, at least not those that I spend time with on a regular basis.  I have \u201cvirtual\u201d friends all over the world.  As much as these relationships mean to me, it\u2019s not the same as sitting down with a cup of coffee and chatting or playing a game of cards.  When my brother was here, we did a lot of both.  The time together became so precious that I didn\u2019t even try to work.  Instead, I devoted myself to soaking up every opportunity I could with my brother. \n Now, he\u2019s back at school.  Soon, my own semester will start up with two new classes.  Life goes on and I must go on with it.  I\u2019m not even sure when I\u2019ll get to see my brother again.  This summer he\u2019s going away for some international studies, so it\u2019ll probably be Thanksgiving or Christmas before I see him again. \n I think of the other people in my life who I\u2019ve tried to stay connected to, despite the distance.  For a while, my best friend from high school (who is also my husband\u2019s foster sister) was an occasional visitor.  She lived in Iowa, then Indiana, and so we didn\u2019t see her often, but at least a few times of year we\u2019d get to connect in person.  Now, she\u2019s moved to Alaska.  My best friend from middle school tried to reconnect last year, but our phone calls seemed to pass each other by and our connection seemed to fail.  As much as I want to try again, part of me fears the moment has passed. \n I\u2019m not lonely, not in the traditional meaning of the word.  My life is full and I\u2019m grateful for that.  I\u2019m grateful for all the people and activities that enrich my life on a daily basis.  But this taste of something else, something different leaves me wondering if, perhaps, my life could be fuller still if I knew how to stay connected with those who are on their own paths, paths which are so different from mine. \n More than even that, my brother\u2019s presence made my home a happier place for all of us, and that\u2019s definitely something to cherish. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/01/reconnected/", "title": "Reconnected"},
{"date": "January 20, 2014", "body": "\r\n A new school in my area is dedicated to providing children with special needs with a positive environment, as well as the educational and support services they need.  It seems odd that I\u2019m actually considering this, because, years ago, I was committed to ensuring all of my children had the benefits of an inclusive educational environment.  Unfortunately, in this school district, that goal was unattainable. \n Alex and Ben have both been placed in segregated school environments since they entered elementary school, where they have minimal interactions with regular education peers.  They have primarily attended school in what is called a \u201cCD\u201d or cognitively disabled classroom\u2014a classroom positioned \u201coff to the side\u201d of the regular classrooms that is designed specifically for children with more severe special needs.  More recently, Ben has been pulled out of even this environment and placed in an even more isolated classroom due to his behaviors. \n According to the principle of \u201cleast restrictive environment,\u201d the ideal situation for both boys is an environment that provides them with the educational and support services they need in an environment that places the \u201cleast restrictions\u201d on them.  Now that a new environment is available, I\u2019m beginning to suspect that the least restrictive environment will be a school committed to their needs, instead of a room segregated from their peers. \n Today I will visit this new school and see the environment for myself.  If I like what I see, I\u2019m going to take a serious look at what is being provided for my children versus what could be provided for them.  If the new environment is indeed a better environment for their education, then that will become a new goal.  The idea isn\u2019t, however, to have them \u201cplaced\u201d somewhere specific, but to have their needs met in a way in a better, more successful way.

The second time it came, a meteorologist on the news feeds explained what a polar vortex was, why the second one wasn\u2019t one, and why some of the dire reactions to \u201cpolar vortex\u201d were wrong.  School wasn\u2019t closed, but it was still pretty cold.  This time nobody seems to be talking about polar vortexes, but the extreme cold is here and school is again canceled for two days (at least). \n These waves of cold are disruptive.  The outdoors is dangerously cold, so along with school we\u2019ve canceled any other appointments we have.  Instead, we hunker down in our home, where it\u2019s warm and safe.  The boys go about their business as if it\u2019s a continuation of the weekend and take the disruption in stride. \n This is relatively new.  When I was a child, I always celebrate snow days as an unexpected reprieve from school.  It wasn\u2019t that I disliked school\u2014at least, most of the time I didn\u2019t.  I liked learning well enough and could, usually, tolerate the socialization problems I had at school well enough.  But snow days were unexpected holidays.  They were like sick days, except without the being sick part, which made them all the more precious.  Whether I was bundled up to play outside (which wouldn\u2019t happen in this kind of weather) or cuddled in a chair with a good book, I enjoyed the extra free time. \n For years, my children had a very different response to snow days.  Whether school was going well or not, they wanted to be there because that\u2019s where they were \u201csupposed\u201d to be.  If school was canceled without foreshadowing, well that was unacceptable.  Especially, as happened occasionally, if I got them ready for school before I learned that the buses wouldn\u2019t be coming\u2014that was excruciating for everyone involved, namely the boys and I. \n Now, they just adapt.

I was greeted by the man who runs the school and taken into a meeting with the supervisor who works with this school and its sister school.  We had an intense talk about Alex and Ben, what I was looking for, and how this school might meet their needs.  Then, we took a look around. \n The school was significantly smaller and quieter than I expected.  There are only eight students and they only lease enough space to meet their current needs.  They are housed in a full size school, but only use a portion of it.  They will lease additional space as they need it, as their student population grows.  The quietness was even more unexpected.  Some of the students weren\u2019t in school, because some districts honor Martin Luther King Jr. Day with a day off from school while others don\u2019t, but even so the school was exceptionally quiet.  While peeking in the classrooms, I saw that the kids were on task.  They were attending, focused on their work. \n As I toured the school, one of the most promising things I saw was the art room.  If my boys attend this school, they will have art class twice a week, and could use additional art time as break time.  The art teacher is actually an art therapist as well.  Considering my boys\u2019 inclination for art and their lack of opportunities to develop those interests in their current environment, this was an especially welcome sign. \n Another plus was the emphasis on actual education.  This school is committed to the Common Core State Standards, which is something all schools are supposed to target, but seems lacking in their current environments.  So, it\u2019s possible that Alex and Ben would be able to catch up to where they\u2019re supposed to be if they attended this school.  That would become clearer after the school staff assessed the boys.  Though, one thing I really liked was their flexibility.  They said that if they assessed a child and found, after a month at the school, that the child had a lot more potential than they thought, they could adjust easily to meet the child\u2019s needs. \n I was looking at this school to see if it might be a better environment for my children.  After visiting this school, I think it may be just what they need.  I have IEPs coming up for both of them.

When I took Ben to his conference, he was really excited to be out with Mama all by himself\u2014until we arrived at his school.  His enthusiasm plummeted and he plodded his way to the door. \n After picking up on the body language, I tried to get him to communicate his feelings, asking him, \u201cIs school good or bad?\u201d  All he would say for me was \u201cschool\u201d in a ho-hum sort of voice. \n He explored his new-but-familiar classroom\u2014the same classroom he started the last year in\u2014and silently sat at his desk drawing with a highlighter.  His new-but-familiar teacher talked to me about what she already knew about Ben, with the speech and occupational therapists adding in their own comments.

Finally, I crouched down next to his desk and said, \u201cBen, what\u2019s that?\u201d  He looked up, saw where my finger was pointing, and clearly and accurately said, \u201cNorth America.\u201d  Then, he looked back down at his drawing. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  He looked up.  \u201cEurope.\u201d  Again, he said this clearly and accurately.  I could feel the excited hum behind me.  The teacher and therapists were watching.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  \u201cAsia.\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  \u201cAfrica.\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  \u201cAustralia.\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  \u201cPacific Ocean.\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  \u201cAtlantic Ocean.\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  \u201cIndian Ocean.\u201d \n The people behind me were bubbling with excitement. \n Ben took my finger, as if to say, \u201cMom, you missed one,\u201d and placed it on one of the bright continents.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that,\u201d I asked.  \u201cSouth America.\u201d  I pulled back, but Ben wasn\u2019t done.  He took my finger again and he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  \u201cAntarctica,\u201d I said, very slowly and clearly.  Then, he copied me, \u201cAnt-ark-tick-ah.\u201d  Then, since there was one left, I put my finger on the last label on the map, \u201cArtic Ocean.\u201d  \u201cArk-tick Ocean.\u201d \n This time I stepped back and the teacher took my place, opening up one of the books she\u2019d picked out for Ben that had much more detailed maps in it.  My point was made. \n The next week went pretty well.  Then, one morning last week, I noticed Ben\u2019s toe nails were rather long.  I figured it could wait, since the bus could come any moment.  But when he was in his shoes, he was limping a little.  So, since the bus hadn\u2019t come, I took off his sock and shoe and cut the nails on that foot.  His foot and toes all looked fine, aside from the long nails.  I put the sock and shoe on again. \n Then, since the bus still hadn\u2019t come, I took off the other sock and shoe and cut those nails.  Again, his feet looked fine.  I put the sock and shoe back on and noticed that he still favored one of his feet.  Walking out to the bus, the limp seemed more pronounced.  I figured his foot must feel funny now that the nails were cut.  That wasn\u2019t unusual for my boys. \n When I got home, though, Mark told me to look at Ben\u2019s foot.  The toe nail on Ben\u2019s big toe on his right foot was deeply bruised and the knuckle was swollen.  It looked like it was broken.  His limp was much more pronounced, too.  But how?  How could he have hurt his toe so thoroughly when I was right there watching him the whole time and nothing the least bit untoward had happened? \n Maybe he stubbed it, I thought and left it go at that for the night.  After all, aside from the limp, there were no signs of pain.  He didn\u2019t cry.  He didn\u2019t rub it.  He didn\u2019t seem to care too much at all.  But in the morning it seemed worse, not better.  I sent him to school and he limped throughout the day. \n Well, I thought, maybe it is broken.  But, aside from the limp, he didn\u2019t seem bothered by it.  So, I scheduled an appointment for the following morning.

{"date": "March 3, 2014", "body": "\r\n Faith is transformative.  When you develop faith in something, your faith transforms who you are, how you see yourself, how you see the world, and what you do.  The stronger your faith becomes the more transformative it becomes. \n I am a Christian.  I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  I believe He took upon Himself earthly flesh in order to be a living example unto us and in order to sacrifice Himself for our sins.  I believe human beings are fallen:  Fallible, corrupted, and imperfect.  I believe human beings, at least in our earthly forms, are finite:  All our abilities are limited, including and especially our abilities to observe and understand the world around us.  I believe we are capable of greatness, for good or for evil.  And I believe that evil is a real force in this world that affects us all. \n These beliefs transform me continually.  They shape how I see the world and they shape how I see my fellow human beings.  Yet, I also believe in the freedom of mind, the freedom of thought, the freedom of belief (especially, but not exclusively, religious belief), and the freedom of speech. \n I am a Christian, but I don\u2019t expect you to be a Christian.  I look at the world around me and see a multitude of beliefs and I am content.  One of the beliefs I see is a conviction in science.  There are people who believe in science the way I believe in God.  I can\u2019t do that.  For one, according to my faith, that would be idolatry.  For two, science is a man-made discipline, which according to my faith means it is finite, fallible, corruptible, imperfect, and limited. \n The irony I see is that these beliefs are reinforced by science itself.  Scientists have demonstrated their finite abilities to observe and understand the universe.  They have proven themselves to be fallible every time they correctly apply the scientific method to reach a conclusion, which is later disproven by yet another application of the scientific method.  Scientists have recognized the corruptibility of their discipline, whether intentional or unintentional, which is why they use double-blind studies\u2014so their assumptions, predispositions, and inclinations are not as likely to influence their results.  Scientists recognize the imperfection of their discipline\u2014at least, they used to\u2014which is why they call their conclusions  theories , signifying that a proven theory is the best they can do to explain a given set of variables to the best of their abilities within their current limitations.  Scientists recognize\u2014at least, they used to\u2014that theories have a nasty habit of being disproven and reconfigured over time.  While I don\u2019t understand advanced physics, I do know there are active (i.e., not disproven) theories that directly contradict each other alive in physics today.  As per my limited understanding, these conflicting theories work to explain current observations and have mechanical application, but that they require a unifying theory that does not exist yet.  I am, however, much more familiar and comfortable with the conflicting theories that abound in social sciences, like psychology and sociology. \n Science provides us with a limited and imperfect way to understand the world we live in and the universe in which our world resides.  As such, I respect it.  But I do not, cannot, and will not put my faith in science. \n Now, if this was a treatise against science, I would point out how inconsistent it is with scientific methodology and principles to assert that man-made global warming, i.e. climate change, and human evolution from animals are  facts .  A fact is something that we know actually exists, because it has been observed to have happened.  We have  NOT  observed man-made global warming and we have not observed human evolution from animals.  We have, however, observed facts which support the  theories  of man-made global warming and human evolution from evolution.  The fact that even scientists have made these erroneous assertions is further evidence that science itself is corruptible. \n But this is not a treatise against science.  This is a post about autism.  Really, it is.  You see, science (i.e. doctors) tell us that autism is a disorder:  The implication is that there is a \u201ccorrect\u201d order for a human brain to be in and that autism isn\u2019t it.  Science will tell us that autism can and should be cured.  Science will tell us that people with disabilities are broken and that science can fix them. \n My Christian faith tells me something else.  My Christian faith tells me that my children were knitted together by God in the womb.  My Christian faith tells me that the inherent people my children are is exactly who God made them to be, which is not to say \u201cperfect,\u201d because we\u2019re all fallen.  But, and this is a big  BUT , God does not make broken people.  Now, it\u2019s true that people have free will and people have a tendency to break each other for their own sick purposes, but that\u2019s a whole other thing having to do with abuse, neglect, and other forms of man-made trauma.  The point is that my Christian faith tells me to love and accept my children as they are, to raise them up to be, to the best of my abilities, the people God wants them to be, and to treat them with charity, which is love not donations. \n My faith also tells me that God can heal.  Jesus Christ healed the sick, the infirm, the lame, the blind, and even the dead.  According to my faith, I believe that if God healed my children they would still be autistic in the sense that there neurology would be profoundly different from \u201cnormal,\u201d but that their neurological differences would no longer be a source of aggravation, discomfort, and frustration for them.  Science, on the other hand, tells us that if my children were healed, then they would be normal. \n Now, I know and freely admit that there are Christians who have a very different perspective from my own.  This is  a  Christian perspective; not  the  Christian perspective.  I also know there are scientists who have a very different perspective than the one, which in my experience is still dominant, which I\u2019ve presented here\u2014I salute you!  I also know that I am just as limited and fallible as the rest of humanity and acknowledge, quite freely, that I very well could be wrong.  But I also know that I\u2019ve spent over a decade studying, praying, exploring, questioning, and informing my beliefs.  I\u2019ve tested this by everything I know and everything I\u2019ve learned and I am confident that, within my own limitations, I can do the best for my children, for our society, and for the world by sharing my beliefs with others.  It is only by sharing that we can instruct, edify, admonish, correct, and uplift one another.  And we all need that, whether we know it or not. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/03/autism-a-christian-perspective/", "title": "Autism:"},

Behaviorism was the only thing that could puncture that apparent indifference of his. I didn\u2019t like this approach for that reason.

He just wanted friends. \n \u2026 \n It was plain old being ready. Time. And the nurturing acceptance of Special Olympics coaches. The message that you are perfect just as you are, now let\u2019s play ball. \n Children grow up, whether they are autistic or not.  Acceptance nurtures that growth, whether the one who is accepted is autistic or not.  Think back to your own childhood.  Who made the most positive differences in your life?

{"date": "January 31, 2014", "body": "\r\n As I start my second semester of public administration studies, I embark on a study of administrative ethics.  Ethics has always been of great interest to me, because I feel it is very important, even essential, to do what is right as much as possible.  If I am to increase the opportunities for me to do what is right, then I have to better understand what the right thing to do is.  Ethics helps in that goal by helping me construct a framework to use when making decisions. \n In my recent reading, I learned something new, something rather unexpected, and I\u2019d like to share it with you.  The text I\u2019m reading now is  The Responsible Administrator  by Terry L. Cooper .  According to Cooper,  responsibility  is a relatively new term coined after the American and French revolutions in response to the need of a new way to define \u201ca common set of values among people of divergent cultures and traditions.\u201d \n Apparently, the change of political and governing structures did so much damage to our ideas of roles, structures, and obligations that we had to create a new framework for understanding and expressing our expectations for ethical behavior.   Responsibility  asserts obligations on individuals in order to describe and attribute obligations for achieving what is right. \n In this sense, the idea of  responsibility  is evolving and adaptable as we learn more and more about what the consequences of behaviors and values can be, thereby bringing us\u2014as a society and as individuals\u2014closer to what is right. \n Cooper asks, \u201cWhat does it mean to be a responsible parent in the first decade of the twenty-first century?  Or a responsible spouse, responsible citizen, responsible politician, or responsible public administrator?\u201d \n As a partial answer to this question, Cooper proposes, \u201cResponsible administrators must be ethically sophisticated enough to reason with others about the ways in which their conduct serves the public interest and have sufficient clarity about their own professional ethical commitments to maintain integrity and a sense of self-esteem.\u201d \n Remembering that I am studying public administration with the intention of learning what I need to know to found my own nonprofit organization, which will serve people with neurological differences, I cannot help but apply these questions and this answer to my own areas of interest. \n What does it mean to be a responsible parent of a child with autism?  What does it mean to be a responsible citizen in a society with people with neurological differences?  What does it mean to be a responsible founder of an organization intending to serve the needs and interests of people with neurological differences? \n It is not enough to simply do what you believe is right.  You need to be able to explain, articulate, and justify  why  it is right, because then you can apply the ethical standard more generally.  For example, a responsible parent of a child with autism will not pursue treatments that endanger the life of their child, because the life of their child is more important than the outcome of the treatment.  Projecting this value further, a responsible parent of a child with autism will not kill their child because the child\u2019s autism is incurable, because the life of their child is more important than whether or not the child is autistic.  By understanding and articulating our reasons and our justifications, we clarify our ethical standards and reveal lapses in ethical judgment. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/The-Responsible-Administrator-Approach-Administrative/dp/0470873949/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391002517&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Responsible+Administrator+by+Terry+L.+Cooper"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/01/1256/", "title": "No Title"},

If you\u2019re familiar with autism, then you can see how this might be a problem for children with autism. \n When Alex was little he didn\u2019t live in the world.  Sure, he shared the same physical space we did.  But he was rather unobservant of the things and people around him.  He assigned such a different sense of importance to the things around him that it was very, very difficult for others to relate with him and to interact with him in a way that he would appreciate. \n Even now, after extensive therapy, my boys assign different senses of importance to the things and people around them than \u201cnormal\u201d people do.  This, in and of itself, isn\u2019t a problem.  However, this tendency to perceive and interpret the world differently makes it hard for my children to relate with others.  It makes it hard for them to interact with the world around them.  It makes it hard for them to tolerate (from a sensory perspective) the world around them.  In short, it makes it hard for them to live \u201cin the world.\u201d \n When I first started delving into the autism community there was a rather large and seemingly significant group of self-advocates with autism who said they felt like aliens from another planet.  This metaphor seems to have died down, in part because it tends to justify exclusion tactics and reinforces the idea that people with autism aren\u2019t \u201chuman enough.\u201d  Yet, it did help, in some small way, for me to better understand \u201cwhere\u201d Alex \u201cwas,\u201d or perhaps, \u201cwhere he was coming from.\u201d \n People with autism aren\u2019t aliens.  They are human beings and part of the range of normal human divergence.  That means they have every one of them has the right to live \u201cin the world\u201d just as much as anyone else.  To achieve this goal, one thing \u201cwe\u201d do is devise and utilize therapeutic services that help people with autism better acclimate themselves to the world.  We devote a lot of energy and resources to this strategy.  A less recognized and less well-resourced strategy, however, is adapting the world to be more inclusive and accessible to people with autism. \n As far as I can tell, people who are mostly \u201cof the world\u201d tend to expect their fellow human beings to adapt to the world and the societies we\u2019ve collectively created, either not knowing or not caring that the world and the societies we\u2019ve collectively created are preconditioned to serve the \u201cmajority\u201d or the \u201cnorm\u201d as determined by those who are good at getting power in society.  People who are \u201cin the world\u201d see the world we\u2019ve created as being flexible and changeable, recognizing that we can and should adapt the world and our societies to be more inclusive and accessible to all people, regardless of the nature of their differences.

When the law was passed, my family was safe and secure in a state-run program that offered families a way to ease off of medical assistance by providing an opportunity to purchase subsidized insurance when they no longer qualified for fully-funded insurance.  I\u2019m not entirely sure how this program really worked, because this month is the first time I made enough to be eligible for the transition and the Affordable Care Act killed the program.  Now, my choice is Obamacare or bust. \n When President Obama first started pushing this legislation, I wasn\u2019t exactly supportive.  On the one hand, we really do have a problem in this country, so there was a part of me that really wanted it to work.  On the other hand, this legislation doesn\u2019t do anything to fix the problem, because, as the system stands, healthcare cannot be \u201caffordable\u201d for providers and insurers and the people.  Somebody has to lose out on that deal.  Seeing as the major supporters of the legislation included providers and insurers, I suspected that the people would be the losers, no matter what the President and his supporters claimed. \n When initial estimates for Wisconsin residents were released, all the evidence pointed to the people being the big losers.   Recently debated figures  indicate a rate  increase  of 10-185% due to the legislation that makes health insurance \u201caffordable.\u201d  Since I cannot afford health insurance independently, my only hope of providing my husband and me with adequate coverage is to hope and pray for adequate subsidies (my children are still covered through Wisconsin\u2019s disability-related insurance program).  The only way to access those subsidies is to go through the program run by the federal government. \n This is all the more complicated by the very unsuccessful roll-out of the new Healthcare.gov website.  When I discovered that I would be forced to use President Obama\u2019s hallmark legislation to provide my husband and me with insurance, I was also taking a class about the crossroads of technology and public administration.  Let\u2019s just say that the disaster that is Healthcare.gov seems so much worse when you\u2019re actually informed and leave it at that.  Okay, I\u2019ll throw this in too:  After discovering how important online security really is, I really have no interest in loading up confidential financial information on a site that hasn\u2019t passed its security tests because those tests were deemed too time-consuming under such a tight deadline. \n The problem is that I don\u2019t have any good choices.  I can either go without insurance, which means my husband will go without prescription medication, or I can let the federal government take even greater control over my life.  Either I pay a penalty for having no insurance or I pay more than I can afford for insurance that I cannot afford to use effectively.  The only other option is to give up the freedom of self-employment in favor of a job that will provide insurance I can actually afford, if there are any employers who can still afford to provide insurance to their workers after this whole mess shakes out. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://watchdog.org/104214/wi-media-reveals-itself-on-obamacare-sticker-shock-reporting/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/12/the-ripple-effect/", "title": "The Ripple Effect"},

It\u2019s hard finding the right person, and sometimes there just aren\u2019t enough options. \n After Willy started having seizures, he struggled to cope with them.  The seizures destabilized his moods and made him prone to irritability.  When he started taking anti-seizure medication, we expected his moods to stabilize, too.  Instead, his moods got worse.  In a moody fit, Willy wrote us a very scary letter that expressed suicidal feelings without suicidal ideation. \n Mark is diagnosed with bi-polar disorder.  I\u2019m diagnosed with depression.  We know way too much about emotional imbalances to let something like that slide.  I made an appointment with Willy\u2019s pediatrician, showed him the note, and asked for a referral.  Actually, I didn\u2019t have to ask for the referral, because the pediatrician offered me a referral before I got the chance to ask.

She\u2019s also easy for Willy to talk to, which is even more important because he\u2019s the one she\u2019s trying to help.  She has a solid understanding of autism, a good understanding of epilepsy, and a fabulous understanding of how special needs and adolescence can collide. \n During our next neurology appointment, I showed the same letter to the neurologist.  I talked about the counseling and I also talked about my discovery that mood instability and depression were a side effect of the prescribed medicine.  After discussing our options, the neurologist recommended that we try a supplement called B6 before we considered changing Willy\u2019s prescription.  We were very lucky to find a medicine that eliminates Willy\u2019s seizures with such a low dose and there\u2019s no guarantee that another medicine will have the same results.  In his experience as a neurologist, B6 had helped several patients with such side effects, though there wasn\u2019t a documented medical explanation for it. \n I can\u2019t tell you how much of the transformation is due to the B6 and how much is due to the counseling.  All I can tell you is that Willy is doing much, much better.  It\u2019s going a bit far to say Willy\u2019s mood is stable, because he is, after all, a teenager.  But he\u2019s not depressed and his mood instability is not abnormal in its frequency or its severity.  While we\u2019re not ready to stop the counseling sessions quite yet, we\u2019re focusing more on skill-building than on damage control.  The hope is that, when we\u2019re done, Willy will be better able to cope with life without the safety net of counseling, though we\u2019ll continue the supplement. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/12/the-counseling-angle/", "title": "The Counseling Angle"},

Bridget Allen brings us that voice . \n First, I want to clarify that my focus is on disability employment because there is a problem I see that I want to fix: \n But I do not work. I am autistic, and being the autistic I am means I am real-world, social-model-disabled. I do not work because I cannot. There are a dozen hypothetical \u2018what if...\u2019 or \u2018should be...\u2019 scenarios in which I could hold down a job, but that is not my reality. \n There are very few reasons that I can imagine that work should be impossible for someone who wants to work.  If you want to work, but you\u2019re incarcerated for criminal activity\u2026  If you want to work, but you\u2019re comatose\u2026  If you want to work, but you need to spend your time rehabilitating from an injury, illness, or addiction\u2026  If you want to draw a payment, but don\u2019t actually want to work\u2026  If you want to work, but aren\u2019t willing to abide by the ethical standards of your profession\u2026  These are a few reasons why work might be genuinely impossible. \n In a society as diverse, as wealthy, as technology capable as ours, there shouldn\u2019t be such a thing as \u201ctoo disabled to work\u201d for someone who wants to work.  Accommodations and innovations are sufficiently possible to give people the opportunity to work to support themselves, regardless of their disabilities. \n This idealized possibility of work shouldn\u2019t mean someone\u2019s self-worth or social-worth should be defined by the work that they do (or don\u2019t do, as the case may be) as indicated by this passage: \n My childhood was infused with a popular feminist theme. I was taught that a Real Woman is financially independent. She doesn\u2019t need a man be it a husband or larger entity (The Man) to support her basic needs or the needs of her offspring. A Real Woman knows children are an accessory to a career, not something one builds a life around. I regularly heard the words \u2018housewife\u2019 and \u2018brood mare\u2019 used interchangeably. I am loathe to believe this is real feminism, because empowerment that exists on the denigration and neglect of other\u2019s needs empowers no one. \n It certainly shouldn\u2019t be a choice between acknowledging one\u2019s need for disability-related assistance and raising one\u2019s children without interference from CPS as indicated in this passage: \n I started to apply for disability once, but every worker I spoke to asked the same question: If you are too disabled to work, how can you be a fit mother? I was told, repeatedly and in no uncertain terms that if I submitted an SSI application, a Child Protective Services investigation would be in my future. \n It should simply be a choice: \n If I could choose, I likely would stay home, but I don\u2019t really have that choice.

I\u2019m over thirty and under forty, so I\u2019m at an age where I feel anything that doesn\u2019t end in a 0 doesn\u2019t matter.  The point isn\u2019t that I\u2019m getting older or just how old I might be.  The point is that I get to kick off my birthday with a rather special surprise. \n At 8:00 AM I\u2019m going to meet Alex\u2019s team to talk about his heightened aggressive behavior.  Sounds fun, doesn\u2019t it? \n You see, Alex was sent home on Wednesday and we were asked to keep him home on Thursday.  This was a surprise and at first I was quite put out.  When I labeled it a suspension, nobody contradicted me, whether that\u2019s what they were intending or not.  We\u2019ve been getting notes about an increase in pinching.  We\u2019ve been seeing that at home, too.  Alex being sent home was related to that. \n When I got there to pick up Alex last Wednesday, I discovered that there was a lot more than pinching going on here.  For one, he was aggressive enough to really hurt one of the paraprofessionals, leaving instant bruises with more bruises surfacing later.  That\u2019s why he was being sent home.  Apparently, Alex was also targeting people, too, though we don\u2019t know why. \n So, on Friday, when he went back to school, they had an independent observer come in to watch him throughout the day, so we could see if we could figure out what\u2019s going on.  Our best guess was \u201cattention seeking\u201d behavior, which would be a kind of breakthrough for Alex, though obviously with a negative spin, i.e. aggression.  We\u2019re hoping the observer will see whatever the school people aren\u2019t seeing. \n So, Tuesday morning, on my birthday, I get to go in early in the morning and talk about all of this and hopefully come up with a new behavioral intervention plan.

{"date": "October 18, 2013", "body": "\r\n This post is a continuation or expansion of last Friday\u2019s post,  A Scientific Link .  Just because we can, doesn\u2019t mean we should. \n If you\u2019re a consumer of science fiction, then you\u2019re familiar with the way writers ask \u201cwhat if\u201d questions in order to explore possible consequences of scientific endeavors.  To get a big dose of this, you can watch  Fringe . \n Basically, science is amoral\u2014not  immoral , meaning in violation of moral principles or wrong, but  amoral , meaning without morality or not concerned with right or wrong.  Legally, we try to assert morality into scientific endeavors by limiting what scientists are allowed to do.  Individual scientists may bring their own morality to bear on their work.  However, science as a discipline is amoral.  It\u2019s about curiosity and testing theories, not about whether or not something should occur. \n Therefore, we can look to science to answer \u201chow\u201d questions, like \u201chow does this work\u201d or \u201chow do we do this;\u201d but, we cannot look to science for the answer for \u201cwhat\u201d questions, like \u201cwhat should we do\u201d and \u201cwhat shouldn\u2019t we do.\u201d \n When it comes to autism and science, we\u2019ve reached the point where we need to focus less on \u201cHow does this work?\u201d and \u201cHow do we do this?\u201d  Instead, I propose that the primary question we should ask is, \u201cWhat should society/scientists be allowed to do to peoples\u2019 brains?\u201d \n In scientific terms, the brain is the storehouse of memory, thought process, and other components that make up personhood, like personality and emotions.  We know that people with brain injuries, stroke, and Alzheimer\u2019s, for example, can undergo significant changes in how they express who they are, because these conditions impact their brain. \n Yet, when it comes to autism and other neurological disorders, there are many people in our society who claim the right to seek a cure due to the disruptiveness of the behaviors people (i.e. children) with autism exhibit.  They seem to ignore the implications of messing with a child\u2019s brain.  By curing someone of autism, for example, you will need to fundamentally change how their brain works, which involves fundamentally changing their brain, which involves fundamentally changing who they are\u2014or, at the very least, how they are able to express who they are. \n On the surface, when you\u2019re talking about people profoundly limited by their autism, this may seem like a good thing.  I know how it feels to want your child to talk.  I know how it feels to want your child to be able to be \u201cmore himself,\u201d by taking away the frustrations that make him act out.  So, yeah, I get it. \n At the same time, I don\u2019t.  Because the kind of cure that could impact autism isn\u2019t going to function at the surface of things, it\u2019s going to have a dramatic impact on a person\u2019s brain\u2014if it works at all.  In other words, it\u2019s not going to make a child \u201cmore himself;\u201d it\u2019s going to change who that child is.  It\u2019s going to change the way he (or she) processes information.  It\u2019s going to change the way he (or she) experiences the world.  It\u2019s going to change the way he (or she) thinks, and probably what he (or she) thinks about and remembers, what those thoughts and memories mean to him (or her), and who knows what else. \n Basically, one of the working theories is that autism occurs because of a combination of overabundant and underabundant neural pathways.  If you start to mess with those pathways, then you are going to change who the person is, just like a stroke will change who someone is or at least how he or she is able to express who his or her own personhood. \n I\u2019ve read enough about tiger moms and other dysfunctional families to know there are parents out there who would love to be able to forcibly re-write their child\u2019s brain to make their child who they want their child to be.  I don\u2019t see the potential \u201ccure\u201d for autism as being any different.  The question then is:  Should parents (or doctors or guardians or anyone) have that right?  Does society have the right to rewire someone\u2019s brain to make them more socially acceptable? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/10/science-and-ethics/", "title": "Science and Ethics"},
{"date": "October 21, 2013", "body": "\r\n I\u2019m testing a theory.  The school psychologist who observed Alex speculated that Alex\u2019s pinching is about predictability and attention-seeking.  The team discussed how pinching may be avoided by withdrawing attention from Alex, which was sparked in part by something I talked about doing. \n You see, Alex has a tendency to pinch me when I\u2019m occupied doing something else.  That happens a lot, by the way.  When it happens, I tell him, \u201cNo pinching.\u201d  And I keep doing what I was doing.  Then, I give him attention when I\u2019m done. \n So, I tried to make these efforts more immediate and purposeful.

Then, I give him the attention he wants before I go back to whatever I\u2019m doing. \n It\u2019s working, for the most part.  Now, he sometimes goes to pinch or something and stops himself.  When he does that, I give him the attention he wants right away.  Other times he pinches anyway, especially when I just get home.  It\u2019s an on-going experiment.

{"date": "October 16, 2013", "body": "\r\n The meeting was a success!  There, I saved you some suspense.  Now, let\u2019s take a look at what made the meeting a success. \n Unlike a typical IEP meeting, we didn\u2019t spend a lot of time going over what we knew.  We met, conversed cordially until everyone got there, and then dug right into the new data.  The school psychologist was the one to collect the new data.  I worked with a different psychologist with Willy, but this was someone new, someone not familiar with Alex and his interactions. \n The pinching that she observed was consistent with the normal behaviors we\u2019d seen before.  In other words, Alex didn\u2019t attack anyone, which is what he\u2019d done to start this process.  So, for the first part of the meeting we concentrated on strategies to address these typical behaviors with the hope of extinguishing them. \n In other words, we followed the data we had and came up with solutions using that data to: \n \n Determine the additional data we needed. \n Use what we currently knew to re-address our strategies. \n \n After listening to the input from a variety of the specialists present at the meeting, a new approach became clear in my mind: \n \n  We know that Alex engages in pinching at times of apparent disorder. \n We know that Alex tends to target certain individuals and we speculate that this targeting is due to the specific, predictable responses he receives. \n We also know that Alex needs copious amounts of positive sensory stimulation to stay regulated and that Alex responds negatively to normal classroom sensory stimulation (different sensory stimuli in each case). \n We know that Alex now receives positive sensory stimulation in response to pinching and we speculate that this has reinforced the pinching behavior. \n \n From this, we concluded that Alex craves more predictability than he is currently being provided with and that we could provide this predictability by increasing the structure in his school day.  We also recognized that Alex\u2019s attention span doesn\u2019t last a full hour, so the structure we add needs to be a shorter cycle than the typical way the school segments time.  We also wanted to provide Alex with more consistency, sufficient positive sensory stimulation, modeling of appropriate behaviors, and opportunities to improve his communication skills. \n A two-fold approach resulted from these conclusions: \n \n We would create a repeating cycle of predictable events that Alex can rely on.  The cycle will be flexible, both progressively and functionally.  This means that the same cycle will be used throughout the day, regardless of what the academic or therapeutic expectations are.  It also means that the cycle will expand and contract according to Alex\u2019s needs.  For example, he\u2019ll have shorter periods of sensory stimulation and longer periods of academic work as needed. \n Staff schedules will be managed to provide Alex with consistent adult support, so that the same people will be made available to Alex from day to day. \n \n These two approaches answered the question, \u201cHow are we going to provide what Alex needs while we shape the behaviors we want to see.\u201d \n These conclusions updated the behavioral intervention plan that we had been using to better meet Alex\u2019s current needs.  There was a celebratory atmosphere for a moment.  We were confident and enthusiastic about our new solutions.  But it seemed premature to me.  We still needed a third component to break the current pattern, and we needed it to be something that could address the more extreme situations, should they reoccur, like the one that made this meeting so urgent. \n The vice principal had been silent throughout the meeting.  He was there as an authority of the school\u2019s and he hadn\u2019t contributed yet.  It was at this moment, when we had determined two of the three components I felt were necessary, that he spoke up to remind everyone why we were here.  His voice was like a dash of cold water on the team. \n I wish I could quote him, because he spoke very well.  He approved of our strategies, but reminded us that Alex lived in a larger environment that included people who would not be as understanding or appreciative of Alex\u2019s unique needs.  After the severity of the last incident and previous relatively minor incidents where Alex sought out strangers to pinch, his concern was that there could be potential blow-back and that the school had to demonstrate a level of responsiveness to this aggressive behavior that had not yet been addressed. \n In short, he was the authority person reminding us of the big picture.  At the same time, he asserted himself as a member of the team, as well, by reinforcing that he, personally, was sympathetic and appreciative of Alex.  He also said something that suggested he is also the parent of a child with autism.  The cumulative result was that, while he was supportive of the work we\u2019d just done, he has a responsibility to ensure the safety and welfare of those Alex might hurt. \n I respected his approach.  He handled the situation well and successfully got us on a track that made it possible to address the serious concern that brought us to this meeting, even though we didn\u2019t have any new data to use.  Everyone seemed somewhat at a loss on how to go from here.  Alex doesn\u2019t really respond to traditional disciplinary action.  Nobody really wanted the consequence to be Alex being sent home, both because it\u2019s ineffective as a consequence (more of a reward than a punishment) and because it deprives Alex of school time for something he really doesn\u2019t (to our knowledge) understand. \n It was a difficult situation.  It took me a while to express what I was thinking.  As parents, we\u2019d tried so many different discipline techniques and nothing had worked.  Well, almost nothing.  The one thing that had worked wasn\u2019t something we really used on a regular basis.  I tried it awhile back.  It wasn\u2019t planned.  It was simply necessary.  Occasionally, I would use it again when the situation warranted.  Attacking someone for no apparent reason we could recognize seemed to warrant it. \n Alex likes cars, especially when they are moving.  When he was younger, he would walk out into the street to take a closer look if we didn\u2019t catch him first.  One time, I got to him just short of the street, took him back to the porch, and sat him down on our steps.  With \u201chard hands,\u201d I put his arms down and made him sit, watching the cars from the safety of the porch.  It wasn\u2019t so much a form of restraint as it was firm, authoritative physical contact.   When he tried to get up, I said, \u201cNo. Stop. Danger.\u201d  Short, simple words that I knew he could understand.  My face was stern.  My voice was firm.  It was the closest thing to discipline that ever worked with Alex.  And I described it to them in as much detail as I could. \n Together, we discussed ways to implement this technique in the classroom.  What it would look like (like a time-out within the environment), what Alex\u2019s response would be (yes, he would get angry), and what the result would be (Alex would calm down and would recognize that he had been stopped).  We spent time discussing how it would work and recognized that it could be implemented right away. \n We had the third and final component.  That, along with increased data collection, will prepare us to meet again at the end of this month for his IEP.  We\u2019ll see how these strategies are working and we will fine-tune them with the new data we\u2019re collecting.  We\u2019re optimistic. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/10/meeting_results/", "title": "Meeting Results"},

{"date": "October 23, 2013", "body": "\r\n I can\u2019t help but be enthralled, and a little nostalgic, to see the way my boys are growing up and maturing.  I suppose it\u2019s a wonder for any parent to see the little person they knew becoming a grown up.  However, I think it\u2019s especially wonderful for me, because of the many times I was told children with autism don\u2019t really grow up.  It\u2019s bullshit, of course.  And I knew that.  But, still, it\u2019s nice to see my boys as living proof of it. \n Don\u2019t get me wrong.  I understand how the mythos developed and I get why some parents tell themselves that it\u2019s true.  In some ways, it\u2019s easier to see our young adults (and even grown up children) with autism who are significantly disabled as children.  If we acknowledge they are adults, it becomes increasingly clear that they are being \u201cleft behind\u201d by their peers and even clearer that their lives will be significantly different than we may have hoped.  Yet, by living in an illusion of perpetual childhood, we\u2019re doing them a disservice. \n From the outside looking in, it\u2019s easy enough to see the many ways Willy is maturing.  He\u2019s becoming his own man.  He still has his playful, childlike side, which most teenagers do, but he\u2019s also growing up in much the same way most teenagers do.  His emotional and intellectual development continues to make leaps forward, but some areas are still underdeveloped.  He\u2019s becoming responsible, self-regulated, and intense in his need for self-determination.  Best of all, he\u2019s a good kid growing into a good adult, of that, there is no doubt. \n From the outside looking in, it\u2019s easy enough to believe that maturation has left Alex behind.  He still has the same interests he did as a little child\u2014art and Veggie Tales.  He still doesn\u2019t talk and he still struggles to perform academically, due to his communication deficits.  He still has more physical needs than Willy does and is obtain a lesser degree of independence, and his gains come much more slowly. \n But Alex is maturing in his own ways and in his own time.  Unlike Willy, he\u2019s not \u201cout-growing\u201d his earlier interests.  But those interests are changing, developing, and refining.  He\u2019s becoming more aware of others and is seeking more mature, if atypical, interactions.  He\u2019s aware of his body\u2019s changes and he\u2019s aware of the inner changes, though it\u2019s hard to know whether he understands what it means.  Self-regulation comes more difficultly for Alex\u2014it always has\u2014but he\u2019s making strides.  He\u2019s becoming more responsible, too.  And he is also becoming more intense in his need for self-determination, but he also has more obstacles\u2014primarily in communication\u2014to achieving whatever his goals are.  Sadly, we don\u2019t always know what they are and it\u2019s becoming more frequent that we don\u2019t. \n If we deny the changes our children undergo, we can\u2019t help them to be all of who they are.  We can\u2019t help them reach their potential.  Even though their potential is different than that of their peers, it\u2019s still important for them and for us that they have the best chance they can to reach their own versions of success. \n It\u2019s a parent\u2019s job to nurture children into adulthood.  It\u2019s also a parent\u2019s job to let them go when it\u2019s time.  That means different things for different children.  Sometimes it means moving far away.  Sometimes it means taking risks we don\u2019t like.  Sometimes it means making choice we\u2019d rather they didn\u2019t.  Sometimes it means being more themselves and taking a different place within a family unit.  It\u2019s different for each child, even when it seems very much the same.  Sometimes it seems very different indeed.  Yet, at the heart of it, it is the same.  Children grow up.  It\u2019s our job to help them do that.  First, we need to see that they can. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/10/maturing/", "title": "Maturing"},
{"date": "October 11, 2013", "body": "\r\n I\u2019ve listened to many parents and many people with autism describe their experiences.  I\u2019ve listened to them describe how and when symptoms first appear.  I\u2019ve listened to them ruminate on experiences prior to the recognition of autism, noting that autism symptoms began much earlier in some cases, but not in all.  I also recognized that \u201cautism\u201d is a label based on behavioral\u2014i.e. psychological\u2014observations, but evidence indicates that autism is most likely neurological in nature.  I deduced that what we call \u201cautism\u201d is probably many different things, with different causes, different treatments, different prognoses, and different complications. \n It seems I was right : \n People with autism are ?regularly lumped together and treated as a single group. But the world\u2019s largest genetic study of the condition \u201cshows that autism is many different diseases,\u201d says Stanley Nelson, a professor of genetics and psychiatry at UCLA who collaborated on the investigation. \u201cThat insight should greatly enlighten how we think about autism and attempt to treat it.\u201d \n\u2026 \nAs the researchers reported last July, the mutations associated with autism fall all over the map. \u201cIf 100 different kids with autism walked into a clinic,\u201d Nelson says, \u201cchances are they\u2019d have 100 different genetic aberrations.\u201d \n If this doesn\u2019t change how autism research is conducted, then  perhaps this will : \n \n  Dr. Carla Shatz studies neuroplasticity. \n She discovered that MHC1 is an important protein in brain plasticity. \n This discovery was made, in part, because she didn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d that MHC1 couldn\u2019t possibly exist in the brain. \n You see, MHC1 is typically part of our immune response. Immune responses don\u2019t pass beyond the blood-brain barrier in healthy brains. \n In the brain, MHC1 serves a different purpose, pruning cells as part of neuroplasticity. \n Imprecise pruning may be a key factor leading to what we call autism. \n \n Research also indicates a connection between immune disorders and autism, and this may be the key to that connection.  This might also explain the connection between autism and schizophrenia, both of which seem to involve imprecise pruning of synapses.  Dr. Shatz research may lead to the ability to exert external control on how synapses are pruned, which could help people with a range of neurological challenges, from Parkinson\u2019s to Alzheimer\u2019s, from autism to schizophrenia, from stroke to brain injuries. \n This still leaves us with the question:  How much of this should we try to do?  Just because we can, doesn\u2019t mean we should.

{"date": "November 15, 2013", "body": "\r\n As someone who is working hard to realize my dreams and as someone who is adapting to my changing dreams, I think about the future and what it takes to be where you want to be when you get there.  This skill comes in handy when I go to IEP meetings and the staff brings up the issue of \u201ctransition planning,\u201d which refers to my children\u2019s transitions out of the school system and into their adult lives. \n Alex\u2019s IEP meeting came first and, surprisingly, we discussed transition planning more in his meeting than in Willy\u2019s.  The impression I have from these meetings is that they have an established track for \u201cpeople like Alex,\u201d which involves building \u201cjob skills\u201d and being transitioned into a sheltered work environment.  Kandu and Riverside are two local examples that involve creating work for people with special needs that severely interfere with their ability to get \u201cnormal,\u201d competitive jobs. \n I understand why these tracks exist and, for the most part, don\u2019t have a problem with their existence.  This post isn\u2019t about the problems I do have with such facilities either. \n According to his teachers, Alex has good \u201cjob skills\u201d and he enjoys the work.  But there\u2019s something Alex enjoys more and that\u2019s art.  I know there are individuals who, with appropriate assistance, can share their art with the world and have that as their vocation, even though they have special needs that severely interfere with their ability to live \u201cnormal\u201d lives.  Special needs, even severe special needs, don\u2019t mean lack of talent.  Unfortunately, his teachers don\u2019t necessarily share my understanding of this kind of opportunity. \n Part of it is that \u201cartist\u201d is a rather tough, competitive gig anyway you look at it.  I know, because while my art is very different from Alex\u2019s many of the struggles are quite similar.  I know Alex would need support to make him successful on such a unique track, and I know that some of this support would be beyond my capabilities.  But it is possible.  It would also be conducive to Alex\u2019s disposition in ways a sheltered work environment would not be. \n It\u2019s hard to know what Alex wants.  I don\u2019t know if Alex thinks about his future.  Even if he does, there are few ways he can communicate his thoughts so that we can understand.  But I know I don\u2019t want his options to be limited to a track to a sheltered work environment.  I want him to be able to choose to be who and what he wants to be. \n Then, there\u2019s Willy.  At his meeting, he announced that he doesn\u2019t want to go to college.  But he still wants to design video games.  I\u2019m not sure the latter is possible without the former, but then again, if he learns the skills he needs, then he can do what he wants with the right support.  Again, I know it\u2019s possible and I know at least some of what he\u2019ll need to make it possible for him.  He also wants to have  our  house to himself\u2014good luck with that one, buddy! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/11/a-look-to-the-future/", "title": "A Look to the Future"},

All I know is what little Willy was able to tell me. \n Willy\u2019s teacher accused him of stealing a girl\u2019s cell phone.  He didn\u2019t do it and he was very upset that anyone thought he had.  He didn\u2019t know what to do about it.  He said he didn\u2019t do it and he was telling the truth.  But the teacher didn\u2019t believe him.  The teacher kept saying that Willy took the girl\u2019s cell phone. \n Then, the teacher told the class that, because Willy took the girl\u2019s cell phone, the teacher was going to take Willy\u2019s birthday.  Willy will be turning 15 in a month and he couldn\u2019t let that happen.  He had to make the teacher stop saying these things.  But he didn\u2019t know what to do! \n Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re reading about  Ender\u2019s Shadow  by Orson Scott Card, which is the story of how Ender and Bean faced extraordinary circumstances and survived, even though they\u2019re kids who are pitted against teachers.  Maybe it was something else.  All I know is that Willy\u2019s reaction was extreme and out of character. \n Willy just wanted to make his teacher stop saying these hurtful, false things.  So, in a fit of anger, he put his hands on the teacher\u2019s neck and \u201cstrangled\u201d him to make him stop. \n I don\u2019t know what happened next, exactly.  I know that Willy stopped.  I know that the teacher reassured him that it was just a practical joke and gave Willy a warning not to do that.  I know that Willy apologized and that the teacher promised never to play a practical joke on Willy again. \n Willy was so confused by what happened and so ashamed about what he did that, when he went to bed that night, he didn\u2019t even want a hug.  He knew that strangling was wrong and we certainly reinforced that lesson.  But it was also important that shame wasn\u2019t the only thing he took away from this experience. \n I wanted to make sure that Willy made better choices, that he apologized for his behavior, and that he didn\u2019t make the same choice at some point in the future.  But it was equally important that he not feel ashamed. \n Time was on our side, because the next day was an appointment with his counselor.  We talked about what the teacher had done and what Willy had done and what Willy could have done instead.

{"date": "April 10, 2013", "body": "\r\n Kathleen  and  Kim  wrote a  post  for  The Autism Channel  about aggression.  This is my third response. \n I\u2019ve already discussed  Ben\u2019s aggression  and  Alex\u2019s aggression .  Now, I\u2019d like to turn to Willy, because Willy\u2019s experiences with aggression are both markedly different and even more heartbreaking than those of his brothers. \n Willy has had a few minor phases with overt aggression.  Early on, when we were just learning about autism, Willy would throw tantrums and he\u2019d throw toys.  His initial \u201csocial\u201d attempts involved hitting, kicking, biting, and pinching to try to get his way.  Then, he developed the language and social skills he needed to be more successful.  So, basically, he developed in a fairly \u201ctypical\u201d way, but on a different timeline than his \u201cnormal\u201d peers.  For many years Willy exhibited few aggressive behaviors, even fewer than his older brother, who is a typically developing child.  Willy is compassionate and passionate about justice, which has sometimes gotten him in trouble when he\u2019s argued with teachers or parents who use their authority in a way that Willy disagreed with, but it also made him conscious of how aggressive acts were acts of harm. \n Then, this summer he \u201cdeveloped\u201d or \u201cmanifested\u201d epilepsy.  (Honestly, I don\u2019t know how much epilepsy is always there, like autism, or if it is developed, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)  Ever since, he\u2019s had a rough time of it.  Even though the seizures are under control, we\u2019re still dealing with the emotional fall-out from that experience.  Added to that, Willy started the school year as the victim of bullies, which may or may not be on-going in a way that\u2019s too subtle for Willy to understand but not too subtle for him to feel (at least, this is a theory shared by his counselor).  So, it\u2019s easy to understand why he\u2019s having problems.  And, yes, under these stressful circumstances, he is acting out more, including some aggressive behaviors. \n Unfortunately, acting out is really the least of it.  Willy has become somewhat more aggressive, and that\u2019s unfortunate.  The bigger problem is his self-destructive emotional state.  He\u2019s \u201cacting out,\u201d but it\u2019s more on an emotional level than actual aggression (though he did hit a teacher after he saw the teacher (playfully) hit another teacher, because he didn\u2019t understand the interaction).  He\u2019s experiencing bursts of anger that he doesn\u2019t really understand and can\u2019t control, which results in some aggression, too.  What worries me so much more is that he\u2019s also experiencing bouts of sadness and anxiety.  He\u2019s had suicidal thoughts. \n This is aggression turned inward.  He doesn\u2019t really want to hurt other people, so he turns it on himself, which in turn makes him feel worse.  Neither the help at home nor school is sufficient, so we\u2019ve started taking Willy to a counselor.  It\u2019s early in the process and we\u2019re still in the \u201cit\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better\u201d stage of things. \n Now, on the surface, it may seem that Willy\u2019s story has little to do with aggression.  Yet, from watching all three of my boys, actually all four of them, it seems rather clear to me that this self-destruction is aggression turned inward, which also involves lashing out when whatever that\u2019s going on inside becomes too much for Willy to bear.  I don\u2019t know what to make of that observation, but it seems significant.  Regardless, understanding and support are the keys to helping us cope with all of this as a family and provide each of our children with what they need.

{"date": "April 19, 2013", "body": "\r\n I admit I read and watch fiction that creates traumatic events for characters to experience.  From thrillers to Christian dramas, almost every story has some kind of trauma which characters are forced to endure. \n Yet, when the news media has a feeding frenzy on the latest real-world traumatic event, I avoid it.  I have seen one video of the towers falling during the 9/11.  The video was only a few seconds in length and I watched it the day of the attack.  I\u2019ve seen one video of the aftermath of Katrina and a handful of pictures taken by someone who was on-site within the first few weeks of the storm. \n I didn\u2019t watch any video footage of subsequent disasters.  Not the mass shootings.  Not the storms.  Not the endless wars across the world.  And not the recent bombing in Boston. \n I read about the news.  I try to stay abreast of the events that shape our world.  But I don\u2019t gorge myself on the violence \u201cMother Nature\u201d and our fellow human beings are capable.  I don\u2019t find real-world suffering to be entertaining.  In fact, I find this trend (both on the part of the media and on the part of the viewers) to be very disturbing. \n What  twisted pleasure  do people get from watching the real-world suffering of others that they watch it over and over and over again? \n There are unfortunate parallels throughout our contemporary culture.  Reality television is a profit-driven example.  I don\u2019t watch it.  I don\u2019t understand it.  I mean, really,  The Kardashians ?!?  Admittedly, I saw a few Jerry Springer episodes when I was a teenager, which was the precursor to all of this as far as I can tell.  I didn\u2019t get it then, and I still don\u2019t get it now.  I really,  really  don\u2019t get why our culture makes celebrities out of people like that. \n And then there\u2019re those activities that aren\u2019t driven by profit.  I admit I find real people inspiring.  People can do some pretty amazing things.  And, yes, some of the people that I admire are people with disabilities.  I just don\u2019t see why people with disabilities living ordinary lives should be inspiring.  I mean, shouldn\u2019t that be  the norm ?  After all, statistics indicated that 1 out of 5 people have some degree of disability. \n Granted, I\u2019m well aware that our society throws up a  lot  of barriers that keep people with disabilities from living ordinary, fulfilling lives, and that those who persevere to do so are admirable in that they don\u2019t give into our cultural stereotypes.  But that\u2019s not the implication associated with these images and messages that are shared through so many social media sites.  It\u2019s more like, \u201cLook at this person with this terrible disability [look at these people who have suffered this terrible disaster/war/attack], what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d \n What  twisted pleasure  do people get from watching real-world suffering (or what they assume must be suffering)? \n It makes me think back to ancient Rome.  I think back to our fascination with Roman gladiators.  I think about the  twisted pleasure  the ancient Romans took in watching people hack each other to death.  Rome ended.  Instead of learning from it, it seems we\u2019re determined to repeat their vices and share their fate. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/04/twisted-pleasure/", "title": "Twisted Pleasure"},

People in these population centers tend to make it sound like certain kinds of resources are readily available to help people with disabilities.  Living in the Midwest, I know there are a lot of resources available in other parts of the country that aren\u2019t readily available here.  And we\u2019re not alone.  A lot of the resources that are available in some \u201ccentralized\u201d areas are not available just a few states away. \n This is not to say that these resources don\u2019t exist.  Sometimes they really don\u2019t, but sometimes they do.  They\u2019re just hard to find.  When you find them, they have long, long waiting lists.  But it\u2019s better to finally find them and to wait than to have no hope at all.  I know, because I\u2019ve finally found and connected with a resource that may empower Alex to communicate using technological assistance. \n I\u2019ve read about how more and more people with autism are being hooked up with technological devices that help them communicate effectively.  I\u2019ve worked with the local school district for years to help Alex take advantage of these opportunities.  We haven\u2019t found the right fit and we don\u2019t have the expertise we need to get the match. \n Now, I\u2019ve finally found the local place that has the resources and expertise to get that match.  At least, that\u2019s the hope.  I admit it could have happened earlier.  I dropped the ball.  I didn\u2019t understand back during that IEP that kicked off this school year that I was the one who was supposed to act.  They all made it sound like it was something that would be done through the school district.  Maybe that was just wishful thinking.  I don\u2019t know. \n Then, with all the busyness and chaos of this year, this issue fell through the cracks of what was necessary and what was urgent.  Even now, I had to sneak it in between preparations for another MRI, not to mention the other urgent and/or necessary tasks of this week. \n Yet, looking ahead to the appointment we\u2019ll have months from now, I can\u2019t help but feel hopeful.  Having read so much of others\u2019 success with technologically assisted communication, I\u2019ve long believed that would be the key for Alex.  He loves technology and is more adept with manipulating technology than I would expect.  When it comes to the new touch-based technologies, he\u2019s much better at it than I am! \n Not only is he ready to access the technology, we also know that communicative intent is definitely there, but the means to make that connection with others is not.  A technological device could be the bridge between where we are and where we could be.  This could be the key that unlocks Alex\u2019s ability to communicate.  As much as we don\u2019t want to wait, it\u2019s definitely an outcome worth waiting for.

{"date": "April 12, 2013", "body": "\r\n Kathleen  and  Kim  wrote a  post  for  The Autism Channel  about aggression.  I\u2019ve written posts about  Ben ,  Alex , and  Willy .  Now, let\u2019s think about this a bit more. \n Aggressive behaviors happen.  They\u2019re easy to judge, but difficult to understand and redirect when you\u2019re in the midst of them.  They\u2019re often associated with either communicative deficits or puberty or both when in association with autism, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m told by the professionals. \n The way I look at it with my three boys\u2014one with \u201ceasily\u201d applicable communicative purpose, one with (maybe) a baffling purpose, and one who directs it inward instead of outward\u2014I think aggressive behaviors (or the lack thereof) are a lot more complicated than the literature and professionals like to make them seem.  It\u2019s definitely more complicated than the generic (i.e., not autism-specific) professionals like to claim\u2014CPS being a prime example. \n I don\u2019t have the answers.  I have yet to meet anyone who does\u2014after all, if I had, then aggression still wouldn\u2019t be an issue for us.  What I do know is that aggression (on the part of a child with special needs) isn\u2019t the result of bad parenting, uncompassionate caregivers, or a lack of discipline.  There\u2019s nothing simple about it.  There\u2019s nothing shameful about it either and I refuse to let anyone make me feel as if there is.  I assure you, we\u2019ve tried all the \u201cnormal\u201d stuff.  We\u2019ve tried a lot of abnormal stuff, too.  We\u2019ve discussed the issue with highly qualified staff familiar with our children and highly qualified professionals unfamiliar with our children.  We\u2019re still trying, we haven\u2019t given up, but the \u201canswer\u201d hasn\u2019t made itself apparent, yet. \n I don\u2019t know what the answer is, but I can tell you some of things the answer is not.  The answer is  NOT  that the child is \u201cbad.\u201d  The answer is  NOT  that we\u2019re not trying hard enough.  The answer is  NOT  one-size-fits all.  The answer is  NOT  to cure autism.  After all, aggression exists throughout our society and manifests in children all across the spectrum of needs. \n Where there is aggression:  Children need support.  Adults need support.  Their families need support.  We all need compassion, understanding, and encouragement. \n A little empathy goes a long way. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismherd.blogspot.com/", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/", "http://blog.theautismchannel.tv/?p=144", "http://blog.theautismchannel.tv/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/04/aggression-what-it-all-means/", "title": "Aggression:"},

Often it seems all too much like a disease.   Staff  is a bureaucratic word.  When the bureaucracy abdicates responsibility, it says  staff .  More accurately, the abdication of responsibility is the disease.  Or maybe it\u2019s a symptom. \n The people who make up  staff  can be wonderful, beneficial influences.  They can cut through red tape.  They can actually, genuinely, and wholeheartedly care about what they do and who they do it for.  They can understand.  They can empathize.  They can accomplish amazing, life-changing things. \n They can also be oblivious and ambivalent towards the well-being of those they care for.  They can be reckless and dangerous.  They can rigid and uncompromising, following policy and procedure at the expense of those they care for.  They can be immoral, unethical, and downright criminal. \n As the parent of three children with disabilities, I have abundant experience with staff.  I meet staff at school.  I welcome staff into my home.  I take my children to the staff that peoples the clinics and hospitals where they receive services. \n I\u2019ve met and grown to love and cherish some really excellent people who will, I have no doubt, be part of our lives for many, many years to come.  I\u2019ve also worked with truly competent and caring individuals who have come in and out of our lives, each in their own season.  I\u2019ve been touched by the amazing abilities of people who I work with over a single day, who I probably will never see again, whose names I don\u2019t even know. \n I\u2019ve also been forced to interact with staff who disregard my children\u2019s well-being.  Some were incompetent.  Others were careless.  Others did intentional harm. \n Staff is a reality for most people in society.  People with disabilities (and their families) often have to interact with staff much more than others, however, and we often have to depend on staff, regardless of whether those people are dependable.  I suppose the same is true for others.  In school.  At a hospital or a clinic.  There\u2019s always the risk.  But the more interactions you have, the greater the risk becomes.

{"date": "April 29, 2013", "body": "\r\n So, there\u2019s a pattern developing.  Ben is being sent home, more often than not over the last few weeks (stretching into at least two months), on either Thursday or Friday for symptoms that appear at school, but disappear once Ben arrives at home. \n I had a nice, long talk with the school nurse, who also has experience working in a different capacity with children with special needs, explaining my concerns and comparing that to what she\u2019s seeing and the reports she\u2019s getting from staff.  On the one hand, Ben is not an effective communicator, so when he shows signs of illness or distress, they have a responsibility to respond.  He can\u2019t tell us when he\u2019s sick, so they have to use his behavior as a strong determinant.  On the other hand, he\u2019s not \u201csick\u201d at home, he\u2019s losing a lot of educational time, and there is too much of a pattern for it to be coincidental.  The nurse and I agreed that we could understand where each side is coming from, but also agreeing the current situation needed to be addressed in a new way. \n Something isn\u2019t right about this.  The way I see it, either the staff is getting tired of Ben by the end of the week and finding reasons for sending him home or Ben has learned how to manipulate staff and is contriving reasons to get sent home. \n If it were Alex, especially Alex as he was a few years ago, I wouldn\u2019t be suspicious, because Alex was underweight, undernourished, prone to infection, and had a lower than normal immune response.  In more old-fashion terms, Alex was a sickly child.  Ben is not.  Ben\u2019s weight and nourishment are both up.  He has a healthy resistance to infection and a strong immune response.  He\u2019s not sickly.  In fact, Alex has made sufficient gains that he\u2019s not sickly either any more, but the point is that Ben never really was. \n But Ben does know how to make himself throw up.  He does express his resistance in a variety of different ways, some of which can be misinterpreted as signs of illness, but are more accurately signs of distress\u2014a different kind of distress.  And they are seeing a variety of those ways at school.  He\u2019s stubborn and strong-willed.  He doesn\u2019t communicate in traditional ways, but he\u2019s very clever and is usually pretty good at figuring out how to get his way.  Mark and I know this, and we also know that giving in reinforces the behavior, so we don\u2019t give in, even when we\u2019d really rather not fight with him.  The long-term cost of the temporary relief just isn\u2019t worth it. \n This time (last Thursday), Ben was acting out of sorts and they\u2019d documented him paying a lot of attention to his ears.  They suspected he had an ear infection.  So, I came in and, in front of the nurse, I pressed on the backs of Ben\u2019s ears, I stuck my index fingers in his ears, I pulled on his ears.  I explained that he probably wouldn\u2019t let her or other staff do any of this, because his ears are so sensitive, but that he lets me do this.  (I didn\u2019t bother explaining about the trust bond between a mother and a child; she got that all by herself.)  I also explained that, considering how sensitive his ears are naturally, he\u2019d be screaming and thrashing if he actually had an ear infection. \n I also explained what\u2019s required to check his ears (professionally speaking) for an ear infection\u2014how the pediatrician who has worked with Ben since he was born would press Ben on the clinic bed, use one hand to hold Ben\u2019s head at the right angle, use his other hand to hold the tool he uses to look in Ben\u2019s ear, use his knee to pin Ben\u2019s torso down, while I held Ben\u2019s legs and arms.  It sounds very dangerous, but it\u2019s actually quite effective and safe.  (Much safer than trying to stick something in Ben\u2019s ears while he\u2019s thrashing around.)  It sounds horrid, and it is.  The only reason I can stay in the room while this goes on at all is because I know it would be far more traumatic for Ben if I wasn\u2019t there. \n Ben\u2019s ears are very, very sensitive.  A lot of people worry on a regular basis that he has an ear infection, but none of them have ever actually seen Ben with an ear infection.  The difference is unquestionable.  I remember one of Ben\u2019s therapists who frequently brought up the possibility of Ben having an ear infection through observations of Ben\u2019s (ab)normal obsession with/aversion to his ears.  Then, Ben actually got an ear infection.  She stopped raising the issue for (ab)normal behavior after that. \n I understand their reasoning.  In a child whose ears are less sensitive, Ben\u2019s normal behavior would be a good reason to suspect an ear infection.  I get that.  But, once I explain what it takes to really, definitively check Ben\u2019s ears, people understand why I don\u2019t go running out to do that every time Ben \u201cstarts\u201d pulling at his ears.  I explain that my mother-in-law is a nurse practitioner who has taught me some tried-and-true ways to test Ben for a pain response that helps us to avoid unnecessary traumatic trips to the pediatrician. \n The nurse understood.  And I made sure she knew that I understood the position they\u2019re in.  But something has to change. \n After my conversation with the nurse, the principal called and we worked out a few different ways to take a closer look at what\u2019s going on.  Hopefully we can figure out what\u2019s bothering Ben and get this all under control.  I\u2019m going to be visiting his school this Thursday and Friday to see if my mommy-radar can detect something they might have missed. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/04/ears-patterns/", "title": "Ears & Patterns"},
{"date": "November 4, 2013", "body": "\r\n On Saturday, Ben went with his behavioral therapist over to her house.  He played with her children, worked on his social skills, and got a haircut.  Things seemed to be going well for them until, for some unknown reason, Ben bit one of her children.  We don\u2019t know why.  What we do know, however, is that while she was busy consoling her daughter, Ben threw a rather heavy bowl up into the air. \n Before I get into what happened next, it seems important to explain a little bit about Ben.  One of the services Ben receives through the school system is called \u201cspecially-designed physical education.\u201d  Basically, Ben lacks the skills necessary to participate in a regular PE class.  It\u2019s not just that Ben lacks the social acumen to successfully participate in their games.  He lacks the physical skills that would enable him to participate.  To put it more simply and more precisely, his SDPE teachers have spent years trying to teach Ben to throw and catch balls, and Ben\u2019s ball skills are still rudimentary.  Getting him to throw a ball with purpose is an accomplishment.  Actually hitting an intended target\u2014that\u2019s a skill that has eluded him. \n So, it\u2019s safe to say that when Ben threw the bowl, he wasn\u2019t throwing it  at  anything.  But throw it he did.  He threw the bowl up, gravity did its job, and the bowl came down.  Unfortunately, the bowl came down on his young friend\u2019s head, leaving a gash right above her eye brow.  Shortly afterward, I took a call from our therapist who informed us that her husband would be bringing Ben home while she took her daughter to the emergency room for stitches. \n That\u2019s not the kind of call a parent wants to receive.  It\u2019s not that we objected to her planned course of action, of course.  We had no problem with her husband bringing our son home or her decision to tend to her daughter.  We supported  that  fully.  But her daughter needed stitches because of  our  son! \n Luckily, this therapist has known Ben for a long time now.  Her husband and her children know and appreciate Ben.  While, under different circumstances, such an incident could result in broken friendships and the loss of a therapist, that didn\u2019t happen. \n In fact, the very next day Ben\u2019s therapist came for him and brought him back to her house.  When Ben and his young friend saw each other the next time, they gave each other a hug.  I didn\u2019t see it, but I\u2019m sure it was very sweet. \n The whole thing does, however, reveal a concern.  The biting we knew about.  We try to prevent it and we try to eliminate the behavior\u2014Ben has gotten much better!\u2014but there\u2019s still more work to do in that quarter.  At least we  knew  about that! \n As I said, Ben isn\u2019t really prone to throwing things.  We\u2019re certain he didn\u2019t mean to hit his young friend.  But the object lesson here isn\u2019t likely to have sunk in either.  I doubt Ben associates his action (throwing the bowl) with the consequence (it hitting his friend in the head).  He might.  I don\u2019t know.  Either way, the fact of that matter is that we\u2019ve put so much effort in teaching Ben to throw that now we have to teach him when, where, and what not to throw.  Here I\u2019d thought we\u2019d been doing that all along! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/11/uh-oh/", "title": "Uh-Oh!"},

I recently had Willy\u2019s IEP and we discussed how he no longer needed OT services.  Yay? \n Well, yeah!  For the last year, Willy\u2019s OT services have only been on a consult basis.  The idea was to create strategies that Willy could implement independently within his various classrooms to manage his sensory needs, while staying in class as much as possible to meet those needs.  This approach has been so successful that the consults are no longer needed.  They were kept in place primarily to transition him to his high school experience. \n Now that Willy\u2019s been in high school for a couple of months, Willy has made his adjustments.  He\u2019s not wholly comfortable in his new environment, as indicated by his rather compulsive need to sharpen pencils to exert a sense of control over that environment, but he is making effective use of his strategies and he is also fully integrated into his classes.  He\u2019s able to advocate for his own needs and generally does so effectively. \n There\u2019s still progress to be made, but it\u2019s no longer about OT and sensory regulation.

{"date": "August 19, 2013", "body": "\r\n It\u2019s perfectly natural for us to want to protect our children from sexual misconduct\u2014whether our children are kids or adults.  We don\u2019t want our children to be victims of someone else\u2019s sexual misconduct, and we certainly don\u2019t want our children to be perpetrators of sexual misconduct. \n When our children have developmental delays, it can be easy to see our children as perpetual kids.  And kids, we\u2019d like to think, aren\u2019t sexual beings.  Therefore, in our minds, our children aren\u2019t sexual beings. \n We like to think this because it\u2019s easier than dealing with uncomfortable realities, like our children\u2019s sexuality. \n After all, sexuality is difficult enough to deal with when you\u2019re a typically-developing adult.  And the sexuality of our children is difficult enough to deal with when you\u2019re the parent of a typically-developing teenager.  Add in an individual with developmental delays and a continued fascination with child-like interests, and it can be very difficult to even acknowledge our children are also sexual beings, let alone talk to them about it. \n But this willful ignorance comes at a cost. \n Most people with developmental disabilities, like most people without developmental disabilities, express their sexuality in more or less acceptable ways, all things being equal.  A few people with developmental disabilities, like the few people without developmental disabilities, engage in sexual deviance that is predatory in nature.  Contrary to recent hype, neither quality has anything at all to do with whether or not someone is developmentally delayed. \n But people with developmental delays are at a disadvantage, because all things aren\u2019t equal.  Society\u2014including many of the people who exert control over the lives of people with developmental disabilities\u2014have actively repressed their sexuality for decades.  And we\u2019re still doing it! \n My mom used to work at a group home for people with developmental disabilities.  They were housed in homes called CBRFs, which was basically a bridge between \u201cnormal\u201d living and institutionalization.  Some of the people she came to know had been forcibly sterilized.  Others engaged in uncontrolled masturbation. \n One of the group homes she didn\u2019t work at specialized in housing sexual predators.  These were people with uncontrollable sexual impulses who were \u201callowed\u201d to prey on each other, because at least then they weren\u2019t preying on those who didn\u2019t share their compulsions. \n So, the question is this:  Are these people natural, normal predators?  Are they so profoundly broken that they couldn\u2019t possibly control their sexual impulses?  Or is our denial of their innate sexuality part of the problem? \n Sexual mores are learned.  They are taught by society and the people in society.  They change over time.  Once upon a time, having an affair with a married man would make you a social outcast.  Now, casual sex is tolerated, even encouraged.  At least, for typically-developing individuals. \n Granted, our sexual history is more complex than that, but when you compare sexual practices across cultures and over time it becomes apparent that sexual mores are learned.  And this means that if we want people with developmental disabilities to know them, then we have to  teach  them.  If we want people with developmental disabilities to abide by them, then we have to  acknowledge  that they do have sexual impulses.  We have to give them safe, responsible ways to express their sexuality\u2014which may or may not include abstinence\u2014based on shared mores.  In short, we have to educate them and then give them opportunities to choose for themselves, which is the same thing we should do for  everyone else ! \n Burying our heads in the proverbial sand because we find it discomfiting is not a solution.  It simply creates more problems and denies the people we love and care about one of their basic human rights\u2014to be masters of their own bodies and to make informed choices about their own sexuality. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/08/sexual-tension/", "title": "Sexual Tension"},

It seems people without direct, familiar contact with a person with a disability are not likely to be interested in discussing disabilities, especially not a particular disability. \n I don\u2019t presume to know how these cohorts broach the subject, but lately I have tried to discuss the issues of interest to me with a variety of people of different backgrounds, interests, and stations.  One of the ways I found to successfully broach the subjects I am interested in is by easing into the conversation through a subject of mutual interest.  (More on this project in the next post.) \n Despite the optimistic reports, we live in an economy that is still reeling\u2014at least at the individual level\u2014from the aftermath of our recession.  It\u2019s true that painful examples of poverty have always been among us.  But now that pain is more common as people who are used to being able to find good-paying jobs no longer can.  I can think of at least a dozen people who are experiencing that pain through direct, in-person connections.  That number goes up exponentially when I add various sources of internet connections. \n People are feeling the pain of poverty.  People who did not grow up in poverty are experiencing it for the first time as adults.  People are feeling the pain of job loss and the inability to find a suitable replacement job. \n This is a feeling that is more common among people with disabilities than the average population.  This is a connecting point that makes a natural bridge for conversation. \n A lot of people know someone or have been someone or are someone who has lost a good-paying job in favor of either nothing or something that pays significantly less than they\u2019re used to.  This issue means something to them.  When you then turn that issue just a little bit and express the chronic state of employment in relationship to disability, then you open eyes, you open minds, and you open hearts. \n I know the pain of poverty.  I know what it is to aspire to sufficiency, and have it seem out of reach.  I know what it is to aspire to prosperity, and have it seem a lost dream.  I know the power of compassion, empathy, and understanding.  If we understand and empathize with the experiences of others, then we can express our own experiences in a way that bridges the gulfs between us.  In the process, we discover those gulfs were merely a step away. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/07/poverty-among-friends/", "title": "Poverty Among Friends"},

After discussing our family history, I took Alex to the neurologist, too.  The neurologist had enough reason for concern to recommend we conducted some additional tests, including a second MRI.  At Willy\u2019s last appointment, we canceled Alex\u2019s appointment to discuss the results of his MRI, because the doctor had peeked at the results and declared all was well. \n Then, the nurse called and uncanceled the appointment. \n Naturally, I was concerned.  Was all not well after all?  Actually, those who know me better know that I was, underneath a front of my own version of normal, seething with anxiety. \n We waited months, of course.  We arrived in a rush, of course.  Then, to my surprise, it turned out our appointment was never actually rescheduled.  It took some persistence with the receptionist, but finally she called the nurse and the nurse talked to the doctor and the doctor, being the conscientious man that he is, agreed to see us. \n We met with the nurse, who asked me leading questions.  We met with the medical student, who asked more leading questions.  I got the impression that we\u2019d missed something, because all those questions were geared toward revealing the changes in Alex\u2019s behaviors that we\u2019d seen. \n But, we hadn\u2019t seen any.  Alex seemed like Alex, which is far from normal, but it is his own version of normal, so I wasn\u2019t concerned about  that !  Oh no, what had I missed?  What hadn\u2019t I seen?  Had I been too busy to notice that something was  really  wrong with my child? \n Then, the doctor came in.  I explained why I\u2019m here.  He was obviously relieved.  He explained what had happened.  I was immediately relieved. \n The gist of it is this:  The nurse was NOT supposed to uncancel our appointment; she was supposed to confirm that the doctor had compared MRI results and verified that there was no significant change to the area of concern and that there was therefore no cause for concern.  In short, Alex didn\u2019t need to come back  unless  we observed significant, worrisome alterations in his behavior.  So, obviously, when we showed up for an appointment that didn\u2019t exist, the doctor thought we  had  observed significant, worrisome alterations in Alex\u2019s behavior. \n All that worrying for nothing but a case of the miscommunications!  At least it ended with relief. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/07/appointment-for-worry/", "title": "Appointment for Worry"},
{"date": "July 26, 2013", "body": "\r\n Cultural immersion  is the idea that idea that you learn about another culture more quickly and more thoroughly if you immerse yourself in that culture.  Student who study abroad through an immersion program will travel to another country and live in that country\u2014speaking the language, learning the culture, adapting to the country\u2019s way of life\u2014to improve their understanding of that country and that language, but also to broaden their understanding of global affairs.  Cultural immersion programs are touted as a great source of learning. \n Compare that to typical American tourism.  As Americans, we go into another country, expecting them to speak English we can understand.  We visit the sights, but see them only from our own perspectives.  We wear our American clothes, carrying around our American baggage, and cop our American attitudes.  We often come off as rude, insensitive, and ignorant. \n An orientation meeting happens when you start a new job with a new company.  If you are one of many new hires, there\u2019s an actual orientation meeting.  If you are a single hire, this often comes in the form of a personal tour and a stop at human resources.  Either way, your new employer orients you to the culture of the organization you\u2019ve just joined.  Some of that orientation will be more about what the organization intends to be, rather than what it is, but even there you\u2019re learning about the organization\u2019s culture. \n Compare this to times where you may have started a new job and been plopped down to work without much of an introduction.  Disorienting, wasn\u2019t it? \n On the surface of things, parenting a child with autism is like being forced into an immersion program.  For most people, this may be their first introduction to the disability community.  They have to navigate the worlds of special education and special needs medical care with no training and no orientation.  They have to figure it out for themselves or find people who can help.  All the while, you also have to learn about your child\u2019s disability and ways to help your child. \n That sounds a lot like immersion, and I suspect we\u2019ve all been there to one degree or another.  After all, we\u2019re being forced\u2014against our will\u2014into the world of disabilities, with all the systems and trappings that go with that. \n A lot of parents seem to stop with that level of immersion.  They stay in the adult world where all their energies and resources revolve around  dealing with  their child\u2019s autism\u2014 dealing with their child . \n It\u2019s like American tourism or the disorienting non-orientation.  It\u2019s overwhelming, it\u2019s intense, but it doesn\u2019t help you to  understand your child . \n In order to immerse yourself in autism, you have to make a shift in your mind.  Do you really want to  deal with  your child?  Or do you want to  understand  your child?  If you really want to understand your child, you have to immerse yourself in your child\u2019s world\u2014not the world of disabilities\u2014and connect with your child as a fellow human being.  The problem, of course, is that people with autism seem\u2014and truly can be\u2014disconnected from their fellow human beings. \n It\u2019s more than just a different culture; it\u2019s a different way of experiencing the world and the people within the world. \n It\u2019s true that you still have to immerse yourself in the world of disabilities, because those are the systems our society creates to  deal with  people with disabilities.  But your child is more than just a problem to be dealt with.  He or she is a human being you love and care about and want to have a relationship with.  In order to do that, you need to connect with him or her.  Don\u2019t be an American tourist, expecting your child to bridge the neurological gap.  After all, if your child could do that, then he or she wouldn\u2019t be diagnosed with a neurological disability.  Immerse yourself in your child\u2019s world.  Speak your child\u2019s language, experience your child\u2019s world, experience your child\u2019s way of being.  Let that experience broaden your understanding and bridge the gap between yourself and your child. \n Autism doesn\u2019t have to be your enemy.  Your child certainly should not be your enemy.  It\u2019s within your power to attain understanding.  Take a step into your child\u2019s world and experience it for yourself. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/07/parent-tip-immerse-yourself-in-autism/", "title": "Parent Tip:"},

Expecting something coherent to come out of my mouth while that\u2019s happening\u2014let alone something informative, persuasive, or entertaining\u2014just exacerbates my anxiety. \n Public speaking is also something I\u2019m going to have to do in order to do what I want.

That means I will need to be coherent, too. \n It\u2019s an \u201cI am Here\u201d and \u201cI need to be There\u201d kind of situation.  Not only does There seem far away, it is an uphill climb. \n I\u2019ve tried the straight-line approach.  I\u2019ve accepted small, seemingly comfortable opportunities to speak.  Usually I come away feeling that I have no idea what I said, and yet getting encouraging feedback, especially from those who knew beforehand that I was scared out of my wits.  Overall, despite the positive feedback, I consider those efforts a failure, because I come out of them feeling like, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to do this.\u201d \n Yes, there\u2019s \u201cTry and try again,\u201d but there\u2019s also Einstein\u2019s \u201cInsanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\u201d \n So, I\u2019m trying a stair-step approach.

{"date": "April 5, 2013", "body": "\r\n Kathleen  and  Kim  wrote a  post  for  The Autism Channel  about aggression.  I recommend reading the post.  I also want to share some of my reactions, based on our experiences with aggression in our children, so please take a moment to hear a little about what we\u2019ve been going through lately, which will help you understand why I found this post to be so important. \n Ben is probably the easiest to explain.  At the end of last year, he was having a very rough time in school.  There was too much going on in his classroom and he couldn\u2019t handle it.  So, he \u201cacted out\u201d aggressively against staff and classmates.  He brought his frustration and his behaviors home, too.  Ben was predominantly non-verbal at this time, so \u201cacting out\u201d was one of the few ways he could communicate.  Along with the aggression, he also covered his ears, pushed things away, and demonstrated other non-cooperative behaviors.  Then, after several meetings, we decided to isolate him in a classroom of his own, away from all the overstimulation, and his behaviors improved dramatically. \n At the time, the school he was in was not properly equipped for Ben\u2019s needs, so the school system decided to place him with another teacher at another school\u2014particularly with a teacher who was trained in \u201cbehaviors.\u201d  What we didn\u2019t know at the time, what had not been fully explained, was that she was trained to work with children with behavioral problems, i.e. children who are emotionally disturbed or present other psychological needs that result in undesirable behaviors.  In short, these children \u201cact out\u201d with undesirable behaviors that serve a different purpose and are not primarily a replacement for communication deficits.  Please note, my point is not that these children are somehow inferior to Ben\u2014all children deserve to have their needs met and many different kinds of children have many different kinds of needs and all of those needs are valid and worth meeting.  My point, instead, is that, unbeknownst to me at the time, prior to Ben this teacher had only worked with  one  child with autism.  And I think we all know what people say about knowing one child with autism.  Neither her training nor her experience prepared this teacher to work with Ben. \n Despite this, it went fine at first.  She is a good teacher, and she cares very deeply for all her students, and she\u2019s quite capable of putting up with what most of her students dish out.  Also, it should be noted, that in those first few months Ben\u2019s environment was very much what we\u2019d been told to expect\u2014most of the time he had the room to himself, and when he didn\u2019t he had a space he could go to that he associated with being \u201chis.\u201d  Unfortunately, the school and staff didn\u2019t really understand Ben\u2019s needs.  Seeing the success of the strategies we recommended for Ben, including this special space, and facing an increased need from more of the teacher\u2019s other students (who are pulled out of regular education classrooms when their behavior requires it) who now needed to be in \u201cBen\u2019s\u201d classroom, the staff started sharing \u201cBen\u2019s\u201d space with other students. \n Now, if you\u2019re a parent of a child with autism, particularly a child with strong sensory needs who is easily overstimulated, one who also has minimal social and communicative skills, I bet you can guess where this is going.  Once the other children began \u201cencroaching on Ben\u2019s space,\u201d the behaviors started up again.  Again, after many meetings, we concluded it would be necessary to isolate him during his academic periods, thus re-establishing the environment Ben was supposed to have in the first place (as far as I understood things.  This school and this teacher were supposed to understand and be able to meet Ben\u2019s needs all along, which was the whole reason I agreed for him to be moved to a new school!  Yet, for several months, that was not what happened.  In short, for two years in a row, we\u2019ve had to go through similar processes to \u201cfigure out\u201d Ben\u2019s needs based on Ben\u2019s behaviors, because when Ben\u2019s needs are not met he \u201cacts out\u201d with aggressive behaviors. \n Ben is not a bad kid.  He\u2019s stubborn and strong willed, but that\u2019s not bad.  Ben is also working within social and communication deficits, so he doesn\u2019t know how to express himself in constructive, non-violent ways.  He doesn\u2019t know how to say \u201cget away from me\u201d or \u201cleave me alone\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s too much noise\u201d or \u201cthis place is way too busy for me to concentrate,\u201d let alone the more polite versions of these phrases.  He can either endure it\u2014but he\u2019s a mite bit too stubborn and strong-willed for that.  Or he can express himself physically. \n I don\u2019t say this to excuse his behavior, but merely to explain them.   Ben  can\u2019t change things for himself.  So,  we  have to adapt to Ben\u2019s needs.  If we succeed, then Ben\u2019s behavior decrease, which allows us the opportunity to discover additional unmet needs.  If we keep it up, then the behaviors will be eliminated because he doesn\u2019t need them anymore.  This would be especially true if we took the opportunity of the \u201cgood times\u201d to develop his social and communication skills to the point that he has alternatives to aggression. \n Ben is one example of aggression in a child with autism.  Ben\u2019s is a fairly straightforward case, meaning the mechanics of the behavior and the purposes of the behavior are fairly simple.  This does not, however, mean it\u2019s an easy situation.  It\u2019s not.  Ben has only a limited number of effective behaviors to work with to express all of his frustrations and distresses and stressors and needs.  Figuring out Ben\u2019s needs and how to meet those needs is a process involving a lot of trial and error, and this process also relies heavily on the understanding of the adults around him.  It\u2019s a long process, but with a good prospective outcome.  But Ben is only one example.  I have two more children who struggle with aggression, which I\u2019ll discuss next week. \n For now, check out the  post  over at  The Autism Channel .

I also read it with the hope that I would, in its pages, discover how to get the kind of medical treatment I wanted from the health care facilities available to me. \n Unfortunately, this book is very much written with the doctor in mind, which means that I\u2019m not going to be able to go to my doctor armed with the knowledge to convince him that not only should I be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, unless he has significant reasons to question the validity of the diagnosis, but that this condition should be treated as a whole, not merely as a collection of symptoms. \n Fortunately, this book has both reinforced my reservations and made me further question some of my own assumptions with regards to health care, so I\u2019m formulating a long-term plan that will, hopefully, not only help me to become symptom-free, but also help me to become truly healthy.  And there is a difference, which is one of the things this book is about. \n If you\u2019re interested in being healthy and you\u2019re willing to open your mind to new ideas, I highly recommend this book.

I feel it like the brush of coarse fabric against my skin. \n Is valuing someone  because  they are autistic any better than  NOT  valuing someone because they\u2019re autistic?  Either way, it\u2019s judging someone\u2019s value based on a preconceived notion of who that person is and what they can or should be able to do.  In other words, it\u2019s prejudice. \n I get the same creepy crawly feeling when I hear affirmative action expressed as a good thing.  I\u2019m sorry, but how is judging someone  favorably  for their race any less an act of racial prejudice, especially when it means judging someone else  unfavorably  for their race? \n On the one hand, if we do nothing, then people with autism will still be marginalized.  On the other hand, if we convince people in power that people with autism have a peculiar set of traits that can add value to their workforce, then\u2026people with autism will still be marginalized, but at least some of them will be employed. \n Practically speaking, I recognize that there is a real-world trade-off going on here.  I recognize that, as abhorrent as the practice may seem to me, affirmative action serves a purpose.  I recognize that marginalized but employed is better than marginalized and unemployed. \n But, aside from these practical realities, the truth is this doesn\u2019t change anything.  The real problem isn\u2019t simply that people with autism are unemployed or that people who are not white are less favorably employed than people who are white.  These very real, life-altering hardships are symptoms, both of them, of a much bigger cultural disease. \n Prejudice is alive and well in our cultures.  Prejudice has a deep, lasting, traumatic, and obviously negative impact on the lives of real people.  The cure to this cultural disease, the cure to prejudice, is not to tweak prejudice to be more favorable.  The cure to this cultural disease is for everyone within the culture to open their eyes and see a fellow human being\u2014not a white male or a black female or a black male autistic or whatever other boxes you might put a person in. \n I don\u2019t care what your skin color is, what your diagnosis is, or whether you have a diagnosis.  You have value.  You have something you can contribute to society.  You have a reasonable expectation to earn a living contributing in some fashion to society.  When applying for a job, you should be judged solely on whether or not you can do the job that needs to be done. \n Granted, in certain cases, designing jobs that meet organizational needs and yet accommodate for existing weaknesses is a very good thing.  I\u2019m all for it.  Until you stick a label on it.  As soon as you designate that job to a certain label, you dehumanize the people who can do the job with the accommodations in place.  The fact is there are people who are similar to people with autism who do not qualify for or do not have access to an autism diagnosis.  Some of them have other diagnoses.  Some of them have none.  Can they do the job?  Can they benefit from the accommodations?  Does a label really matter?  The fact is that the label only matters in a world where prejudice reigns. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/06/04/thinking-differently-autism-patients-in-demand-by-employers/"], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/06/1016/", "title": "The Employment Conundrum"},

The family likes to congregate at the cottage to spend special (summer) holidays for obvious reasons.  So, when I received a rather cryptic Facebook message from my best friend/sister-in-law asking me if we were going to the cottage, I kind of knew what she meant.  But there was no holiday and no scheduled family gathering.  At least, there was none that I knew about.  Besides, my best friend/sister-in-law had moved to Louisiana.  Last I knew, she wouldn\u2019t be making it to the cottage any time soon. \n I received this message around 4 am and was in bed by 5 am.  Alex woke me up oh-so-thoughtfully by pinching me (while I was still asleep) ten times, before I finally got out of bed around 11:30 am.  Shortly thereafter, we received a call from my mother-in-law with my very impatient best friend/sister-in-law making somewhat belligerent statements in the background. \n Surprise!  She\u2019s here! \n As you might imagine, surprises\u2014even good ones\u2014aren\u2019t so easy for our family to deal with.  But, because I hadn\u2019t seen her or my nephew in about a year, we had to get everyone ready for a trip up to the cottage without notice or foreshadowing. \n All things considered, it went well.  The boys took it in stride.  We all had a blast.  It was great seeing her again.  And now that she\u2019s back in Indiana, I\u2019m going to be able to see her a lot more.  I even got to bring my nephew back with me to spend the night with his cousins.  All in all, it was a very good day. \n Which just goes to show how far we\u2019ve come.  It used to be that I\u2019d try something like this, and we\u2019d face major meltdowns from some very disturbed little boys who couldn\u2019t handle their routines being shattered without notice.

But he\u2019s excited about high school.  He\u2019s slipping into a summer routine without a problem. \n Alex is doing especially well.  I expected, for example, to see a marked increase in pinching while he\u2019s at home.  Basically, pinching at home + the pinching he would have done at school.  Instead, most of the time he goes through the motions, as if it were a habit, but doesn\u2019t actually press hard enough to hurt.  Sometimes, when he\u2019s distressed, he pinches with genuine force.  But the times he seeks me out have decreased markedly.  The times he seeks his brothers out have decreased, though less drastically.  Let\u2019s face it, brothers can be very annoying. \n I\u2019m not sure how much Ben realizes school is over yet.  His school year has been so unpredictable, it\u2019s not like he can count on not going to school as an indication that school is ended.  His empty backpack\u2014which is finally, actually empty\u2014should be a big clue.

The doctors\u2019 first guess at which medicine would control his seizures was correct, and the dosage he needs to maintain control is relatively low.  Now that 2013 is almost half over, I\u2019m glad to say that he has been seizure-free throughout this calendar year.  Many people with epilepsy aren\u2019t so lucky or so easy to treat. \n A big part of the success of this treatment, however, involves Willy remembering to take his pills in the morning and the evening.  He needs both doses.  He needs to remember every day.  This is important. \n It\u2019s also easy to forget.  When you feel sick, it\u2019s relatively easy to remember to take your medications.

I also learned that, while my undergraduate degree made me a better-informed businessperson and honed my strategic and planning capabilities, this degree would do absolutely nothing to improve me as a writer. \n Before I\u2019d finished my undergraduate degree, I knew I would get a graduate degree and I knew exactly what I wanted this degree to cover.  I researched the programs available to me and finally made my decision by taking an intuitive leap.  I don\u2019t regret my choice, because my recently-completed Master of Science in Written Communications made me a better writer in all of the areas I wanted to improve my writing, both in corporate and journalistic writing and in literary and prose writing and even in poetry. \n I thought I was finished.

In this dream, I\u2019m able to do that because 1) I write a surprise bestseller or 2) I win the lotto. \n Recently, something inside me shifted.  I realized that people with passion  do  start nonprofits, not because they win the lotto or become independently wealthy, but because they  share  their passion and  work  for their dream.  Many of them even know what they\u2019re doing and do it well. \n When I started searching for this part-time job that was going to round out my different activities, I gravitated to nonprofits from the very beginning.  Then, I admitted to myself that I didn\u2019t  like  corporate writing for corporations, and focused my search  exclusively  on nonprofits. \n With that decision, I gave myself permission to admit that what I really want to do is to make the world a better place.  There, I\u2019ve said it:  I want to change the world.  And, more importantly, I believe I  can  change the world.  I can make this world a better place by working my dream. \n I\u2019d done a little research and toyed with the idea.  I was interacting with one of my blogging friends and she asked some questions.  I tried to answer them, but had to stop and delete my comment.  Then, on a second glance, I knew they were rhetorical.  Well, maybe it\u2019s not so much that they were rhetorical, but that it was not expected for me to have an answer.  And I didn\u2019t have an answer.

Even when we can prove, unequivocally, that he\u2019s wrong.  Facts are facts.  He resents that when he\u2019s on the wrong side of them. \n I remember, as a child, being very similar in that respect.  Don\u2019t worry.  It is possible to grow out of that sort of thing.  Unfortunately, far too many people don\u2019t. \n Anyway, despite his will to form his own values and identity, Mark and I take our responsibility seriously when it comes to helping him shape those values and his identity.  We look for opportunities and we snatch at them. \n Will and I still read together.  We\u2019ve recently read  Ender\u2019s Game  and  Speaker for the Dead  and have moved on to  Xenocide .  For those who aren\u2019t familiar with these books, they are part of a series written by  Orson Scott Card . \n In  Ender\u2019s Game  Ender/Andrew Wiggin is taken from his home at the tender age of six to join a military training facility where they train children to fight aliens.  Ender exists specifically for this purpose:  his brother was too cruel, his sister was too kind, so despite strictly enforced population controls, Ender was born with the hope that he\u2019d be \u201cjust right.\u201d  And he was, especially after what they put him through.  He was empathetic enough to understand his alien opponents, but ruthless enough to blow their digitized home world to atomic dust.  After all, it\u2019s just a video game, right? \n In  Speaker for the Dead , Ender is a grown man who has survived three thousands year, but is only 35-ish.  Ain\u2019t space travel a grand thing?  He meets some new young people who have direct contact with a new alien race, but these people are still in the pre-agricultural stage and they\u2019re different in a way nobody quite understands.  He\u2019s brought there to solve some serious dilemmas and to unravel some serious puzzles\u2014at least, that\u2019s why he comes.  In the process, he starts a war to save the life of a young man who ends up on the wrong side of a fence. \n Now, in  Xenocide , they have to fight this war.  The young man who ended up on the wrong side of the fence is suffering.  The fence was electric, except more so.  It was designed to create pain too intense for a human to climb the fence, but the young man tricked himself into climbing it and the experience left him with brain damage.  So, now every time that character appears as the point of view character, his disability is a central part of the discussion. \n All three books have stimulated important discussions.  That\u2019s why we read books like this together.  But the disability factor is special for obvious reasons.  It\u2019s important to me that Will be able to see a similitude between not only himself and his less-functioning brothers, but also between himself, his brothers, and people with other disabilities (and other differences).  For example, acknowledging Will\u2019s initial reaction, \u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have brain damage,\u201d is important.  Nobody asks for that, after all.  It\u2019s not what any of us want for ourselves. \n But so is turning that statement around in two necessary ways: \n \n  You have autism and that is not brain damage. \n People like Miro, who do have brain damage, are still people and still deserve to be heard, because they still have something to say, and you\u2019re good at listening. \n \n Do you try to help your children identify with those with differences that are different from their own?

{"date": "July 8, 2013", "body": "\r\n My new office is in my mother\u2019s house, so she\u2019s often there when I release a progress report on my recent work session, which I\u2019ve been doing on my social media sites.  A few days ago, after releasing a report, I came upstairs and my mother greeted me with, \u201cYou\u2019ve finished another chapter!  Great!  Congratulations!\u201d \n That started a conversation about the book I am writing and I decided to share a chapter with her.  She was effusive with her praise, as mothers are prone to be, and then said something that caught my attention. \n \u201cWell, you need to tell where Willy was in order to show how far he\u2019s come.\u201d \n I processed this for a moment.  No doubt I was shaking my head from the start.  Still, it took me a while to come up with the words that went with the denial. \n \u201cI\u2019m not writing Willy\u2019s story.  It\u2019s my story.  It\u2019s not about the boys.  It\u2019s about me.  It\u2019s about what I did with it.\u201d \n This is an important distinction. \n I write about my children.  I write about them a lot.  But I\u2019m never telling their story, because their story must be told through the way they process the experiences they have.  I don\u2019t presume to get inside their head and voice what\u2019s in there.  I tell my story.  I tell my story as a parent.  I tell my story as someone who is neurologically different, but not diagnosably autistic.  I tell my story as someone who had to learn to advocate for my children. \n And that is the crux of this book.  Going into this whole autism thing, I had no idea what I was doing or what I was dealing with.  I\u2019ve read a lot of stories from parents who took charge from the get-go, but I wasn\u2019t one of them.  Based on the people I\u2019ve talked to, most of us weren\u2019t one of them.  So, on the one hand, I\u2019m telling my story for those parents who don\u2019t know what to do when they start out. \n More than that, the place that I went is also different than the norm, because I am different from the norm.  So, I\u2019m telling my story for all those parents who don\u2019t jump on the I\u2019ll-do-anything-to-cure-my-child\u2019s-autism bandwagon. \n My children are central characters in my story, but this is  my  story.  It\u2019s not because I\u2019m arrogant.  I certainly don\u2019t think I\u2019m more important than my children.  But I can\u2019t tell their story.  I can only tell my story, because I am only in my head, processing my experiences.  If I were telling \u201ctheir\u201d story, it would be fiction, not memoir, because I\u2019d be making unknowable assumptions on what they were experiencing.  Furthermore, I am telling my story because I believe (and I\u2019m not alone in this) that telling my story will be a service to others, particularly a service to parents who want to serve their children. \n Someday maybe my children will tell their own story.  It may not be in words, though, but that\u2019s part of the point.  Me, I will tell my story, and I\u2019ll tell it in words, because that\u2019s the story I have the authority to tell. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/07/the-story-i-am-telling/", "title": "The Story I Am Telling"},
{"date": "July 5, 2013", "body": "\r\n I had already graduated from high school when  Columbine  became short-hand for school massacre.  For a single year, I had attended classes in a fairly rural high school; due to the poor academic offerings, I took college classes for the remainder of the last two years of my high school experience and only went to the high school building to fill out paperwork.  Still, I remember very little security in my high school building. \n Yet, there was abundant evidence of the potential for violence in my high school.  Although we didn\u2019t have gangs\u2014at least none that I ever knew of\u2014and there was relatively little blatant crime, bullying was rampant and went unchecked.  Walking through the halls, I heard everything from threats laced with racial slurs to plans to get girls too drunk to realize they were having sex.  It was an unpleasant place and I was happy to escape to the more civilized college environment. \n When I heard about the Columbine shootings, I found I wasn\u2019t as surprised and shocked as others seemed to be.  I could imagine it.  I could kind of, sort of understand it.  Not that I had ever even entertained such an idea.  But I knew people who might have and I understood why they would think about it.  And I knew, if they had been pushed just a little bit further, they may even have acted on the impulse. \n With all the violence that\u2019s been going on in our society, I\u2019ve shied away from the gorging of the media frenzy.  I don\u2019t like the way \u201cfreedom of the press\u201d has been transformed into a form of harassment and invasion of privacy, whether it\u2019s celebrities or disaster victims, man-made or otherwise.  I also don\u2019t like the way so many try to \u201ccash in\u201d on these disasters, either for profit or for political gain. \n So, I was kind of surprised to find  April Showers  in my Netflix queue.  It\u2019s a movie about a school shooting.  I wondered why I put it in there.  I looked it up and found out that it was written and directed by Andrew Robinson, a Columbine survivor.  Then, I remembered that the movie had been recommended in one of my classes. \n Art is one of the ways we try to come to terms with the incomprehensible reality that surrounds us.   April Showers  is an honest exploration of a traumatic event, capturing the horror and the aftermath without relying on gore or sensationalism to tell the story.  Life is full of consequence.  If we thought a little more about it, then we\u2019d all be able to live better lives. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/07/april-showers/", "title": "April Showers"},
{"date": "May 13, 2013", "body": "\r\n I was recently required to fill out a multi-page questionnaire about Alex\u2019s communication skills.  I took a quick look at this document, put it back, and made arrangements to fill it out with the help of school staff.  That\u2019s been done. \n I arrived during the lunch hour (which lasts significantly less than an hour, but we still took an hour, so I got to say \u201cHi!\u201d to Alex) to sit down with Alex\u2019s teacher and go over the questionnaire page by page.  The issue, which I found difficult to explain, was that the words they used to elicit information left significant room for interpretation. \n So, our process consisted of: \n \n  Reading the question aloud. \n Agreeing on what the question probably means. \n Applying the question to our observations of Alex. \n Agreeing on an appropriate answer. \n \n This process stimulated some interesting insights about Alex\u2019s means of communication.  Without having been asked the questions and forced to articulate a response, I probably wouldn\u2019t have volunteered some of the answers they were looking for. \n Some of the things that we could readily agree on were: \n \n  Alex\u2019s expressive communication skills are limited to readily tangible wants and needs. \n Alex\u2019s receptive communication skills are unknown: We don\u2019t know how much Alex understands or how sophisticated his comprehension is. \n Alex tries to communicate in ways we don\u2019t understand and seeks ways to make himself understood, yet he also gives in to frustration or gives up and we don\u2019t always recognize his attempts to communicate. \n Successful communication is limited to a select group of people who know Alex well enough to \u201clisten\u201d in the ways that he can communicate, but even then much of the time there is a failure to communicate and \u201clisten\u201d successfully. \n \n We also agreed that the ideal situation is to provide Alex with a means to communicate that can be expanded to communicate more complex thoughts and feelings.  This means a system that is limited to expressing wants and needs would be inadequate, even if it were able to help Alex communicate wants and needs more clearly and more universally. \n Furthermore, we agreed that the ideal situation would use Alex\u2019s strengths to his advantage.  The primary implication here is that Alex excels, in a seemingly intuitive sort of way, in the use of touch technologies.  He uses iPads and SmartBoards at school and a Kindle Fire at home, and he\u2019s able to figure out their capabilities more quickly and in more depth than most of the adults around him. \n Not only did this process take us a step closer to getting Alex the professional help he needs to be paired with the right technological assistive communication device/program, it also helped his teacher and I better understand what Alex is doing now to communicate with us.  Hopefully, this insight will help us to reduce the frustrations and failures and increase the success and depth of communication with the skills Alex already has. \n Ironically, it started with a questionnaire that, due to its seeming ambiguity, could be described as an example of poor communication (based on my standards as a professional writer). \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/05/a-step-towards-communication/", "title": "A Step Towards Communication"},

I can lose track of time easier than I can lose my car keys.  And, unlike my car keys, I cannot designate a place to keep time so I always know where it is. \n Using Sunday as a guidepost, I managed to make sure I was awake during the day on Monday and again on Tuesday.  Tuesday I got flipped and it wasn\u2019t even my fault.  Ben refused to go to sleep.  Even though he was content to play (almost) quietly in his room, I couldn\u2019t let myself fall asleep.  I lay in bed, resting, but the mother in me just couldn\u2019t sleep and leave Ben unsupervised. \n In the morning, he was chipper as could be, revving up for his day.  I was dead on my feet, canceled my morning appointment, and crashed for a good long while\u2014seven whole hours.  By the time I woke up, I\u2019d completely forgotten that it was Wednesday.  So, that night, as I pushed to get the boys into bed so I could get some work done, I forgot all about their baths.

A long, long time ago I resisted the idea of using melatonin to help alleviate that problem.  I got over it.  Now, Alex happily takes his melatonin in gummy form.  Ben still has to take crushed up pills, but we have a system that makes it less of a battle.  Unfortunately, I seem to be the only one who can implement the system. \n Willy\u2019s prescription medication helps him sleep, though it doesn\u2019t make him sleepy per se, just more regulated.  Mark\u2019s prescription medication helps him sleep by making him sleepy, but only in combination with a formerly-prescribed-now-over-the-counter medication that isn\u2019t supposed to have any sleepy-time effects at all.  If he takes each pill separately, there\u2019s no sleepy-time effect.  If he takes them together, there is.  If he runs out of his prescribed medication before it can be refilled, then he can\u2019t sleep at all.  Even with melatonin and/or Tylenol PM. \n I take melatonin and Tylenol PM to help me sleep now and it just barely works.  When it doesn\u2019t, I get a headache instead of much needed Zzzzs. \n I know that people who are on the autism spectrum seem to have more trouble sleeping.  I don\u2019t know whether this is a statistically proven fact, however.

There are people in this world who are so motivated by profit that they take advantage of desperate and/or gullible parents and caregivers, and jeopardize the lives of everyone with autism in the process. \n On the other hand, there are parents and people with autism who are so convinced of their own authority due to their experiences that they speak as if their experiences  are  autism.  They tell their story as if their story is  the  story of autism.  In the process, they marginalize everyone else who experiences autism for themselves. \n It\u2019s important for those of us who speak (or write) publicly to recognize when we are crossing the line between speaking as a parent (or a person with autism) and speaking as an advocate.  It\u2019s important for us to act with integrity and respect all the people involved, who may have very different experiences and needs than we do.

All too often it seems this greater community provides inputs for the microcosm while getting little in return. \n My family has lately experienced many, many relatively minor, non-life-threatening hardships.

I\u2019m not talking about the literal atmospheric condition which essentially creates cloud-like conditions for several feet off the ground, though fog can be rather annoying to drive or walk through.  I\u2019m talking about something called \u201cfibro fog.\u201d  At least, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. \n My livelihood (and my family\u2019s) relies on my ability to think, to focus, to concentrate, and to string those focused thoughts into words on the page, i.e. to write something worth reading.  Generally speaking, I\u2019m fairly good at this.  But lately my abilities to focus and to concentrate have been slipping.  It feels like, for the last few months, I\u2019ve fallen off a foggy cliff and disappeared for a while.  This is on top of another illness, which has been difficult to shake. \n When I\u2019m well enough, I meet, via Skype, with a co-writer on a weekly basis.  Awhile back, I explained, \u201cMy week is gone and I have no idea where it went.\u201d  I had nothing to show for it, including the assignment I was supposed to turn into him the day before we met.  That has persisted for much longer than just the one week now. \n This is frustrating, because if I can\u2019t focus and concentrate, I can\u2019t work.  The work piles up and there\u2019s always more of it to do.  It\u2019s also how I earn my family\u2019s living.  What\u2019s more, much of what I do for the boys (advocacy, program development, ect.) to ease their way in the world also relies on these abilities.  I can\u2019t advocate for my children properly if it\u2019s a struggle to simply concentrate and focus my thoughts. \n The thoughts are there, they just don\u2019t reach my mouth or my fingers.  They slip away into the fog.  In some ways, it\u2019s similar to descriptions I\u2019ve heard of attention-deficit disorders.  Except, instead of thoughts moving quickly, they move terribly slow and the fog (a blank nothingness) rolls in quickly over them.  In some ways, it\u2019s similar to depression, except instead of my mood being depressed (mood is actor), my whole brain is being depressed (brain is the subjected to the action).  Altogether, I dislike it and want it to stop. \n Anyone know anything that might help? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/03/lifting-the-fog-from-my-mind/", "title": "Lifting the Fog from My Mind"},

{"date": "May 6, 2013", "body": "\r\n What is a \u201cgood day\u201d in the life of your child? \n This is an important question, because we frequently get reports from teachers, therapists, and other care providers as to whether our children have had good days or bad days.  Unfortunately, the answers to this question are loaded with subjective assumptions.  It seems that no matter how clearly you try to express your expectations, the people who work with your child are going to develop their own subjective interpretation of what a \u201cgood day\u201d looks like. \n On one hand, we need to be flexible.  Our children\u2019s behaviors differ across environments and so do the behaviors they are required to perform in order to succeed.  On the other hand, the feedback you receive reflects their subjective assumptions, not your own, so you may be getting a faulty impression of your child\u2019s success in a certain program or environment. \n As I\u2019ve discussed, Ben has been struggling in school.  I went in for a visit to see if I could pinpoint the source of a recurring problem.  Except, according to school staff, my son was having a good day.  So, I observed, for about an hour, this \u201cgood day.\u201d \n Considering the problematic behaviors I\u2019d been hearing about, I suppose it was a good day.  Ben stuck to his routine.  There was very little in the way of resistance behaviors.  There were no pinching or other outbursts. \n Considering reasonable school expectations, even for a child with autism, I can\u2019t see how this could be a \u201cgood day.\u201d  School progress requires concentration and application.  It\u2019s about learning, not just managing sensory needs and managing explosive behaviors. \n All things considered, after this long and troublesome year, I suppose, perhaps, it\u2019s reasonable to call what I saw a \u201cgood day.\u201d  The problem, however, is that Ben can do so much better than what I observed.  He\u2019s capable of focus.  He can apply himself to his work.  He can have his needs met  and  meet scholastic and behavioral expectations.  I\u2019ve seen it happen.  His on-going, at-home therapist can get this kind of \u201cgood day\u201d out of him consistently.  Sure, even she has bad days with him, but these expectations aren\u2019t out of reach. \n No matter what we do, not every day is going to be a good day.  But a good day shouldn\u2019t be \u201cgetting by\u201d by managing behaviors and needs.  A good day involves meeting reasonable expectations.  Reasonable expectations have to be adjusted to the child\u2019s needs and abilities; that\u2019s a big part of what special education is all about.  However, those adjustments shouldn\u2019t lower expectations to the point that \u201cgetting by\u201d and managing behaviors is a \u201cgood day.\u201d  Our children can do better. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/05/good-day/", "title": "Good Day?"},

It gets to light up the night sky while it soars and swoops, or even while it rises from its own ashes to live again.  Once I thought about it, I decided to turn my crashed-and-burnt airplane metaphor into a phoenix. \n For those who don\u2019t know me quite as well, I\u2019ve overcome significant adversity in my life.  I\u2019ve crashed.  I\u2019ve burned.  I\u2019ve gotten up.  I\u2019ve dusted myself off.  I\u2019ve flown again.  Time after time.  In the past, depression has usually been my downfall.  After experiencing a true crash-and-burn fibromyalgia style, I have to say I kind of prefer the depression. \n Sure, depression feels worse in a lot of ways.  Let\u2019s face it, hopelessness sucks.  On the other hand, fibromyalgia is physically painful.  I can handle that surprisingly well.  What I dislike is the impact it has on my ability to concentrate. \n Again, for those who don\u2019t know me quite as well, I\u2019m a professional writer.  Particularly, I\u2019m a freelance writer.  I own and operate my own writing business.  I\u2019m also the primary \u201cbreadwinner.\u201d  I support my family (or not) by writing.  Lately it\u2019s been more the \u201cnot,\u201d which sucks.  I\u2019m also a graduate student with a 4.0\u2014again.  Yes, this is my second graduate degree.  I am also the go-to person for my children\u2019s IEPs and other issues. \n The frustrating thing is that all of this requires the ability to think clearly, to remember things, to hold words in my head long enough for them to get off my tongue/fingers, and to make them make sense when they do.  For me, the worst part about fibromyalgia is that I\u2019ve been feeling like I\u2019m losing my mind.  Not in a going crazy sort of way, but in a dementia sort of way.  Of course, that\u2019s a comparison that fails to capture the true loss of dementia, but still. \n The most poignant part about all of this is that my ability to think started to slip right around the time my grandfather, who was experiencing symptoms of dementia, made it perfectly clear that he didn\u2019t want to live that way.  My situation was totally different and I wasn\u2019t quite as stuck in the inevitable decline as he was, but it made me much more sympathetic to his position.  As much as I love and miss my grandfather, when he passed I respected the fact that for him it was a relief. \n Now, I have my own relief.  I\u2019m getting better.  My phoenix is rising into a new period of my life.  A period of growth and productivity.  A period of profitability and publication.

In a household with children with autism, this ritual is modified. While the modifications depend entirely on the child, here are a few things that might occur: \n \n Your child does NOT want new clothes\u2014no matter how cool they happen to be. Even new socks and/or underwear can ramp up the before-school anxiety. \n Your child does NOT want a new backpack\u2014even if the old one is falling apart and held together with duct tape. \n If your child MUST have a new backpack, then it MUST be the same style, size, and color as the backpack that is being replaced. \n If your child MUST have new clothes, then the outfits should emphasize comfort and should not be stress-inducing or exciting; whether the clothes are \u201ccool\u201d or not may not matter to your child. \n Your child may require a set of \u201cschool\u201d supplies for home, as well as for school, because paper, pens, pencils and crayons are always welcome. Your child might \u201cbreak into\u201d his or her school supplies if a set of the most desirable items is not purchase for immediate, at-home use.

If possible, get a new set that will be adaptable until the next growth spurt, adding new items as the seasons change. \n Your child may have absolutely no interest in going shopping with you; the added stress of shopping on top of the near-constant back-to-school stress may be too much for your child to bear. If your child says, \u201cNo\u201d in any way, shape or form, honor that choice if at all possible. \n If your child MUST go shopping with you, please respect your child enough not to drag him or her to multiple stores in pursuit of the best deals\u2014the cost savings is not worth the stress this will cause your child.

Not once that I can remember. \n Saturday night, late, I went upstairs to go to the bathroom. When I came down I sat in my chair and \u2014ouch!\u2014 something poked me. I scratched, thinking a sliver got stuck in the pillow*. But there was something, like a little wad, in my pant leg. \n I was alone, in the privacy of my den, so I reached in and took it out. It was a bee! It was alive! I flung it, stomped on it. Realized that it might have been a wasp, but it didn\u2019t occur to me to care. It was bee  in my pants!!! \n How does that even happen?

Yes, still. \n *I have an \u201cexecutive\u2019s\u201d chair, with a wheeled bottom, a high back, arms, and built-in cushioning. I sit on this chair lotus-style, because otherwise my legs feel like they\u2019re floating away, which makes it rather hard to concentrate on my work. When I sat on the faux-leather, this created semi-permanent callus-like lines in my ankles that would occasionally bleed. So, I got a regular chair cushion, but it was only marginally better, because the extra cushioning and fabric didn\u2019t cover the whole chair.

I knocked down the cobwebs that had accumulated in my den. You see, it doesn\u2019t take long. My den is in the basement. The den is the only room that\u2019s \u201cfinished\u201d in the basement and this room is only semi-finished, with a bare-beamed ceiling and either bare-beamed or concrete block walls.

{"date": "August 8, 2014", "body": "\r\n After the muddled end of my last school year, I admit I\u2019m anxious about starting up school again. I still haven\u2019t quite gotten a handle on my fibromyalgia. My business is growing, but it\u2019s growing primarily in a way that involves me doing more work to make it grow, as well as the work I need to do to provide for my family. I\u2019m not up to a full day\u2019s worth of work, quantity wise, even though it takes me a full day (or longer) to do it. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll strike a balance between work and school once it starts, since both are priorities. There is so much that is unknown and I feel so unprepared, that there\u2019s definitely an anxiety factor involved. \n Willy, on the other hand, seems willfully unaware that school will start in less than a month. He will acknowledge it if I bring the issue up directly. He\u2019ll discuss what concessions he\u2019s willing to make with regards to new clothes, new school supplies, new shoes, and a new backpack. He\u2019s willing to talk, briefly, about how he felt last year went. He won\u2019t talk directly about his hopes and fears about the coming year. It\u2019s difficult to weigh his anxiety levels, because he asserts a blas\u00e9 attitude that seemingly belies his willfulness on the matter. \n Alex, of course, is impossible to gauge. Honestly, I think getting back to the routine of school will be good for him. We have had something of a routine this summer, which has helped; but it\u2019s a routine that spreads across the week, not over a single day, and it\u2019s subject to far more change than the routines of school. This is not to say that he isn\u2019t experiencing anxiety over the start of school. It\u2019s more to say that it\u2019s difficult to judge that anxiety relative to the buzz of anxiety he seems to feel most of the time. There are times when he\u2019s completely free and, by noting those times and repeating the surrounding circumstances, we\u2019ve even been able to increase them. However, the onset of anxiety is never so easily pinned to one cause or another, because he can experience both instantaneous and delayed reactions, depending on his processing during the moment. He seems to be handling the idea of returning to school well, but it\u2019s hard to tell. \n Ben is another matter. He seems genuinely unaware of the imminence of school. If I bring it up, his behavior reflects a belief that what I\u2019m saying is not interesting, and therefore not worth attending to. This doesn\u2019t necessarily suggest a blas\u00e9 attitude similar to Will\u2019s, because Ben\u2019s hyper-focus can be very difficult to break through, even if you attempt to do so with something immediate, tangible, and desired. Ben has very much been \u201cin his own world\u201d this summer. He\u2019ll zone into something desired and prolong it as long as possible. The easiest way to break him out of it (not that we do this on purpose or anything) is to give Alex the opportunity to do something he likes to do that annoys Ben. Ben will stop whatever he\u2019s doing, wherever he\u2019s doing it (as long as they\u2019re both in the same house) and try to make Alex stop. If Ben cares one way or the other about the start of school, then he\u2019s not saying so. I suspect he\u2019ll care once he has to go back to focusing on tasks and timetables that other people set for him. \n Of course, Mark is the stay-at-home parent who is not going to school, so the start of school means something different to him. I remember what that was like and, if he\u2019s anything like me, he\u2019s looking forward to the relief. After all, he\u2019s borne the brunt of a difficult summer. He\u2019s definitely ready for a break! And he definitely deserves it! \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/08/school-year-anxiety/", "title": "School-Year Anxiety"},

She checked out my incisions, but other than that the check-up was all verbal. I told her what I had experienced, good and bad, with my recovery thus far. She was pleased with my progress. \n Her informed assessment, however, was something of an obvious conclusion. I\u2019ve had too much stress. On the one hand, my life is stressful. This is seen as being particularly true whenever I bring up the boys. I brought up the boys to make the point that I\u2019ve spent too much time putting their health (and educational) needs first; and that I\u2019ve been putting my own health on the backburner for far too long. Her point was \u201cWow, three with autism, that\u2019s got to be stressful all by itself.\u201d Hm. Yes, I suppose it is, but not nearly as much as people might think, especially now that we\u2019ve figured out what works for them. \n On the other hand, she also made a point of stating that my body has been under particular stress lately.

For some, this might seem self-evident and obvious. For me, it\u2019s kind of revolutionary. My idea has generally been: \u201cGet through this as quickly and thoroughly as possible, so I can get on to the next thing.\u201d It\u2019s not that I am in such a hurry that I forsake quality, because that isn\u2019t effective. It\u2019s that I\u2019m so focused on doing  as much as possible  that I\u2019m actually reducing what I\u2019m capable of because too much of my energy and focus is spent worrying over or planning for things I can\u2019t do yet. \n Here I am trying to recover, trying to build my capacity, and I\u2019m eroding my good intentions with unnecessary stress.

{"date": "June 18, 2014", "body": "\r\n So this post is going to be a little bit late. Yesterday was a busy day and the content of this post was going to depend on what happened. I haven\u2019t gotten a chance to write it out until now, but here\u2019s what happened: \n \n First, I had three paid assignments that were due. (I successfully completed two of them and put the third back in the public queue for somebody else to do, because I ran out of time and energy to complete it myself.) \n Second, I had scheduled a meeting with the Sister Missionaries from our church for 4 pm. (I met with them and it was a good meeting.) \n Third, I had to go with Alex to his first Summer Swim at 6 pm. (This is the main point of this post.) \n Fourth, I had a sleep study scheduled for 9 pm. (This is the main point of my next post.) \n \n So, I took Alex to his Summer Swim, which is a special program arranged by the school system. Now, it\u2019s important to know that I wasn\u2019t in the best frame of mind for this, because I was frazzled and stressed with too many pressing demands for a single day. Alex, on the other hand, was excited. He\u2019d been excitable all day and telling him he was going swimming sent him through the roof. Not literally, but close enough to it. \n Then, we arrived at the school. Except that it was the wrong school. By this I mean we were at the correct place to attend the Summer Swim session, but it was the wrong school in Alex\u2019s mind. You see, Alex loves to swim. He swims two to three times a week during the school year. He swims in the pool at his school. He swims with his classmates at his school. And he loves it! He actually  swims . But this wasn\u2019t his school and it wasn\u2019t his classmates. \n This was disorienting. He didn\u2019t want to get in this pool; he wanted to get in that pool; but, I managed to get him in the pool that was available. He didn\u2019t want to swim with these kids; he wanted to swim with those kids; and I didn\u2019t get him to interact with any of them. He was in the pool up to his waist, but that was it. He didn\u2019t try to swim. He was too agitated to do much of anything. He just jumped and flapped his hands and made sounds of distress. \n I thought if I could get him in deeper, he\u2019d relax and enjoy the experience. I tried to coax him to dunk himself in the water and he jumped his way to one ladder. I blocked him and he jumped his way to the other ladder. I got there before him and he turned around and went to the other ladder. We went back and forth for ten minutes. Whenever we were face to face, Alex would pinch me. Whenever I tried to soothe him with a hug or by mushing his face (which he usually likes), he tried to bite my neck or my hands. \n Then, I got the brilliant idea that if I could get him to the deeper end of the pool, where there were fewer people, he\u2019d be able to relax and enjoy it. Remember, I was frazzled and hurried. So, I grabbed him by the belt of his little life preserver and pulled him out into the deep end. At first, he seemed like he was going to relax, but after a few moments he made a bee line for the ladder again. I tried again, pulling him out to the deep end, but he made it clear he wanted to go for the ladder again. \n I blocked him and the first routine started over again, but he was even more agitated, so when we made it back to the first ladder, I told him we were done. It took some coaxing to get him up the ladder, despite all his efforts to get to the ladders before. I think he realized that I wasn\u2019t really accommodating his needs and that it was more of a punishment for poor behavior. It made getting what he wanted (or what I\u2019d thought he wanted) less fun for him. I dried him off, dried myself off, at least enough to get in the van, and I got him out of there. We arrived at 6:10 (which was on time) and we left at 6:35 (which was early). \n Now, I readily admit that I didn\u2019t handle this well. I wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind \u2013 that\u2019s not an excuse, just an observation. Luckily, we\u2019ll have another shot on Thursday. Maybe that one will go better. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/06/summer-swim/", "title": "Summer Swim"},

If we had yet a third hand, we could count the verbal wars that take place in our political bodies, in our dialogues about significant matters, and even in our dialogues about trivial matters. And if we had yet a forth hand, we could count the wars that rage within each of us between what our conscience dictates and the weakness of our flesh\u2014wars for our very souls. So, it seems self-evident that peace really isn\u2019t possible. \n There are powers within this world that would have us believe that is true, that peace isn\u2019t possible; if we give up on peace, then we give those who want war power over us. Yet peace is a choice. We can make peace with ourselves, both between our spiritual potential and our earthly present. We can make peace with those we disagree with and even cooperate and collaborate with them. We can bridge the divides that separate us and make peace on our streets. We can even make peace in the world. So, contrary to the obvious, peace is possible. \n The autism community is fractured.

The autism community is at war. \n There are some among us that will never choose peace. This is not due to their convictions that they are 100% right and the others are 100% wrong, as it may seem. It is because they want war, because they thrive on controversy, because they choose to grasp for power, to exert their control, to have their say, and to get their way. For some, war is a way of life, but these people are only a small percentage of the autism community. They succeed only because we let them. \n Most of us want peace. We want cooperation. We want collaboration. We want things to get better. And we\u2019re willing to work for it. But we feel overwhelmed and overwrought. It can be so hard simply getting through the day that we leave ourselves little energy for peacemaking. It seems easier to fight for the specific things we believe in and want than to make a peace that will provide those things. Besides, we have few contemporary examples on how to bridge such divisive issues into workable, cooperative, collaborative solutions. Is peace possible? Perhaps, perhaps not.

This has been asserted as a fact in every attempt I have made to study statistics. This time around I\u2019m admitting right off the bat that I don\u2019t buy it. \n Maybe it\u2019s that I don\u2019t understand where this \u201cfact\u201d came from and how they reached the conclusion that it\u2019s true. More likely, it\u2019s the \u201cfact\u201d that I am and always have been something of an \u201coutlier.\u201d You cannot talk to someone who has the same age as me, the same gender as me, the same race as me, and who is living in the same area as me and conclude that their views (the answers to the survey) can be generalized to me. \n This assumption of generalizability leaves out far too much that is of personal significance: \n \n Would she have children? \n Would her children have disabilities? \n Would those disabilities include autism, sensory processing disorder, and epilepsy? \n Would her children be teenagers? \n Would she have a disability? \n Would that disability be fibromyalgia? \n Would she own her own business? \n Would she be going to graduate school? \n Would she already have a graduate degree? \n Would she have dabbled in politics long enough to become disgusted with our system? \n Would she vote despite that disgust? \n Would she make every effort to be an informed voter? \n Would she have experienced life below the poverty line? \n Would she have struggled to lift her family out of poverty? \n Would she have experienced life as a married teen mother? \n \n I could go on and on. The point, however, has been made. The things that shape my answers cannot be attributed to my race, my age, or my gender\u2014at least, not exclusively. My experiences\u2014who I am\u2014shapes how I see the world. And that shapes my answers to surveys. While I may be an outlier, I\u2019m pretty sure the same is true of everyone else and that those generalized factors aren\u2019t the major determinants of their experiences. \n How can we possibly generalize people based on random attributes when those attributes aren\u2019t really what makes them who they are? \n Part of me wonders if inequality based on age, race, and gender persist with such prevalence because our society, at its core, still believes that those attributes really do determine who and what we are. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/09/generalizations/", "title": "Generalizations"},

Many of them have expressed it this belief as a matter of logic; others have expressed it as a matter of justice; and others have demanded it as their right. Those outside of these circles sometimes see this demand as self-advocates wanting to wrest the decision-making powers from parents and researchers and practitioners. \n There is some truth to their claims on these powers, but there is also some untruth to these claims. With regards to researchers and practitioners, it\u2019s a matter of scientific practice and scientific integrity. They want to control their own efforts, and they have a point in that regard; a scientist should not be forced to study something that does not interest him or her. Fortunately, the public doesn\u2019t have to fund the objectionable research particular scientists may wish to engage in, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t find funds elsewhere. But, for the moment, I\u2019m not concerned with researchers or practitioners. \n As a parent, I empathize with the position of parents. That position can easily be summarized: You don\u2019t represent our children. Whether we\u2019re talking about adults with autism or researchers and practitioners, the truth is that you do not represent our children, no matter how much you might want to do so. If our children are of age and have the necessary resources to self-advocate, then they can self-advocate and then we have to accept their rights to do so. If our children are not of age or cannot advocate for themselves, then we have the right and responsibility to advocate for them. \n For some parents, it truly is a matter of power. Some parents continue to exercise excessive power over their children long after their children are able to engage in self-determination, self-advocacy, and self-fulfillment. They actively seek to deny their children the necessary resources to self-advocate in an attempt to maintain control of their children; they may also actively discourage self-advocacy. For the moment, I\u2019m not concerned with them. \n I\u2019m concerned with the parents who advocate for their children because life has taught them that no one else will do so. I\u2019m concerned with the parents who have been burned by school systems, medical facilities, and governing bodies. I\u2019m concerned with the parents who know that their children\u2019s interests are threatened and who stand up to speak out against those threats. \n We will not let you advocate in the names of our children, because we don\u2019t trust you. Our ability to trust has been damaged, assaulted, and betrayed. We\u2019ve learned the hard way that \u201cthe system\u201d doesn\u2019t really protect our children\u2019s interests unless we advocate for them. We recognize that you may be well-intentioned, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you know what our children need. Furthermore, we recognize that you may not be well-intentioned; you may be self-serving and we know what serves you does not necessarily serve our children. \n If you earn our trust, then we can cooperate with you and even collaborate with you.

There are a lot of reasons why authors are particularly eager for the acceptance of the ebook. It allows them to reach out directly to their readers. As a writer, I share their enthusiasm\u2014until I have to read one. \n A friend of mine wrote a novel and published it as an ebook. I bought the ebook and began to read it, got frustrated, and then distracted. There was nothing wrong with the story. For as long as I could forget the screen, I could get into the story. Then it would be time to \u201cturn\u201d the page. It made it all-too-easy to put it down.  \n That was before my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, which means it was before I started to have to really think about what encourages my own productivity. Recently, I had two ebooks I was supposed to read for my course work. I tried and failed. I literally could not get past the first page. \n One of the reasons for my failure is that the system wasn\u2019t user friendly. The publisher who made the book available as an ebook clearly cared more about protecting copyright than they did about the readability of their ebooks. For example, I couldn\u2019t access the ebook via my Kindle. I had to zoom in to see an eighth of the page at a time to read the thin, gray text. Every time I tried to scroll to a different part of the page, it reset me to the top of the page. It was a \u201chorrid unpleasant\u201d experience. \n Another reason for my failure was that, inconvenience aside, I couldn\u2019t concentrate on the text in this format. This is kind of peculiar, because I read text online all the time. I realized, however, that my brain has different modes for reading different things. The mode for reading novels is different than the mode for reading text books. The mode for reading online is different from either of them. \n As I considered this issue in more depth, I realized that there are lots of things I have avoided reading online. If I get a short PDF, I will waste the paper and print it out. If, however, it is a lengthy blog post I\u2019m fine reading, then it\u2019s fine for me to read it online. I can read online news article just fine, but I can\u2019t get in the right reading mode to really enjoy an online short story. This has been true for a long time and it\u2019s become more pronounced since the onset of my fibromyalgia. \n I broke down and bought the text books, because I realized that was the only way I was going to get through this class. I\u2019ve realized that the mode I get into when reading course materials and fiction, while different, both involves being unaware of my surroundings and becoming immersed in the material. This is not possible when I\u2019m online, accessing the material via my computer. I assumed my discomfort would change with increased exposure, particularly on the Kindle, but I\u2019m beginning to wonder if this is just one of the quirks of being me.  \n I can\u2019t help but wonder: Is it just me? \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/09/is-it-just-me/", "title": "Is It Just Me?"},

Thursday was a much better swim day. \n Perhaps it was because he started out so much calmer. Perhaps it was because the pool was just a tad bit warmer. Perhaps it was because there were fewer people there this time. Perhaps it was just a little more familiar. \n The moment Alex got into the pool he crossed over to the other side. We were still in the shallow area, but we were on the far side, which just happened to be away from almost everyone else (at least for a while). Alex started to play in the water right away. He liked pushing the mini-surf board down in the water. It was designed for a child to lie on so his torso was supported while he paddled across the water, but Alex tried very hard to sit on it. He also played with a ball. The inside was soft sponge and the outside was coated in plastic. I suppose at one time it was waterproof. Now, the coating was cracked and punctured. So, Alex filled it up with water and then squeezed the water out, sending spouts of water over his face and into the air around him. He loved that! It also turned out to be a great alternative to pinching. \n Last time, I could barely get Alex to go out into the deep end where we could just barely touch. This time Alex not only gravitated to the deep end, but he wanted to go over the floating line to the deepest end where we couldn\u2019t touch at all. In the deep end, we worked on getting him to lie flat and he did. We worked on getting him to kick his legs and he did. We worked on getting him to float on the board and he did. Then, after much urging on his part, I took him past the rope. \n We made it out a little ways and he was swimming with the help of the board and the life preserver. He kicked his feet. He clung to the board. Then, he pushed the board away from him and sunk into the water. I grabbed his waist while he laughed and I swam one-handed back to where I could touch the bottom. We went back over the rope to where it was safe. He tried to go back out into the deepest end several times before it was time to go, but I wouldn\u2019t let him. When he got upset he squeezed the ball instead of pinching me. We stayed in the pool until the lifeguard called out the time and then we slowly, reluctantly made our way to the ladder.

I\u2019ve got about five more weeks before my body is fully healed (no more weight restrictions and no more bathing/swimming restrictions), but I suspect I\u2019ll have my energy and concentration levels back up before then. I\u2019m already feeling remarkably better consider I slept all of the first day after my surgery and most of the second. I\u2019ve even put in a few part-days of work and one full one, though only the one. With any luck today will be my second. \n Unfortunately, now that I\u2019m well-rested and on the mend, my insomnia is back, as was proven last night. I tried to sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. Then, I took melatonin and a sleeping pill and they sort of worked and sort of didn\u2019t. I\u2019m starting to think my sleep issues are going to be the most difficult to resolve. \n Before my surgery, I was beginning to sort out the difference between fibromyalgia pain and arthritis pain. Then, once the gall bladder issue started I had a new kind of pain to factor into the equation. By the time I went to the doctor it was all gall bladder pain all the time. After the surgery, my other pains were muted and I had a rather deep, cutting kind of pain to deal with, but I also had the kickass power of percoset to keep that under control.

I watched the movie and then got the books and I blew through the first two, becoming far more immersed in the stories than I should have been considering that I had a business to run and course work to do, not to mention a family to nurture. \n Then, very early in  Allegiant , what I read felt like a punch in the gut. If you want to read the book and haven\u2019t yet and don\u2019t want any spoilers, then stop reading; if, however, you also have adverse reactions to \u201ctriggers,\u201d then you might want to consider reading anyway.

There had been studies that  indicated  that violent tendencies  could be partially traced  to a person\u2019s genes\u2014a gene called \u201cthe murder gene\u201d was the first of these, but there were quite a few more, genetic  predispositions  toward cowardice, dishonesty, low intelligence\u2014 all the qualities, in other words, that ultimately contribute to a broken society . \n \u2026 \n \u2026despite the peace and prosperity that had reigned in this country for nearly a century, it seemed  advantageous  to our ancestors  to reduce the risk  of these  undesirable qualities  showing up in our population  by correcting them . In other words, by editing humanity. \n Allegiant  by Veronica Roth, pg. 121- 122, emphasis added \n I literally became sick to my stomach when I read that. The feeling persisted until the end of the book. And I was disappointed, because nobody in the book realized that the problems they were facing were an inevitable product of the original decision to mess around with humanity\u2019s genes. \n See, my problem with all of this, with the whole big mess, is that NONE of the characters react to what has been done in a way that it deserves. They react to what these scientists are doing in their own present in a variety of ways, which I sympathize with because these behaviors also deserve a strong reaction.

{"date": "June 26, 2014", "body": "\r\n When I woke up Tuesday, still in pain, I expected something\u2026but this wasn\u2019t it. Have you ever looked back on a day in your life and  known  God was there? \n It started many years ago. During the third trimester of my third pregnancy, I was plagued with \u201cfalse labor pains.\u201d This didn\u2019t seem at all extraordinary until I needed to be induced in order to deliver my son early, because he wasn\u2019t growing in the womb. I started at a zero. At the time, I didn\u2019t think much of it \u2013 being rather worried and in pain \u2013 but if I were really having \u201cfalse labor pains,\u201d then shouldn\u2019t I have been at least a little dilated? \n My \u201cfalse labor pains\u201d became extraordinary when they continued  after  my son was born and kept coming  after  my uterus had resumed its normal, contracted position. It was during a severe, three-day bout of this inexplicable pain that my mother took me to the doctor. He tried to dismiss it as a \u201cback strain\u201d due to a recent pregnancy (or three) and my excessive weight. I was curled in on myself, assuming as close to a fetal position as could be obtained in a hard plastic chair, so I was not able to advocate for myself at the time. My mother, not so encumbered, pointed at me and screeched, \u201cShe\u2019s  crying . She  never  cries. You\u2019re going to  do something !\u201d \n So, I was sent down for an X-ray. I tried to lay myself flat for the X-ray, but couldn\u2019t quite do it. The technician just shook his head and said, \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be here. She should be in ultrasound. It\u2019s her gall bladder, not her back.\u201d Turns out he was right. I was given a prescription for oxycodone and a referral to a surgeon. The surgeon explained that I would have a six-week recovery after the surgery during which I could lift no more than 15 lbs. and that I was not to allow any little person climb or lay on my abdomen. That nixed that, and so I stuck to homeopathic treatments (sarsaparilla), recommended by an Internet friend who lived in India, and I was \u201cfine\u201d for years. There were occasional bouts of pain, when stones passed, but the duration was short and the treatments helped. It was manageable. \n All of that change last Friday night. A \u201cgall bladder attack\u201d started and it seemed like normal, except that it continued on into Saturday, and then into Sunday. On and off, it continued through Monday. Except, it wasn\u2019t just continuing, the pain was getting worse in little leaps. Tuesday morning, I\u2019d had enough. Things were different now. I expected to go into the doctor, get my prescription for pain medication, get my referral, and schedule surgery for some time later in the week or maybe next week. But that\u2019s not what happened. \n I was going to get some sleep, if I could, and call that afternoon, but I couldn\u2019t sleep and I felt a strong  need  to call right away. I called for my appointment and discovered that my doctor was only in the office during the mornings today (Tuesday). He could see me at 9:45, but he would have been gone if I\u2019d waited. So, I got myself ready and arrived early for my appointment. \n I explained what I\u2019d been experiencing to the nurse and then again to the doctor. This facility uses a 0 \u2013 10 pain scale, complete with happy faces and very unhappy faces. To put this in perspective, giving birth usually comes out at an 8 for me, which is fine considering that I get a baby out of the deal. Untreated fibromyalgia, at its worst, is a solid 7; with treatment, it\u2019s a manageable 5 to 6. My broken wrist was my only 9. My previous \u201cgall bladder attacks,\u201d as I called them, were solid 8s \u2013 with no baby as a reward. This doctor was the same doctor I\u2019d been seeing since shortly after Ben was born. He\u2019s a good doctor who listens and cares and responds with as little prescribed medication as possible, which is something both Mark and I appreciate. He knew me and knew that I wasn\u2019t prone to exaggeration (at least not during medical appointments) and he knew I would avoid narcotics whenever possible. So, when I told him that my pain was at a 9, he took me seriously. \n He had me lay down and he probed my stomach. He stood back a little and had me sit up. He watched while I did so. He looked at me thoughtfully and he responded honestly. He told me that my responses didn\u2019t correspond with a \u201cgall bladder attack,\u201d i.e. it didn\u2019t seem to him like I was passing stones. He also said, almost to himself, \u201cthe disease doesn\u2019t follow the book.\u201d He wrote down on a piece of scratch paper some OTCs (over the counter medications) and handed it to me. \u201cThis is what I would give you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a 9. You say it\u2019s a 9?\u201d Then, again to himself, \u201cMust have a high pain tolerance or there would be more reaction.\u201d \n While he ruminated over what to do, I thought to myself,  Well, I didn\u2019t think screaming when you pressed down would help matters any.  I was no longer the young woman who would curl up into a ball in a plastic chair and let my mother handle things. I was my own woman; so yeah, call it high pain tolerance or, better yet, self-control. It didn\u2019t mean the pain wasn\u2019t a 9. \n This doctor knew me and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t just go to the emergency room. He  knew  something must be wrong, even if he didn\u2019t know right away what it might be. So, he sent me to the hospital to get a CAT scan, with the understanding that the OTCs would hold  if  they didn\u2019t find anything. The plan, as far as I knew, was for me to get the CAT scan and to go home and wait for his call.

I went through the usual questions and then yet another lady led me to Radiology. \n The radiologist receptionist (one out of three) took my name, I sat down, and then I was handed a bottle of clear liquid that I was told to drink. It was ionic contrast for the CAT scan. I drank it and then had to wait 30 minutes. After fifteen minutes, I asked if I could use the bathroom. The receptionist said, \u201cSure!\u201d and told me where to go. I went, came back, and five minutes later a technician walked up to me and said she was taking me down to labs. I needed to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test. I said, \u201cI wish somebody would have told me that! I just went.\u201d Long story short, I tried, I failed, I walked back to Radiology, I was told I\u2019d failed, I was handed a bottle of water, I was led back to the Out Patient Surgery Lab, I succeeded, I walked back to Radiology where I waited to be told definitively that I was not pregnant. \n Keep in mind that during this whole ordeal I am at a 9 out of 10 on the pain scale. I have a very unhappy face, though I\u2019m bearing it as well as I can. I keep quiet most of the time, but let out an occasional whimper that I just can\u2019t hold back. I\u2019m getting paler and sweatier and more dazed as the moments pass. And nobody but the other patients seems to notice. \n Finally, I get to take the CAT scan. I lay down on this long, thin \u201cbed\u201d with a cushion under my knees and my arms up over my head. The tech puts in an IV so she can inject more contrast into my veins. I hold as still as I can for the scan, which turns out to be still enough. The tech warns me, and she\u2019s right; the contrast feels like warm lead in my veins and makes me feel like I\u2019m urinating with an infection. Afterwards, she tells me that she\u2019s going to leave the IV in, \u201cjust in case,\u201d and that I\u2019m to wait in the waiting room for the results. \n So, I end up back in the Radiology waiting area, but I can\u2019t sit and wait any longer. I ask if I could have a pager and go walk the grounds. I get the pager, I head off the property, smoke two cigarettes, come back in, go to the bathroom again, and head back to Radiology. The receptionist is on the phone, waving me over, and I point innocently to myself, and she nods fiercely. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get my page,\u201d she hisses as she hands me the phone. I shake my head and she says, \u201cI paged you twice!\u201d I say, \u201cHello?\u201d into the receiver. A quick glance to the clock tells me I was gone less than fifteen minutes. \n It\u2019s my doctor\u2019s nurse on the phone. She tells me that it is in fact my gall bladder, that it\u2019s very inflamed, that I\u2019m to go to such-and-such a building, and that somebody there would show me the way. Looking back on this moment, I could have been freaking out. I could have been extremely anxious and panicky. Instead, I was perfectly calm, if a bit dazed. I follow where I\u2019m led, asking few questions. I chat about the wonder of having a skywalk in Janesville. The little hospital was growing up so it was almost like the Children\u2019s Hospital in Madison. \n I\u2019m registered at the new office. I hand over my co-pay. Nobody really told me why I was here and I didn\u2019t really ask. I waited, still very much in pain, for what seemed like a long time. I remember that I was told quite specifically not to eat or drink anything. I think to myself that they already made me drink two whole bottles of liquid. I get caught up in random snatches of music. The time passes without much thought. I\u2019m called into the doctor\u2019s office. \n The young lady that calls me back is a doctor\u2019s assistant, or something. She asks questions, she probes my abdomen, and I react a bit more strongly this time, loss of self-control. She explains that my gall bladder is inflamed and probably infected. I\u2019ll need surgery today or tomorrow, but it\u2019s not her call. I might even have to stay overnight. She talks about the risks and the reasons. I nod a lot, I speak a little. She tells me that the doctor is in surgery and that it\u2019s his call and that she doesn\u2019t work with him as much so she\u2019s sorry if it\u2019s not exactly what he tells me. Then, she leaves and I wait some more. The nurse will be in with me shortly. Someone pops her head in and asks about my insurance. I tell her. Then I wait for a while longer. I start getting up. I want to walk around. Sitting hurts more than walking. As I start to walk out, someone comes up to my door and tells me that I need to go back to the front desk of the hospital. She doesn\u2019t tell me why and I don\u2019t ask, though she does say something about, \u201cThey\u2019ll probably want some labs.\u201d \n I decide to go outside and walk to the hospital that way, so I can have a cigarette. I smoke one and that gets me to the place I need to turn. I consider having another, but think that they might be missing me, so I go in. I tell the receptionist, \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d It only takes them a moment to figure out who I am and where I need to go. It\u2019s not even in the computer yet \u2013 she wrote it down on a piece of scratch paper. She leaves her post to the other lady and leads me back herself. I follow without question. \n Looking back, it seems that I must have been in shock or something. I was so dazed and so confused. Yet, at the time I was perfectly calm, perfectly at peace. I find myself back in the Out Patient Surgery Lab area, but instead of sending me to the waiting area, she leads me deep into the warren of little rooms. She consults her piece of paper, and then says, \u201cHere you go.\u201d All I could think to ask was, \u201cI get a room now?\u201d And she says, \u201cYes, they\u2019ll take good care of you here.\u201d \n There\u2019re a lot of ins and outs now. Things move more quickly. A registrar comes in to verify my information and give me a new wrist band. She snips off the one Radiology gave me and sets that aside like a souvenir. Another lady comes in for my vitals. I\u2019m told to get in the gown, but not to put my arms in the sleeves of the robe. I do, and then I call Mark. I tell him I have a room now, but that I still don\u2019t know when I\u2019m having surgery. He takes it fairly well, but he\u2019s clearly much more worried about this than I am. A lady comes in to take my blood, so I offer her the IV. She says she can\u2019t use that. While she\u2019s still there, another lady comes in to do an EKG. They work around each other. I almost feel like I\u2019m there. When they\u2019re done, I try to call my mom. I get her machine. I leave a message, though I have no idea what I said. All I know is that, whether I have surgery today or not, I\u2019m no longer safe to drive. The pain feels far away now, but they haven\u2019t given me anything. \n Somebody comes in for me and asks how I\u2019m doing. I say, \u201cNot well.\u201d And she says, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t look very well, but we\u2019re going to help with that.\u201d She wheels me back to Radiology. This time I get a chest X-ray. I tell them I\u2019ve already been tested and I\u2019m not pregnant. She says, \u201cI\u2019m sure that hasn\u2019t changed since this morning.\u201d The X-ray technician asks why I\u2019m there and I tell him, quite honestly, that I don\u2019t know, that I\u2019m just doing what they tell me. \n He apologizes profusely and tells me that I\u2019m probably having surgery, \u201cDoes that sound right?\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I think the tech must have reported this \u201cconversation,\u201d because people seem much more aware of just how dazed I am at this point. As I\u2019m coming back, someone from somewhere calls out, \u201cCall your mom!\u201d Before I can do that somebody explains roughly what\u2019s been going on and that I should be ready to go home around 5pm. So I call my mom. We talk. She seems so very worried and it\u2019s very upsetting. She asks me questions that I don\u2019t know how to answer. She\u2019ll be there to pick me up around 5pm, she tells me, and she apologizes for not being there sooner. That seems silly at the time. \n The surgeon comes in \u2013 it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him \u2013 he explains that my gall bladder is inflamed and that it\u2019s probably infected. He strongly recommends surgery today and that there are risks involved \u2013 he explains them. \u201cDo you understand? Do you give your consent for this surgery?\u201d \u201cOh yes,\u201d I say, \u201cthat much I get. It\u2019s just nobody\u2019s told me when it\u2019s happening or what all this other stuff is for.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s happening now,\u201d and he turns and points to the bed they\u2019re getting ready for me. \u201cOh.\u201d \n The anesthesiologist comes in and explains her role. I have to give informed consent to both of them and sign their forms, which I do. By now it\u2019s really sinking in that I\u2019m having surgery, but I\u2019m still perfectly calm. Then, they get me up and on the bed and I\u2019m still conscious as I\u2019m rolled into the surgery room. I see the surgical instruments and wonder to myself why I\u2019m not freaking out, but I\u2019m still perfectly calm. The anesthesiologist tsks over my IV, but uses it to give me the medicine that puts me out. The last thing I remember is her saying, \u201cI\u2019ll put in a proper one once she\u2019s out.\u201d I try to defend the Radiology technician, but I don\u2019t think the words ever come. \n I wake up and there\u2019s my mom, worried and waiting. It\u2019s not until I\u2019ve slept more thoroughly than I have in years that it occurs to me why. Looking back on everything that happened that day, from the initial impulse to go to the doctor to my circuitous route to emergency surgery, it occurs to me that I was probably in a lot more danger then I ever realized. \n Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. \n ~Psalm 23:4 \n I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever quite grasped the meaning of that passage before now. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/06/not-what-i-expected-part-2/", "title": "Not What I Expected \u2013 Part 2"},
{"date": "June 20, 2014", "body": "\r\n I have this goal that somehow, someday I will be able to go to bed at night, sleep through the night, and stay awake through the day. In other words, I want a normal sleep experience. I want to have this normal sleep experience consistently. This may or may not involve an occasional nap, but that\u2019s okay. \n This is a dream that seems far from my reality. My sleep schedule is no longer a schedule. I can get four hours of sleep at a time, sometimes up to six, but that can happen at any time. I can force myself to be awake at a certain time, but the effect is only temporary. My sleep schedule rotates from being awake during the night to being awake during the day, with about two complete shifts per week. I rotate from a 18 hour day to a 36 hour day (in contrast to a 24 hour day), but those are just rough estimates. The point is that my sleep \u201cschedule\u201d is definitely not healthy. \n So, I had a sleep study to start the healing process. That happened Tuesday night. I arrived around 9 pm. I was brought into a room that resembled a hotel room, complete with a bed, two night stands, a bathroom, and a television. I watched a video that explained the sleep study process and what they might discover about my sleep. After that was done, I got into my jammies. \n Then, the technician wired me. It was similar to the boys\u2019 EEGs, but different, too. The technician told me that most sleep technicians were actually EEG technicians. There were wires for my head, my face, and my legs. There were straps with wires across my chest and my abdomen. These wires were tucked in a \u201cponytail\u201d and clipped to one of my straps. While they were uncomfortable, they felt psychologically restraining. \n The sleep technician went off to her other patient and I filled out the paper work I was supposed to have completed before I arrived, as well as the few forms that I got from the technician. I finished shortly before the technician returned to plug me in so I could go to bed. I was definitely drowsy. A few more wires were added, including a bandage-like one for my finger, which would measure my blood oxygen levels. \n It was all pretty painless. Then, I went to bed on the adjustable bed. I made it a soft (but not too soft) number 50. The pillows were thinner than I usually prefer. The technician became a disembodied voice over a speaker. She ran me through a few maneuvers \u2013 breathing, wiggling one leg, then the other, looking (with just my eyes) up, down, and to each side. Then, I was allowed to roll onto my side, using one of the pillows to help support my upper leg, and go to sleep. Sometime during the night, the disembodied voice told me to sleep on my back, so I did. Then, I fell asleep again and had a weird dream about being strapped and wired with a disembodied voice giving me commands. It wasn\u2019t frightening, but it was a sci-fi version of the real experience I was having and it was a bit disturbing. \n I woke up around 4 am and had to go to the bathroom. It\u2019s a good thing it wasn\u2019t urgent, because she had to come in and unplug me before I could go, which was different from our EEG experience. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep again, which is usually true. She needed me to lie down for another hour, even if I didn\u2019t sleep. So, I did, though I didn\u2019t want to. I was restless and awake and annoyed for some time, and then I heard the disembodied voice telling me it was time to wake up. Somewhere in between those two events I fell asleep, though it didn\u2019t feel like I had. It seemed like I was conscious of the time between, but maybe I wasn\u2019t. I wondered what level of sleep I\u2019d reached in the duration, but I didn\u2019t ask. She unplugged me, unwired me, asked me a few questions, gave me a few instructions, and I got dressed.  \n I slept through the night and I felt better rested than I usually do. I wasn\u2019t as sore as I usually am in the morning, but I don\u2019t know if it was because I didn\u2019t toss and turn as much (because I was conscious of being wired, even in my dreams) or if it was because I\u2019d made the bed much softer than my own. I was able to drive to the convenience store and then to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and then home without a problem, even though I hadn\u2019t had my morning medicine. I took that when I got home and tried to get back into my routines. It was difficult, because everything was different. It was disorienting. But I\u2019d slept. Hopefully it provided the doctor with the information he needs to help do it more often. We\u2019ll see. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/06/sleeping-through-the-night/", "title": "Sleeping Through the Night"},
{"date": "July 21, 2014", "body": "\r\n First of all, I am myopic\u2014in the medical sense of the word. Myopia really refers to nearsightedness and I\u2019m nearsighted. I\u2019m also farsighted, but that\u2019s another story and another eye.  Myopia  has  come to mean  lack of foresight, obtuse; narrow-mindedness, intolerance. This is similar to how  idiot  used to refer to people who had an intellectual disability and is now used in a derogatory way to suggest that a person without an intellectual disability is foolish, senseless, and does things without thinking\u2014which, if you\u2019ve ever met people with intellectual disabilities, doesn\u2019t often correlate to them at all. \n Anyway, in common usage, I\u2019ve come to hear  myopic  and  myopia  to refer to someone who is overly focused on one thing at the exclusion of other things, like the way a person with myopic vision (without glasses) will hold a book right up to their nose to read it, and will therefore not see what else is going on in the room. This is the sense that I\u2019m using the word, and I feel wholly comfortable using it in that sense, because I\u2019ve been both the person who is literally myopic and figuratively myopic, especially lately. \n Most of my posts have been about me, my health, and my children, at the exclusion of everything else that has been going on.

The father holds the baby. They laugh, they cry, they rejoice together. Their love has made another life. This is  their  baby. \n This is a common enough scene and a common enough sentiment. I know I\u2019m fiercely territorial when it comes to my children. You try to hurt them and you discover that this mama bear\u2019s got claws and teeth. I\u2019ll shred you to bits if I have to in order to protect my children. \n There\u2019s a difference between these two sentiments. It\u2019s subtle, but important. It\u2019s one not enough parents seem to make. \n A  territorial  parent will: \n \n Protect their children, \n Nurture their children, \n Provide for their children, and \n Make a home for their children. \n \n Some of us go to extreme lengths to achieve these goals. We seek to guide our children and imbue them with the morals and values we believe in. We shape and mold our children, like clay, into the adults we\u2019d like them to become. \n A  possessive  parent will: \n \n Protect their interests in their children, \n Develop their interests within their children, \n Provide their children with the things they wanted as children, and \n Make a life for their children. \n \n These parents may go to extreme lengths to make their children into the people they\u2019d like them to be, and that\u2019s often people like themselves. They seek to order their children\u2019s lives and imprint them with the morals and values they believe in. They shape and chisel away at their children, like stone, to shape them into the adults they\u2019d like them to become. \n Children are not property. They aren\u2019t possessions. They are human beings. They are individual, little people who grow into individual, big people. They have thoughts, feelings, and dreams that are all their own. Someday they will have the power to leave you. When that day comes the only reasons they have to stay in your life is because: 1) they love you, 2) they respect you, or 3) they\u2019re too afraid to do without you. \n Personally, I\u2019d rather be loved, though I hope to be respected as well. I have no desire to be feared\u2014by anyone, least of all my own children. \n I\u2019m a territorial parent. I\u2019m active in my children\u2019s lives and I feel a welcome obligation to be present, both for their sakes and for society\u2019s sake. But I am not a possessive parent. As much as I say they\u2019re  my  children, I do not consider them property. I do not own my children. They are my own, but I do not own them. The difference is subtle, yet important. \n I look around and I see possessive parents, parents who are trying desperately hard to make their children into mini versions of themselves or to shape them into who they wanted to be but couldn\u2019t be. You see this in upper class parents who demand their children live up to the family name. You see this in aspirational parents who demand their children be all they can be. You see this in impoverished parents who tell their kids to be realistic if they say they want to be doctors or presidents. You see this in gang families that expect their kids to get into the biz. You see this in sexually-abused single mothers who allow their young daughters to be sexually abused, too. You see this in families who take desperate measures to convince their self-announced gay child to be \u201cstraight.\u201d And you see this in families where typically-developing parents take desperate measures to force their atypically-developing child to be \u201cnormal.\u201d \n History is on their side. It\u2019s only relatively recently that children were recognized as people having rights and those rights aren\u2019t fully developed yet. We still talk about \u201cTiger Moms\u201d and wonder if it\u2019s a good thing. There\u2019s debate and discussion. It\u2019s not clear to many how these behaviors show that the parent is dictating to the child who the child should be\u2014not what, as in a doctor or a lawyer, but  who . \n Our children are people.

They\u2019re fifteen months old and their adventures made it perfectly clear that our house was no longer baby-proof. \n Over ten years ago, I went on a journey of discovery. I found Birth to Three, I found a doctor to diagnose first one son, then another. I navigated IFSPs and IEPs. I wrangled with diagnoses, labels, and services. And now I see this friend beginning a similar journey. \n She knows she\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d and she has received diagnoses of disabilities for herself. Now, she\u2019s seeing herself repeated in her daughter and she\u2019s seeing other traits that are duplicated but different in her son.

{"date": "July 25, 2014", "body": "\r\n Assuming our children are verbal, we expect them to answer when we talk to them. We expect them to listen, to answer our questions, and to tell us the truth. We learn, over time, that our kids will lie upon occasion. We try to teach them the importance of honesty, of authority, of coming to us when they\u2019re in trouble. Rarely, it seems, do parents stop to wonder whether they\u2019re worthy of what they demand of their kids. \n From the beginning, I was reluctant to teach my kids to believe in Santa Claus. I still remember learning the truth of that. I didn\u2019t learn the truth about Saint Nicholas. I learned that Santa Claus was a lie that adults told to little children. I learned that the letters, the news broadcasts, and the presents were all lies. I\u2019d already figured out that the guy at the mall couldn\u2019t be the  real  Santa Claus. But to find out there was no such thing\u2026 \n As I child, I believed in fantasy. I thought, maybe someday, maybe if I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019d get swept away into Narnia. Or maybe I\u2019d discover my own magic world\u2014there are lots of them\u2014and I\u2019d get to go there. Maybe I\u2019d get to go any time I wanted to. Life was rough and I clung to this fantasy longer than most kids. I read  A Wrinkle in Time  and the books that came after it, and I thought that maybe if I had my own magical, transformative experience I\u2019d turn out alright, too. \n When bad things happened to me when I was a child, I didn\u2019t tell my parents. I didn\u2019t tell them, because I didn\u2019t trust them. Would they blame me for what happened? I got blamed for things that weren\u2019t my fault all the time. Would they believe me? They didn\u2019t always. Would they be honest with me about the consequences? Would I ever really know what would happen next? I didn\u2019t know what to do, but I didn\u2019t know what they would do either. How would they react? What would happen to me? I didn\u2019t trust them. So, I didn\u2019t tell them, even when I needed them. \n I wasn\u2019t completely alone. I didn\u2019t keep everything to myself. But I didn\u2019t tell any adults either. I told other children and we coped with each other\u2019s problems, helping each other as best we could. I remember what that was like. I remember what had happened to me and how I dealt with it. The truth is that the events of my childhood almost destroyed me. Not only did I get myself in situations where I could have been killed and in situations where other people wanted to kill to protect me, but I nearly killed myself. I seriously considered it. And the only reason I didn\u2019t is because I knew two people in my life would miss me too much if I did. Neither of them were my parents. \n I remembered these events and I decided to tell my children the truth. I told them that Santa Claus was for pretend and that it was alright to pretend. I made it perfectly clear that it was perfectly okay with me if they wanted to believe in Santa Claus, but that they didn\u2019t have to. I taught them the difference between what\u2019s real (like a brother) and what\u2019s pretend (like a story or a toy). I told them that they could play pretend, but that it was just pretend. My children\u2014autistic though they were, disillusioned though I was\u2014learned to play pretend just fine. They didn\u2019t lose any of the magic of their childhood. But they knew the truth. And they knew I would tell them the truth if they asked me. \n Being trustworthy isn\u2019t easy. We\u2019re socialized to shade the truth. We\u2019re indoctrinated with the \u201cgoodness\u201d of white lies. We\u2019re taught to fudge the details, to shape arguments to our advantage, to shape opinions to be like our own. We\u2019re taught that charisma and glamor are qualities to have and to believe in, to follow. And then we have to break down these socialized tendencies and tell the truth, even when it\u2019s hard, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable or unpleasant or even \u201cunnecessary.\u201d \n It\u2019s not that my children don\u2019t lie to me. Each of my children who know how to talk has learned how to lie, whether they lie well or poorly. And they do lie. But, when it really matters, when it\u2019s really important, they know they can tell the truth, no matter how hard it is, and they know they\u2019ll get my help and that they\u2019ll have input on what kind of help they get. In other words, my children know they can trust me\u2014even the teenagers\u2014because they know I\u2019m worthy of their trust. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/07/the-importance-of-being-a-trustworthy-parent/", "title": "The Importance of Being a Trustworthy Parent"},
{"date": "July 18, 2014", "body": "\r\n As the boys grow older, there are some things that are hard to ignore. Their bodies are maturing and we need to help them understand that. They\u2019re heading for major life transitions and we need to develop a plan for what their lives will look like after school. There are choices to make, services to acquire, and things to set in motion. \n These things are difficult in the sense that they consume time and energy. They need to be planned and those plans need to be led, not by Mark or me, but by our children who will be living those plans\u2014for better or worse. These things are easy in the sense that there are choices, paths, and opportunities. We can do something about these things. \n Sometimes thoughts sneak up on me that I did not expect. Earlier this week, as I was talking with our friend about her young children, it occurred to me that we might someday have a similar discussion about our children\u2019s children. If scientists are to be believed, the human race\u2014like every other species on earth\u2014has a natural impetus to reproduce. The mating process encourages survival of the fittest. If all that is true, then there seems to be a lot of unanswered questions, like how \u201cfitness\u201d is decided and why social structures perpetuate qualities that do not seem to be in the best interest of the species. \n Personally, I believe man-made science seeks to explain what God already understands, because God created a system that truly works. I know, despite our best efforts, we\u2019ll never completely understand how the universe works, because we have finite minds and a system like the universe works on levels far beyond what we can grasp. As an example, what are the full implications of light that can act as both a particle and a wave? Why must light be both a particle and a wave to serve its purpose? \n Whether or not my children have children of their own isn\u2019t going to be determined by science or who is fittest, but by the choices they make and what God wills for them. That\u2019s what I believe. Yet I think there\u2019s something to that natural impetus. I\u2019m too young for grandchildren, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t want my children to be able to have children of their own. I think that should be between them and whoever they might conceive the child with. It\u2019s not up to me, nor should it be. It\u2019s not up to the government, nor should it be. It\u2019s not up to society or any self-entitled group or person. \n Unfortunately, human society has produced numerous people and groups that believe they should have the power to make those kinds of decisions. This results in dramatic, world-changing affairs like the Holocaust and the other genocides that have been committed in the name of various forms of purity\u2014as if any kind of purity could be acquired by drenching the earth in human blood. This also results in less dramatic, but equally evil affairs like forced sterilization and denial of reproductive rights. \n I can influence many things about my children\u2019s future. I can fight with every ounce of my being that eugenics does not prevail. Yet I know that this silent, hidden enemy is alive and well and plays a very current, if less dramatic role, in contemporary society. I don\u2019t want to look into the future and see this possibility, but denial doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/07/a-look-forward/", "title": "A Look Forward"},

{"date": "July 28, 2014", "body": "\r\n From the outside looking in, perseveration can look upsetting. Imagine Alex, a fourteen year old boy, waking himself up at 5 in the morning so he can get the first crack at the computer. For two or three hours\u2014however long it takes for someone else to wake up and take a turn\u2014he\u2019ll sit, stand, bounce, and jump in front of the computer to the sound of the VeggieTales theme song. The clip lasts from one to three minutes, depending on the version he finds on YouTube, and he watches it over and over and over again. Occasionally, he\u2019ll move to different versions of it. Sometimes he\u2019ll even move on to different songs, like \u201cThe Hairbrush Song.\u201d Rarely, he\u2019ll watch a whole episode. \n Alex \u201cstims\u201d on VeggieTales. \u201cStim\u201d refers to self-stimulation, which is an outside-looking-in coinage of autistic behavior. Basically, the implication is that the person is providing him or herself with stimulation, and that this is somehow unusual. \n Think about that for a moment. When I was growing up, all the parents\u2014not just mine\u2014were always encouraging us kids to \u201camuse ourselves.\u201d You\u2019d hear parents of typically developing children encourage the same thing now, except that it\u2019s so much easier to do when we provide our kids with technological devices like Wiis and smartphones, so \u201camuse yourself\u201d barely takes any encouragement at all. Instead, we hear parents complain that their children are  too connected . \n Therefore, one must conclude that self-stimulation isn\u2019t the problem. This leads to the obvious assumption that the unusual nature of autistic self-stimulation is the perceived problem and that, because it\u2019s unusual, it is somehow damaging or destructive. \n So, let\u2019s go back to Alex. If you interrupt him before he gets it all out of his system, he gets upset. When upset, he may bite his wrist. He may pinch others. He may pull at others, especially the person who displaces him in front of the computer. The problem here isn\u2019t that his self-stimulation is atypical, nor even that he\u2019s compulsive about it. The problem is his inability to cope constructively with being upset. \n The thing that gets me is that it\u2019s  supposed to be   self -stimulation. We all do it. It\u2019s a normal behavior. But since autistic people aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d people, the way they choose to stimulate themselves isn\u2019t \u201cnormal,\u201d either. And the point is\u2026? They\u2019re not trying to stimulate \u201cnormal\u201d people, they\u2019re trying to stimulate themselves, so why not just let them get on with it? \n Let\u2019s do some contrast. Mark is a compulsive Facebook user. He\u2019s in groups. He even started his own group. He plays games. He chats with friends and strangers alike. He\u2019s more social on Facebook than he is in \u201creal\u201d life. And, from the people I\u2019ve seen out in the \u201creal\u201d world, these are perfectly normal behaviors. But they\u2019re not behaviors I do, nor am I particularly empathetic to Mark\u2019s compulsivity with Facebook. I just don\u2019t get the attraction. \n On the other hand, I like to watch television shows and movies on my computer. I\u2019ll start and stop them in between doing my work. I\u2019ll compulsively run through an entire television series in a matter of weeks, depending on how long the show lasted. Considering that Netflix and Hulu thrive on this trend, I know I\u2019m not alone. It\u2019s a perfectly normal compulsion. But they\u2019re not Mark\u2019s behaviors, nor is he particularly empathetic to my compulsivity with Netflix. He just doesn\u2019t get the attraction. \n We don\u2019t get the attraction for Alex, either. But it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a \u201clive and let live\u201d thing.

For some, worries revolve around the violence and crime that permeates our world. For no reason, for no reason at all, a car could slam into a child and take that child from this world. Does it really matter if the road was slippery due to rain or snow? Does it really matter if the driver was tired or drunk? Does it really matter if the driver was in a get-away-car or going for a joy ride? What matters is that the child is gone and there\u2019s no reason for it. \n For some, worries revolve around society and the judgments society makes about individuals. For no reason, for no reason at all, a child can be harassed or bullied or killed. Does it really matter if the child is gay or straight? Does it matter if the child is typically developing or developmentally delayed? Does it matter if the child is autistic or crippled or seemingly normal? Does it matter if the child is black or white? What matters is that the child is hurt, scarred, or gone and there\u2019s no reason for it. \n For some, worries revolve around the child. For no reason, for no reason at all, a child can be sick or dying. Does it really matter if it\u2019s leukemia or AIDS? Does it really matter if it\u2019s epilepsy or traumatic brain injury? Does it matter if the disease is rare or common? Does it matter if it\u2019s acquired or if the child was simply born that way? Does it matter if the life expectancy is a month or a year? What matters is that a child is hurting, growing weaker, slipping away, and then gone and there\u2019s no reason for it. \n I look out into the world and sometimes what I see terrifies me.

There\u2019s enough pain and suffering in this world that we can do absolutely nothing about! Why in the world would anyone want to bring more pain and suffering onto others by committing crimes, acts of violence, or acts of negligence? \n I realize, logically, that these people aren\u2019t thinking about other people. The man who drinks himself stupid and then gets behind the wheel isn\u2019t thinking about the people he might hit along the way.

{"date": "August 18, 2014", "body": "\r\n I can\u2019t remember for sure, but I think my initial reaction to the buzz about Veronica Roth\u2019s  Divergent  was, \u201cNot another dystopian novel!\u201d I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the hype; then again, I rarely ever do. Besides, I rarely have the time to devote to leisure reading, so I tend to stick to books that I know I\u2019ll like\u2014it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t enough of those to keep me entertained for the next few decades. \n At some point, I caught on to the premise of the story. Tris, the main character, is  different  in a world (or what\u2019s left of it) that considers difference a bad thing. Sounds familiar, doesn\u2019t it? Except, this story is set in the remnants of Chicago after a cataclysmic war. If you know anything about contemporary Chicago, then you know its population is full of diversity and probably couldn\u2019t get over being different in any foreseeable future, no matter how devastated that future might be. If the movie is any indication, then this attribute of Chicago is at least partially recognized in Roth\u2019s vision because the movie shows at least some of the racial differences that can be seen in contemporary Chicago. The cultural differences, however, have been sacrificed for the sake of survival. In their place, new differences have emerged, dependent solely on the dominant nature of the individuals: intellectuals, self-sacrificing servants, compassionate agriculturalists, honest judges, and courageous warriors. \n Based on the movie (I still haven\u2019t gotten a chance to read the book), I\u2019d have to say that I fit most closely with the Erudite or intellectuals. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m power-hungry, as they prove to be in the movies, but because, especially through my young adulthood, I have usually valued my intellect the most. I can be selfless, I can be brave, I can be kind, and I can be honest. In fact, I try to be all of those things most of the time. But if I had to choose just one, then I would go with intelligence, because I like to solve problems by thinking them through. \n Based on the issue of conformity, rather my lack thereof, I would be divergent as it\u2019s described in the movie. Then again, so would most of the people I know. Whether that\u2019s a reflection of the people I know or whether it\u2019s a reflection of the impracticality of the faction ideal, I don\u2019t know. Still, the idea that nonconformists are perceived by those that hold down the status quo is very familiar. \n The world is full of people in the here and now that view difference, divergence, and non-conformity as threats to their way of life, even when the people who are different, divergent, and non-conforming don\u2019t actually have anything to do with their life.  That  is very true to human nature and that fear is the source of the most violent, dangerous aspects of human nature. Ironically, it\u2019s also those parts of human nature that Erudite Jeanine embraced\u2014that and the desire for power. \n Giving the selfless the responsibility to govern and administer was a wise allocation of human resources, if a rather futile one. The people who want power the least are those who are going to treat it most responsibly, but they are also the least likely to hold onto it. This is why, despite our best efforts and our best claims about public service, we haven\u2019t been able to create a government or nonprofit sector that consistently serves and protects the interests of all of the people. Unfortunately, these sectors tend to fail the people who are in the most danger the most frequently, because they are inevitably those with the least power. \n In the movie, the solution is for a few brave souls to stand up, challenge the power-hungry destroyers, and save the day. In reality, it\u2019s rarely so simple. Government bends in the face of power, especially the power of the most powerful of its own people. The least powerful are in the most danger, precisely because they lack the power to make the government bend towards them. In a democratic state, the only defense we have is to stand together; weaving what power we have into a stronger tapestry than any of us can make for ourselves. By working together and fighting for and with each other, we show those in power that we have enough power that we\u2019re worth bending towards. This isn\u2019t accomplished by separating into factions, but by uniting under a banner of freedom and equality, regardless of the differences that make us \u201cdivergent.\u201d Therein lies our power. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/08/a-divergent-review/", "title": "A "},

I\u2019m talking about the behavioral instincts that are surfacing. \n Don\u2019t get me wrong. Willy\u2019s always been competitive. In the past, however, Willy\u2019s competitiveness has always come across as an aspect of how he feels about himself: He took the words \u201cwinner\u201d and \u201closer\u201d far too seriously and would do almost anything to be recognized as the \u201cwinner.\u201d Over time, we were able to address the root problem and teach him better gamesmanship. Still, there was always a part of Willy that sought out external validation. \n Recently, I\u2019ve been witnessing something entirely different. Just short of beating his chest like a gorilla, Willy has been exhibiting very masculine behaviors. I\u2019m talking about the I\u2019m-going-to-keep-pushing-until-I-impress-the-girl kind of behaviors. The only problem is that I\u2019m the only girl here and that Alex and Ben are (usually) not seen as the primary threats. So, yeah, things are getting uncomfortably Freudian. \n Last week, after Will kept pushing over something really stupid while Mark was actually trying to teach him something, i.e. not trying to engage in one-upmanship, I just had enough. Without going into anything Freudian (though Mark just had to bring it up), I explained to Willy what he was doing, why he was doing, and why I was definitely not the right person to impress. Then, I explained to him as best as I could that, despite the very male instinct he was displaying, these behaviors rarely really worked. \n Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I have never changed my opinion about a guy one iota (at least, not in a positive direction) because he won some sort of machismo contest with another guy. Who can dunk a better basket? I don\u2019t really care, but if I had to guess I\u2019d say Michael Jordan. Who can arm wrestle best? I\u2019d guess the Hulk. Not the Hogan guy, either. I\u2019m going with the green one. Who can beat the video game faster? Um. I\u2019d guess the guys who designed it. \n \u201cNo, no,\u201d they\u2019d tell me, \u201cbetween us!\u201d \n I never got the point of these episodes until I got to college. It\u2019s not that college boys made this any clearer; it\u2019s just that I studied more human behavior in college. I remember raising my hand\u2014I don\u2019t know if it was my first psych class or the class on human sexuality\u2014and asked, \u201cDoes this ever really work?\u201d The professor (who was a guy) smiled, shook his head, and said, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t keep us from trying.\u201d He went on to explain that it was genetically coded precisely because there was (must have been?) a time in human history or human evolution when it really did work. \n I understand that, from the points of view of anthropologists and evolutionists, this \u201cmust\u201d be the case, but I have to wonder if it isn\u2019t just as plausible that human psychology was just as messed up back then as it is now. Guys did it because they thought it worked, just like guys still do it because, on some level, they\u2019re sure it will. \n Now that it\u2019s my own son it\u2019s ceased to be the least bit amusing. And I do NOT want to hear about Freud! After all, the dude thought young women \u201cfantasied\u201d about their fathers molesting them, because he couldn\u2019t acknowledge that the fathers of respectable families could really be sexually abusing their daughters.

{"date": "June 2, 2014", "body": "\r\n I\u00a0am a planner at heart. I like to look into the possible futures and map out a plan to navigate through those futures in the hopes that I will achieve the future I want. \n There are two fundamental problems with this: \n \n I am not actually in control of what happens in my present, let alone in my future. \n I am not very good at predicting how much energy I will have to devote to a given set of tasks on a given day, which makes it hard to plan for the variables. \n \n In His sermon on the mount, Jesus Christ says, \u201cTake therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\u201d (Matthew 6:34).\u00a0\u00a0I do take thought for the morrow. I can\u2019t help it; at least, I do not yet know how to help it. I worry, I plan, and I strategize. Unfortunately, all my plans and strategies are for naught. No matter how much I plan, I cannot control the future. Sometimes my worries come to pass, but even those don\u2019t mean what I expected. \n One variable that has long been out of my control is my sleep pattern, rather my lack of a sleep pattern. I\u2019m working on this in the present, and in the future I expect help from sleep specialists. In the meantime, I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll be asleep and when I\u2019ll be awake on any given day. All I\u2019m really sure about is that I won\u2019t get enough sleep no matter what I do. Even if I do get enough sleep on a particular day, the pattern won\u2019t last out the entire week. \n But, for this day, I am awake during the day. I\u2019ll probably take a nap, because I woke up at 3 a.m., but at least I\u2019ll be awake for part of the day. I\u2019m committed to taking this day as it comes. I do have a plan \u2013 there\u2019s work I want to get done \u2013 but I\u2019m not going to let my plans interfere with the rhythm God sets for my day. \n Living life day-by-day is a bit different for me, but if that\u2019s what I need to do to get healthy, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. And I\u2019m not going to apologize for it or feel guilty over the things I don\u2019t get done. This day will be enough for this day. Tomorrow and all the tomorrows after it will just have to take care of themselves. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/06/day-by-day/", "title": "Day by Day"},

That\u2019s the idea and I\u2019ve tried to accept it. But it hasn\u2019t ever really stuck. I\u2019m in the habit of running myself ragged, because there\u2019s always more to do than I can possibly get done. I keep it up until I can\u2019t any more, and then I crash and burn. I vow to change, pick myself up, dust off the ashes, and start all over again. \n This doesn\u2019t really work. \n By failing to take care of myself, I end up failing to take care of my family. I end up with a longer, more unwieldy To Do list and less capacity to do it with. I get further and further behind. I become more and more vulnerable to depression. The overall effect is disastrous levels of suckage. Simply put, it stinks. But I am stuck. \n The key for me is to think about capacity. \n If I don\u2019t safeguard my capacity, then I won\u2019t be able to take care of my family in the present. If I don\u2019t build my capacity, then I won\u2019t be able to do the things I want to do in the future. In order to safeguard and build my capacity, I have to take care of myself. My health must come first, next my family, then my (paying) work, and finally my dreams. Throw in a dash of fun and a dollop of sleep and I should have a winning recipe, not that I cook or even want to learn how. The point is that sometimes putting things in order requires less busy hands and more purposeful patience. \n So, here\u2019s to taking care of mama: a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down, but a mindful look to my own reality is what makes me swallow. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/06/taking-care-of-mama/", "title": "Taking Care of Mama"},
{"date": "July 2, 2014", "body": "\r\n A little a while ago Ben brought home a piece of school work that Mark put up on the wall. They\u2019d written statements for him and marked where he should complete them with a long line. \u201cMy name is _______,\u201d \u201cI am _____ years old\u201d (which he got wrong), and other things Ben is expected to know. One of the statements was \u201cMy mother\u2019s name is ______\u201d and Ben answered \u201cdad.\u201d \n Mark is a stay-at-home father. I am a work-at-home mother. While I may share more of the domestic responsibilities than the typical working spouse, Mark has a heavy load to carry to fulfill his daily role (especially during the summers) and he has access to far less support than traditional stay-at-home mothers do. Mark and I both appreciated that Ben recognized that Mark\u2019s role was a bit untraditional. \n Now, with me partly out-of-commission, we\u2019re undergoing some changes. I can\u2019t lift more than 15 lbs. without endangering my abdomen. Since I don\u2019t know 15 lbs. versus 10 lbs. or 20 lbs. when I\u2019m lifting it, I may not be the strictest adherent to this rule; however, as a family we try our best to accommodate my recovery needs. But this simple restriction changes a lot. \n Since my sleep cycle is so screwed up, I have to make most of the days when I\u2019m awake during the day. I usually do my shopping at night, late at night, when everyone else is asleep. I would go to the grocery store, load up my cart, go through the self-check lane, bag my groceries, load them into the cart, load them into my van, and unload them into the house all by myself. Then, I\u2019d put them away. The boys would wake up to a house full of surprises. \n Laundry is a bit different. Sometimes I would do it all myself, but sometimes Mark would lug the heavy hampers downstairs for me. Now, I can\u2019t even carry the baskets of clean clothes upstairs unless I separate a load into smaller baskets and make several trips. Daily chores have become especially exhausting. So, now Mark\u2019s doing all the heavy lifting for this family, both literally and less literally. \n I may be the one bringing home the bacon, both literally and figuratively, but his job is harder. I know, because I\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s easier when I can help more, but getting me healthy is a priority, too. Resetting expectations and obligations isn\u2019t easy and the timing isn\u2019t good. Summer is not the time to mix things up. But we\u2019re trying, as a family, to make it work. You can\u2019t reset Mama without it spilling over to the entire family, even if she\u2019s a work-at-home Mama. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/07/a-family-reset/", "title": "A Family Reset"},
{"date": "June 6, 2014", "body": "\r\n With capacity-building in mind, I decided to use some of this \u201cdowntime\u201d to crack open some of the self-help books I\u2019ve been stockpiling. I decided to start with  First Things First  by Stephen Covey, in the hopes that the title\u2019s onto something. \n In the first chapter, Covey says, \u201cFundamental to putting first things first in our lives is leadership  before  management: \u2018Am I doing the right things?\u2019  before  \u2018Am I doing things right?\u2019\u201d (pages 27-28 of the 2003 edition) \n While I haven\u2019t gotten much past this quote yet, the idea is to engage in  life leadership  instead of  time management , or, perhaps, along with time management. I\u2019m not really sure yet. \n I am frequently guilty of letting life lead me around by the nose. I try to do the right things, but that effort doesn\u2019t pervade the entirety of my life. Mostly, I try to adhere to the right ideas: people over possessions, love over hate, put your back into, etc. \n I\u2019ve spent a lot of time building towards my dreams: get married and have children, become a published author, change the world. I\u2019ve spent a lot less time, at least as far as results go, ensuring that I have the foundation to pursue these dreams. Things like earning a sufficient living come to mind here. \n I\u2019ve learned a measure of practicality over the years, but the thing is that I have to learn it. It doesn\u2019t come naturally to me. I\u2019m a dreamer. I\u2019m comfortable with being a dreamer. But I\u2019m uncomfortable with the reality that results from spending too much of my time away from the practical realities of my life. \n Part of me wonders if the idea of  life leadership  will help me balance the two, resulting in a practical dreamer. Or if the idea is better suited to helping practical people embracing the dreamer locked within\u2026letting him or her come out to play more frequently. \n My dreamer-self has already set the course; now I need a practical captain to steer the ship.

{"date": "July 4, 2014", "body": "\r\n When Alex leaves the house, the Ben comes out to play. This is not to suggest that Ben doesn\u2019t play when Alex is in the house or that Ben doesn\u2019t play when he goes out of the house. Ben is a typical kid, at least in the sense that he can play wherever he is and will do so without the least bit of encouragement (as long as you don\u2019t account \u201ctypical play\u201d as the only kind of play). \n Still, it\u2019s hard to say who enjoys Alex\u2019s respite time more. Alex has a blast, whether he goes with his respite therapist or whether he goes with my mom. Ben has a blast because Alex is gone. They both enjoy their time away from each other. \n Now, when things are reversed and Ben is out of the house, Alex enjoys Ben\u2019s time away, too. The difference is that Alex, while having more fun than usual, is also calmer than usual. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about Ben bursting in on the scene and stealing his fun away. When Alex is gone, Ben has his fun without trying to be the least bit calmed by it. \n I swear, these boys\u2019 ability to aggravate each other is epic. The term \u201cepic\u201d has become so overused I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not \u201ccool\u201d any longer; but really, there is definitely something epic about the Ben/Alex battle. There is the typical sibling rivalry, of course: They like many of the same movies, toys, and activities, but don\u2019t want to share them with each other. It\u2019s more than that, though. \n Alex exacerbates Ben\u2019s sensory issues. Ben exacerbates Alex\u2019s sensory issues. They have mutually exclusive coping strategies. Ben\u2019s been such a bully for so long that Alex has given up the nice-guy routine and let\u2019s loose on him. Ben is more vicious, but Alex is bigger. Alex still loses unless he\u2019s willing to go all out; luckily, he has a genuinely gentle nature; unfortunately, that means Ben wins more often. It\u2019s sibling rivalry on autism and I don\u2019t like it. \n So, Ben\u2019s happiest time is when Alex leaves and my happiest time is when they\u2019re both having fun, even though it happens when one of them isn\u2019t here. It\u2019s not that I want one or the other out of the house; it\u2019s just that I want them to be happy\u2014both of them at the same time. \n Summer\u2019s going great, let me tell you. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/07/bens-happiest-time/", "title": "Ben\u2019s Happiest Time"},
{"date": "July 7, 2014", "body": "\r\n So, it\u2019s very early Monday morning. I have an hour to decide whether or not I\u2019m even going to try to sleep. It\u2019s around 3 am. I have a meeting at 9 and an appointment at 11:30, which means I have to be up at 8 at the latest, which means if it\u2019s going to be worth it at all I have to be in bed shortly after 4 am. \n My mind is still buzzing. I feel the pull of work. But I know I\u2019ll be exhausted by 10 am and I can\u2019t miss my appointment. My meeting might give me the buzz I need to keep going. But I\u2019d been hoping to use this as an opportunity to switch over to a day schedule. Day schedule, schmay schedule, you say\u2026but I like being awake for the boys. The quiet of the night has lost its allure. \n I don\u2019t get it. I really don\u2019t. After my surgery, I slept as much as I needed to, more than I thought I possibly could. I continued to sleep well for a few days. When I was able to stay up more, I felt  better . Better than I had before the pain that made the surgery necessary. I felt  good  even. \n And then, just like that, I was back to my lack-of-sleep schedule. \n Within days, I was back to being tired.

{"date": "August 1, 2014", "body": "\r\n In the last couple of months, I\u2019ve watched all 8 seasons of  Charmed . I didn\u2019t much care for the Prue/Paige switch up. I didn\u2019t much care for the way they axed out Cole. But I kept watching. Unlike the upheavals in  Buffy the Vampire Slayer , I didn\u2019t buy into it nearly as much after a while. I mean, I \u201cget\u201d the whole Paige deal, both from a practical angle and from a story angle. But, really, did they have to make her quite so consistently, persistently bratty? \n The Cole thing really bugs me. To go ahead and spoil things, Cole starts out evil, then he falls in love with his \u201cmark\u201d and becomes good, then he becomes evil to save the one he loves, and then he becomes good by being stripped of his powers, and then he saves the one he loves and becomes evil again\u2014this time through absolutely no fault of his own. And then they \u201ckill\u201d him for it. Except, dead isn\u2019t so very much dead for him. He comes back, less evil, and tries to be good. But they\u2019re just done with him. \n The thing that brought  Buffy  to mind is that it was once revealed that Buffy\u2019s two vampire romances were both metaphors for different kinds of abusive relationships. It was intentional. I suspect, on some level, the Cole thing was the same kind of deal. The message being that love can\u2019t save someone who is abusive. \n On the one hand, Cole reminds me a bit of another topic that grates. Cole will do  anything  to save his love. As a parent, I will do  almost anything  to help my children. Yet, I define  help  as being \u201chelp my children to be wholly and completely the best selves they can be\u201d and not as \u201chelp my children to become normal.\u201d That\u2019s a distinguishing factor. I also define  help  as \u201cdo no harm,\u201d which means I\u2019m not going to risk their health to make them what I want them to be. I stress  almost anything  because there are trade-offs. I\u2019d rather be poor and raise my children than rob a bank and give them wealth. If an attacker broke into our house and threated my children, then I believe I\u2019d be able to kill to save them, but I could never be an assassin to earn our bread.  Almost  anything. \n Cole doesn\u2019t get the value of  almost  anything. \n If I were a witch, it wouldn\u2019t be like  Charmed . I have a tenacious belief in free will. Being a werewolf or a vampire or a human being doesn\u2019t make you a monster. What you choose to do with what you\u2019re dealt makes or breaks you. You don\u2019t have to be evil just because others say you are. You have a choice. Cole\u2019s choices, while misguided, were driven by the greatest power this world knows: the power to love another more than the self. That can be nurtured. That can be harnessed. That\u2019s the stuff of miracles. \n I\u2019m all for saving innocents or, rather, innocence. But I can\u2019t help but think that Christ didn\u2019t come to save the innocents. He came to save the guilty. We all fall short. We all make mistakes. We\u2019ve all sinned. We\u2019re all fallen. None of us are truly innocent. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t choose to be good and it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not worth saving. \n If I were a witch, I wouldn\u2019t magically cure my children. I might try to write a spell that enables Alex to talk, but he\u2019d talk as a person with autism, a person who is one version of autism. If I were a witch, I wouldn\u2019t devote all my energies to saving innocents. I would devote my energies to helping people see the consequences of their choices, so they could make better choices. I would try to empower others, using magic to release the untapped potential in those I meet. But you don\u2019t need magic for that; you need love\u2014the kind of love that values others as much as or even more than the self. Then again, maybe that is magic, maybe it\u2019s the best magic of all. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2014/08/if-i-were-a-witch/", "title": "If I were a witch\u2026"}
