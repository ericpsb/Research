It has been pouring down all day so there has not been a lot more that she could do. \nHowever, the fact that she has been content with her day is a very good thing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j7-QnTJsb2k/Vj_n7sS6ROI/AAAAAAAAQ6c/JHqAPiqLz2g/s1600/a9030300e669397044f54cfcb2e599a8.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2015/11/hiraeth.html", "title": "\nHIRAETH\n"},

For no reason whatsoever Missy got out of the car at the shops\u00a0and started to scream\u00a0\u00a0and shout\u00a0in a very loud and angry\u00a0voice for no reason whatsoever. I immediately responded with .'right back in the car, we are going home .' And we did . When she realised she was not going into the shop Missy totally lost her cool and she had a full blown meltdown. Mid meltdown I phoned her carers to tell them that she could not go out because of the meltdown.\u00a0 In the background to my phone call Missy could be heard\u00a0screaming and crying and the carer said , 'well I guess you know best '. 'What the feck ??????' The carers,\u00a0not the childminders who have more sense in their\u00a0\u00a0little fingers then these carers seem to have in their entire brain, resent me cancelling Missy's outings when she is prone to a meltdown because they don't get paid.

{"date": " June 15, 2014", "body": "\n \u00a0 This is Missy playing with her blocks.\u00a0 Missy has always loved them and she plays with them a lot. But where did they come from ? They were given to her by her sister's mother-in-law who is German. The family are German and they live in Switzerland.\u00a0 They were something Missy's brother-in-law Ulf played with in the early 80s. Ulf's younger brother and sister also played with them. But that doesn't really answer the whole question,\u00a0 'But where did they come from ?' Well today I found out. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froebel_Gifts 'The\u00a0 Froebel Gifts \u00a0( German : Fr\u00f6belgaben ) are a range of educational materials designed by\u00a0 Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel . They were first used in the original Kindergarten \u00a0at\u00a0 Bad Blankenburg . Fr\u00f6bel advocated the importance of\u00a0 free play \u00a0in\u00a0 childhood . Each gift ( Gabe ) was designed to be\u00a0 given \u00a0to a child to provide material for the child's self-directed activity. These Gifts are a series of activity-based playthings ranging from simple sphere-shaped objects, through to geometric wooden blocks and more advanced Gifts pertaining to sewing, cutting, weaving and the modelling of objects in clay. Ottilie de Liagre in a letter to Fr\u00f6bel in 1844 observed that playing with the Froebel Gifts empowers children to be lively and free, but people can degrade it into a mechanical routine. \"Realising how the Gifts were eventually misused by Kindergarten teachers who followed after Froebel, it is important to consider what Froebel expected the Gifts to achieve. He envisaged that the Gifts will teach the child to use his (or her) environment as an educational aid; secondly, that they will give the child an indication of the connection between human life and life in nature; and finally that they will create a bond between the adult and the child who play with them\" Joachim Liebschner on page 82 in his book,\u00a0 A Child's Work: Freedom and Guidance in Froebel's Educational Theory and Practice Frank Lloyd Wright \u00a0was given a set of the Froebel blocks at about age nine, and in his autobiography cited them indirectly in explaining that he learned the geometry of architecture in kindergarten play, [ 1 ] \u00a0writing \"For several years I sat at the little Kindergarten table-top\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and played\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. with the cube, the sphere and the triangle\u2014these smooth wooden maple blocks\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. All are in my fingers to this day\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\" [ 2 ] Froebel Gifts remain popular today in Korea \u00a0and\u00a0 Japan \u00a0in\u00a0 early childhood education .' http://www.froebelweb.org/shop/wood. I have seen lots of natural wooden blocks in varying shapes and sizes so I think I will be buying more to add to Missy's collection. Missy has always love building towers with anything and loves lining things up. 'Each child with an\u00a0 autism spectrum disorder \u00a0will have his or her own individual pattern of behavior: Sometimes, a child's development is delayed from birth; other children develop normally before suddenly losing social or language skills. In some children, a loss of language is the impairment; in others, unusual behaviors (like spending hours lining up toys) predominate.' Web MD \u00a0 Does this mean Missy has autism ? Sorry humour lapse :) Humour is the coping mechanism of many parents and carers of children/adults with special needs. It is that realistic sense of humour that many doctors and nurses and other members of the caring community have. :) Repetitively stacking or lining up objects is a behavior sometimes associated with individuals with autism. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-otUbcDT63-c/U52BOoPBS9I/AAAAAAAACo4/IczSZOtH2zs/s640/blogger-image-794949590.jpg", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froebel_Gifts", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Fr%C3%B6bel", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blankenburg", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froebel_Gifts#cite_note-1", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froebel_Gifts#cite_note-2", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_education", "http://www.froebelweb.org/shop/wood.html", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vyR6qlVZLKU/U52BKXUISDI/AAAAAAAACoo/PCNKSFwrt_A/s640/blogger-image-312661555.jpg", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2RQenfeWRmg/U52BMVOS4fI/AAAAAAAACow/It3M8l3u3Hg/s640/blogger-image-1960683904.jpg", "http://www.m.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autism-spectrum-disorders", "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autism-stacking-cans_2nd_edit.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2014/06/you-learn-something-new-every-day.html", "title": "\nYOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY\n"},

Perhaps I should replace it with sunblock :) Last night Missy and her friends from PHAB went 'welly wanging'on the beach at Penarth.

{"date": " March 08, 2011", "body": "\n Beauty's Bunny display. This is my 25th year of being a parent of a child in school and I can tell you now that contributing continuously can be very tiring. Beauty's school is very small and there are usually 6 children in her class. I am the parent of one of only 2 children in the class that are taken to and from school by their parents so such contact means it can be difficult to escape contributing to everything. For each celebration the children dress up and bring different types of food or something else that is relevant to the occasion. Today is Shrove Tuesday so that means Pancakes BUT I really feel that I am getting tired of making and creating. I am getting just a little old for this. And personally I am feeling a little 'tattered' around the edges :) Did I ever tell you about the St David's Day when I sent in a tin of Welsh Cakes? I just did not have the energy to handmake them so I took them out of the packet and put some caster sugar on them and put them in a cake tin. They only went and won a prize in the school competition. It was a bit of a Helen Mirren moment in Calendar Girls when her M&S cake wins first prize in the WI competition. Well nobody told me they were going to be bloody judging them. Not that I won a prize or anything(thank goodness)! This year for Shrove Tuesday I am sending in pancakes still in their packets so there is no possibility of confusion. Not that there is a pancake competition(phew!). And Beauty and I spent all of half an hour making paper bunting. Beauty was too busy singing and dancing and bouncing around to spend much time being creative. I spent many hours once sewing Easter bunting for Beauty's class but that went walkabout and hasn't been seen since so this was definitely more enjoyable for Beauty to make and less time intensive and definitely cheaper. And so I have spent time and effort on something that Beauty and I can both enjoy. Today we put together an Easter display on the piano. We bought most of the things in 'What' and 'Dunelm' so you can tell they did not cost a lot. Beauty was thrilled when we did this and she showed it by being very flippy-flappy with her fingers. She also enjoyed rubbing noses with the bunny noses :) I especially love the vases. They were the cheapest vases in 'What' yet I felt they were the most attractive. Anybody who has shopped in 'What' knows exactly what I mean :) So what comes after Shrove Tuesday and before Good Friday ? I am sure the school has something planned :) UPDATE Look what I found today. A photo of the bunting that I made for Beauty's school. I am so glad I have a photo of it:) \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PW9bCwHukrI/TXWAzgXXCKI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/jw9dnyvDvwY/s1600/001.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vCJ1QWNN-2Y/TXV4wE_9DCI/AAAAAAAAB8g/SqtjZ927swI/s1600/010.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FzI5f4xMPs4/TXV6HRe1WOI/AAAAAAAAB8o/viGBS2aWTXg/s1600/003.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6lXJ1REeq2I/TXV8GTbadSI/AAAAAAAAB9A/1kDhOXoskVY/s1600/008.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PFFDfYFVi_A/TXV8GQXQ_cI/AAAAAAAAB84/N_DpDczea_g/s1600/005.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pYfPKIBsI64/TXV8F-30CwI/AAAAAAAAB8w/vW4vNlCe1iw/s1600/001.JPG", "http://s93.photobucket.com/albums/l50/seren211000/?action=view&current=25-03-07-11001.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2011/03/pancake-day.html", "title": "\nPANCAKE DAY\n"},

{"date": " July 28, 2011", "body": "\n Day 4 Week 1  and already I know Beauty is bored and last night she had a meltdown when the technology in the house would not co-operate........it was a video player thing ! Her computer is playing up and every time she uses her laptop and watches a video it freezes plus she now has an actual video stuck in her TV/Video combi :( \n Yesterday Beauty came to me and said OFF which means she wants me to turn the parental control off on her computer so she can watch YOUTUBE, my answer was NOT A CHANCE to which she replied ANGRY and made a grrrrr! noise and turned around and went back to her computer making Baby Bear growling noises! OK , communication skills improving :)  Plus the weather is so sticky and humid that this all combined is making for one stressed out 10 year\u00a0 old ! Let me add to that, it is also making for one stressed out Momma lady :| ' I will survive'.....Thank you Gloria Gaynor , that is my anthem for the week, well the next 6 weeks . Top of my To-Do-List today is to clean the back garden up, which basically means get rid of everything that can be dumped or re-cycled. I am hoping that Beauty will enjoy helping as she likes being in the back garden despite the mess.Yesterday she was out there counting gravel! She also spent a lot of time seeing how many\u00a0 pebbles would fit into my gardening gloves.......not enough it seems as she got in her words ANGRY when she could get no more pebbles in ! I am so glad she didn't try and see if the rabbit or the guinea pig would fit in the gloves. Thankfully the rabbit is a VERY FAST runner and can escape her and the guinea pig scratches and bites so I think they are safe for the time being.\u00a0 Beauty has become closer to the animals now that the boys live in the garden and she even enjoys cleaning\u00a0 them out at the weekend( the job is yours kid !).  \n \n The rabbit is now 'free range' and it is quite sweet to see them together in the garden, they don't play together but they don't seem to be afraid of each other anymore which is nice :) \n \n However, Buzzy Bee Bunny has been wandering a bit too far of late and has been upsetting 'Mr McGregor 'who lives next-door and grows vegetables , Buzzy Bee is obviously very interested in what is on the menu ! So yesterday I got some chicken wire and wired up the bottom of the gate so now Buzzy Bee can longer escape. Buzzy is not a happy bunny , ah well, life's a beach . Also  on my list of To-Dos today is to make a plan of action for Beauty for the holidays., what to do and where to go .I don't think I want to cope with another meltdown from her. \n \u00a0 One meltdown in the family is enough but with me the meltdown is a physical thing, it is an age thing!!!!! I have spent a fortune on Black Cohosh and special vitamins and supplements and as of yet there are\u00a0 no\u00a0 visible results. They had better start kicking in soon before I melt into a puddle like The Wicked Witch of the West though I am sure Beauty thinks I am already The\u00a0 Wicked Witch of the South with my lack of sympathy to all things technical!

{"date": " March 12, 2011", "body": "\nAnyone who has worked in the health service and is my age+ will remember weekend work. It was a kind of mini spring cleaning session and looking back it was probably a good thing because there just doesn't seem to be time for anything like that today. It also served another purpose and that was to check that everything was working properly,so I think it was a good thing. Well I think that a lot of nurses carry on that tradition but not all of them because I know a certain nurse who doesn't live a million miles from me who hasn't cleaned her house since 1976 BUT HEY, we are not all the same thank goodness. Well my house has weekend work and Niamh loves it. How to save time and energy ? Let the 10 year old do the work because she loves doing it, it is still a game for her:) Beauty loves to cook and today we made pasta bake. This is me trying to be frugal :) Cheese-35p Pasta -36p Sauce x 2 - \u00a32.00 So the meal cost me \u00a32.71 to make and it will last for at least 2 more meals. The finished product :) Beauty LOVES baking :) She also loves to clean :) One thing that I have a problem with is the dust pan and brush and anybody who has recently visited my house wiill know this because they are always being asked to dust pan and brush something up that I have swept into a corner.......sorry girls :) However, now I know that Beauty can help me. One of the problems with the sweeping is that Beauty gets very excited and is likely to be a bit over enthusiatic :) Beauty seems to go through stages of development and at the moment she seems to have made a huge step forward. She just wants to learn all the time and this is constant and due to her ADHD which Prof. Fraser also diagnosed, she just wants to be DOING all the time. Her learning seems to fall into 3 groups. Personal care, educational learning and homemaking skills and these are totally her own choice. I feel in a way that we are following a Montessorri type plan for her and she is leading the way and  achieving at her own pace the skills she needs to learn. Finding the energy to keep up with her enthusiam is the only difficulty :)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DX6xsL4OFdU/TXtoZCidrfI/AAAAAAAAB9o/JRe4YHuAsLM/s1600/016.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VwZH6XztEy8/TXtoYnLdPGI/AAAAAAAAB9g/ttwrV7AlTD0/s1600/013.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aHHaoV3mhYU/TXt04Yx7sqI/AAAAAAAAB9w/3w16QS8mt5I/s1600/017.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JCfi8O41k6U/TXtoYAirCtI/AAAAAAAAB9Y/b9mixnUQH3Q/s1600/012.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X2heQuCxBQA/TXt5-xoLmBI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/0K1yyipznJw/s1600/025.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aPRN_IHBE8c/TXt5-AHOKuI/AAAAAAAAB-Q/BonQJuw4uqI/s1600/024.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6feFSLHuACg/TXt592BLouI/AAAAAAAAB-I/HirMfXpLYRM/s1600/023.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QTJYWgrJhGQ/TXt59S2PkvI/AAAAAAAAB-A/S-uaMNDEt4A/s1600/022.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQZYy9QaB68/TXt582ikvgI/AAAAAAAAB94/K4lze2c9KUg/s1600/021.JPG"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2011/03/weekend-work.html", "title": "\nWEEKEND WORK.\n"},
{"date": " January 14, 2011", "body": "\n I am in a much lighter brighter mood than I have been in a while even thought the pain from my back and joints continue. And why? A trip to the spinal clinic in CRI. CRI (Yes that's the one, the one used for filming Dr Who) Going into the infirmary was a really strange experience as I was there last when I worked on a ward that closed  and moved to UHW and that was in 1999. UHW Oh so long ago. The spinal clinic is in the old casualty building and I swear the reception desk is exactly the same one and has not changed in anyway.I was directed through to the waiting area which was also the same apart from a lick of magnolia! I had been referred to this clinic after being seen at Llandough Hospital for an MRI. Llandough After the results came through it was decided that I no longer go to Llandough but go to the CRI which is on Newport Road and closer to where I live. After being in the waiting area for 5 minutes, a woman came and called me through to an interview area. She did not tell me her name, state her designation or wear a name badge. She could have been the Tea Lady for all I knew. However, as we started to talk it became clear that she was not medically trained and was totally vacuous of all common sense and anything remotely connected to Human Biology! She had an x ray screen in front of her with my spinal x ray on it, and a small manila folder  in front of her and she asked me 'Where is the damage in your back?' It took me a few seconds to figure this one out and wonder if it was a trick question and I was being secretly filmed for some new comedy show. Pointing to the screen I said , 'In the lumbar region'. She then looked at the x ray and said ' Well at least it isn't serious, it is just normal wear and tear' WHAT! 9 inches of damage and deterioration and 3 ruptured discs not serious. 'Have you considered working on your core?' 'What about Pilate's?' At this point I wanted to start banging my head against the wall and give up the will to live. I felt the way that you do when you are on the phone to a cold caller trying to sell you insurance who has a script to follow and will not shut up long enough for you to say NO THANK YOU! My reply was, ' I am sorry, but that x ray is serious and it is not NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR'. Her reply was, ' Well it is for some people'. 'Are there Pilate's classes in Cardiff?' was her next question and from this I knew the conversation was on a downwards cycle and I knew that I had to get out of there before I found myself banned from the hospital. 'I don't know ' was my reply! To which she asked , 'Why are you here, what do you want?' 'To be free of pain' was my answer. 'But what do you want to do' was her response and by this time I was convinced that this woman did not know the time of day let alone what a normal spinal x ray should look like. Praying this meeting was going to end in the next 2 minutes I replied, 'I have had an MRI and I am here for you to give me the options of what can be done.' Her next statement floored me, 'Well I think you are being very negative and so there is no point in you being here' I just wanted out of there. ' Look just give me the options' was all my poor addled brain could think of. 'Well you don't want an operation, do you? 'If I needed one YES but if it is optional NO. I have had MRSA once thank you  and that was enough'. 'OK, then we will refer you for physio.Where do you live?' Remember, she has notes in front of her!!!! 'Pentwyn' 'Where's that?' 'North East Cardiff' 'Where is that?' 'Cardiff Gate, M4' 'Sorry I don't know where that is so I don't know which hospital to refer you to.I will ask someone' Disappears, reappears, 'I couldn't find anyone, I will just refer you to physio' I am now convinced that this woman has  just wandered in off the street and sat down at a desk and picked up a pen and is pretending she works here! 'I will also refer you to the pain team though I don't know if they can help you as the damage is so widespread!' I felt like yelling WHAT DAMAGE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WASN'T SERIOUS. And then I managed to escape!!!!! GIRLS......you would have been impressed at how well I behaved! So the first thing I did when I got home was check out where the Pilate's classes were, how much they cost and what they do physically. The first thing that I came across was this! On first sight I thought it was something from a medieval torture chamber BUT NO, it appears to be an exercise unit  which you PAY to use as part of one-to-one coaching! Then I checked out the prices which start around \u00a340 for a short course and a one-to-one coaching session is \u00a335 . But the final straw which made me fall about laughing was the actual routines/exercises involved in Pilate's! For me it was like watching an episode of a funniest video show where people have accidents and falls and you can't help squealing OUCH! and OOOOOOOO! when you see what happens to them. Well I am watching these videos and thinking I HAVE TO WALK CAREFULLY to stop my hips, knees and ankles dislocating.The thought of doing theses moves and the pain caused when my joints dislocate had me squealing OUCH! constantly just watching the moves and positions. Just go into YouTube and watch any Pilate's video and you will see what I mean.

{"date": " December 14, 2010", "body": "\n Yes I know. As my girls have told me many times,years ago I would have been burnt as a witch!!!!! And what is my crime? Well I make all my cleaning products myself using borax,soda crystals,bicarbonate of soda, natural soap flakes and white vinegar but I do have ready made eco-products for when the girls need to do some cleaning or washing(oh I am so funny!) or when I cannot be bothered messing! I have also made my own shampoo and hair conditioner which seems to work better on my hair than the most expensive 'frizzy' products . When a girl has hair like Crystal Tips then she HAS to try everything to tame THE BEAST! If that makes me a witch then Oooops! Or it could be the fact that I spend the summer in long dresses. But  surely that just makes me like a hippy but then again the girls also think I look like a hippy!!!!!! I am not sure ! I don't do labels!!!!! I am also a vegetarian and cook lots of vegetable stews using herbs and spices in large steaming pots on my large range cooker. Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and caldron bubble but I don't use \"Eye of newt, and toe of frog,Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,Lizard's leg, and howlet's wing,--For a charm of powerful trouble,Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.\" Macbeth (IV, i, 14-15)   BUT you never can tell so be careful what you eat at my house! Remember DON'T DRINK THE KOOL AID!!!!! Or perhaps it is my PREMONITIONS!!!! I have had quite a few premonitions of things going to happen in my life but I have never been able to do anything about them. They usually seem pretty vague until they have happened and then they seem crystal clear. My most recent was that Beauty was going to cut her own hair and that happened though I did try and hide all the scissors, she found a pair that had been lost! The most significant was the day of the Hungerford Massacre. I was walking through Newbury which is only a few miles from Hungerford (a number of Newbury people died in the massacre) and I had what I can only describe as a vision. I am not religious but I realise that there are a lot of things that happen that I don't know about or understand.Anyway, I was walking towards the market square when I felt I saw a man , there but not there, run around the corner of the post office carrying a rifle and he ran straight passed me and was gone. Then I thought it was just silly imaginings but at that time the gunman had already killed a number of people in Hungerford and went on to shoot more. My theory? I obviously have no more firm evidence that anyone else but I think it is to do with how you are as a person. I am a mother of 6 and being a mother of 1 or 6 heightens your senses and makes you constantly aware and sensitive to what is going on around you with regards to your children. You are always listening and always watching and you can also sense things when nothing can be heard or seen. I also read The Nun's Story and she describes Nun's who are Mental health nurses as different to other nurses.She said it was as if they were hyper aware and constantly alert. I think we humans have that ability to be hyper alert BUT where the 'visions' or what ever you want to call them come from......I have no idea. Conclusion.......Witch or not a Witch? Perhaps what they said in Practical Magic is the answer. 'There's a little witch in every woman.' \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQc_TxdJnlI/AAAAAAAAB4o/-JSegerDxtQ/s1600/which%2Bwitch.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQdEDjg9MdI/AAAAAAAAB4w/IGdq_hfF7v0/s1600/eco%2Bproducts.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQdEDjg9MdI/AAAAAAAAB4w/IGdq_hfF7v0/s1600/eco%2Bproducts.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQdKzmMtkFI/AAAAAAAAB44/hQ6J7ec7KNc/s1600/crystal-tipps-and-alistair.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQdEDjg9MdI/AAAAAAAAB4w/IGdq_hfF7v0/s1600/eco%2Bproducts.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQdN2M2AAuI/AAAAAAAAB5A/zpcWnb2HaE0/s1600/summer%2Bhippy.bmp", "http://www.enotes.com/macbeth-text/act-iv-scene-i#mac-4-1-14", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQdRL0f-3mI/AAAAAAAAB5I/BJJXRaHZCAg/s1600/KOOL%2BAID.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQdV4hptLgI/AAAAAAAAB5Q/IqfkgzTkmn8/s1600/the%2Bnun%2527s%2Bstory.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/12/which-witch.html", "title": "\nWHICH WITCH?\n"},
{"date": " July 23, 2010", "body": "\nI am awake! But the hyperactive 9 year old is not and so I have access to the computer without fear of a full frontal assault or my toes being tickled! Beauty`s sleep routine has been like living with a baby in the house for the last 9 years.I am getting just a little tired of this and sadly I know that not even Supernanny could handle this because Beauty just cannot rationalise. Talking of Supernanny.....I can hardly say it is my favourite TV show but I can say I am mesmerised by it when it comes on TV. Many times when I watch the show I cannot believe it is actually real. Surely parents do not behave that badly? One program I was convinced was not about the children but about mummy getting on TV. Each time we saw mummy she had a different outfit on and her makeup and hair was perfect. OH and the boobs definitely came out of a packet! One comment about this show on The Supernanny website that I found quite funny was `the tag line of the show was Mummy loses control of her 3 boys, heck she would lose control of the daddy if it weren`t for the boobs!` When they were growing up,my girls were definitely angels in comparison. Feeding is definitely a thing that I have gained an insight into from watching Supernanny. One thing she did say however that I do not agree with is that there isn`t any reason why a child shouldn`t eat everything .Beauty has a  Selective eating disorder  and whilst her eating is not too selective,there are definitely things she will not eat. Beauty will eat bread, ham, pizza ,toast,chicken nuggets and pop corn, fish,crisps, yoghurt , breakfast cereal,yorkshire puddings, chicken,tomato sauce, raw cabbage and carrots whenever you put them in front of her but she will not eat fruit or any other vegetables. All the food she eats is because she has seen them and decided that she wants to eat them. My problem has been that she eats because she is bored. I have tried her with other foods many times but she just doesn`t want to know. Another problem has been that when she starts to wander around the house ,I ask her what she wants and she will always reply with some kind of food. She now seems to be eating constantly so now when she starts to wander I ask her where she is going and the answer is usually not food. Plus I am now hiding crisps and when she asks for them I always say that they are ALL GONE and offer her Petit Filous or carrots or ham instead which she always accepts. Thank goodness the only drink she likes is a no added sugar drink and she will not eat sweets which can`t be bad. Imagine.....a 9 year old who will not eat sweets! Beauty was in school one day making sandwiches for a birthday tea for one of the boys and they were making ham sandwiches and she just decided there and then that she LIKED ham.This has been a blessing because now whe can go out and I can make her ham sanwiches to take. Though it has never been too much of a problem having food when we were out as there is a MacDonalds EVERYWHERE and she will always eat the chicken nuggets and tomatoe sauce! And as for the Pizza Hut Pizza Buffet, she will eat twice as much as any adult. Thank goodness though that her eating issues extend to not eating the bread part of the pizza or she would be the size of a house by now. However, if all else fails and there is nothing else available, the disgusting child has her own buffet on tap! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TEk6EMXQtzI/AAAAAAAABvs/olZ2AzZZ6XA/s1600/supernanny.jpg", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_eating_disorder", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TElBYRkzcCI/AAAAAAAABv0/AruespOa6VA/s1600/bunny.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TElEU2aBk1I/AAAAAAAABv8/eoE8dvt3Mzg/s1600/pizza+hut.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TElE5-uWrwI/AAAAAAAABwE/x26oQwBACmQ/s1600/nose+pick.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/07/eatdrink-and-be-merry.html", "title": "\nEAT,DRINK AND BE MERRY.\n"},
{"date": " September 24, 2010", "body": "\n1  The rain will pour at school run time,shop assistants will say when you take something back WELL NO ONE HAS EVER COMPLAINED BEFORE and last but not least, MEN WILL LIE TO YOU! Accept it and get over it. They cannot help it, it is a design flaw. If their lips are moving, there is a good chance they are lying to you. And why do they lie? Because we as women have let them get away with it. So why on earth would we do something so stupid? Because many women fear the confrontation and also possibly losing the man. Yet why do we women turn men into the Gods that they are not? Probably because men need to be adored to feel complete, something we mothers taught them as children and in doing so ruined them for the poor woman they end up with! But the upside is that most men seem to be totally unaware that their women KNOW THEY ARE LYING. Unaware that we are actually ALLOWING them to do what they do because it is easier and it keeps them happy. But yes there is an upside......treat this species of animal considerately and they will adore you like a new puppy loves its owner. Feed them, keep them clean and warm and very much loved and they will dote on you.....most of the time.......well a lot of the time.......or possibly only some of the time but they can be worth the effort! Please remember.......no animals were hurt in the writing of this piece and it is of course a gross generalisation and merely my own opinion!  2 Children will grow up and leave home and break your hearts because they are no longer sweet cuddly babies! When my children were born they failed to read the small print which said that they had to stay a baby for always......Well apart from Beauty who will always be a baby in lots of ways. They were not meant to go to school,be a Brownie,go to university, fall in love, get married but hey .....the grand babies will be ok when they arrive! 3  In reality, your own parents were as clueless as we were when dealing with screaming babies and child rearing,that's the deal......it was not their fault or ours. It was meant to be that way! Every parent had to learn to be a parent on the job, there is never any real work experience. However, we do now have SuperNanny and all I can say is that if there had been somebody like her around when my girls were little they would not have had to deal with such a psychotic, useless mother. SuperNanny has been my Guru for lots of Beauty's problems. Just remember though, you are your child's expert, no one else. 4  You have a body that is uniquely yours Sometimes it will be fatter, sometimes it will be thinner. Sometimes you will believe you look like a Super Model(after a few drinks maybe) other times you will be convinced you look like Pat Butcher but at the end of the day you are always you and remember significant others come and go but you will always end up in bed with yourself SO LOVE YOURSELF. Would you really want to be in bed with someone you didn't love? 5  That money will not make you happy. I know it can make life comfortable and you will be secure but think of all those famous, wealthy celebrities who took their own lives. It didn't mean much to them.  However, offer me a nice house with a big garden for Beauty and I would snap it up. But what can I say? I am only human.....and honest! 6  Never let your dreams escape. They are what make you who you are. You may not achieve everything you want straight away but keep them polished and shiney. I will finish my masters one day. I will cruise the Nile. I will tell the woman who told me I was fat that she is fatter than me! Well.....two out of three ain't bad! 7  Sex is just Sex! It can be wonderful and joyous and perfect!!!!! But it can also be boring and not just a little tedious. Do not enshrine it as the wonderment of your life. When you one day realise that you would rather do the laundry or wash the car then you have truly arrived. You have become a true adult and sex is in its rightful place. And that is , that there is a time and place for it. And sex is not love but just an expression of it. 8  You will have regrets and it is just not possible to forget all your mistakes. Just say WHAT WAS I THINKING(or not as the case maybe!) and walk away. IT is important to have dated,lived with or married a total idiot because then you will truly appreciate the perfect person you meet and fall in love with who is not a complete idiot. As pass\u00e9 as it sounds it is important to have EXPERIENCED THE BITTER TO KNOW THE SWEET. And by experiencing these mistakes , you will learn a lot about yourself, I have. Mostly that I have poor judgement skills when it comes to at least 50% of the men I have ever known. The other 50% are probably just grateful that they escaped from such a crazy woman. 9  You will not be forever young and you will grow old. Now I am sorry but I was never meant to be 49 with arthritis and walk like I have a 'rod up my arse' as one of my delightsome daughters so sweetly described it. I was never meant to be 49 going on 50. Like everyone else I was meant to be young and beautiful(well I was never that but it is nice to dream) and always in the prime of my life. So take care of your body as you will need it to be healthy so much more as you grow older. You want to be one of those people in their 70's and 80's who go snow boarding and not like me with walking sticks, even if they are very attractive with stars and moons on them. 10 And last but I feel so important. Do not take what you are told as gospel . Just because some one says something is a truth long enough does not make it so. Find your own way in life. Be your own guide. Find your own path. Be true only to yourself and then everything you will do will be right and just. Which means that you will seek to make yourself happy which is the only way you can make anyone else happy and make the world around you a better place. I conclusion, these are things I have learned over the years but do I practice my own ideals all the time? I try but fail on a daily basis but the important thing is that after you fall you get up and start again....it is the only way.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/09/ten-things-i-have-learned-in-my-life-so.html", "title": "\nTEN THINGS I HAVE LEARNED IN MY LIFE SO FAR.........\n"},

{"date": " July 06, 2010", "body": "\nYesterday when I went to my neighbours house to return an Avon catalogue she had left me, she commented on the fact that my stomach was FAT! Good sales technique....HUH! She has mentioned this before and she is about a size 20/22 whilst I wear size 14/16 jeans and usually I think WHATEVER! But yesterday I have to admit that it upset me. Yesterday I was feeling exhausted after doing so much and everyone knows that when your back hurts you tend to slouch which of course makes your stomach look bigger. Well that`s my excuse and I am sticking to it! Since I have started dieting I have lost over 4 stone and gone from a size 22 to a size 14/16 which is not bad but I seriously think that after 7 babies my stomach muscles can only achieve so much! And I do not intend to have cosmetic surgery to resolve the problem. My Pollyannaism for the situation is that if I slouch on a bus then perhaps  someone will give up their seat for me. However, thinking about it, maybe not at my age! When I went for my last spinal x ray ,for the first time I wasn`t asked if it was possible I could be pregnant so I must be starting to show my age after a lifetime of people telling me how young I look! Today is a SOFA DAY. After yesterdays exhausting run-around, today I will rest on the sofa (with my phone super glued to my hand!) as much as possible and in between rests, try and get some housework done. So far I have managed to get the `activity corner` going.....I have put on the washing machine and dish washer and I have put the piggies and the rabbits out in their runs which by the way they absolutely LOVE. Well I did manage to get a rest and I must have fallen asleep because I was woken at 11.30am by the Fed Ex guy phoning me to tell me that he had a parcel for me and was at my garden gate. It was nice to have a rest and not be rushing around.

Oh Well. But I have been referred to have my spine seen in the hospital and have possible work done on it or if that is not possible then have painkilling injections straight into my back.....ouch! This week I am going back to have x rays on my knees and hips as they are also deteriorating but whilst they are very painful, the biggest problem with them is that they dislocate and the dislocating is getting worse and more frequent.But apart from that I am fit and well!!!!! And Beauty is too. Beauty`s Biggest problem is that as soon as it is light she is up and out of bed and ready to rock and roll. And for me, 4 am is just too early to be rocking and rolling. This early a wake up call leaves me comatose for the rest of the day. Today was such a day. For the first hour all I could do was lie on the sofa waiting for the  meds  to kick in.....which they never did! I took the second lot of  meds  at 10am and only by 11 am did they start to work.

Well at least it hasn`t been as hot as parts of the USA where they are having a heatwave but for somebody with very fair skin and red hair IT IS TOO HOT! For however long it has been since I wrote properly on my blog, it has not been a time of inactivity. I have probably written more in these last few months than I have in my entire lifetime. I have been writing a journal and I call it my Phd in Hind Sight.My journal is not just about my life but everything I have been reading and how I feel about the books.I have also started another book but this is just about memories from growing up. My girls have suggested that I write about some of the things that have happened in my life and write a book but my answer was NOT A CHANCE! And the main reason is that I hate Mis Lit and after reading Angela`s Ashes I swore I would never read another Mis Lit book and I haven`t.I hated the story in Angela`s Ashes about Angela`s baby girl that died, it upset me so much that I said NEVER AGAIN! But going back to writing a blog entry is really difficult after writing a journal because journal entries can be so much more personal and you write in a journal about really private things that you would not dream of sharing with the world. Plus I had forgotten how fast it is to write on the computer compared to writing my journal by hand. I really enjoy writing by hand and I write with gel pens as they give a `similar`effect to writing with an ink pen.Perhaps I shall try an ink pen as well! Whenever I think of writing with an ink pen I think of Winston Smith in 1984 and his journal writing experiences.                     However ,I have to confess that my writings are not those of a literary genius and the stories in my life are probably not exciting or even interesting!

I truly understand why even many of Hitler`s inner circle say they tried to read it but couldn`t get through it!It has to be one of the most depressing pieces of writing I have ever encountered.

If Beauty does not want to do something, convincing her to actually do it can be almost impossible . Beauty's non-compliance in school concerts goes beyond even Gandhi's hard-core ideals. For example, she spent last years concert sat in a a paddling pool on stage and the year before she sat in a giant box. Now if I were her teacher I would be pretty peed off at this as she is the most verbal and most aware(and most obstinate!) child in the class. She is also always singing and dancing but refuses to perform to request. She also knows an amazing amount of Christmas carols and songs. What a party  pooper ! In today's concert she is a reindeer. However, I have no idea what she is going to be sat in! Such a sweet child x Anyway, today is Beauty's school concert but I do not think I will be attending due to this virus I have as I think it would be unfair to inflict it upon anyone else. It has got worse and it has now got to the 'HACKING AND SPITTING' stage! NICE! Also, all down my wind pipe is starting to feel sore. I shall ask her teacher to take a photo of her sat in whatever she is sat in then I will not miss anything! The sad thing is she never notices if I am there or not! My memories of my own school concerts include always being an angel but never Mary and being dressed in Edwardian clothes singing to Mary Hopkins' song Those Were The Days.. My most significant memory of the concerts Beauty's older sisters did.....Fiona dressed as Mary seen drop kicking the baby Jesus across the stage just as the stage curtains are closing. I was weak with laughter You have got to love that kid. She is a star. Oh yes.....PC gone mad. I can imagine this happening! x\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQhlRKPr5vI/AAAAAAAAB5Y/Re4fACDoPZg/s1600/nativity.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TQhmy1Wv7tI/AAAAAAAAB5g/b31vkb_cglA/s1600/pc-nativity-play.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/12/school-concerts-and-non-compliance.html", "title": "\nSCHOOL CONCERTS AND NON-COMPLIANCE!\n"},
{"date": " September 25, 2009", "body": "\n  Beauty having a splashing good time in San Diego  It has been a worrying day as far as Beauty is concerned. Beauty has had  separation anxiety attacks  since she was quite small but not in the traditional sense. She has always been very happy to go to school and to go out with the childminders but she dislikes it when people who visit her leave. She also doesn't like it when I am not around and says 'where's she gone?' When we went to the US for the summer and had to say goodbye to friends and she was absolutely distraught and still asks where they are.She cried for hours with that episode. Today after school we went to the shops to buy her some new waterproof trousers for wearing in the school garden and Forest School and our friend the IT man came with us.Well the 2 of them played in the shop like a pair of naughty 3 year  olds  and she really enjoyed the time they spent together.Well the moment we arrived home and she knew he wasn't coming into the house she became distraught and started to cry 'Where's he gone' over and over and she started to cry and wouldn't stop. And anyone who knows Beauty well knows that her crying is not a pretty sight as her skin is so pale that when she cries she becomes all blotchy and it looks as if she has an incurable disease! So we lay down on the sofa and cuddled for an hour until the crying subsided.  Don't worry, she is fine now. I am worried about this as this is the second time in a couple of months and before that it was maybe a year since her last anxiety attack. I have googled separation anxiety and treatments but everything I have read seems to be geared for normally developing children and so I am at a loss as what to do apart from lay down with her and cuddle her. COLOUR THERAPY Colour Therapy is a complementary therapy for which there is evidence dating back thousands of years to the ancient cultures of Egypt, China and India. Colour is simply light of varying wavelengths, thus each colour has its own particular wavelength and energy. The energy relating to each of the seven spectrum colours of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, resonates with the energy of each of the seven main  chakras /energy centres of the body. If you can imagine the  chakras  as a set of cogs/wheels, they are rather like the workings of a clock or an engine; each cog/wheel needs to move smoothly for the clock/engine to work properly. Thus good health and  wellbeing  is achieved by a balance of all these energies. Balance of the energy in each of the body\u2019s  chakras  is very important for health and  wellbeing . Colour therapy can help to re-balance and/or stimulate these energies by applying the appropriate colour to the body and therefore re-balance our  chakras . Well ,until I study this a bit more then I am afraid this is all a little bit deep for me but the point that I want to make is that I love colour and I think I need to add a bit of colour into my life to cheer me up because of the changeable weather we are having at the moment. And at the moment my favourite colour is  RED . Last night I bought a lovely Egyptian cotton sheet in a sale and it is now on my bed cheering me up.  I think the sheet goes very well with my vintage pillowcases(by vintage I mean 1980's, I find it scary when I see things for sale on EBAY described as vintage when they are circa 1980!). At the moment I am taking Beauty to bed an hour early and I either go to bed myself or sit in bed and read or write or knit until she goes to sleep so it is nice to have the bedroom looking so cheery. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr0TC32ZxYI/AAAAAAAABq0/SWwuoS1GUvc/s1600-h/splashing.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr0N-rUn10I/AAAAAAAABqk/lTY3oTWCbXY/s1600-h/bedding.jpg", "http://http//www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch300/ch300b.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr0QTrJ1WjI/AAAAAAAABqs/x4tekHXM7Ww/s1600-h/mummy+and+niamh.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr0N-rUn10I/AAAAAAAABqk/lTY3oTWCbXY/s1600-h/bedding.jpg", "http://http//www.colourtherapyhealing.com/colour_therapy/what_is_colour_therapy.php", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr0N-rUn10I/AAAAAAAABqk/lTY3oTWCbXY/s1600-h/bedding.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/09/it-has-been-worrying-day-as-far-as.html", "title": "\nI LOVE RED!\n"},

Can anyone reading this blog tell me why my viewing stats have gone up by approximately 1,000 overnight? Did I upset somebody? It would be nice to know! Beauty went to bed at her usual time last night and I am happy to say that she slept peacefully all night and awoke with a smile. However,when she came into the kitchen we have a brief moment where she looked out of the window and said,'Where's he gone?'. But then she went to the fridge and got herself a drink and then went to watch Cinderella on the video...... AGAIN! So I think we maybe OK. (I can hear her clapping and shouting BRAVO so she sounds happy enough)   A sure sign that Beauty is OK........she has trashed the living room! My girls have told me that I would be OCD and my house immaculate if I didn't have children in the house.That is so true. The problem though with having 6 girls is that they will go on to have 6 lots of children so the children in the house seems to be a never ending prospect! All I have to do is deal with the mess now! At present, I am scouring the internet to find Autumn craft ideas for Beauty and I to do together.Which really means that unles the activity includes copious amounts of paint and getting dirty then Beauty is happy to hold onto and guide my hands whilst I do the activity!Or just stand next to me totally enthralled and  hand flapping ! Niamh happily hand flapping at the ducks by the lake in Santee, San Diego.  Now this is definitely number one on my list of something we can do. Found at  DomestikGoggess.com I think they are stunning and look quite easy to make.I also managed to find lots of activities at http://www.marthastewart.com/  now some of the activities here are stunning and also easy-ish!  One of Martha Stewarts HOW-TOs is  Pumpkin Candy Faces we will definely be trying this one.   I will definitely be posting the pictures of the things we make this autumn.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr3oZiawStI/AAAAAAAABrk/97gpMW9NpcY/s1600-h/pumpkin+candy+faces.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr3mXjuodwI/AAAAAAAABrc/p08GAOAlcTU/s1600-h/folded-maple-leaf-roses-bouquet.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr3fh__MoaI/AAAAAAAABrM/Vi1wKJ3fV4U/s1600-h/girls+pulling+faces.jpg", "http://http//2.bp.blogspot.com/_JzIKux5uFIs/ShEStq2kk7I/AAAAAAAABAo/YEO5wIdowYM/s320/disney-princesses-pull+a+funny+face.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr3dUMp0zTI/AAAAAAAABq8/iZFHLFkkjhA/s1600-h/my+living+room.jpg", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr3lVyXR4aI/AAAAAAAABrU/pL3Th7Xwa1g/s1600-h/niamh+flapping.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr3mXjuodwI/AAAAAAAABrc/p08GAOAlcTU/s1600-h/folded-maple-leaf-roses-bouquet.jpg", "http://http//domestikgoddess.com/make-a-rose-bouquet-of-autumn-leaves/", "http://www.marthastewart.com/", "http://http//www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/tricks-and-treats?", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr3oZiawStI/AAAAAAAABrk/97gpMW9NpcY/s1600-h/pumpkin+candy+faces.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/09/hey-girls-recognise-yourselves-in-this.html", "title": "\nPEEK A BOO\n"},

I have emptied and refilled the dishwasher,emptied and refilled the washing machine and pegged clothes out to dry and I feel like I have run a marathon with Eddie Izzard! I don't think I have the energy to chase the Black Dog away even if I wanted to! At least the pigs don't need cleaning out today which is definitely a bonus. At last I totally agree with Obama on something, Kanye West is a Jackass for what he did to Taylor Swift. But then I don't think the term Jackass should be confined to Kanye. Anger at Iranian Holocaust denial The Iranian president's latest denial of the Nazi Holocaust has drawn strong condemnation from Western powers. Speaking in the capital, Tehran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the Holocaust was a \"a lie based on an unprovable and mythical claim\". Germany said the comments were a \"disgrace to his country\" while the US said they would \"isolate Iran further\". Mr Ahmadinejad made the remarks at an annual rally where opposition supporters clashed with police. Reformists, who have been banned from holding demonstrations since disputed presidential elections in June, defied warnings not to use the pro-Palestinian Quds (Jerusalem) Day marches to stage protests. 'Unacceptable and shocking' As part of the Quds Day events, President Ahmadinejad delivered a speech in which he repeated previous assertions that the Holocaust was a lie.  See......some people just don't know me at all! Assumption is the mother of all ...............what was that phrase again? And on a different note. Feeling so lacking in energy I was thinking today about this poem and how I am NOW OLD(and grey under the hair colour)! William Butler Yeats. b. 1865 When You are Old WHEN you are old and gray and full of sleep   And nodding by the fire, take down this book,   And slowly read, and dream of the soft look   Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true;   But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,   And loved the sorrows of your changing face. And bending down beside the glowing bars,   Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead,   And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. Moving swiftly on.......................! Beauty just came up to me and looked me straight in the eye(remember the 'aversion' thing) and said to me 'are we not going to have ice cream? I am sorry but I just burst out laughing, no conversation for ages BUT when she wants something it is totally different! Beauty is a sweetheart.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SrShHEbqB0I/AAAAAAAABqM/FjWWdxnUWhw/s1600-h/eddie+izzard.jpg", "http://http//www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/sep/16/eddie-izzard-charity-marathon-mp", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SrShHEbqB0I/AAAAAAAABqM/FjWWdxnUWhw/s1600-h/eddie+izzard.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/09/dance-with-teletubbies.html", "title": "\nDANCE WITH THE TELETUBBIES!\n"},

There's a sort of a tiny potamus, and a tiny nosserus too - But I gave buns to the elephant when I went down to the Zoo! There are badgers and bidgers and bodgers, and a Super-in-tendent's House, There are masses of goats, and a Polar, and different kinds of mouse, And I think there's a sort of a something which is called a wallaboo - But I gave buns to the elephant when I went down to the Zoo!

We visited  San Diego zoo  and  Panama City Beach Zoo  and Beauty loved them both. San Diego Zoo was amazing and it had so many animals to see that Beauty absolutely loved her visit.The other brilliant thing about the zoo was the fact that there were so many animals but they were all cared for so well.The animals all seemed very happy and healthy looking and whilst I understand the need for zoos I have never been to keen on them but this zoo was a wonderful example of how a zoo should be run. Now Panama City Beach Zoo was the tiniest zoo I have ever been in but it was lovely and the animals did seem well cared for and happy.However, the best part of this zoo was the fact it was so small and so I felt it's size helped in making it a wonderful educational facility.We were able to wander around and because of the size easily see everything......twice!

{"date": " July 07, 2010", "body": "\nSome random thoughts about me and my random thoughts! 1. God gives you a free ticket to spend the night with absolutely anybody in the world and the entirety of history \u2013 whom do you choose? Well.....considering I do not believe in God, my first reaction would be to pass out at the shock that God exists and he has actually spoken to me! But a choice of actually anybody? Hitler, to ask him WHY and IS HE SORRY and I would rather meet him in the day! 2. Frankie Howard or Frankie Boyle? (This is a separate question and is not related to no. 1 above.) Mmmm.....neither really so perhaps I`d just go for Frankie and Benny's. 3. What life skill or ability do you wish you possessed? The ability to play the piano. However, I have quite pronounced Clinodactyly and have tried to learn many times but my fingers just will not stretch far enough. 4. If it takes Johnny three hours to fill a bath with water using a colander and a train travelling at 90mph takes 2 hours to reach it\u2019s destination why does Britain no longer have the right to call itself Great? A. First, why did dumb Johnny not turn on the bath taps? B.Second,with the train are we talking `leaves on the line` or `the wrong kind of snow` . Britain will always be GREAT , its greatness has just evolved and changed! 5. Have you ever genuinely wished to be a member of the opposite sex (or are you that already)? Let me see......... What are little boys made of? What are little boys made of? Frogs and snails And puppy-dogs' tails. Uh.....NO! 6. Do you have any embarrassingly weird interests or hobbies \u2013 and if so please explain in detail? My degree  was in History and I specialised in Welsh History but my interest is now Hitler and The Third Reich. I just do not understand WHY or HOW it could happen and the more I read the less I seem to understand. Some of my children think my interest is weird. 7. Dance, Punk, Goth, Metal, Grunge, Pop, Country, Folk or Classical? The choice is yours. Actually, anything but Jazz and Trance! I loathe both. 8. If you could change anything about your current lifestyle / life situation, what would it be? And what would you keep? I would like a new spine and a replacement of all joints. And of course I would keep the joy of my life, my six girls. 9. If you were a packet of crisps what flavour would you be? McCoy's Flame Grilled Steak 10. Describe the sandwich of the gods. Walkers Salt and Vinegar Crisps sandwich  made with thin, cheap white bread.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/07/i-know-i-didnt-get-asked-but.html", "title": "\nI KNOW I DIDN`T GET ASKED BUT.....\n"},
{"date": " September 11, 2009", "body": "\n It seems I am blogging back for good,well it seems that way anyway! As always I am multi-tasking as I write and I am also cleaning at the same time(well not literally but you know what I mean). Somebody who has a very small baby and a toddler asked me yesterday how I could have had children so many times meaning when the whole thing is so exhausting.Well looking back on my life it was probably being 'The busiest bee in the beehive ' thing and the whole desire for the 'Whole Celestial Deal' but now I am definitely way too cynical and it was probably a good thing that I had them when I did or Anastasia would have been an only child(not forgetting her older brother of course). Motherhood definitely takes youthful exuberance to pull the whole thing off. I was 'proper poorly' when I had Beauty at 39, it would probably kill me now! When I go on holiday there are 2 things I tell my children 1.If the animals die do not try and replace them with similar to make me think nothing has happened,I WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE! The animals we have are psychotic and the the pigs we have are brothers and way,way too friendly with each other, so YES I WILL KNOW! 2. If you break something like a fridge,mirror etc tell me because I WILL FIND OUT. This summer whilst we were away I am happy to say the animals are all fine but one of my saucepans went on holiday on it's own to Lourdes and was miraculously healed! I came home to find that my IKEA(no not Le Creuset, blood would have been spilt!)saucepan had been magically fixed and nobody knew how.Because the saucepan is so small it has to be placed very carefully on my cooker or the underside of the handle will get burnt and it has been burned a number of times.Yet I came home to find it was miraculously healed........surely this is a sign? My opinion? Somebody burnt the butt out of the other saucepan and replaced it! I am now eating my lunch whilst writing and my one piece of advice for today is......ASDA's own Tomato Soup is nowhere near as good as Heinz Tomato Soup.   Why PROCRASTINATION can be so off putting!

Yes I am awake really early AGAIN! I awoke suddenly this morning feeling as if my right arm had just been kicked by a donkey. It took me a few minutes to realise that the pain was so bad because I had taken the last of my new singing, all dancing super duper pain killers at 6pm and the effects had worn off. I hadn't taken any meds at 10pm because I was worried that because they were so strong they would keep me awake. However, I am always worried aout taking pain killers due to the possibility of causing further problems. Once you able to make your pain go away, you may think that your problem is also gone. This, in turn, can cause you to lose valuable time that could have been used working toward a cure. Today, many people with advanced stages of cancer, diabetes, and other problems used pain killers to mask pain, instead of solve the underlying problem. If you decide to take pain meds, you may also wind up with more injuries to areas that are in pain. For example, if you have joint pain, you may decide to lift something, or stretch too far. Since the pain killers mask the pain, you will not be aware that you are causing more damage to your body. Regardless of how much you hate being in pain, sometimes you need that signal in order to prevent further damage to your body. Sometimes however the pain is so bad you just think JUST GIVE ME DRUGS! Again,even though I am blogging, I am managing to multi-task! As well as blogging I am doing laundry and I did worry initially that the noise might wake SnoWhite up whose bedroom is off the kitchen but then I remembered THIS IS SNOWHITE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, she could sleep through Fire Alarms!  However,I know from experience that Fiona cannot sleep through earth quakes! Beauty started back at school yesterday and she had a wonderful time. Back with all her mates, computer time, books and toys and play time.........what's not to like? Plus Beauty now has 2 sessions a week with the child minder, a pick up from school on a Monday and the child minders bring her back to the house by 6pm. I love it. And the 2nd child minder is Beauty's original childminder(remember the part-time flight attendant?) so Beauty is really happy.And they took her to JUMP so a good time was had by all.

And I still feel bad about it. But.....he was abusive to me and I am sure he doesn't give a second thought to how he may have upset me. A question ..........I believe his  subsequent behaviour to me was as a direct result of me not being the same religion as him. But why should that matter? Just because I don't think the same way as you, because my life has gone in a different direction to you, because maybe I haven't been as lucky as you,because according to you I may have  sinned, because according to you I may be The Devil's Whore doesn't mean that I am not a good person and a person that has feelings. And why do you behave as if you think only your thoughts and opinions matter and I should care how you feel? Whether I do or don't have a religion or religious feelings the same as yours, doesn't make me a bad person. I live my life the best way I know how. I am sorry if your disapointment of who I am makes you behave the way you do. You need to understand that my life and happiness does not depend on your approval. I never asked for it to.

The problem with Beauty and funny tummys which she seems to get a lot off is that when she gets them she loses a lot of weight each time and then she has to be built up again.She loves crisps and last year I stopped buying them AND then she got sick so I allowed her them again and when she had put on weight again,I stopped them.

I have to apologise for not blogging more often but in the last few months I have just not been well enough,when Beauty is in school I try and sleep to get my energy back and when Beauty is home then computer time is just not happening. THE HOTEL ART I ENJOY TAKING PICTURES OF HOTEL ART THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE SEEN Ariel is home from Syria for a few days but we have seen little of her as she is out and about having lots of fun. She has been to institute, the temple,visiting with S and R  and of course shopping with Fiona in town. SnoWhite will be going to visit Ariel in Syria at the start of the start of April. I pray there will be no international incidents!!!!!! Because I do not have the money or inclination to go to Syria to sort it out.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyGS7s_yrI/AAAAAAAABcQ/rdti0PB__L0/s1600-h/20090327_53.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyAL8svNUI/AAAAAAAABbA/LPnmvPSQdOk/s1600-h/20090327_16.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyALdxNKTI/AAAAAAAABa4/7o97LHjTtgQ/s1600-h/20090327_4.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyAMz58EiI/AAAAAAAABbY/lZUr_oWzpaM/s1600-h/20090327_27.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyAMUz5VkI/AAAAAAAABbQ/t8J9GJZSXQI/s1600-h/20090327_20.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyALxQYUeI/AAAAAAAABbI/mOL07bwx0PA/s1600-h/20090327_19.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyGTcjW9GI/AAAAAAAABcg/YX5BH81zVA0/s1600-h/20090327_15.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyDH2S6YyI/AAAAAAAABb4/7ZCUGw7noOA/s1600-h/20090327_39.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyDHn0Cr7I/AAAAAAAABbw/UjaTCEz_j9I/s1600-h/20090327_36.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyDIBDnnwI/AAAAAAAABcA/yQQglsBBxQk/s1600-h/20090327_51.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyGTaUwIPI/AAAAAAAABcY/Pf7EY0QmSFw/s1600-h/20090327_52.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyDHWVe2tI/AAAAAAAABbo/HLWKAoQrN4A/s1600-h/20090327_35.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ScyDHEFD-1I/AAAAAAAABbg/mvhr5YvKM5w/s1600-h/20090327_30.JPG"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-love-maltesers.html", "title": "\nI LOVE MALTESERS!\n"},
{"date": " April 03, 2009", "body": "\nThe day after the day before........whew! having FMS can create quite a roller coaster life.The day before yesterday was a lot of pain but yesterday was quite a pain free day but a day after pain is usually a recovery day and yesterday was exhausting but very nice. The weather was beautiful for April,a little chilly at times but still very nice. What is it with men and the ability they have to phone when you are in the shower? The phone call was from the plumber and the question was CAN I SERVICE YOUR BOILER? My replyNO I`M IN THE SHOWER! His reply I AM OUTSIDE,CAN I WAIT? My reply NO, GIVE ME 24 HOURS NOTICE.......I HAVE AN 8 YEAR OLD IN HERE WITH THE POOPS! It`s amazing but the price I pay for a yearly service you would think that I was the one in charge of the situation. At lunch time Beauty and I met IT man for lunch and we went to M&S on Newport Road for lunch. Beauty had a great time chomping away on her salt and vinegar crisps, we sat and watched the traffic thunder down Newport Road!The weather was lovely and Beauty really enjoyed herself. IN THE GROUNDS OF THE CHURCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WHERE WE PARKED BEAUTY ON THE CAROUSEL After dropping IT man off, as we were in town and the weather was so nice, Beauty and I went shopping. Yes  I know .......Stand back in amazement......I went into town shopping!My twice yearly venture. ME IN MY `SUMMER OF LOVE` DRESS I bought a dress from Primark which would not have looked out of place in the Summer of Love and a flowery skirt. And I bought a dress and top from Monsoon for Beauty. I am not too keen on going to any shops that you cannot park outside of due to my inability to walk far and knees that collapse on me. Taking Beauty helps though as for longer trip I take her in her buggy/wheelchair and I use the buggy like a zimmer frame! As it was such a nice day I thought it would be good to take Beauty for a walk somewhere as she has been stuck in a lot over the last few weeks due to her funny tummy so I picked Fiona up and we went to Barry Island. WOT`S OCCURRIN!??! BEAUTY LOVES PIZZA On the way we stopped at Pizza Hut in the Bay and had tea,Beauty`s favourite food, PIZZA! FIONA HATES HAVING HER PHOTO TAKEN Beauty was a lot better this time waiting for the order to arrive as she prefers buffet to waiting for an order.Fiona enjoyed it too and I was able to have my favourite AS MUCH SALAD AS YOU CAN EAT! ADVERT FOR LESBIAN VAMPIRE KILLERS ON  BARRY ISLAND Then we drove over to Barry Island. WHAT CAN I SAY BUT BARRY ISLAND WANTS `NO DOGS` Dusk was falling as we got there but it was still a nice walk along the front and Beauty was fascinated by the noisy seagulls. BEAUTY WATCHING THE SEA AND THE SNOGGERS THE SEAGULLS ARE CHEEKY B-GGERS AND WILL STEAL THE FOOD OUT OF YOUR HANDS! MOON OVER THE ISLAND WOULD SOMEBODY BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO CYCLE DOWN HERE? FLOWER BED ON THE ISLAND It was a very tiring day for me and I went to bed with Beauty as soon as we got home but all in all it was very nice. BEAUTY`S LATEST CREATION ON MY STUDY WALL! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWU5jTXqjI/AAAAAAAABf4/HrZIrcBBvsY/s1600-h/008.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWU5d5Ps8I/AAAAAAAABfw/ofqeIy4TXCc/s1600-h/007.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWc8kC3n4I/AAAAAAAABiA/2VNlPl5kjDA/s1600-h/005.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWc8OeoLhI/AAAAAAAABh4/-IpY2qCeKyg/s1600-h/052.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWU56sGw-I/AAAAAAAABgA/gi8MkQw1Zbg/s1600-h/019.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWU6V9AStI/AAAAAAAABgQ/O1GRnuCwv_Y/s1600-h/016.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWU6Ot6ATI/AAAAAAAABgI/fZseLqhqVeg/s1600-h/020.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWaeRpitdI/AAAAAAAABhQ/a0etJyK4HRw/s1600-h/032.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWae80qrKI/AAAAAAAABhY/Ml_M3dW57Zg/s1600-h/034.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWae8xXZ9I/AAAAAAAABhg/aGNq1CTpaZA/s1600-h/040.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWad0IrD2I/AAAAAAAABhA/6n8LygYfWMA/s1600-h/024.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWc7phqqvI/AAAAAAAABho/vL9simj5GLY/s1600-h/028.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWaePNEMxI/AAAAAAAABhI/1WQBFi0Gxhg/s1600-h/025.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdWc8Ld2ctI/AAAAAAAABhw/V1P8niwAQeU/s1600-h/043.JPG"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/04/spring-has-truly-arrived.html", "title": "\nSPRING HAS TRULY ARRIVED\n"},
{"date": " December 01, 2008", "body": "\nIT'S COLD OUT THERE EVERYDAY!' A philosophical question.....if a philosopher says IF YOU CAN NOT SEE IT THEN IT IS NOT THERE why is it that if I do not look at my feet they are still cold? Why if I can not see a baby dying of malnutrition and disease does it still happen? Why if I can not see our guinea pigs do they still squeak for endless supplies of food every time they hear me, surely they do not exist? That premise would surely mean that all racists, bigots and all other nasty people do not exist because I can not see them! Oh I so wish the last were true. I am again awake pre-Beauty, I awoke feeling so hot that I couldn't stay in bed a second longer.So I got up and came downstairs and now I am freezing my arse of with the cold. 6am is definitely to early to be getting all philosophical! My neck is again communicating with me, it is positively srceaming at me and is there a Pollyanna-ism that I can take from this? I suppose there is the fact that I can still feel my neck whilst some poor people can't .....I know.....yeh pretty lame and poncy  so how about if I punched my least favourite person in the head the pain couldn't get any worse! Hardly the spirit of Pollyanna-isms I hear you saying but there isn't anyone who I dislike enough to punch.....wow I am certainly mellowing with age. I was wrong, there are many people on the  Amnesty International  website that I could cheerfully punch, there..... so not so mellow really. Yet again I wish that  Brownies  lived in my house, I wish that I could wake up and find the house clean and all the washing washed, dried and folded. Yeh and man might land on the moon......... I have to pick up my new glasses this morning so the housework will have to wait a little, they are lilac. Beauty's child minder(I love this woman, I couldn't live without her) is going on holiday next week and so Beauty had 2 sessions this week instead of 1.They went out on Saturday and Sunday and it was bliss, with all my wonderful plans in the end I just fell asleep and it was fantastic but I did however find time to eat half a packet of chocolate Hobnobs.......mmmmmmm. Yesterday afternoon as a treat I took Beauty to Smyth's the toy shop  but when we got there she was napping and refused to wake up and go into the shop so I went to Hobby  Craft which is just close by and bought some wool for my scarf knitting. MY LATEST KNITTING CREATION I went to Hobby Craft to buy black wool but I couldn't resist buying this wool, it is lovely to knit with and the colours are beautiful. This is the latest baby basket, it was for SnoWhite's maths tutor, they just had another baby boy.Fiona was appalled that I should give away such a beautiful tin wash tub but they were on sale and cheaper than baskets. the treats are obviously not for the baby(who has not been named yet) but the other children. It must be something in the air or water locally but my list of baby baskets to make is increasing steadily.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amnesty.org.uk/", "http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/brownies/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/STOKF3Q-cmI/AAAAAAAABUY/V6E1vrXpVQc/s1600-h/ME+004.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/STOLGPfyWJI/AAAAAAAABUg/4qOgGix98M8/s1600-h/ME+001.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/STOLGmp_58I/AAAAAAAABUo/Xd5aO_z-lNY/s1600-h/ME+002.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/12/okay-campersrise-and-shineand-dont.html", "title": "\n'OKAY CAMPERS,RISE AND SHINE,AND DON'T FORGET YOUR BOOTIES 'CAUSE IT'S COOOOOOLD OUT THERE TODAY\n"},

Sorry. We have no snow and I am thrilled because it means that Beauty has gone to school. However we do have LOTS of miserable,misty rain. In the last few months I haven't watched a lot of TV.....too busy, too tired,too ill,the 8 year old watching Cbeebies-there was always a reason.Well last night I watched  Lark Rise To Candleford  on BBC i player, I watched the Christmas episode and it was brilliant. Sheridan Smith played a ghost in it and her acting was brilliant and it brought tears to my eyes.I have only seen her play comedy roles but her acting was so good it made me cry. Yep, I'm a sap. Bread withrawl symptoms continue with continuation of healthy eating.You cannot believe how much I miss crusty bread! Tic Tacs and gum are helping but yes I am a Bread aHolic and the cravings are really bad and no I am being serious. Thankfullu I have lost just over 5lbs in weight so that is encouraging me to continue. The weight is going off my tummy rapidly so I have had to take the belt on my jeans in a notch which hopefully means that nobody will think that I am pregnant. Evidence that I Truly ,Madly,Deeply Llove the 8 year old! On Saturday I took Beauty to ToysR us even though I hate the shop......the customer services women there is an old witch! I bought Beauty a Thomas the Tank Engine Aqua Draw AND a High School Musical bag to put it in! Now that is love,allowing HSM in the house! Hopefully it will go the way of the hairdryer.....are you reading this girls. Now that is defintely something you can half-inch(In the words of our cockney Runningman)!

There is a central open courtyard with an overlooking balconey and a roofed living room/sitting area We walked through the Souk but it was not very successful as Beauty did not enjoy walking, next time Beauty will go in her buggy.It was a very similar place to the indoor market that we visited in Turkey but here are a lot more shops.

{"date": " February 28, 2008", "body": "\nOur guinea pigs are so entertaining they never cease to make me laugh. Mostly because their behaviour so reflects human behaviour that they make us laugh on a daily basis. Chunk and Mouth They are especially 'human' in the sense that they never, ever learn from their mistakes! Everyday is the same routine, I get up and they week and screech constantly until they are fed. They have a top quality hutch with an upstairs and a downstairs and on the top floor is a separate room with a poopy tray and  an area that I use as a feeding area and the stair/run way down to the bottom floor. I feed them in the top area to try and keep downstairs clean but every morning is the same , they are so intent on getting the food first that they grab a portion of the food with their teeth AND run! BUT one of them always ends up  falling down the stairs, like  a little fur ball, with their cucumber still in their mouth! Everyday is the same. Mouth, the ginger pig is so protective of his food that he even sleeps on any uneaten cabbage! The family  joke is that one day the  guinea pig hutch is going to completely collapse because even though the little pigs have plenty of food, card and wooden toys to chew on, they have chewed almost every interior ridge of wood off they hutch.   They have  even chewed the  steps off their stairs and  it is now just a plank of wood.  The  family belief is that one day, when the hutch does  collapse,  they   will sit there in the middle of the devastation and have that look on their faces, you know the one children and men get when they are caught and  are in trouble and the only way out is by playing dumb(and it always works so it shows how clever children and men really are)! Then start bitch slapping each other like Tuck and Roll in  A Bug's Life And when the hutch does collapse, the rabbit will have that look on his face which says NOT A CHANCE, THEY ARE NOT COMING IN WITH ME! A TIP When buying a huge IKEA station clock(HUGE!), make sure it is securely attached to the wall. On Tuesday night I was quietly sat at the kitchen table, painting and minding my own business WHEN the kitchen clock fell off the wall and hit me on the head. I have a lump on my head the size of a duck egg. MORE WEIRD DREAMS!       David Hasselhoff  Last night I dreamed that I was at Heathrow Airport to catch a plane to the States and David Hasselhoth was there, he was signing autographs for free but if you wanted your photograph taken with him then you had to pay \u00a330. I declined his kind offer. Beauty is progressing daily,her communication skills are coming along in leaps and bounds. When she is tired and does not want a bedtime story she will communicate this to me by pretending to snore! If that doesn't work and I keep on reading then she resorts to repeatedly saying Shush. She has also been known to kick me off the bed! Beauty has a favourite bedtime story- the Three Little Pigs. Telling Beauty the Three Little Pigs story is like going to a Robbie Williams concert.You know how Robbie doesn't even have to sing the words to the songs as the audience knows the words so well he just turns the microphone towards the audience and they do the singing.Well I only have to say the first word or two of a sentence and Beauty does all the huffing and puffing and blows the houses down. I have a question......(well a few actually) if the Big Bad Wolf  WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN why does he reappear 2 minutes later in Little Red Riding Hood? What was Goldilocks doing in the woods on her own anyway? Why didn't the 3 Bears just put milk on their porridge to cool it down? Why did Daddy Bear and Mummy Bear sleep in separate beds? I tell you, after the trillionth(if I've told you once I've told you a million times,don't exaggerate!) reading of a fairy story,all you want to do is give Goldilock's mother a good slap for letting her wander and tell baby Bear not to be such a baby!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://s93.photobucket.com/albums/l50/seren211000/PIGGIES/?action=view&current=JOSEPHS032.jpg", "http://s93.photobucket.com/albums/l50/seren211000/?action=view&current=FRONTGARDEN005.jpg", "http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://us.movies1.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/hv/photo/movie_pix/walt_disney/a_bug_s_life/tucknroll2-th.jpg&imgrefurl=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800019794/photo/stills&h=64&w=75&sz=3&hl=en&start=43&sig2=g2QiXHQxDiprRb0OStXSMg&um=1&tbnid=w9fWVswWW9SDQM:&tbnh=61&tbnw=71&ei=21zGR_WANo6MwAGUnZmPDw&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dtuck%2Band%2Broll%2Ba%2Bbug%2527s%2Blife%26start%3D40%26ndsp%3D20%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1B3GGGL_enGB214GB245%26sa%3DN", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3785805.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/02/once-upon-time.html", "title": "\nONCE UPON A TIME.....\n"},

{"date": " February 14, 2008", "body": "\nI think in the life of every Blogger comes a natural sabbatical.....and the last 2 weeks was mine!How it happened I am not too sure, it was really a combination of things. One of our computers is down and so access is a major problem coupled with the fact that Fiona and Beauty are on half-term holiday from school, getting a look in on the computer is a difficult thing.Beauty and Fiona fight over the computer in the day and invariably in the night it is Sno-White and Fiona! The only answer is to get up early! Life trudges on with little change.Anastasia was home for a holiday last week but has gone back to Austria,it was nice to have adult conversation in the house.Anastasia had an enjoyable time .....shopping!She bought plenty of clothes and books to take back with her, definitely my kind of holiday! Ariel was also home for a short break and whilst she adds to the adult conversation, it is usually LOUD adult conversation! I have also just had a birthday and my children bought me many beautiful presents.I especially wanted a jet-wash(yes I know it is a strange present!) to use to clean my car and clean out the fluff-chamber on my condenser dryer!And yes the jet-wash duly arrived and is beautiful. On Tuesday I went to the hospital for some results on a scan I had done on some large lumps in my throat, thankfully they are all benign which is good news because my mother died of cancer which started with lumps in her throat.It wasn't all good news though! On arrival I had to get a lift from the ground floor to the first floor where the clinics were situated because I had Beauty with me in her wheelchair /buggy. Anyway, when I got in the lift 2 girls got in with toddlers in buggies plus a man in his 60's who was tall,well built and using a walking stick.The man looked at the 2 girls who were both wearing full length black Islamic dress and said I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!I was so shocked because his manner was so aggressive and he was really quite scary.The girl stood next to me also had her face covered apart from her eyes and she quickly replied to the question NO! I looked at the other girl who was stood opposite me and smiled and rolled my eyes and smiled and she did the same and we exchanged pleasantries regarding our children and when the lift doors opened we all disappeared into the crowd.But the gravity of the situation stayed with me. I could tell from the accents of the girls that they had probably grown up in Cardiff and their English was as good as any other person who lived in Cardiff.Yet here they were having to put up with an aggressive man questioning them. I have a friend who is a nun in a convent in London and her order also has a house in Cardiff.The last time that I spoke to her she told me that the majority of new nuns joining her order were coming from the Far East.It made me wonder if 2 nuns from the   Far East had  entered the lift would the man  have questioned them in the same way? I felt the girls dealt with the situation in the right way because if they had become aggressive back then the man could have become violent, with a stick , in a small space. Why do people behave in such a way? It just isn't necessary.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-can-i-say.html", "title": "\nWHAT CAN I SAY?\n"},

Corrie Hotpot                                                      This hotpot's a favourite at The Rovers. Betty Turpin, who\u2019s been behind the bar since the summer of 1969, makes a great one.                                                          1\u00bd lbs. lamb neck meat - cubed 1\u00bd lbs. potatoes, leave skin on and slice thinly 1 large onion, chopped 1\u00bc cup stock or water 3 oz butter or cooking oil or bacon fat \u2013 or 1 \u00bd oz each butter and oil 1 tablespoon flour 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 bay leaf salt and pepper to taste   Pre-heat the oven to 325 F. Sear meat on all sides over high heat in butter, oil or butter/oil combination, reduce heat to medium and cook until evenly browned. When browned put meat in deep oven-proof casserole.  In same pan, saut\u00e9 onions in pan juices, adding more butter, oil or fat if needed. When they begin to turn brown, sprinkle with flour.  Stir until roux begins to brown, stir in a little stock or water \u2013 stir quickly to avoid lumps. Stirring constantly, add remaining liquid and bring to a simmer. Add Worcestershire and season to taste. Pour onions and liquid over meat, mix well and add bay leaf. Layer potatoes over meat, seasoning each layer with salt and pepper. Cover and cook in oven for two hours, 1/2 hour uncovered.  Note - brush potatoes with butter or oil if they appear dry   ENJOY!  I have also been making ONE POT MEALS  for the rest of us and it is so much easier than cooking the usual meals that we have. Everyones favourite is Corned Beef Hash Pie but I have also made fish pie using Coley with a mashed potato topping, beef pie with pastry and a variety of vegetarian pies. I am busy searching the internet for other pies and I think that my next attempt will be some kind of cobbler. My children think I am a brilliant cook but as I have told them many times, I am just good at multi-tasking-a microwave technician.The only person who appreciates what I say is SnoWhite's friend as he worked in a local restaurant and basically he was a microwave technician and we probably have the same amount of cooking ability! Beauty however is so not interested in my cooking if it is not pizza or fish fingers or tomato sauce! Children can be such strange creatures. I am not that interested in watching celebrity cooking shows (do not get me started on Nigella Lawson)but when I am occasionally  sitting with Fiona and she is  'couch commander'  we do  sometimes get to watch a bit of a cooking show and I am just shocked at the poncy food that they shuffle out. I am on a diet and managing to lose weight but the amount of food they manage to produce for a meal is not enough to fill even my hopefully shrinking stomach. I look at the meals that they produce and invariably think - A PLATE OF CHIPS WITH THAT WOULD BE PERFECT!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/coronation/hotpot.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/02/bettys-hotpot.html", "title": "\nBETTY'S HOTPOT\n"},

I am so glad  to be  at home and able to sit  quietly in my living room and  read my books,  write  my letters and do my art work.....oh what an exciting life  that I lead. At the moment I am attempting to read Mansfield Park by Jane Austen but I am really finding it hard going, it just seems to drag and I have totally lost all interest in Edmund and Fanny .....actually I think a good slap for them both would make me feel a lot better! This reading of Mansfield Park reminds me of when  I read Midnight's Children by Salman Rushdie , I had been very interested in reading the book for a while as it sounded really good but I apologise here and now to Mr Rushdie and all of his fans because when I started to read it I felt it to be the most boring,long winded book that I had ever encountered. I admit to being a Philistine! I persisted in finishing it but it left little in my memory. Alongside of  Mansfield  Park I am now reading for a little light relief(!)  The Lost Life of Eva Braun  by Angela Lambert.When I was in school the teaching of World War II  was not something that happened in too much detail and  in my degree I studied mostly Medieval Welsh history   so I felt for a while that I should read a little more on 20th  century history.I had always wondered about Eva Braun and  so far the book seems very good. I apologise for not have blogged earlier but access to the internet is severely limited to  one computer being temporarily out of action. Yesterday evening Fiona wanted to work on the computer so Beauty was relegated to watching videos in the middle room.....BIG MISTAKE!! She watched videos and trashed the room at the same time. Beauty's speech has increased amazingly in the last few weeks and she is so much better with actual communication. Whilst on holiday we were at the restaurant table and I asked Beauty something and she replied by saying I HAVE FINISHED MY DINNER.Well I was absolutely floored, I was so taken back. That is such a huge improvement. Yesterday I returned to my art class and was thrilled by a 16 year old student sitting next to me who seemed genuinely surprised that in a few days I will be 47.Actually whether she was genuinely surprised or not I don't care as the  sentiment made my day. My next finished piece of work has to be in by  Monday, it is a self portrait! I have chosen to paint  myself in a  landscape  and the reason is?

I left Fiona and SnoWhite to happily wander and buy their Christmas presents.Tesco did not seem as bad as usual due to the fact that all the tills were open and things seemed to be moving pretty quickly , I think that when I go shopping next I will definitely have to use a shopping scooter. Recently , after  not having watched the show in a long time, I have taken to watching Eastenders again!(SORRY).   I tend to do my artwork whilst sat at a small folding table in the living room,  so I tend to have the TV on plus I am needing to take more rests between activity so overall I am sitting down  more - well that's my excuse and I am sticking to it. I know it's only a story but the whole homelessness issue with  Billy and Honey and the children is making me angry. They have been evicted from their flat because Phil Mitchel sold the house and the new landlord wanted double the rent  and Billy couldn't afford it and they were thrown out on the streets without the landlord going through the courts. Billy and Honey  First of all I would like to punch Phil Mitchel in the head(who wouldn't?) for selling the house and being so unsympathetic but most of all I am angry that situations like this can still happen in the 4th richest nation in the world. Billy may not be the sharpest tool in the box but he works as hard as he can but he always seems to get the bum deal. As with Special Needs Education, I think many areas of the social care system benefit those who SHOUT THE LOUDEST. I watched a program the other night on TV Called  Growing Up Skint          Growing Up Skint  follows the lives of young people in three cities around the country. However different their family lives and ethnic backgrounds may be, they all have one thing in common: a chronic lack of cash. Yet despite missing out on what many families take for granted - school trips, books, birthday treats and holidays - we'll see how they try and defy the odds to succeed and survive. I really feel that the system does not help and encourage those who really want to work hard and provide for their families. When I grew up in the 60's my family were very poor due to my father's ill health and times were really hard but after watching Growing Up Skint I can honestly say that for many today the situation is no better and I would say for many a lot worse. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.gm.tv/media/images/g/h/billy75.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.gm.tv/index.cfm%3Farticleid%3D9876&h=75&w=75&sz=3&hl=en&start=6&sig2=T-bTrT52cXuZwjFv2ajYvQ&um=1&tbnid=I85TzatghTtfWM:&tbnh=71&tbnw=71&ei=2s9sR4bMBIqOwQGw1ZntDw&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dbilly%2Band%2Bhoney%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/born_survivors/skint.shtml"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/12/christmas-is-coming.html", "title": "\nCHRISTMAS IS COMING\n"},

Due to the rules about not taking pictures of the other children in the school I do not have a photo yet but I will post one as soon as possible. We all want to go and see Enchanted and so we might go as a family,Beauty has never been to the cinema before so that will be something to look forward to but as she absolutely loves the dark I am hoping we will not have too many problems.I have seen clips from Enchanted on the Disney Channel for a long time now and it looks very funny.

{"date": " December 11, 2007", "body": "\nA very cold night last night- well for Cardiff anyway, I so would not want to be living further north at this time of year.Outside is very frosty and glittery, thankfully sunshine is forecast for all day. Yesterday I couldn't understand why the car wouldn't work properly and  was slow to pull away from stationary.Somehow the Snow Button on the car had been pushed and so the car  had generally slowed down for snowy conditions.(which shows how much I know about cars-well apart from watching  Top Gear and seeing middle aged men destroy cars!)I did use the snow button once last year when we had a blizzard   and the snow didn't melt even under the heavy use of Cardiff traffic  but Cardiff  is more likely to have rain  than  snow.I think it is something to do with living on the Bristol Channel.When we stayed in New Orleans  it seemed to rain every day but the rain lasted 5 minutes and it dried up straightaway and was gone, a pity Cardiff can't be a bit more like that. Due to the weather my house is like a laundry,Beauty wipes her hands into her clothes when her hands are dirty-constantly! Yesterday she came home from school covered from top-to-toe in red paint, and then she had to be changed again after eating her tea. Her bedding has to be changed regularly as she still wears nappies to bed and Fiona still baths using 3 large bath towels and changes her clothes every hour! We also have throws over all of the furniture because the furniture is getting a bit tatty  PLUS Beauty also gets the sofa filthy. I have seen the most beautiful sofa that I would like but it seems pointless to buy it with Beauty still in destruction mode.I wash the clothes and dry them overnight on a clothes horse/dryer and then finish them off in a tumble dryer, for financial reasons as well as environmental ones.Todays sunshine looks like we good have a good bit of drying weather so I think it is time to wash throws. On some streets in Cardiff we have a number of pod-type super loos that self-clean after use, the whole of the inside is washed down and dried .I wish my house were like that PLUS I wish that children could also go through the same process. I had the final mark yesterday for my art project for my AS Level ART  and I got an A which I am really pleased with. For the final piece I did a tree and the marker felt that I could have done more detail into the tree but that was how I wanted the tree to look. I told the lecturer that I would have been happy to have done another painting because I didn't want to add to the painting that I had done but they said not to bother as I had an A and there was no real point. At present we are doing a portraiture project and as well as my large presentation folder I am also filling a small A5 sketchbook with portraits and the more I do the better I really seem to get. I really do not have much natural talent when it comes to portraiture but I have learnt the techniques and the more that I draw the better I rally seem to get at creating likenesses of people.I am not sure what I should do as a final piece for this project, I have been considering a water colour of my mother but my lecturer thinks a picture of one of my girls might be a good idea.

A question, how can I possibly have a headache when I take copious amounts of painkillers  for arthritis,lump pains etc! Beats me.

They invited parents to attend a Harvest Festival  service and then the coffee morning, Beauty took in some Baked Beans,  Pease  Pudding, Tuna and Sweetcorn to donate. When I picked Beauty up this afternoon they had all the donations in the hall and they really seemed to have a lot of donations. The school was festooned with lots of pink balloons and streamers, a definite PINK PARTY. The male helper in Beauty's class wore a black shirt with an In The Pink bow pinned on but one of the other male helpers in another class was braver and wore a very pink shirt.

{"date": " November 02, 2007", "body": "\nWell Beauty definitely seemed to be feeling better so when she fell asleep early I took her to her bed and thought she would be there for the night! Well not quite...... During our 275th watching of Mean Machine(I'm a Brit Flick fan, it comes on TV, I watch it) Beauty awakes, a bit of a temperature but basically seems OK. AND then she proceeds to be ill .......EVERYWHERE! My washing machine is again on what seems to be overdrive BUT Beauty  has awoken this morning seemly as well as she was yesterday morning, she is again dancing to High School Musical! It may be chilly outside but I am sure glad that the sun is shining and that I have a garden with a washing line. Anastasia lives in Vienna and typical to other European cities the majority of residents live in apartments, they have a laundry room in their basement but I just could not cope without having a washing line. When we were having our extension built a few years ago  and the back garden resembled a bomb site, I used to take my drying over to Runningman's flat because they have communal drying areas in the gardens. When the Anastasia and Belle were little we lived in a flat in Oxford and the flats had communal drying areas on the top of the flats, we had a brilliant view over Oxford's Dreaming Spires. Fiona and I played a game of Scrabble last night, if Beauty had been awake it would have been impossible as she would have wanted to stack and line up all the tiles. There may be Beauty as well but in many ways Fiona is still the youngest, of the oldest girls anyway and I remember what that was like. I remember my older sisters and brother no longer being interested in Halloween, getting up late on Christmas Day and generally growing up and no longer being interested in childish things.Not that I can imagine Fiona dressing up for Halloween(of course when she is in Uni things will change!) but I have to remember that Fiona, Ariel and Beauty have had a different childhood to the older girls and remember to do things with them. However, as far as Christmas is concerned I don't think any of them will ever really grow up. My girls were shocked and really felt sorry for Dimitri when they found out that because his family is German their main Christmas celebration is on Christmas Eve and not Christmas morning. They also really felt sorry for the Dimitri and his sister and brother when they found out that they usually have money for Christmas and not a sackful of presents like them. BUT I spend only \u00a3100 on each of the girls for Christmas on gifts whilst I am sure that Dimitri and his brother and sister get lots more BUT it was the whole lack of opening of presents that the girls found  so un-Christmassy. GHOSTS AND THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT! On my 7 most interesting things list I mentioned that I had seen 2 'GHOSTS' so for Steve and anyone else who may be interested, here is an account of my encounter with ghostly apparitions. When I was 15 I was lying in my bed with my eyes shut but I was NOT asleep and I was NOT dreaming and I opened my eyes to see a semi-solid grey figure standing by the side of my bed. The figure disappeared and I heard no noises and the door of my bedroom did not open or close, what it was I couldn't tell you. Then a few years ago I was  lying on the sofa in my living room in the day time with my eyes closed, again I was NOT asleep and I was NOT dreaming, when I became aware that something was directly in front of me. I said,' DON'T TOUCH ME'(as you would to a ghost!) and I opened my eyes and there in front of my face was a head shaped semi-solid  grey 'THING'. As soon as I opened my eyes the shape which appeared to be attached to the far upper corner of the room, retracted backwards and disappeared. What it was I do not know. In    Regeneration which is about the poet Siegfried Sassoon and his experiences during the First World War, the psychiatrist discusses how many things we see may be a creation of our own minds, especially during that almost asleep/almost awake time. I really do not know but I do believe that the human brain has amazing capacities that we as yet do not know how to harness.For example, Poltergeist  activity tends to occur around a single person called an agent or a focus. Foci are often, but not limited to, pubescent  children. Almost seventy years of research by the  Rhine Research Center  in  Raleigh-Durham ,  North Carolina , has led to the hypothesis among parapsychologists that the \"poltergeist effect\" is a form of  psychokinesis  generated by a living human mind (that of the agent).

{"date": " September 20, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday I took Fiona to 'WHAT' on Newport Road to buy Art supplies for her GCSE class and I never cease to be amazed at that shop. It is a CHEAP shop or POUND shop but it isn't necessarily the price of the purchases but the service that you receive that always impresses me. Yesterday, because the weather has turned, I decided that I needed to buy some blue plastic tarpaulins to put over the Rabbit hutch and the Guinea pig hutch in the garden. In WHAT there is a large DIY/car department so I thought that I would look there whilst Fiona was looking through the rest of the shop. Now in WHAT there are staff on the shop floor all the time filling shelves and on the DIY department it always seems to be the same person so when I couldn't find the Tarpaulins I went up to the guy putting out stock and I asked him and he knew straight away that they had sold out of the product. Not like ASDA or TESCO where they say OH I DON'T KNOW BUT I'LL CHECK FOR YOU!  Larger stores locally(I don't know what the situation is across the rest of the UK) seem to employ the majority of their staff part-time as this is better financially for the employer.This means that in larger stores they really do not get enough time to know the stock that well as they are there so few hours and are constantly being moved from department to department. Also in WHAT they do not use a bar code system, the  till operators and the shelf fillers learn the prices of the products because of constant access to the product and this means that you ask them a question WHERE, HOW MUCH and they know the answer straight away. Here I am going to start to sound like a bit of a Luddite but I really feel that technology may increase productivity  and profits but it definitely does not always make for better service. WHAT may  not have ALL SINGING. ALL DANCING SHELF DISPLAYS AND TECHNOLOGY but what they lack in technology they make up for in service. I know many people will find this hard to believe in a woman but I REALLY do have a phobia for shops, specially large supermarkets but WHAT never makes me feel that way. I find that the smaller the shop and the less time I am in them the better, perhaps with WHAT it is because the shop is run on a more traditional basis that it doesn't  bother me so much.

{"date": " September 22, 2007", "body": "\nThat rat and I are going to have a serious falling out! This morning at 2:30am, yep you heard that right! Ariel decided to return from a church dance which had been in Reading. Ariel went to her first dance for single adults who are over the age of 18 in the church and she went without a door key so I had to let her in when she got back. I was unceremoniously awoken at 2:30am by the phone and Ariel saying I'M AT THE BACKDOOR,LET ME IN! Well I did but remember my recent eco-drive has meant no lights on anywhere at night so when I went into the kitchen to open the door I had forgotten about the rat who was still on the cooker......so when I switched on the light I was a just a little bit more than surprised.And there he was again this morning, still on the cooker and still surprising me! I think for the sake of my nerves he is going to have to go. I am being as quiet as possible, the animals are still asleep and quiet,so is Fiona(always good), and Beauty and Ariel. The reason for being quiet is that if I let Ariel sleep then the longer it takes before I have to drive down to Exeter to take her to university. I am quite happy for her to go, she has only been back a few days since Florida and she is driving me mad with her noise. It is constant, loud, irrelevant and I swear she IS somewhere on a scale when it comes to Tourettes. Ariel assures me that in classes she is quiet but I am not totally convinced as I have memories of her and her best friend being in trouble for constant chatter. It is so strange to have Ariel go to university as she is so young in lots of ways. I am convinced though it is to do with the school that she went to as a number of her friends are the same. When Ariel was 8 the Assisted places were being phased out and she got one of the last rising 8 places at the best private school in Wales and she has been there ever since. The children are all together from 4 to 18 year olds and in the same building which is an old country house approximately 5 minutes away from the house in Old St Mellons. At 8 she wore a boater, had plaits and still played with the Tellietubbies, and I feel that the school cushioned them in many ways from the rest of the world. She also went to church twice a week , every week whilst she was growing up and so had quite a different childhood from the other children locally. Whilst educationally sound I would say in lots of ways Ariel and some of her mates are a good 2 years behind the rest of her peers but don't get me wrong I do not think this is a bad thing.They are all sweet, very nice girls and having 6 girls, through the years I have come across some' not so nice girls'. The 'not so nice girls 'seem to be amongst a group they call THE ELITE( the popular crowd) in school,whose family either have a little bit of money or they just think they are better. Well this never seemed to happen in Ariel's school as it was a private school and the families were all paying for them to be there so they were all elite in their own way but you would never have thought it. They were just nice , genuine girls. I think Ariel will cope very well with  Uni as she has been going away with cadets for quite a few years now and always enjoys it, of course she is nervous but I know she will love it. However, will I be able to cope with the quiet? LET ME SEE..........\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/road-trip.html", "title": "\nROAD TRIP\n"},

{"date": " August 31, 2007", "body": "\nI seem to have been spending most of the last few days trailing around the colleges in South East Wales looking for a an Art course for Fiona to start in September. How can so many colleges have such different course? I would have thought they would have all been the same. Coleg Glan Hafren in Cardiff doesn't even really have a basic Art course, they have a joint Art and Media course but nothing just Art. We seem to have shortlisted to Cross Keys and Barry so it is make your mind up time for Fiona. A few years ago I did a GCSE in Art and got an A, it may sound like I am bragging but I was really pleased with the result. In school I got a fail in Art even though everyone thought my work was really good, the art teacher didn't like me and then that could effect the way your work was marked. All the exam work was marked by the teacher and a sample of the work was sent off to the examining board to see if the work was marked fairly, my work was not part of the sample. I may not be brilliant at art but I am creative and I do lots of work which is why I received an A. So this year I am going to attempt to fulfill my ambition of getting an A level in Art. I have enrolled at Cross Keys College to do an AS in Art, the first year of an Art A Level. On Tuesday night I watched a little bit of a comedy called Outnumbered, it is about a family and the father is a teacher. Outnumbered is a new comedy from Guy Jenkin and Andy Hamilton, the creators of Drop The Dead Donkey, about the daily rollercoaster of life with small children. Outnumbered is comedy about two parents and three young children, locked in an unequal contest.  It is an honest portrayal of the well-meaning parental incompetence that happens in most homes, as a beleaguered Mum and Dad attempt to raise their kids with the minimum of emotional damage for all concerned. Three children are: Karen, a regal five-year-old girl with a talent for interrogation, seven-year-old Ben, who could out-fib Jeffrey Archer and eleven-year-old Jake who is gearing up for his scary first day at secondary school. The parents are played by Claire Skinner and Hugh Dennis. The Dad works in an inner city school, where a typical school holidays sees five arrested, two pregnant and one pupil shot.                          Meanwhile, Mum is a part-time PA with a very demanding boss. Other topics explored in the part improvised show include: racism, child abuse, new age weirdness, weak bladders, death and heaven, bird 'flu, contagious diseases, bullying, obesity, parental competition, attempting romantic nights in, divorce, journalism, running away, atoms, underage drinking, gin, corn-fed organic chickens, Nazis and ratbags.           Some of it was really quite funny. I did feel guilty laughing at one joke because some people might think it was bordering on racism  but I actually thought in a way it was quite a natural thing to say.The father who is a teacher, made a comment to a pupil who was Muslim and  was large and constantly eating in class about wishing it was Ramadan all the time. The father of the child complained that the teacher was being racist and had traumatised the child by  referring to his weight as the weight problem was glandular.To which the teacher asked did the glandular problem make the child stuff pies into his mouth. I have an under active thyroid which I regularly take medication for and find it difficult to lose weight but I found the comment funny and so true. I may have a thyroid problem but it is certainly my love of bread and all things carbs that stops me losing weight. It is important to be PC today because of not wanting people to take offense at things. When I was growing up I was bullied because I had red/ginger hair but I went to a wrestling show last year and one of the baddies said that Wales was like the ginger step-child of the UK and I found it funny because I knew it was a joke. Making comments and jokes about culture and race is such a mine field today that it is best to leave well alone. I also watched Outrageous Wasters and the Dad was black and when her had to shovel up the pig poo he commented Why is it always the black man? which was a very natural comment BUT only funny because he said it. It is sad that we live in a world that has to be so PC but if we didn't have certain social rules on what it  is OK to say then some people might take advantage and be unkind.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/08/making-your-mind-up.html", "title": "\nMAKING YOUR MIND UP\n"},

She was off work due to diarrhea on the 21st of this month but went back to work the next day because she was afraid that her supervisor would be angry with her.She told her supervisor she was still unwell when she signed her return to work form AND THE supervisor knew she was still unwell but allowed her to work ........ in the restaurant. Ariel was called to a meeting to discuss her absence and I went with her as her representative. The restaurant manager asked her the same question a total of 5 times-if she felt she had been fit to work  when she returned .I encouraged Ariel to have the situation clarified, I advised Ariel that the manager was intimidating her to say she felt well enough to return to work. How Ariel FELT was irrelevant, the law states that she should not have returned within 48 hours of the symptoms. In the interview, Ariel who is 17 was bullied by the front of house manager in the meeting and the front of house manager said that I could only ask for clarity and an adjournment, I was not allowed to discuss the bullying behaviour. When I tried to discuss it the front of house manager told me it was not my place to give her feedback on her behaviour so I advised Ariel to ask for clarity on the intimidating behaviour and she said that she understood what was happening. Ariel confirmed that there was a culture of intimidation and bullying in IKEA  Cardiff restaurant to make people return to work before they were ready, that was why she returned the next day even though she still  felt unwell. Others have told her it is better to come to work ill and be sent home.This last Monday when Ariel returned to work after a 3 day  Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme Expedition she was told off by the supervisor and intimidated by the supervisor about her absence even though IKEA knew about her involvement in Army Cadets and the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when she first started in the job. Who remembers this report? LINK Ikea's filthy kitchens of shame Nov 1 2006 Katie Jones, South Wales Echo         Customers at Cardiff's Ikea restaurant were served food on filthy plates from an 'unacceptably' dirty kitchen. That was the conclusion of a damning inspection report at the flagship store. Internal safety inspectors also found soap was missing for staff to wash their hands. And chicken which was past its use-by date was being served. Ikea says all the findings have now been addressed but customers are shocked. Regular user Darryl Beaver, 46, of Barry, said: 'It's disgusting.'         So IKEA Restaurant Cardiff WANTS their restaurant workers to work, even one day after having diarrhea, and their absence for diarrhea is investigated EVEN when the supervisor and the front of restaurant manager knows the employee has had diarrhea. Will I ever feel safe eating in IKEA again? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/southwalesecho/news/tm_headline=ikea-s-filthy-kitchens-of-shame&method=full&objectid=18026855&siteid=50082-name_page.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/dont-get-me-started-on-ikea.html", "title": "\nDON'T GET ME STARTED ON IKEA!\n"},
{"date": " July 21, 2007", "body": "\nNo more Harry Potter books to queue up for at midnight! I have tried many, many times to read a Harry Potter book but I have always failed, after a few pages I seem to lose interest and fail to complete reading the book. I think it is because my children have told me(in detail-repeatedly) exactly what happens that it holds no interest. However, as a mother, I feel that J.K.Rowling has finished the books well. If she had killed off any of the characters my children LOVE I think I would have been very unhappy with her. My children know my feelings regarding people who hurt or upset them, for instance, Ariel will be doing a course at  DEEPCUT (yes DEEPCUT) and I have previously told her that if anything happens to her I will hunt them down for the rest of time , she doesn't think it is funny! Back to Harry Potter, I have traipsed the length and breadth of the British Isles with their love of Harry Potter, from an interview in an Edinburgh Park with the BBC ,to an interview in the Cafe where the first book was written, to a TV documentary in Surrey and to a premier in London. Just one more film to go.........however I think the love of Harry Potter will live on! My parents were heavy smokers and one died of a heart attack and the other cancer, I think it was because of seeing them smoking and their illnesses I never smoked, not even once. I think that having lots of children has had the same effect on my girls, whilst I think they will all have at least 2(though SnoWhite insists she will have none-we shall see!) I don't think they will have large families. I see Anastasia with 2 boys and a big slobbery dog, I see them as Berber jacket wearing,green wellie wearing and jeep driving. I also see Belle with 2 boys and a slobbery dog(Woody of course) but I see them wearing American football shirts and Cons and driving a truck. SnoWhite I see marrying a Ron Weasley look-a-like and having LOTS of red, frizzy haired babies and the children all wearing flowered wellies(even the boys!), rainbow coloured clothes and driving a VW BUS! Ariel I see driving a hummer whilst wearing a baseball cap and a white track suit with a girl and a boy called Chaneese and Dwayne. Whereas with Fiona I can see little girls dressed is clothes made from Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston fabric in a big country house with lots of animals and driving again a VW BUS but there is a blank as far as a man is concerned! And for Beauty I can see no further than her being permanently attached to a computer at the moment but things will change. Well those are my predictions anyway, I am sure that reality will be completely different.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Royal_Barracks,_Deepcut"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/thank-goodness-it-is-over_21.html", "title": "\nTHANK GOODNESS IT IS OVER.\n"},

Pupils were sent home from St Richard Gwyn High School on Friday                              There has however been flooding at the bottom of my sister's road and at my nieces school, they live in Barry which is only a few miles away. A lot of the guests at the wedding that SnoWhite and Ariel went to yesterday also had difficulties getting to the wedding as they came from up around the border -Hereford, Gloucester and Worcester which has seen a lot of flooding. The only problem we are experiencing is so much rain is causing next doors garden to smell( the dog poop neighbours!).             Torrential rain left several parts of Barry under water on Friday                           SnoWhite cried last night when she read that a certain young man from Hogwarts had died. However, if it had been a different young man from Hogwarts who had died she would have been inconsolable. Enough said as Ariel hasn't yet read the book. I realise that when I talk about my arthritis - back pain- Dercum's it must sound like I am a complete moaner........Sorry! I never though about it that way. I actually do not consider myself to be sick-I only think of myself as sick when I have a cold or something viral. I am lucky to have Fiona and SnoWhite to watch Beauty when I need to lie down because of the pain in my back or joints. As I have a day bed off the kitchen where I lie down I still feel as if I am part of everything that is going on and I usually lie down until the pain killers kick in. I do have a wheelchair but my back only feels better if I lie down for at least an hour, there appears to be as much pressure on my back sitting as standing. Even the piggies go quiet when I lie down but the moment I sit up on the bed to get up they start wheeking like crazy, their hearing is so good they know when I am moving. Oh it is so nice to be loved that much! With Beauty as long as she has plentiful supplies of 'you-gut', pizza, fish, crisps and chocolate she is happy but she is just as happy for her sisters to feed her as me thank goodness.

{"date": " July 19, 2007", "body": "\nSorry I didn't blog yesterday girls but I was too exhausted. The lease on  Snowhites  flat runs out on the 31 July so she has been looking for a new flat with little success. However, earlier in the week Fiona, Ariel and I stopped and looked at flats to rent in a flat shop in  Cathays  and found a couple of 2 bedroom flats for her to see. 1 was in Column Road and the other Wordsworth Avenue and on Tuesday we got  SnoWhite  and her mate to view them and they took the one on Wordsworth Avenue. I think they are very lucky to get the flat as it is quite special, it is a garden basement flat in a Victorian house in a tree lined street and  it has a small garden at the front and quite a large paved garden at the back. The lounge/ dining room is very big and there are 2 double bedrooms and  SnoWhite's  bedroom has a door that leads out onto the back garden. The living room floor is being re-laid and the kitchen re-fitted before they move in and it is just as cheap as the rental on living in a shared house. I have promised to paint  SnoWhite  a picture of a boomerang for the flat because she is a boomerang girl who always ends up coming back home! She came to house sit when I went on holiday in January and never went back to her flat-let's hope that a 2 bed flat share works better. I think that  SnoWhite  may want to be on her own but she gets lonely when she is in a flat on her own. On Tuesday  night she stayed the night at her mates house in  Roath  and I had to pick her and her mate up to get them to the flat shop to sign the contracts by 12 mid-day but when I got there they were still asleep so we got to the shop a few minutes late.AND then she didn't have her cheque book so we had to go to my house and then her flat to look for it-luckily we found it in the flat. We also went to the bank in  Roath  twice and the bank in Canton once to get cash for the deposit and the flat shop fee. AND  SnoWhite  insisted on going to the baguette shop on  Senghennyd  Road because they had a better vegetarian choice of baguette! We just got to Beauty's school in time to pick her up without being late. By the time we got home I was seriously considering batting her around the head or hiding all her  WESTLIFE   CD's . Fiona watched Beauty whilst I lay down and I took some pain killers for my then very painful back and joints and I passed out for approximately 3 hours! Most days I lie down a lot due to the  pain in my back but if I nap it is usually a very short nap of about half an hour and then I feel lots better. Well after my long sleep yesterday I was walking around like an old woman-no I wouldn't say I walked, I hobbled. Tomorrow is Beauty's last day of school before the summer holidays, there is no  play scheme  this year so I see our summer being filled with visits to the beach, the park, the farm, the museum and St  Fagans -all the places that Beauty loves to visit. We have had sunshine now for 2 days and it is very pleasant. I was sat in the car yesterday waiting for  SnoWhite  to come out of the bank and the smell of the heat in the air reminded me of the summers when I was young ,playing on the field behind my house.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/i-blame-snowhite.html", "title": "\nI BLAME SNOWHITE!\n"},
{"date": " July 20, 2007", "body": "\nWe were awake this morning at stupid o'clock, I was awoken to the music coming from the Beauty and the Beast video-well I suppose it could have been worse! Last night I watched a TV program Nazi Pop Twins-it was a documentary about  Prussian Blue  who are a nationalist folk duo in the USA. There is no way that I agree with the ideologies promoted by the family but I was more concerned with the psychological damage all this propaganda appears to be having on the girls. They just do not appear to believe the things their mother believes and their mother was just not able to accept this. There was also one point when the mother called one of the twins a C_NT, I was just stunned that the mother would use this word on camera. School boys, drunk men and Brit Flicks are the only time I have  EVER heard this word used and as a nurse I have not led a sheltered life but hearing this word used by a mother in the context of family life was shocking. SOME KIM AND AGGIE  PICTURES                                                             I have a some photographs of a certain bedroom that Kim and Aggie might like to see! I also watched  Kim and Aggie  last night, Fiona and I LOVE watching How Clean is your House and of course Anthea's  Perfect Housewife  but I wonder sometimes why we bother because we watch half of the show behind our hands it is so bad. Kim and Aggie appear to concentrate on really filthy houses and Anthea on very cluttered and untidy houses and I definitely agree with the analysis on Wikipedia  The show is light-hearted and often camp , falling more into the entertainment category than the factual genre. Much of the appeal comes from the almost voyeuruistic  pleasure of seeing how untidy some people let their houses become (many have not been cleaned for years), though the cleaning tips add some practical value to the show. Every time I watch the program I have a huge impulse to hire a skip to sort out my garage( and SnoWhites bedroom). From the 1 August all of SnoWhites possessions will have' left the building' and I will have plenty of space to allow me to store my art supplies in the back bedroom whilst I sort out the front bedroom as an art studio, I cannot wait(for the art studio of course!). Yesterday I walked up the Wash Powder and cleaning aisle in ASDA(WALMART) and I nearly choked at the fumes that were coming from the products, surely it cannot be safe for the shop employees to work with these fumes or for them to be used in homes? Here is something I found on the BBC website I use the Ecover, soda crystals plus borax. Clean Home, Clear Conscience link                                 Looking for a chemical-free cleaner? With naturally derived ingredients, such as coconut soap and chalk powder, you'll know you won't be killing off the local wildlife, but do they actually work? We put our favourites to the test.                                                           Ecover Cream Cleaner \u00a31.25 for 500ml from supermarkets How eco is it?   It\u2019s made from chalk dust and plant-based ingredients, all of which are biodegradable. The containers are 100 per cent recyclable.   Is it any good?   Marvellous. It\u2019s probably as good as a traditional cleaner but without the chemical nasties. A quick squirt on a grimy hob shifted even burnt-on marks. Baths and sinks come clean, too, with only a little elbow grease and, once you rinse them clean, look really quite sparkly. This felt the closest to a traditional kitchen/ bathroom cleaner and, although you do need give it a good rinse afterwards, it produced the best results.    Score  5/5                                         Soda Crystals From any supermarket How eco is it?   As eco as you can get. Is it any good?   Not so much a cleaner as a handy natural solution for breaking down grease (such as in the U-bend of a sink). It can be used as a water softener for laundry, too. We used it instead of bleach on a blocked sink by simply pouring a couple of cups worth of crystals down the plug, swiftly followed by a kettle of boiling water, and it did the trick. Got a waste disposal unit? Emptying half a cup and some hot water into it every few weeks will stop grease and smells building up.    Score  4/5                                          Liquid Soda crystals \u00a31.49 for 500ml How eco is it?   It contains no phosphates, enzymes or bleach and is bio-degradable, too. Is it any good?   Pretty impressive. Just squirt it on and leave it for a few minutes to work, then get scrubbing. You don\u2019t need a massive amount of elbow grease to shift grimy units and burnt-on mess on your hob, and you can also use it to get rid of caked-on gunge in pans (though you can\u2019t use it on aluminium ones) and stained chopping boards.    Score  4/5                                          E-cloth Cleaning System Kitchen/Bathroom Pack (one general purpose cloth, one glass/polishing cloth), \u00a34.99 How eco is it?   The cloth contains loads of tiny fibres to shift grease and grime and no chemicals at all. Is it any good?   It\u2019s worth having in the cupboard, but you will need another all-purpose cleaner to tackle every job around the kitchen and bathroom. It came up trumps on lightly soiled worksurfaces, glass and stainless steel, where it left surfaces clean and quite sparkly, but was less impressive on a grubby hob.    Score  2/5                                         Simple Green All Purpose Cleaner \u00a39.99 plus \u00a34.99 p&p for 1L of concentrate (makes up to ten 500ml trigger spray bottles when diluted \u2013 works out at \u00a31.49 for 500ml) How eco is it?   No bleach, ammonia and phosphates. Comes as a concentrate, which saves on packaging and transport costs. Is it any good?   Yes. It may not smell as gentle and lovely as some of the fragranced cleaners we tested (it\u2019s like a more traditional cleaner though the lemon is much nicer than the original), but it does do the job if you leave it for a handful of seconds to work. Just spray it on and get to work \u2013 you don\u2019t need to rinse afterwards. Because it\u2019s a concentrate, you can change the strength of the mix for different tasks.    Score  4/5          Yesterday when I went to pick Beauty up from school I sat and waited as usual in the hall for her and suddenly she came squealing HERE I AM into the hall being pushed by JOHN the teacher's aide at 50 miles per hour in her wheel chair!

All That Glitters is Gold Stairway To Heaven Theres a lady who's sure All that glitters is gold And she's buying a stairway to heaven. When she gets there she knows If the stores are all closed With a word she can get what she came for. Ooh, ooh, and shes buying a stairway to heaven. Theres a sign on the wall But she wants to be sure cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook Theres a songbird who sings, Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. Ooh, it makes me wonder, Ooh, it makes me wonder. Theres a feeling I get When I look to the west, And my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen Rings of smoke through the trees, And the voices of those who standing looking. Ooh, it makes me wonder, Ooh, it really makes me wonder. And its whispered that soon If we all call the tune Then the piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn For those who stand long And the forests will echo with laughter. If theres a bustle in your hedgerow Don't be alarmed now, Its just a spring clean for the may queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by But in the long run Theres still time to change the road you're on. And it makes me wonder. Your head is humming and it wont go In case you don't know, The pipers calling you to join him, Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, And did you know Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. And as we wind on down the road Our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know Who shines white light and wants to show How evrything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last. When all are one and one is all To be a rock and not to roll. And shes buying a stairway to heaven And as for Mr Blair! Well I think I shall say no more and remember the old adage- THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING. Talking of puddings, did you know that rhubarb is poisonous to guinea pigs? One of those useless pieces of information you pick up and think REALLY. I think the weekie boys maybe a little happier, they are bouncing around their new hutch more and generally weeking more.

The alien-chasing series, starring John Barrowman and Eve Myles, is expected to be shown in 2008 and Marsters is set to guest star in the first episode. I have strict instructions to let SnoWhite know if I hear of (or see any filming) as they are filming the next series of Torchwood at the moment! The final of Doctor Who was filmed in SnoWhites friend's street in Roath, the scene where Martha is caught by The Master. I did see some filming at the Royal Infirmary but that was a while back now. I have a Doctor Who question. If The Doctor and the Master were able to 'store' their 'essence' in a watch, could a ring do the same thing? Remember  The Masters ring that a woman picked up from The Master's funeral pyre? Sorry .....Enough Doctor Who/Torchwood. WEATHER REPORT-The rainy season continues, I am almost tempted to go on holiday to escape the bad weather but I know there is no way that I could cope with the high temperatures elsewhere in the world at this time of year, unless of course I went North. Even now Helsinki is a pleasant 21 degrees and Oslo is 18 degrees- I have always fancied visiting Norway. PIGGY UPDATE-The piggies are growing daily and are very sweet and very happy. Whenever I enter the room they go weeking crazy and demand to be fed  and they really seem to enjoy cuddles. Mouth the larger piggy is such a baby really, when I sit him on my lap and give him a cuddle he slowly creeps up to my neck and snuggles in and starts to purr- I think I forget that they are still only a few weeks separated from their mother. I have no really knowledge of animal psychology but can guinea pigs miss their mothers? Beauty appears to be a walking advert for Hello Kitty at the moment, her sisters who love her very much keep buying her Hello Kitty things that they see in town. Her latest present is a Hello Kitty water bottle from H&M, H&M seem to be doing all things Hello Kitty at the moment which is keeping Fiona happy. And talking of Fiona, yesterday evening Fiona went for an interview at IKEA- if she gets a job then that will be daughter number 4 to work for the company! PIANOMAN UPDATE-Still enjoying the pain relief! Still not happy with the no mobile phone rule. Today or tomorrow he should be moved from Coronary Care to a ward. From today he is able to have non-family visitors-Let The Fun Begin! 'A' the Branch P visited Sunday, he still only looks 19! Let's hope I miss the visit from the friendly neighbourhood GP. I will keep you all informed-thanks for the phone calls, it was good to hear from you. Time to get Beauty out of bed for school! She doesn't fall asleep until midnight but if I put her to be earlier she will be up at stupid o'clock- she is like a University student with her love of bed EXCEPT she does get up a little before Hollyoaks comes on TV in the evening! More news later from the less than exciting life of a middle aged woman in Wales! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6900670.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/and-rains-came-down.html", "title": "\nAND THE RAINS CAME DOWN...........\n"},
{"date": " June 14, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday I went with Fiona to a charity shop and we bought fabric, books,  casettes  and videos. One of the videos that we bought was Joseph, the Donny Osmond version. I was bought this originally as a Christmas present and Beauty watched it so often that it 'died', now she has a replacement it seems that she wants to watch it constantly. If I wasn't word perfect before then I am now! It seems that even the computer has fallen out of favour and she didn't go online once last night. At gone 11pm last night there was a very loud knock on my back door,we were all a bit surprised because Fiona,Ariel and Beauty were home and  SnoWhite  was spending the night at a friends. Ariel, thinking it might be  SnoWhite , didn't open the door but asked who it was. We were all a bit shocked to hear a voice call back THE FIRE SERVICE. Throwing the door open we were amazed to see a flashing fire engine by the gate! It seems that our neighbours(yes Belle and Anastasia-those neighbours!) had phoned the fire brigade because they smelt petrol around our car.The same neighbours who phoned the police because builders were doing work on the house whist I was out. The guy in charge asked if we had been out in the car recently and I said YES AT 10PM, he explained to the neighbours that the reason why the car smelt of petrol was because it hadn't long been driven. I couldn't apologise to them enough, I imagined all sorts of scenarios from having disturbed their evening meal to having already gone to bed. I am so sorry Mr fire Fighter Man. Why didn't the neighbours  knock the door and tell me they smelt petrol? If you know my neighbours you know the answer to that one. Fiona and Ariel were a bit concerned that they  might be causing trouble because I had had to speak to the council about the condition  of their garden. They have 2 dogs and the dogs poop in the garden and that is where it stays for weeks on end and with the warm weather,well I am sure you can imagine the situation. Plus the vermin the filthy garden encourages!We used to live in a 16 th   century stone cottage on the  Oxfordshire /Berkshire border and it was a lovely house until the farm opposite emptied it's grain silo towards the end of the year.Then the local rats would  go looking for food. NICE! The council were delighted to tell me that rats live within a metre of everybody. That is so nice to know. I once saw a small section from a reality TV show where they were cast away on an island and one of the men hadn't washed his face and hands before going to sleep and had awoken to a rat chewing on his face. We sometimes call Beauty MOUSE (or rat when she is being a typical 6 year old) but I not so sure about calling her that anymore!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/i-am-surrounded-by-idiots.html", "title": "\nI AM SURROUNDED BY IDIOTS\n"},

They live a life of privilege, comfort and security that only a tiny few of us will ever achieve, and that many of us can barely even dream about. So what do you give somebody who has everything? Nothing. In  Filthy Rich and Homeless , five of Britain's wealthiest people take part in one of TV's most hard-hitting and controversial experiments ever - living the life of the homeless on the streets of London for ten days solid.Guided by homeless experts Rebecca and Craig, the five wealthy volunteers will be faced with the very harsh realities of life for those who have nothing.

{"date": " May 30, 2007", "body": "\nI AM THE SPIDER CATCHER! In our house anyway.For the last 11 years , 90% of the time we have been an all female household, and as leader of said house all unwanted tasks have been left to me. I am pretty good at painting, drain cleaning and especially spider catching.SnoWhites young man friend is especially nimble on his feet when spiders are seen,well he is a wrestler! I am very good at picking up Daddy Long Legs with my hands, no problem,skinny legs and small body are fine. Even large furry spiders are OK when I am hunting them with a glass and a piece of card, hey I am in control. However, even though I am greatly attracted to Buddhism and I cannot kill a spider(under normal circumstances), I have no problem killing flies and wasps and bees(though when I kill a wasp or a bee I am always afraid their family will come and get me,sad moo!) so that is Buddhism out the window for me. I insist that the girls do not stamp on spiders or insects and I insist that they leave it to me to get rid of them. BUT last night in total fear I 'killed' a spider. Hey I saw the film ARACHNOPHOBIA and the spider was running straight towards me, I was scared. BUT it wasn't really a spider. A few years ago I had our downstairs toilet enlarged and made into a shower/splash room and boy does Beauty love to splash in it. The hall carpet  outside the door is forever ruined due to constant flooding by Beauty and so the carpet is slowly falling to pieces. Also the pull light switch in the shower room is broken again, it is broken more than it is fixed............funnily enough the toilet handle is constantly broken and so is the shower holder! Perhaps the room is haunted ,perhaps it is built on an ancient Indian burial ground-like in Two Pints of Lager and the Amityville horror(or maybe not). Right back to the spider story(sorry). Last night I went to the toilet and I took a candle with me, a candle has better overall light than a torch(or so I thought). Whilst sitting in the bathroom a 'spider' hurtled towards me from the space under the door and I was up and out of there in a nano second and I am afraid that I killed the 'spider'(on purpose) in my escape.AND now do I feel guilty! I killed a TUFT OF CARPET but if it had been a spider  I would still have killed it in my fear. What if reincarnation is true, I discount very little, I could come back as a rat or a pig or a cat. a cat would be worst, they lick their bits..........sorry but that is more that my brain can deal with. I told Anastasia and she was totally supportive. SnoWhite is arachnophobic in a BIG way and she said that the tuft of carpet would have frightened her too and her  screams would have woken Beauty. Give me a glass and card and I become SPIDER HUNTER, brave and fearless(well almost) but something less that the size of  a penny scurrying towards me turns me into a quivering wreck. What a wimp! My biggest fear though is that should Beauty come into contact with an insect she would treat it just like a daisy..........and eat it!I'm sorry but that would be a vision forever seared on my memory!

I don't think that Kew would have plastic flamingos and not even a cat could get lost in our garden(Hampton Court Maze), but it's home and somewhere to sit on a sunny day (they'll be back I'm sure)!

Surely this is a case of  prejudice, you can't show your underpants but it's OK to show off your breasts and bra-let me see, is it because Carol and his buds like looking at women's boobs but not low slung pants which mostly men wear.

I definitely have to get more sleep, the less sleep I get the weirder my dreams. Last night I dreamt that I was in a lift with Chunk from the  Goonies. I so have to get more sleep! Chunk was afraid of heights and was rolling around on the floor afraid to look out of the glass sides of the lift. Why couldn't I have had a nice normal dream like a date with George Clooney? I have been reading the blog  No Impact Man  and whilst many people seem to be critical of the intentions of the project that No Impact Man is doing it personally makes me want to give up living a greener life as it makes me feel totally inadequate. The No Impact Experiment For one year, my wife, my 2-year-old daughter, my dog and I, while living in the middle of New York City, are attempting to live without making any net impact on the environment. In other words, no trash, no carbon emissions, no toxins in the water, no elevators, no subway, no products in packaging, no plastics, no air conditioning, no TV, no toilets\u2026 I give up now! Think about what would happen if everyone stopped using elevators,the subway, clothes shopping( also part of the experiment), no products in packaging, no plastics, no air con, no TV, no buying new books( also part of the experiment)...........really think about it. Economic meltdown! Surely the  answer is to make things environmentally acceptable(neutral) rather than everyone living without them? Yep- I'm officially confused. Dr Who(or maybe even Torchwood) are filming again at the Cardiff Royal Infirmary.We passed last night as huge lights were trained on the building but I'm afraid nothing to be seen, they were also filming off Broadway whilst I was on holiday, on SnoWhites friend's road.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218/", "http://noimpactman.typepad.com/blog/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/05/im-officially-confused.html", "title": "\nI'M OFFICIALLY CONFUSED\n"},
{"date": " April 26, 2007", "body": "\n If anyone wants to listen to the radio interview then go to Five Live on the BBC website and they will find a recording of todays lunch time program. It was meant to be done by Simon Mayo but he was off sick and it was done by John Pienaar. ' John Pienaar's  first job was as a local newspaper trainee (South London Press), covering the round of courts, crime and sport. He was a member of the Westminster staff of the Press Association between 1980 and 1986. John joined the Independent newspaper when it launched under the editorship of Andreas Whittam Smith in 1986, and as a member of Tony Bevins' team he covered the downfall of Margaret Thatcher, and the rise and fall of John Major, writing news stories, features and the Westminster Diary, as well as occasional parliamentary sketch columns. In 1992 John joined the BBC as a BBC political correspondent, reporting for all major TV and Radio outlets.BBC Radio Five Live, the live news and sport station, has since appointed John Pienaar as its first Chief Political Correspondent.' And would you believe that AGAIN I didn't get to speak! It seems that they wanted my daughter SnoWhite who is very politically aware to talk on the show..........never mind, we are on another program on Sunday so maybe there is still time. On the program was also Glyn from Big Brother.  Glyn was just like he was on TV. He was there because he supported Plaid Cymru, whilst SnoWhite supported the Liberal Democrats (well maybe)                                 Ross Thomas                            And  Ross Thomas who supported Labour.  'A first-time voter, he says he is passionate about politics, unlike many of his age group. He is concerned about the health service and education and the engagement of young people in politics.'   Glyn and Ross were a nice pair of lads. The interview was about young voters and their views.

{"date": " April 27, 2007", "body": "\n       I am afraid that reproducing this article in it's  entirety   was the only way that I could really show why I am so upset. Tough packaging fines are urged                                                                                                                                                              Many items sold in supermarkets are packaged to retain freshness                             Penalties for companies who break an EU directive banning excessive packaging should be made tougher, the Local Government Association has said. Councils say the EU rule has too many loopholes and the maximum fine of \u00a35,000 is not a big enough deterrent. The Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment says trading standards are right to encourage firms to cut packaging rather than going to court. About 5m tonnes of annual household rubbish is used in packaging. It makes up almost one-fifth of all household refuse. There have been just four successful prosecutions since the UK adopted the EU law eight years ago. ' Toothless tiger' They include a butcher whose pre-packed meat was wrapped in two polystyrene trays and an office supplies firm that used large boxes to send very small items. Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, Chairman of the Local Government Association, said the law against excessive packaging is a \"toothless tiger\". \"The fact that there have only been four successful prosecutions in the UK demonstrates the law simply isn't working,\" he said. He added: \"Local authority trading standards services find their hands tied by regulations which allow retailers to defend excessive packaging claiming it is what the customer wants or that it is required for the purposes of marketing.\" Whilst there is the reference to 5m tonnes of annual household rubbish is used in packaging. there is no reference to any plans to make suppliers and manufacturers use bio-degradeable packaging! WHY? My local council's green bags are not bio-degradeable........... again WHY? I have heard of councils thinking about  penalising  residents for producing excess rubbish but what are we supposed to do? I have been recycling everything that I can since we lived in Newbury in Berkshire in the late 80's when councils first started to recycle seriously. What goes in my bin cannot be recycled and cannot be composted and I send plastic containers to Beauty's school to use in art work. So what is left I have little control over.For a time I was sending crisp packets back to Walkers asking them to recycle them as I was unable to find someone who would recycle them and there were results in this campaign (not just my campaign-I'm not that vain), Walkers reduced the size of their crisp packets because of public demand. Every time I put something in the rubbish bin I feel guilty. I frequently think about  Michael Palin's  visit to the Sahara when they asked for a bag to put rubbish in and they were looked at with bewilderment. The locals had no rubbish, everything was recycled. Vegetables came without plastic, beans and pulses came in sacks and any meat was killed and eaten straightaway so no need for packaging there! Packaging is the key to dealing with rubbish. I have stopped using plastic bags to send Beauty's food to school in, I now use tea towels and packaging that cannot be recycled to wrap every thing in and I am in the process of making fabric bags to put the food in. Her food sometimes goes to school in bread bags, pasta bags and clothes packaging!I remember living with foster parents in the 70's and the mother bitching about a neighbours child being sent to school with their food in a plastic bread bag! Well whoop a dee do- if that were the extent of the world's problems. The child in question went to school school washed and with clean clothes and always smiling and people were worrying about the bread bag! I would be quite happy for anyone to comment on the way that I re-use plastic packaging!                                 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6598129.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6598129.stm", "http://www.palinstravels.co.uk/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/rubbish.html", "title": "\nRUBBISH\n"},
{"date": " April 23, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday we went to the christening of my nieces baby Dotty. My sister's husband and their girls are Catholics, Dotty's aunty and Dotty's mums cousin were Godfather and Godmother and so was my daughter SnoWhite. The other 2 Godparents are Catholics but SnoWhite is not and I do not have any problem with this. I believe SnoWhite will make a good Godparent, she will encourage Dotty all that she can to follow the ways of the families chosen religion and be there spiritually for Dotty. I believe that SnoWhite will encourage Dotty to go to church,  receive  her first communion  and  confirmation  and all other necessary things until Dotty is an adult  and can make decisions  for herself. My mother's family were high church of England and my father's mother was a Methodist but we did not grow up attending church. As a child I chose to go to an  Apostolic  Sunday school, though I was christened in  St Peter's church  in Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan. Even though we did not attend church my mother felt it important that children were christened so if they died they went to heaven. My spiritual life has taken many twists and turns and now I am supportive of all the religions that people belong to as I believe that they are important coping mechanisms. At present my life seems to be heavily involved with the Catholic church due to the fact that Belle's husband and family are Catholics, Anastasia's boyfriend and family are Catholic, SnoWhite's friend and his family are Catholics . From the time I was 14 until I was about 40 I attended a church which had a tenet  that said  it was important to worship  God according to the            dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege,            let them worship how, where, or what they may. This church believed it was the one and only true church(as do a lot of religions) but the above tenet says that this church believes that all mankind have the right to worship how, where or what they may. I am still searching, whilst trying to lead a good life. My conscience or my mind has not yet found one religion or truth that it can believe in yet so the jury is out. So in the meantime I am trying to live a morally and ethically good life on my journey. I think I would be content with a belief in God. When I think of my loss of faith and belief I always think of  this poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of everyday's Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints! ---I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life!---and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. I have lost the God and saints of my youth and like the guy in the film The Matrix, I would love to go back to before that time of awakening. But that will never happen!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.apostolic-church.org/", "http://www.penmarkwithporthkerry.org.uk/page3.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/religion.html", "title": "\nRELIGION\n"},

{"date": " April 17, 2007", "body": "\nBelle is on her way, jetting her way across the  Atlantic  but we are still waiting for news on Anastasia. The best part of the journey is the fact that her flight from the US goes to Amsterdam instead of London and from there she flies directly to Cardiff. Getting a bus from a London airport to Cardiff is a nightmare and the journey feels like it takes forever. After waiting on the runway at 6am, in the snow on a January morning at Bristol airport I decided a couple of years ago to only fly from Cardiff. At Cardiff the majority of planes are entered via walkways directly onto the plane, going across the runway in a warm country is not a problem but trying to  manoeuvre  a disability buggy, an over excited child and hand luggage on a cold snowy morning puts you off going on holiday not matter how wonderful the destination may be. As I have really fair skin due to my red hair(or what red is left after the grey set in!), I only go abroad in the winter and I love that. One year I went to Malta for 2 weeks in June, I loved Malta but never again will I go on holiday after May. In the words of Little Cook it was HOT,HOT,HOT. A weeks holiday in January or February really splits up the  winter but  I do not see the point of going abroad after May as the weather may not always be fantastic but I am quite happy with the weather in the UK between April and October, it is just January, February and March that I would like to spend in  Fuerteventura .  Fuerteventura  is special in the sense that the weather is pleasant and  Coralejo  where we stay is just like an overgrown fishing village. It might be nice to visit Belle next winter in Florida for a week in the winter, Beauty will  absolutely  love it. When Beauty started school I worried about taking Beauty out of school during term time as the government has said it no longer wants parents to do that as they feel it interrupts a  child's  education. I spoke to the school about this and they have no problem with Beauty going, I think they see it as a life experience. I just couldn't take Beauty on holiday during half term or during school holidays as there would be lots of other children and Beauty is not very good at noise and crowds of children do create a lot of noise! AND we only go for one week! One of Beauty's friends went to visit relatives in Canada and didn't come back until the snows came and another went home with his mother to India in June and didn't come back until November so I think my winter holidays are not too bad. I am still in shock at the news reports of the killings in  Virginia  ans I feel very sorry for all those involved and those who have lost loved ones. I lived in  Newbury  at the time of the  Hungerford massacre and I remember the shock that gripped the town whilst it was happening and the aftermath when every body struggled to cope with what had happened. When something like this happens we all suffer,we lose our faith in the goodness of mankind. When  Dunblane   happened I remember thinking about how awful it would be for the parents who had lost their little ones and how they would NEVER recover from it. Imagine a stone being thrown in a pond and how you have the ripples flowing outwards, well that is the suffering caused by these senseless acts.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6562259.stm", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungerford_Massacre", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_Massacre"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/coming-home.html", "title": "\nCOMING HOME\n"},

It is a pity that the ordinary Iranian people will not be able to see a news report like this. I may not agree with war but I still support the men and women in these conflict situations who are doing what they believe to be right.

The answer is simple..............let you 6 year old who is profoundly autistic into the living room where her older sister have passed out after a sleepless night and let her turn on a Cinderella video first thing in the morning! And what is so irritating about a Cinderella video? CINDERELLA Nothing usually except that this is an old video and it squeaks(!) and Beauty has it on quite loudly. PLUS Beauty is flitting between the TV and  the computer which is close to the living room door and on that she is playing with CBeebies  games, Kevin and Spanner, also quite loudly!

Thankfully she has 4 years of a degree and  officer training to go through before she is let loose on the world! Time to calm down. Beauty went out with the child minder yesterday, but due to the early start she spent most of the time asleep. I did too! But that was fine because trying to catch up on sleep when Beauty is in the house is not an easy thing to do. I try to ask one of the girls to specifically watch her if I am resting because otherwise I will get the usual'. oh but I thought .............was meant to do it', or 'you didn't ask' which goes for any job , not just looking after their sister.

A medical tribunal said it was satisfied the evidence showed 51-year-old Alan Hutchinson, who routinely did not wear gloves or wash his hands, had risked the health of \"himself, staff and patients\" for more than 28 years No wonder so many people are  OCD and do not want to leave their houses when they read about things like this.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.childrensartandliterature.com/images/cinderella002.gif&imgrefurl=http://www.childrensartandliterature.com/&amp;amp;amp;amp;h=712&w=500&sz=219&hl=en&start=618&um=1&tbnid=SZV3AGHNcmEuOM:&tbnh=140&amp;amp;amp;amp;tbnw=98&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dcinderella%26start%3D600%26ndsp%3D20%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/storycircle/cbeebiesstories/kevin_the_spaceman/images/scene1.gif&imgrefurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/storycircle/cbeebiesstories/kevin_the_spaceman/&amp;amp;amp;h=401&w=501&sz=22&hl=en&start=2&um=1&tbnid=xy3l_SOgQr1AzM:&tbnh=104&amp;amp;amp;tbnw=130&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dkevin%2Band%2Bspanner%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_Theatre", "http://imdb.com/name/nm0446319/", "http://imdb.com/title/tt0377260/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.channel4.com/life/media/F/fword/gallery/TX5DeanLennoxKelly7.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/F/fword/gallery_6_fword_gallery4.html&amp;amp;h=251&w=400&sz=29&hl=en&start=2&um=1&amp;amp;tbnid=0GJDlcGthofX3M:&tbnh=78&tbnw=124&prev=/images%3Fq%3DDean%2BLennox%2BKelly%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN", "http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.channel4.com/life/media/F/fword/gallery/TX5DeanLennoxKelly7.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/F/fword/gallery_6_fword_gallery4.html&h=251&w=400&sz=29&hl=en&start=2&amp;amp;um=1&tbnid=0GJDlcGthofX3M:&tbnh=78&tbnw=124&prev=/images%3Fq%3DDean%2BLennox%2BKelly%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Wanamaker", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910738/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freema_Agyeman", "http://uk.news.yahoo.com/rtrs/20070405/tuk-uk-britain-dentist-fa6b408.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/to-sleepperchance-to-dream.html", "title": "\nTO SLEEP,PERCHANCE TO DREAM\n"},
{"date": " March 26, 2007", "body": "\nDid you read  this  today? Cabinet minister Ruth Kelly has lost her complaint against the Daily Mirror, over its coverage of her decision to educate her son privately. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) rejected her complaint that the story had breached her son's privacy. The former education secretary decided to send him to a private school because of his learning difficulties. The PCC said the Mirror had correctly balanced the public's right to know with the child's right to privacy. In its ruling, the PCC said the issues raised in the article were \"a matter of considerable public interest\". \"The fact that a Cabinet minister - who had previously been Secretary of State for Education and Skills - had elected to remove her child from the state system to be enrolled in a private school raised important issues for public debate,\" it said. \"Even if government policy included an acceptance of private schooling for those with special needs, the fact that the complainant did not feel that the current state system could meet her child's requirements raised questions about the nature of publicly-funded schooling and its ability to cater for children with special needs - including those whose families would not be able to pay for private schooling.\" The article goes on to say Mirror editor Richard Walla Mirror editor Richard Wallace argued that it was \"right and proper\" to identify her, as her actions \"were clearly at odds with government policy\".  When a government minister tries to hide behind their child to get what they want then the truth need to be told. The headmaster of this child said that the  child had minor dyslexia and the LEA were confident that they could deal with the situation but Ms Kelly was not so confident of the education system she had helped to shape . Yes her actions were clearly at odds with government policy and had to be shown as such.

{"date": " March 22, 2007", "body": "\nI love clocks and mirrors! Not to an obsession because I have some rooms without either but my kitchen has a very large station clock, a timer clock and a cuckoo clock. Having friends who live in Switzerland I received a small cuckoo clock from there but I have always wanted a large cuckoo clock so last Christmas Anastasia bought me one. I love it BUT.......it is like having an extra member of the family that you have to consider constantly! Due to my disabilities and Beauty needing watching 24/7 , we had an extension built a few years ago which meant that Beauty and I could have adjoining bedrooms but the extension is on the ground floor and the extra bedroom comes off the kitchen. AND the cuckoo clock works on a light sensor(well who would have thought it?Not me!) which means that the room where the clock is has to have it's light switched off before bed-time as the clock seems to have a light memory time of over an hour. 'Move it' I hear you all shouting at the stupid mother but not so easy, it cannot go in the lounge as Beauty would tear it off the wall. The hall walls are all thin board and nothing stays up very long and the second half of the kitchen wouldn't be any good as the clock has such a loud cuckoo you could hear it in Geneva, so that leaves the front kitchen. Already I have suspended the  use of the pendulum because that swings every second and is louder than the cuckoo! The cuckoo is so loud that it interrupts conversation and quite regularly I tell it to ,'Shut up' or say to it ,'Who asked for your opinion'. Beauty is at that stage where she says thing that really seem as if she understands a lot more than she wants you to think and her conversation at times can be alarmingly  relevant. She also seems to include the cuckoo in her conversations! Yep, I know .............cuckoo the lot of us! What a little sweethe art . Did you know Ad campaign features newest NI model A little Belfast girl has been chosen to represent the British Skin Foundation to help the charity raise funds. Anyone travelling in the London Underground will soon get the chance to see latest cover girl Olivia Curran. The three-year-old is not exactly camera shy. When she was given the opportunity to become the new face for the British Skin Foundation - she jumped at the chance. Her mother Patricia said Olivia has a birthmark which covers most of the left-hand side of her face.  The following is  a wonderful piece of research. Whereas some of the research that I highlighted yesterday may have been a little obvious in the outcome, this definitely offers hope. As someone who has had  MRSA  and had a friend die from it ,I can only hope that the results of this research are found to be valid and can be used to combat super bugs.       Essential oils 'combat  superbug ' Tests of new machine at a hospital have found it could be effective in the battle against the  superbug   MRSA . Consultants at  Wythenshawe  Hospital found that using a  vaporiser  to spray essential oils into the atmosphere killed off micro-organisms. Airborne bacterial counts dropped by 90% and infections were reduced in a nine-month trial at the burns unit. The recipe of oils used in the machine was refined by microbiologists at Manchester Metropolitan University. Scent Technologies, the  Wigan -based company which makes the machine, developed the device to mask smells on wards but found it had a beneficial effect on infections. The study was started after the recipe of oils was modified by the university team, in conjunction with  Wythenshawe  consultant Ken Dunn. \"Many people will be aware that there are decades of experience with the use of essential oils to control infection,\" said Mr Dunn. \"I think the novelty of this is putting the two researched technologies together and being able to affect a really surprisingly large area of the ward with a single machine.\" There were no  MRSA  infections in the burns unit while the machine was being used with the recipe of oils. In the final two months the natural essence blend was removed from the machines and  MRSA  levels in the air increased - and there was an  MRSA  outbreak in the ward. But despite the apparent success of the trial,  MRSA  campaigners have urged  healthcare  professionals to continue with strict cleaning regimes. Bev  Hurst, whose mother Margaret died from an  MRSA  infection, said: \"If this is something that is going to help then that's brilliant. \"But it has to be in conjunction with everything else - it can't just be a machine on a ward.\" The National Audit Office estimates hospital-acquired infections contribute to some 5,000 deaths annually.    Further tests are now being carried out. Did you know(listen careful because I have a theory on this but don't quote me!) MRSA  ( methicillin -resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus ) was first detected in Britain in 1961 and is now \"quite common\" in hospitals (from  Wikipedia ) How is it that  MRSA  was first diagnosed in 1961 but has only really become an issue in hospitals in the 90's and now? I think it has developed because of a number of reasons. I started training in to be a nurse in 1980 and did further nurse training in 1996 so I feel that I have enough experience(however limited) to comment on the changes in hospitals and nursing in the intervening 16 years. The cleaning of the wards has been outsourced to the bidder who can do it for the cheapest amount of money in the shortest time. In 1980 the ward cleaner/maid cleaned the ward daily and maintained it to a high standard of cleanliness. Now when I visit hospitals I see dirty furniture, dirty walls(as portrayed in the  Trial of Tony Blair) ,dirty floors and bulging bags of rubbish and dirty laundry. When I trained as a nurse in 1980 we were taught how to wash beds between patients, clean lockers and do a whole load of other tasks which put the nursing staff in control of  hygiene  and in closer contact with the patients. This no longer happens because there are so few nurses per patient so that the patients are lucky to get basic nursing care as the nurses are being run ragged. When I trained again in 1996 most of our nursing care studies revolved around giving the patient  Total Holistic Care . Holistic Nursing Practice takes a whole-person approach to nursing addressing both medical and psychosocial concerns.  To borrow the words of Jim Royle of the  Royle Family  , 'Holistic Care...............MY ARSE' Th RGN Nurses barely have time to give the patients medication, do dressings, endless paperwork, Doctor's rounds...........the list is endless, they may want to provide holistic care but many things are against them actually providing holistic care. Th following article shows this       The lure of nursing 'Down Under' They entered nursing with high hopes of working in a valued profession which made a difference to peoples' lives. But the staff shortages and cash cutbacks have taken their toll on nurses such as Sarah Hector and Rob Carey who have joined the exodus of staff heading for Australia. According to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) 3,200 nurses of the 8,000 registering to work abroad want to work Down Under. Senior intensive care nurse Sarah, left her job in London worn down by the National Health Service's problems. \"I was sad to leave the people and my friends because the people here are brilliant but it's just the conditions, the lack of staff, the lack of finance that I'm not sad to be leaving,\" she told BBC One's Real Story. \"You just come away each day feeling demoralised. You've given your utmost best yet you still can't give the level of care that your are trained to do and would so love to give.\" She added: \"I think my grievance with the NHS is a national thing - I think it is shared all over the UK. \"Everybody who works within the NHS, I think to a certain extent are disillusioned and would like change.\"  The article carries on   \"I've been here for two years. You're really well supported, really well educated whereas where I used to work in the UK you'd have 12 to 15 patients and it would just be dangerous. \"When I got here they had a strict five to one ratio - five patients to one nurse - and I just thought oh my goodness because that would never have happened in England,\" she added.   So my theory is that money is the root of all evil (well dirt anyway). You take the funding away and what do you think is going to happen? An extra \u00a3400m to be allocated to the Ministry of Defence to cover overseas commitments in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. What do I say to my 15 year old on the autistic spectrum when she asks why the government is spending \u00a3400m on 'Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere' when she knows that we have to fight for every penny in educational funding for her sister. Will the following   Investment in schools, hospitals, security and defence and infrastructure will rise from \u00a343bn this year to \u00a360bn by 2012 be enough to pay for repairs to crumbling schools, pay for resources and facilities for schools, more nurses and cleaner wards and suitable after-care for returning soldiers. There is a pathetic group of unsupported ex-servicemen, who may be suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, who are homeless, jobless and wifeless If a  2p reduction in the income tax rate  is a pathetic attempt to garner votes for a political aim then don't bother Mr Brown, that money could have been put to many good uses. Last night I managed to watch  Freaky Eaters   before my eyes would stay open no longer after Beauty's early morning wake-up. In a way I did not think that the person on the show was a Freaky Eater she just had a good old fashioned food addiction. Episode 6: Addicted to chicken Everything about Debbie Ezeogu's life is great - her job, her friends, her flat. Everything, that is, except for her diet - a high fat, high salt and high sugar cocktail of fried chicken, takeaways and ready meals. At just 24 years old, Debbie is already clinically obese and risking some serious health problems. Can our experts help Debbie to understand why she resorts to food for comfort? And her behaviour was that of a 14 year old child! All I could think was this girl didn't really want any help just 15 minutes of fame on TV. After a disastrous 45 minutes of the program where she didn't co-operate at all(she claimed that the lime juice in her Vodka was a portion of fruit\") the finale was for her to produce a healthy meal for  Natalie the nutritionist  and  Benjamin Fry the psychotherapist.  Debbie ended up drunk on the kitchen floor! You could tell that Natalie and Benjamin were less than impressed. Many of these type of 'make-over' shows are predictable, take Super Nanny for instance, 45 minutes of the viewer wondering why social services are not called then in the last 15 minutes they become family of the year! Well Freaky Eaters was anything but predictable last night, Debbie your eating habits may not have changed a lot but you were highly entertaining and are assured of a place in my memory.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6473271.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6471475.stm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945405/", "http://www.ovid.com/site/catalog/Journal/386.jsp?top=2&mid=3&bottom=7&subsection=12", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royle_Family", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/real_story/6447179.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6474997.stm", "http://www.women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/william_rees_mogg/article1500230.ece", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6472999.stm", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/freaky_eaters/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/freaky_eaters/experts.shtml", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/freaky_eaters/experts.shtml"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/six-children-and-cuckoo-clock_22.html", "title": "\nSIX CHILDREN AND A CUCKOO CLOCK\n"},

{"date": " March 21, 2007", "body": "\nThe way that this is going there will soon be no point in going to bed! Wake-Up time is getting earlier and earlier and Beauty's voice is getting louder and louder on waking. Fiona has alarm clocks in her bedroom(!) but I have not had the need to use an alarm clock in years. Such is the difference between Beauty who is profoundly autistic and Fiona and SnoWhite who are somewhere else on the spectrum. Whereas when Beauty awakes she sees no point in staying in bed (so much to do, so little time), Fiona and SnoWhite on the other hand do not see the point of going to bed at night but sleeping through the day and getting up when the fridge starts to call them or when Hollyoaks is on! Sounds like your average student to me! Last night SnoWhite went to see a Westlife concert in the CIA in town, she took Ariel's friend as she is also a huge Westlife fan. I am so glad that SnoWhite found someone else to go to the concert with her because last time I had to go. Don't get me wrong, I really like Westlife's music but 2 hours in a concert seat is more that my old arthritic hips can cope with. The concerts are all seated so it is a bit pointless me being there as I cannot see anything, I have to sit down because of pain but everyone else stands up in their seat spaces. And last time I went I had one of my painful neck episodes so I probably would have had more fun watching YouTube..........sorry SnoWhite but hey, at least this time you got to go with somebody who was as equally mad about Westlife as you so it can't be bad! When I was doing Nurses training I worked part-time in the CIA and got to see many concerts for free, in comparison to some of the shows I have seen, i.e Blur, Oasis, Gary Glitter(save me God)...........I have to say that Westlife's stage show is up there with the best. Tom Jones' one man show, no warm- up act , was equally as brilliant. Sorry, am I waffling? Lack of sleep can do that to you! Oh no, Sporticus is back, bouncing around in my kitchen! Now I know that I am truly awake. I read the following on the BBC website     Councillor sold partner for sex A councillor who advertised his girlfriend for sex over the internet has been given a suspended sentence.Alan Burkitt, 48, of West Bromwich, West Midlands, admitted four counts of causing prostitution between November 2005 and February 2006.The court heard more than 20 men paid \u00a350 for her services while Burkitt, an Independent member for Sandwell Council, sat in the room next door.A council spokesman said the council found the matter \"abhorrent\".Prosecuting, Stuart Clarkson told Wolverhampton Crown Court the woman had an IQ of 52 and mild learning disabilities.\"She is easily led and was not able to give informed consent to sexual activity in return for money. It seems that in his defense the Councillor said  In mitigation, Andrew Fisher said she had consented to the work and that it was to help them out of financial difficulties.\"He thought both of them could put themselves forward to earn money on the site, but to nobody's surprise there was little interest in him.\"He said the woman made the accusation after she mistakenly believed he was seeing another woman. What a git! And he was given a suspended sentence! The courts are mad. This elected councillor sold his learning disabled girlfriend for sex and the courts are OK that this person is allowed back out onto the streets with just a suspended sentence. What a warped vision of reality the courts have. And what would they have done if he had been violent to her? Given him community service somewhere sweeping floors?     we are still jailing 6,000 people a year for non-payment of fines. Yet this little git sells a learning disabled women into prostitution, puts her at risk of sexually transmitted diseases and violence and profits financially for the situation and the bloody judge thinks that a suspended sentence is an adequate punishment. It doesn't look like any punishment to me. I saw this new story and thought ,'Oh really!'     Dance 'could keep young healthy' Dance classes could be a good way to tackle childhood obesity, say ministers.Public health minister Caroline Flint and culture minister David Lammy touted the idea on a visit to the Laban dance centre in London.They highlighted  research  by Laban which found children who dance enjoy physical and psychological benefits.The researchers said creative dance should be considered as an alternative to sport for children.They said it might encourage girls who have no interest in sport, or other physical activities, to stay healthy.A separate study by the University of Bristol found that a small amount of moderate exercise a day could have far-reaching benefits for children. I am so glad that government money did not fund this research being touted around by government minister Caroline flint. Could we the public not have figured this one out ourselves? Research seems to be telling us many weird and wonderful things, for instance The Prison Service has said it will not fund further  researc h into prison food even though a recent study found that changing inmates' diets cut violent behaviour by 35% . New  research  carried out at Unilever's Beverages Global Technology Centre could help us understand why taking time out for a cup of tea is beneficial and makes such a difference. Elephants visiting \"graveyards\" of long-dead relatives may be a myth, but new  research  suggests that they may, like humans, be able to recognise their own kind among the dead. A new study by Oxford  researchers  has produced the strongest evidence yet to suggest that female badgers can conceive during pregnancy. A groundbreaking study from Brunel University has revealed that the combined effects of a cocktail of chemicals are affecting UK waterways to a far greater extent than previously thought. This groundbreaking  research  unearths evidence that mixtures of chemicals are acting together to affect reproductive processes of fish. Ice cream can help a woman conceive, new  research  has shown. A study found that eating high-fat dairy foods reduced the risk of ovulation failure. SHEEP experience complex human emotions like love, scientists have discovered.Ewes fall in love with rams, sheep have best friends and they feel sad when members of the flock die or are slaughtered,  studies  have found. I am sure that one day research will be able to prove anything, whether it is true or not! But then of course we have what  Mark Twain said LIES, DAMNED LIES AND STATISTICS.          I can empathize with you for getting woken up so early. I don't go through it with Samuel now, but it was a real problem for years, maybe from ages 2-5 or 6. Could it be that earlier sunrise times are waking her up? Are there birds starting to sing at 4am? We ran into that with Samuel when we vacationed in Maine. They are so far east in this time zone that during the summer it gets light at 4 am there.I hope that you'll get some good napping time today!  Hang in there!

{"date": " March 15, 2007", "body": "\nI was shocked by this news report yesterday.       Man questioned over vicar's death A man is being questioned after a vicar was found stabbed to death in the grounds of his south Wales church. Father Paul Bennett, 59, died at  St Fagans Church in Trecynon , near Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf. The father-of-two and grandfather was found dead in the church grounds by his wife Georgina about 1450 GMT. A 23-year-old local man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and is being questioned. Police said they were not looking for anyone else.    The church grounds in Windsor Street in the middle of the village were sealed off with police standing guard at the gates and scenes of crime officers working throughout the night. Officers said the vicar's family were \"extremely distraught\" Perhaps I  isolate myself too much, due to my disability caused by my arthritis I really do not go anywhere apart from my daughter's school, the supermarket and occasionally to drop my 21 year old at University. Perhaps I should get out more but after reading this I don't think that I want to. My Dad was brought up near to Aberdare and personal attachments to certain situations definitely causes greater impact. I just can't believe that some body would do something so pointless. How do you go on writing after a story like that? I had a video camera for Christmas, a lovely little thing. However, with being ill for so long I haven't actually got around to using it yet! That's me, the number one procrastinator. Last night I finally got to sit down and read the instruction book and have a go at actually filming something. But what do you film? Fiona and SnoWhite refused to be filmed so I had a practice run filming Beauty BUT she was asleep. So all I managed to film was 20 seconds of Beauty snoring..........I have to say the sound quality is brilliant! Now I have to learn how to transfer the filming from the camera to the computer. Then Anastasia and Belle will be able to see how much Beauty has grown. I also managed to re-load the printer(I will be scanning and emailing very soon Belle) and next on my things-to-do-list is re-load Skype(as per request Dimitri!). Being me I did manage to watch a little TV last night but Beauty was again an early riser so I didn't watch very much and I went to bed early. The girls were watching Pretty Women and I managed to see my favourite part, the bit where Julia Roberts goes back to the shop that refused to serve her and shows them all her shopping and says, 'Do you remember me, I came in yesterday and you refused to wait on me, you work on commission don't you? Big mistake'. I did notice Fiona watching a little of  Anthea Turner's Perfect Housewife , but it was a repeat so I didn't bother watching it. Anthea Turner's Perfect housewife is one of the funniest things on TV.  Does the idea of housework instantly make you reach for the remote control and a box of chocolates? Forget Desperate Housewives, meet... the Perfect Housewife! BBC Three's hugely successful series is back and looking for outgoing, funny and friendly women and men to take part. If you'd like to spend a couple of days at Anthea's lovely home and get expert help to turn you from a \u2018hopeless housewife\u2019 into a \u2018domestic goddess\u2019 (or 'domestic god'!) then help is at hand! If you are interested in taking part in this programme call 0117 970 7642  or alternatively, visit the  Me on TV  website and fill in an online form. Would I take part in her show? Not in a million lifetimes! I still haven't figured out if Anthea is seriously mad or seriously sending herself up. I am seriously impressed though with what she can do with a lemon! Whatever is going on in her head though  is compelling viewing. Whenever I see a house like Anthea's  all I can think is that she has too much time on her hands, or a legion of cleaners! I love your program Anthea. Remember what I said about Cardiff yesterday? Time lord tourism boost for city Science fiction TV series Doctor Who and Torchwood have pushed Cardiff into the top 10 short break UK destinations, according to a travel website. The two shows, which are filmed all over south east Wales, attract fans keen to visit key locations. Cardiff Council said the city was building a \"tourism package\" on the back of the success of the programmes. Dale Who from Brighton, who started visiting Cardiff because of the series, said the city was \"stunning\".     In the case of Doctor Who, Cardiff often doubles as London and other cities. Torchwood is set in modern-day Cardiff. And   A spokesman for Cardiff council said Doctor Who and Torchwood had helped to raise the profile of Cardiff. He also said that visitors attracted by Doctor Who and Torchwood were finding that Cardiff had a lot more to offer for a short break. So I am not the only one who likes Cardiff. I like Dr Who and Torchwood as well. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://ljh.d2g.com:81/photos/fulldetails.asp?ID=4574", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/perfect_housewife/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/go/bbcthree/programmes/be_on_three/perfect_housewife.shtml/ext/_auto/-/http://www.meontv.co.uk/AntheaTurnerPerfectHousewife/%28vse3ifuhwln3ds45k1l2pzma%29/Default.aspx", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6450679.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6450679.stm", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-sad-world-we-live-in.html", "title": "\nWHAT A SAD WORLD WE LIVE IN\n"},
{"date": " March 14, 2007", "body": "\n I was brought up in the country, Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan to be precise. So why is it until recently I  have never noticed birds singing at night? And boy are they noisy. According to the RSPB a number of birds do sing at night, even in towns but remember I do live right on the edge of the city next to fields and farmland. I read the following on the RSPB site Which birds sing at night? Nightingales, nightjars and corncrakes are known for their nocturnal singing during the spring and summer, but in winter they migrate to Africa. Other, more common birds such as song thrushes, dunnocks and, most regularly robins, can be heard singing at night all year round. Night-time singing is usually stimulated by bright lights or sudden noise. The robin is the most commonly heard night-time We are on the edge of the city but we have all the street lights and the added lights of the dual-carriageway, perhaps the reason there is so much bird noise is because of the street lights  and the sound and lights from the cars on the dual carriageway. I had to go to the garage around the corner at 5:30am this morning and I was surprised at the amount of bird noise and punters at the garage and from the garage you can look down the embankment and see a lot of traffic on the dual carriageway. Whatever the reason , they make a lot of noise at night. John Barrowman  said that he liked Cardiff because after about 7pm the place quietens down(apart from the birds!) and it is like living in the country. It is so true , I have lived in a number of other places and people so often say uncharitable things about Cardiff and I think 'Whoa, you are so wrong'.It is a capital city  but it is compact enough for me to know where everything is and I can get to town or home from town at any time of the day in under 15 minutes. I remember when Cardiff was competing for city of culture against Bristol and other cities and a  Bristol DJ said he could take losing against any other city but Cardiff and I was amazed that someone would say that. Bristol has a different atmosphere to Cardiff and you just cannot compare them. Anastasia worked in Clifton, Bristol when she first graduated from University so I am aware of what the city has to offer and it just wasn't for me. Bristol has an older industrial heritage to Cardiff and so  Bristol has less of a small town feel. I guess that I will always be a country girl at heart. Last night I watched 10 Things I Hate About You,AGAIN! Heath Ledgers Singing of 'You're Just too Good To Be True' is definitely one of the highlights of the film, up there with Bianca being caught wearing the baby belly! I love that film,the film is just like watching my girls in action. SnoWhite and Fiona are so like Katarina and Bianca when they fight except Fiona isn't all 'Look at me, Look at me' and unlike Katatrina, SnoWhite has self-confessed CHAV tendencies.How terms change over the years, when Anastasia and Belle were younger a CHAV was called a TOWNIE. I remember watching Only Fools And Horses years ago when Del Boy started calling Rodney a WALLY, and it entered into everyday speech, now you don't often hear that term. I can remember John McEnroe introducing the affectionate term Mother F........... into the English language at Wimbledom,it shocked a nation at the time but now it is just another piece of bad language that you hear on TV.Our sensibilities are definitely affected the more that we see and hear  things which makes them no longer so much of a problem to our perception. I also watched some of the documentary  Bodyshock. At just seven years old Dzhambulat Khatokhov - Jambik for short - is four foot three inches tall and weighs 16 stone: as much as a baby elephant. He dwarfs his older brother who is twice his age and less than half his weight. But Jambik is a hero in his home town and an object of fascination in the West. In Bodyshock: World's Biggest Boy, British  Doctor Ian Campbel l travels to the far south of Russia to meet Jambik and his family and uncovers a more disturbing story than he originally imagined. Nobody knows why Jambik is so big, or what this means for his long-term health. But Dr Campbell - one of the world's leading experts on obesity - is determined to find out. Travelling over 2,000 miles to the Caucasus Mountains in Southern Russia, Campbell meets the \"biggest boy in the world\" to see what, if anything, can be done for his condition. Well this body so was shocked .I just could not believe that Jambik's mother can not see the danger of what  is happening.Would she not be gutted if her son died of a heart attack before the age of ten? At one point Jambik's mother questions why doctors cannot come out and say that you can be big and healthy...........that's because you can't.I think that Jambik's Mother seriously needs a visit from  Gillian McKeith, I think that Gillian has the ba**s to take on this woman before the child dies. Gillian, I take back anything I may have said in the past. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds/faqs/identification.asp", "http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds/faqs/identification.asp", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.johnbarrowman.com/", "http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/W/worlds_biggest_boy/index.html", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/bigfatproblem/content/livechatscript_iancampbell.shtml", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.drgillianmckeith.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/noisy-little-suckers.html", "title": "\nNOISY LITTLE SUCKERS!\n"},
{"date": " March 11, 2007", "body": "\n US time switch set to save energy The US has switched to daylight saving time, or summer time, three weeks earlier than usual to cut fuel consumption and help the environment. At 0200 EST (0700 GMT) clocks moved forward by an hour, shifting an hour of daylight from morning to evening. Summer time will last until 4 November, a week later than in previous years. The extra four weeks are expected to help cut energy consumption, as demand falls for electricity in the evening if it is still light. The measure was signed into law two years ago as part of the Energy Policy Act which aims to encourage new energy technologies.  I am totally envious! I seem to spend my winter months waiting for this day and the US are getting it 3 weeks early. This winter has been a long winter with all our illnesses and this would certainly have helped psychologically. I could also go with  this During the Second World War, double summer time (2 hours in advance of GMT) was introduced and was used for the period when, normally ordinary summer time would have been in force. During the winter clocks were kept one hour in advance of GMT. After the war, summer time was invoked each year from 1948 to 1967. In 1968 clocks were advanced one hour ahead of GMT on 18 February and remained so until British Standard Time, during which clocks were kept in advance of GMT all year, came into force between 27 October 1968 and 31 October 1971. I can see all the disadvantages but it is nice to dream! Two years ago we spent Christmas on the island of Tobermory and it was still quite dark at 9 am. The farmers also talk about working longer in the dark but after years of working  nights as a nurse I know that you get used to it( well I did, I loved working nights). I do have sympathy however with the religious implications. Due to the whole  UNTIDY HOUSE  episode, we had a family conference yesterday. We tend to end up doing our weekend shopping on a Saturday evening due to my total dislike of shopping when there are huge crowds in the supermarkets and evenings are relatively quiet.I asked SnoWhite and Fiona if they wanted to come with me and they unsuspectingly agreed. Imagine the situation, Myself, Beauty, SnoWhite and Fiona in the car and I said ,'Right.........family conference'. And why did I choose that moment? Captive audience of course! I also told them that I wanted no arguments and they were very obliging. I explained my desire for the whole of the downstairs to be cleaned daily(plus the upstairs bathroom), and co-operation with the washing of dishes and laundry.I explained that the more that they helped the quicker the work would be done daily,  if they did not agree they in no way showed it. I have a brother and sister who attend my computer classes and the sister has told me that they do all the housework in their house. The mother and father both work and the children contribute to the family by helping around the house. Also, when I was growing up I was quite happy to help my mother with housework, so I am not asking them to do something I wouldn't do. Only time will tell the outcome of this little conference! I was so pleased with Beauty yesterday, she brought me some yoghurts to take the lids off for her and when I handed them back she said, 'Thank you'. Only a little achievement but they all build up. When we were in the Supermarket we went down the crisp aisle and Beauty saw Pringles and she remembered that we had had some before and wanted some but I said No and she was not happy with this answer. I did however put Walkers (70% less fat) crisps into the trolley and it took about 2 aisles of paddying before she would accept that the Pringles weren't happening but the Walkers were. No it isn't ever very nice when a child on the autistic spectrum has a meltdown in public but thankfully this was only a small one. From it's early conclusion it also seems as if she understood that she couldn't always have her own way and that is an achievement in itself.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6438563.stm", "http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.344", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/us-time-switch-set-to-save-energy-us.html", "title": "\nPERCHANCE TO DREAM\n"},
{"date": " March 09, 2007", "body": "\n In a previous blog I wrote about how I could only dream about having a housekeeper, the situation has not changed but somehow I feel I was  mis -read by my children. Instead of them reading I would like a housekeeper they have  mis -read the statement to say I WANT TO BE A  HOUSEKEEPER. Two totally different statements.Yesterday my usually laid back self lost it, the state of the house was more that I could cope with. I went to bed about 11pm the night before and the last thing I said to  SnoWhite  and Fiona was.'Do not let me get up in the morning and find this mess still here'. And yes it was still there! I have to admit though that Fiona had tidied up all her painting stuff and it was in a pile in one place.......... SnoWhite  had not!  SnoWhite  was asleep on the sofa mid-mess. Hands up..........I loosed a verbal tirade at her for not doing as I asked. She eventually got up, grabbed her stuff together and started to go upstairs, to which I shouted,' Do not go back to sleep' and she shouted back angrily that she would not be. 10 minutes later, the quiet from upstairs made it very obvious that she was asleep. I sent Fiona up to tell her to get her butt  downstairs and to do some housework. Art work aside, the whole of the downstairs seemed to be awash with dirty clothes , dirty dishes and rubbish and not of my making. When Fiona tried to wake her up,  SnoWhite's  usual response was 'I am not asleep' and Fiona's answer was,'I don't think she cares, she wants you downstairs now and cleaning'.Having a flouncing  princess cleaning when she would rather be sleeping is like having a time bomb ticking away. We both remained silent whilst the work got done. Fiona was helpfulness personified. I do not ask for much, I just want them to do the same as me. Fill and empty a dishwasher. Fill, turn on  washing machine and wash clothes. Empty washing machine and dry clothes. Put clothes away. Ironing. Put rubbish and recycling in the bins and put the bags out. Clean the kitchen,hall, dining room,lounge, bathrooms and Beauty's bedroom. Do the above without being asked(most important). If It takes me 3 hours to do the above then it should only take the 3 of us 1 hour each to do the lot! Why should I clean up after 2 other adults(O.K Fiona may technically still be a child but as she is over 6 foot tall and bigger than me, lets not split hairs here)?And without being paid for it! Oh yes...........the worm has turned. Where are these  OCD  autistic children that you always read about? I wrote about the  Jackson  family in a previous post and they had 4 boys who were somewhere on the spectrum and their house was just like mine, floors  awash with clothes , toys...........you name it! To other less important matters................life of course goes on. Snowhite  showed up last night with a handful of leaves that she had picked to paint for her project and amongst the leaves were some  catkins . I don't think I have had children bringing catkins into the house for years, that is the strangeness sometimes of having children over 3 decades, the 80's 90's & 00's. Beauty would totally not be interested in nature the same way that her sisters saw nature, remember........... Beauty eats daisies! Though she does love picking and holding fallen leaves. I remember Anastasia and Belle picking catkins as small children in the 80's . I remember picking catkins as a child. Life with Beauty has been a lot less stressful in many ways with Beauty than it was with her sisters. No Rainbows, no ballet classes, no martial arts classes...........which brings it's own sadness too. The weather (as a Brit I have to mention the weather frequently-it is one of the things that we do best) seems to have cheered up recently. Rain at night but sunny and bright in the day, I have even managed to almost dry  a good few lines of washing in the last few days. I dry them as much as possible outside and then I finish them off in the tumble dryer and with the volume of washing that we go through in our house it does seem to save a lot of money on the electricity bills. It still surprises me how many people I see in little  strappy  T shirts the minute there is a little bit of sun. I went to the Doctors surgery the other morning to pick up a prescription and I remember not wanting to get out of the car because it was quite chilly and I didn't have the largest of jackets on(I think I had  mis -read the weather slightly) and across from me was a young girl wearing flip-flops, jeans and a  STRAPPY  T SHIRT! I felt colder just looking at her! I also don't know if it is just a  phenomena  of the city I live in but what is it with lads and shorts in winter and no they are not just coming from the gym. Cardiff is a university city so we have students everywhere, 24 hours Tesco on Western Avenue is opposite UWIC . Behind the store is a huge halls of residence for the University of Wales, Cardiff so whenever I go to this particular store, night or day, students are in the majority. And the lads seem to love to wear 3/4 length shorts.........even when it is snowing!I sometimes feel frostbite setting in just looking at them. Thankfully in the summer when it is slightly warmer they do not shed all their clothes and walk around naked, well not in the shops any way! Am I the only one whose mother said ' Ne'er cast a clout till May be out'  ?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catkin", "http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/till-may-is-out.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/dont-misquote-me.html", "title": "\nDON'T MISQUOTE ME!\n"},
{"date": " March 10, 2007", "body": "\nI started my degree when Fiona was a few months old, a computers degree but after a few months I realised that computers was not the subject for me.If I wanted to do a science based subject then it would have to be an exact science and there is definitely something very inexact about computers! One of the favourite answers given by course lecturers when something wouldn't work was to turn the computer off and re-boot it! Anyway, I completed the first year of the degree and then transferred to a  joint honours Welsh/History degree which I completed in 1995. At the end of the degree I applied for a job in the   Museum of Wales  library, it required knowledge of  Welsh and Welsh history and I had both. They couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge my application, feeling very rejected I went back to nursing.Because of my degree I understand  Welsh  but constructing sentences and taking part in a conversation is a lot of effort and I tend just to switch off. My children tend to mistake this for having no knowledge of the Welsh language and sometimes I have to remind them that they are NOT talking a secret language when they chat to each other in Welsh! Each of them went to Welsh language schools for part or all of their education so their conversational skills are of course better than mine. However, even with all the knowledge that they have of Welsh it has never really been a language that was spoken at home.We lived in England until Anastasia was 7 and I insisted that we came back to Wales so that the girls could learn the language, even though their father is a first language Welsh speaker he did not speak the language with the girls.With this lack of the Welsh language being a big part of our home life I was surprised yesterday when I was sitting at the computer writing to hear a little voice singing and talking in Welsh! Beauty was playing on the  CBeebies (BBC for little children) website and was on her favourite site- The  Bobinogs . Yes it is a cartoon made in Wales but the BBC does have an English language version of all the games and songs but obviously not for Beauty! She seems some how to have found the Welsh language songs and games and insists on playing on those.By coincidence, Beauty's older sisters have a cousin who does the voice of one of the Welsh language  Bobinogs ! So we have Beauty singing the songs  Mynd   i'r   ty   bach (go to the toilet), Beth i  wisgo (what to wear)and  Ffrindiau (friends).Very surreal, here is a child who is profoundly autistic, has speech delays and yet she has learnt to sing songs in another language and chat to the computer in another language! Remember this is also the child who taught herself to use the computer.Beauty can zip around the web, in and out of websites with remarkable ease and she has also taught herself to use the mouse and can use the space bar, arrow keys and enter a name to play a game! I wouldn't have known where to start to teach her all that! I really feel that the computer has helped Beauty a lot, more and more she is transferring what she has learnt on the web to real life.   This is  Punky , named after the pumpkin in the Cinderella story, Beauty named him herself. Cinderella  is a story that Beauty really loves and we listen to it at least once a day. After listening to the story, Beauty was able to transfer information she had gained from the story and know that the Pumpkin Head decoration that she found on the shelves in the kitchen was also a pumpkin and she named him  Punky (she did call him  Pumpky  at the start but now she seems to have settled on  Punky ). Last night when Beauty went to bed she also exhibited the signs and symptoms of being a NORMALLY developing child! Would she stay in her bed? Would she heck! At least 20 times(I kid you not) we went through the whole GOOD NIGHT, SWEET DREAMS,SLEEP TIGHT routine. Eventually exhaustion won over her determination. It was quite sweet actually because every time you said,'Right.........BED!' to her and she knew you were coming to put her back to bed, she would turn and run and  squeal with laughter and then jump onto her bed just as you got there to put her back into bed! I love kids. It is 7:35am  and I am being 'picked on' by Ariel( Tourettes  Girl), she just will not shut up(remember this is the girl who wants to join the army-save us all). Usually when I wake up in the morning I generally ease myself into my day by taking pain killers and arthritis medication and slowly but quietly waiting for my medication to kick in. However, this morning Ariel has insisted on sending me kicking and screaming into my day without any undue delay. She is up early to go to her Saturday job in  Ikea  and presently we are discussing the merits of her best friend selling her  Mini Cooper  and buying a diesel version of her Mini Cooper!Oh and the possibility of her and her friends going on a road-trip to visit their University of choice ,   Exeter  for an open day! Ariel's answer to the situation is, 'You've gotta love 17 year  olds !'.................thank you for that deeply philosophical insight into my day. Nothing on TV last night seemed to catch the imagination of my children so they decide to watch a DVD or a video, we literally have a cupboard full! Considering all the quality films that we have i.e everything  Steven   Seagal ,  anything  Disney (well maybe not quality but Beauty loves them all) and my favourite  Steel Magnolias  I was surprised with their choice,  Sleepless in Seattle! Wow was  Tom Hanks  so young in that! You know those silly questions you get emailed every so often in a quiz? The ever popular question,'which actress would play you in a film about your life' always comes up and my answer is always  Meg Ryan.   Snowhite's  choice is  Selma  Hayek . Ariel has gone to work, Fiona and SnoWhite are still asleep(it would take a lot to wake them!), Beauty-after refusing to sleep is still catching Zzzzz's, I think I may join Beauty for a little nap.

What are our children going to think when they visit their supermarket and clothes are on sale for adults which are a size 4(0)? They are going to get a message which says that this is OK, it is acceptable but it isn't.

{"date": " March 12, 2007", "body": "\n 'The NHS failed my daughter' An independent inquiry is to be launched after the charity Mencap highlighted six deaths of people with learning disabilities in NHS care. One of the cases was that of Emma, 26, a woman with a severe learning disability, who died in 2004. Her mother Jane took her to the GP because she had not eaten for eight days. The doctor thought it was a virus, but Jane thought her daughter's condition was something more serious. A month later, Emma had to be admitted to hospital where she was found to have a swelling in her groin. She was distressed and in great pain, and she could not eat or take painkillers orally. Her family say the hospital staff found it hard to look after Emma, who could display challenging behaviour and struggle to express how she felt. Emma was discharged because the hospital said they could do nothing more to help her. But 11 days later, test results showed she had lymphoma - a cancer of the blood. Her family were told that, with treatment, she had a 50:50 chance of survival. But doctors decided not to treat her, saying she would not co-operate with her treatment, and she was sent home. However she was admitted again five days later because she could not drink. But, according to Jane, Emma still received no treatment for two days and care only started when the family's solicitor complained to the hospital.     At this point, doctors said Emma only had a 10% chance of survival after treatment and that the only option for her was palliative care.Jane says: \"We had serious doubts about her care; the delays and the lack of understanding and the fact that they weren't listening to us.\"She wasn't given basic care. We had to feed her and wash her.\"Nobody talked to her about her care, although we tried to advise them what she needed.\"She added: \"I know cancer treatment is expensive, and I feel like Emma wasn't seen as an investment.\"Emma was transferred to a hospice for the last month of her life. Her condition, and her ability to take in liquids, improved while she was there.The family has submitted a complaint to the Healthcare Commission, who are currently investigating the case. Jane said: \"We were devastated by Emma's death, and we also have to deal with the process of making a complaint.\" I find this article really sad. Not only do I find it sad but frightening. What does this mean for my child who is learning disabled? Would Beauty also  not be  's een as an investment'    if she were taken seriously ill? Only by reading things like this can we learn and be prepared. I am grateful to Emma's mother for revealing what has happened. If Beauty became ill I would insist on immediate care with my solicitor stood next to me. To something less serious. Should I be proud to say that I watched very little  TV last night? I sat down to watch the end of Grey's Anatomy, not a program that I usually watch but SnoWhite loves it  and she had informed me that the new episode of Supernatural would be following. BIG HOWEVER, she proceeds to inform me that she doesn't want to watch Supernatural as she has already seen it on YouTube and 'it's not very good anyway'. BUT  there is a double bill of Grey's Anatomy on! Unspoken 'Pleeeeeease let me watch it'. She also happily informs me that Supernatural will be repeated on Thursday! Who could deny a face like that?

{"date": " March 27, 2007", "body": "\nRecently the 2 minibuses at my daughter's school, a wild garden at a local primary school and numerous cars have been vandalised  in the area where I live. As the police did not witness who committed the crimes it is really difficult to do anything about the situation. Gangs of  golf club wielding youths between the ages of 10 and 16 have been seen wandering the area all hours of the day and night but unless you witness them doing something ................nothing can be done. I was recently asked to write a short piece for the BBC Wales website on what I thought the Welsh Assembly and assembly members could do for young people. The reason that I had agreed to take part in the Wales 60 group was because I wanted to voice my opinions about Special Needs Education  and provision. As yet I haven't managed to say anything on that subject. I was so upset with the mindless vandalism that has damaged the two mini-buses at the Beauty's Special Needs School and the other vandalism mentioned that I used my recent piece on the website to discuss lack of parental control. The question  I was given for the recent piece was What should candidates for the Welsh assembly elections on 3 May offer the young? Other panel members talked about provision of affordable housing for young couples, another member talked about  changes in secondary education and again affordable housing, another talked about set curriculum stifling teachers and families being better off working than finding it easier to be on benefits, another the worries of providing an education for your children, and another talked about young people feeling disengaged from politics in general. I wrote the following  I am concerned with parental responsibility.     Two of my daughters are university graduates, one is in university and one is going in September and whilst they were growing up they had plenty of places to go and things to do in the area in which we live -  Pentwyn , Cardiff.    They attended dance classes, youth club, went swimming and went to Guides and Brownies and when not attending activities they did homework, watched TV, used the computer or read books.    All these activities still happen in  Pentwyn , as well as computer classes for children at the local community education centre. A skate park has been built at the leisure centre, where there are many activities for children and young people.    There is also a park and an all-weather pitch has been built which is within walking distance.    So why, then, do we have gangs of children of all ages wandering the streets, all hours of the day and night committing acts of vandalism and instilling fear into local residents? Maybe they will not ask me to write again as they might think I am too stroppy! And before I even got to voice my opinions on Special Needs issues, not much of a voice for the cause am I ?                             \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6471749.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/voice-for-cause.html", "title": "\nVOICE FOR THE CAUSE\n"},

{"date": " March 01, 2007", "body": "\nToday it has been 1 month exactly since I first came down with flu-like symptoms and I have been sick ever since though I think I have had 3 different types of bugs. This morning I decided to look on the internet to check-out reduced immune symptoms and to see what I could do to increase my immune system.I have always been really good at exams but dreadful at writing essays! AND within a week of taking the exam I have forgotten a high percentage of what I learned for the exam anyway(which is not much good!). After trying to get a grasp on what the many thousands of articles on reduced immune systems were trying to say, I have decided that I would need a Phd to understand what all the articles were trying to say and a Phd I just don't have. My capacity to forget excelled itself this morning and within seconds of reading each article I couldn't remember much of what I had read. The ANSWER...............go to Asda(with my reading glasses) and check-out all the supplements and see which ones are being sold to boost the immune system. Perhaps my brain is more addled than usual due to constant illness! Perhaps not. The thought of going back through the articles to pick out the lifestyle changes also needed to improve your immune system just tires me out  so perhaps I will get Fiona or SnoWhite to do it for me. The one thing I do remember from the article that seemed to stand out was the fact that stress can contribute to a reduced immune system, perhaps I can convince the girls that if they were to help with the housework them my stress levels would be reduced! Nice thought. The thought of a week in in bed with endless supplies of cold cure and OJ and the children doing the housework sounds good to me(see........I have such a wonderful imagination that I could write a book!).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/life-is-beach.html", "title": "\nLIFE IS A BEACH!\n"},

{"date": " February 28, 2007", "body": "\n Who needs an alarm clock when you have a thunder and lightning storm that wakes you up at exactly 5:15am and is finished by 5:20am! That was a short but massive storm. I awoke wondering what had woken me and then I saw the lightning........and the heavens opened. AND the pressure in the air caused me to have a really splitting headache! Weird! I'd rather Beauty as my alarm clock-not so violent. When Beauty was 6 weeks old we went on holiday to Portugal, one night we had the scariest storm you could imagine.The storm took a long time building up and had travelled across the Mediterranean and we were in its path when it finally went out into the Atlantic ocean. When it hit us I thought that a bomb had hit the hotel it was so loud, I have never heard or seen a storm so loud and noisy. Even the storm of 1988 that took the roof off SnoWhite's nursery school was quiet in comparison. Last night I watched a TV show called  Never Did Me Any Harm,    From the makers of Channel 4's acclaimed series That'll Teach 'Em, this new four-part series is for every parent who has ever said \"It wasn't like that when I was young.\" The McIvers' house in Morecambe is packed to the rafters with toys, gadgets and gizmos.    They have six televisions, six DVD players, three video players, five games consoles, two computers, six hi-fis, four digi-boxes and a karaoke machine. Mum Cheryl's childhood - only a generation ago - couldn't have been more different. When she was young there was no indoor toilet, let alone the latest technology. There was just the one television set and the family watched it together. She saved up for a cassette player to listen to her favourite band:  The Bay City Rollers . Cheryl has worked hard to give her children everything she didn't have when she grew up. But now she is starting to question what it is doing to them. She wants to know if a dose of her strict no-nonsense 70s upbringing will sort out her lot. In tonight's third episode of Never Did Me Any Harm, the clocks are turned back for two weeks to when Cheryl was young, so that her family can get a taste of her no-nonsense childhood. Mum is desperately hoping that this experience will help them to learn how to communicate better with each other, how to work together more as a family and how to entertain themselves, all without the aid of modern technology.   it was really uncomfortable viewing...........this was my childhood! Except for the 2 weeks holiday in Blackpool, the nice clothes and the good food she had when she was younger! I was impressed with how well behaved her children were, for a walk along the beach the boys allowed their mother to dress them all alike in grey trousers, shirt and jumper.........yes the boys did look smart but not for a walk along the beach! I really have never grown-up because when the mother kept saying,'Well when I was a young girl' it really started to get on my nerves and I mentioned it to Fiona and she laughed and said that she was thinking exactly the same thing. The program confirmed what I have been saying recently that pre-internet days was literally The Dark Ages in it's own way.I did my degree without using the internet but one of my lecturers on my masters course recently said,'if it's in a book it's out-of-date'. I know that the internet has all the bad stuff on it but it is still a powerful tool for good. Think of all the stuff you couldn't do pre-internet.........now we can easily buy   Britney's  hair, view people making nit-wits of themselves on YouTube and even online dating! What more could we ask for? I don't often tell Beauty off because I am not sure how much she understands. However when she does something dangerous I do tell her forcefully that she has done something that could hurt her and if she has touched something that could hurt her I usually tap(not hit) the back of her hand to reinforce what I have said. Yesterday in a fit of pique that the computer would not do as she wanted she  pushed the  screen, the keyboard and the mouse on the floor.  Yes I did  tell her  off forcefully  and she put  her hands  over her ears and  started to cry!  The little moo made me  feel so guilty but  at least  I felt that she knew there was  something not right with what she had done. I can hope! Later on she was having difficulty with one of her internet games and she started to get a little over enthusiastic with the computer so I said, 'NO..........I don't think so' and instantly her hands covered her ears BUT she did calm down so perhaps it worked. When Beauty was little and first diagnosed with autism her first speech therapist said to simplify commands and speech so that it was easier for her to remember and understand what was being said and it really seemed to work. This is going to sound like all I do is watch TV but like I've said before YOU ONLY HAVE ONE LIFE and I am pretty selective about what I watch. Last night I was watching  Dog Borstal,  I really cannot believe the behaviour of some of the dog owners, some of them seem to have no commonsense whatsoever and I feel sorry for the dogs. One of the dog owners was teaching his dog to sit, stand, walk etc..........you know , follow basic commands. Instead of giving giving strong basic commands the owner kept waffling on and I remember thinking.'oh shut up and say things like sit, stand etc and keep the waffling for the shows of affection'. AND the trainer said exactly the same thing. Beauty to me acts very much like a puppy at times and responds very well to simple language and predictable , consistent behaviour. When I was training to be a nurse I remember being shown the embryos of different animals , including humans , and being surprised at how similar they looked. As long as I am not being patronising and I talk to Beauty with respect, I can see how teaching and learning can be similar in humans to certain animals. Obviously development , emotional and physical does eventually separate and take a different path in humans to animals but early development in the very young does seem to have similarities. Years ago I remember a TV advert where a father is looking after his young son whilst his wife is in hospital just having had a baby. The father asks the young son what he wants for dinner and the son says,' Choc ice  and chips' and that is what he gives him! Well it sounds good to me, only one dish to wash. This morning I found Fiona making herself breakfast of raspberry ripple ice cream! She was surprised when I laughed at her less than traditional breakfast! What joy a child on the autistic spectrum can be.........never a dull moment. Brilliant News! SnoWhite has caught the girly bug..........she now has a beautiful hairstyle! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/never-did-me-any-harm-channel-4/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_City_Rollers", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/dog_borstal/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choc_ice", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/who-needs-alarm-clock-when-you-have.html", "title": "\nWAKEY,WAKEY!\n"},
{"date": " February 26, 2007", "body": "\nMy 6 year old has one scary cough, she coughs like an elderly gentleman who has smoked way too much, and at the end of the cough is a hugely disgusting expectorating noise like Spit the dog(I dislike that dog!). But not as much as that bl**dy emu! Spit Emu Emu is the thing of nightmares and should definitely stay in his box. WE HAVE CURTAINS! For many people having curtains is something that they take for granted but for the last 4 to 5 years our lounge has seen a succession of curtain rails.......all torn down by Beauty swinging on them! So we have had throws, bed covers , sheets and for the longest time a pink sari covering our lounge window and all held up just by being tied to hooks. But now we are trying a curtain rail again(but still suspended by the hooks) to see how Beauty reacts to them, she seems to have lost interest in the window. When Beauty was diagnosed with autism there was no mention  of house trashing which seems to affect a lot of autistic children! These are Beauty's bedroom curtains! Yes I know that they are bright but I bought them on sale when Fiona was little for her bedroom and she loved them. They were designed and made in Australia and so have an aboriginal theme. Beauty also ripped the radiator off the living room wall(thankfully she doesn't do that anymore!) flooded the expensive cream berber carpet(what was I thinking buying that?) and so we replaced it with wood flooring which is  a wonderful thing to have when you have a a child on the autistic spectrum, so much to easier to keep clean! Terence Conran  once said that it was better to decorate you house in whites and creams so you could see the dirt and clean it. It maybe a good idea if you can afford to pay a legion of cleaners but I'm afraid it is not such a good idea when you have a child on the autistic spectrum who will only drink blackcurrant and apple squash and loves to 'decorate'(artistically pour all around the room) their world with it. My answer is to cover all the furniture in throws and wash them constantly. My washing machine is very hardworking(eco-wash of course!). I AM INSPIRED Mid blog creation I decided to have my breakfast so I went to the fridge to find some yoghurt. I decided on Weight Watchers fromage frais with forest fruits. However, I made the mistake of passing the sink to get a teaspoon and I found the sink overflowing..........can anyone explain why my sink should be overflowing but the dishwasher empty? That one always confuses me! So I filled the dishwasher and turned it on. I also emptied the tumble dryer and folded the clothes, sorted out clean clothes for Beauty to wear, re-filled the tumble dryer and turned it on and filled and turned on the washing machine(remember all eco-washes). None of these tasks were too arduous so I have decided that for Mother's Day (they are already asking me what I want) I shall ask for the day off housework! I shall also ask that my off spring also DO THE WORK that I am not doing so that the next day I do not have to do twice as much work. PLEASE.

{"date": " February 27, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday  evening there was a bit of a commotion in the local garage when I went  to pick up a few groceries, it seems that someone had stolen a  cancer charity collection box! I felt really sorry for the women working in the shop because they thought that they were going to get into trouble from the owner of the shop. How could anyone possibly steal something like that? I am totally baffled. I know that my thoughts are not totally mainstream on a lot of things but that is totally unacceptable. I could understand if somebody was totally without money and stole groceries for their children but this is different. Thankfully I have never been in a situation where I have felt compelled to steal to feed my children. And what would the person who stole the money spend it on anyway? These charity boxes are placed in such a way in shops so you put your 'shrapnel'(spare change-coppers) in when you receive your change after paying. So how much could possibly be in one of these boxes? Not a lot! Don't get me wrong, I really believe that there can be situations that arise that you have no control over that can leave you financially desperate(and yes I have been there) but I also believe that some of the situations are created by the individuals themselves. A few years ago, a few days before Christmas, I took my children into a charity shop to look at second-books and whilst we were there a young mother came in with her 3 small children and asked  the shop assistant if they had any toys for sale.  I was devastated to  see this young mother trailing her children around charity shops just before Christmas looking for toys as there was nothing I could do for her and God only knows what had happened to bring her to this situation. However their 'poverty' was nothing compared to the beggars that asked me for money in the Moscow train station when we were waiting for the train to St Petersburg. The toilets in the station were not very disability friendly and were at the bottom of a huge stair case so I waited at the top with Beauty whilst Anastasia and SnoWhite went down and I went down when they came up. Whilst I was waiting a gypsy woman with her 2 small children asked me for money but I didn't have any so I gave her children some pink iced buns that we had bought that day and were going to eat on the train journey. The iced buns had literally cost pennies but the children's faces lit up like they had never seen anything like it before and when Anastasia came up I asked her if she had any change and she gave me a few pennies which was enough to buy  bread for the family for 2 days. The mother of the children was almost in tears with what we had given her but it made me feel awful that she should have so little. I also feel that 'poverty' or what defines it has changed since I was a child. When I was growing up we gad a rented TV and that was it but today the list of what an individual has in their house is endless..............TV(PLASMA MAYBE , DVD, computers, laptops, I pods , Mp3's, sound systems, video games consuls etc. Whilst I was going around visiting with the Health Visitors when I was doing my nurses training we visited a family who were recently  on benefits and were having a hard time but the only thing the health visitor could comment on when we left the property were the amount of videos the family had. Even if they had sold them they wouldn't have got much for them, a tenner if they were lucky. However, I also visited some families who had been on benefits for many years and they lived in luxury and I can remember thinking, 'I want whatever they are having'. I am with  Andrew Collins  who wrote the book WHERE DID IT ALL GO RIGHT, I hate miserable childhood stories. I am sorry but I had a miserable childhood, no I don't want to write about it  and publish a book and yes forgetting the bad bits of my past is fine by me but I do feel that poverty today is relative  in this country compared to what it was when I was a child. No child in this day and age should be reared in poverty and any government who allows it to happen has failed. Today I read about       Hospices warning of service cuts Hospices have warned they may have to turn away terminally ill patients in Wales because of a funding crisis. The Hospice of the Valleys in Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent which provides palliative care said it would have to cut services unless it was \"properly funded\". And the following article You are just left alone' Shirley Nurock  talking about her husbands dementis care She said there was a desperate need for better support for people with dementia and their families.\"You do not get much help from state services, and voluntary services are overstretched and pushed for cash. It made me angry and I am still angry now. \"Services are really fragmented. People w ' ith dementia are being rationed. Its criminal. \"Basic care should be seen as a necessity. T here seem to be cuts and problems with funding everywhere. Dirty, badly maintained streets, cuts in social and health care , inadequate educational provision etc Monday, 4 December 2006, 11:51 GMT   BBC News Anger at MPs' '66% pay rise call' MPs have been criticised after reports some are calling for a 66% pay rise, taking salaries to \u00a3100,000 a year. MPs are reported to have written to the Senior Salaries Review Board saying the rise is needed to bring them into line with senior civil servants and GPs.  I wonder if the MP's are happy with the funding for their salaries? If they are then at least somebody is happy with the way government money is being spent. Re-reading this entry I think perhaps it comes across as confused but I think probably that is because I covered so many issues, probably badly..........sorry. I think that even if I didn't have a child that was autistic and fighting for better educational and social provision for her then I would still be fighting for someone or something. Perhaps I get that from my Dad! Richard Bach said the following in The Reluctant Messiah Here is a test to know if your work on earth is done.........if your alive, it isn't.

{"date": " February 14, 2007", "body": "\nHow accurate are statistics? Today we have the following news report UK is accused of failing children The UK has been accused of failing its children, as it comes bottom of a league table for child well-being across 21 industrialised countries. The Unicef report looked at 40 indicators including poverty, peer and family relationships and health. The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Finland head the list. Children's charities have condemned the findings. The government says it has made progress on child well-being through several initiatives.    Unicef - the United Nations' children's organisation - says the report, titled Child Poverty in Perspective: An Overview of Child Well-being in Rich Countries, is the first study of childhood across the world's industrialised nations. A spokesman for the UK government said its initiatives in areas such as poverty, pregnancy rates, teenage smoking, drinking and risky sexual behaviour had helped improve children's welfare.   Welfare Reform Minister Jim Murphy said the Unicef study was an \"historic\" report, which used some data which was now out of date.\"It looks at some information and analysis from perhaps six, seven, eight years ago,\" he told the BBC's Newsnight. \"Some of the information really is out of date in that sense I have looked at he data used and feel that not all geographical, sociological and economic situations in each country are fully appreciated with their regard to the data obtained. In a  list of countries by crude  birth rate , based on  The World Factbook , as at August 2006  it shows that the UK is above the following countries in Birth rate (births/1,000 population) Romania, Finland, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Poland,Hungary,Switzerland,Germany, Italy,Canada, Malta, Poland, Czech Republic Have they mentioned how this can effect their results? I want to say straightaway that my evidence is purely anecdotal and I am not a sociologist, anthropologist , psychologist or any other -ologist but recently I read a news article about a decline in birthrates in Spain and a similar  trend in other European Countries.When on holiday in Spain recently I read about a falling birthrate which was seeing the decrease of the larger Spanish families to families that only had one child. The article talked about how the government had become worried as to decline in population but the women of child bearing age felt there was no way they could afford to have more than one child. Because of this, from my own observation, Spanish children are adored and treasured and there is nothing wrong with that. This is a list of   by countries  total fertility rate (TFR UK-1.63 Romania-1.35 Belgium-1.61 Sweden-1.53 Spain-1.13 Poland-1.38 Hungary-1.25 Switzerland-1.47 Germany-1.38 Italy1.18 Poland-1.38 Czech Republic So does this evidence show that countries with a lower Total Fertility Rate fare better in the  Unicef Report? I think on average it does  BUT did you notice that I did not list the countries that did not fit in with my theories? So the less children you have then the better quality of life you have? Well I think we were all aware that 'only children' gain many advantages from being an only child but  possible sociological and emotional issues are not included in the UNICEF study. Of course you can't mention everything but please mention the possibility of other evidence skewing the results. Larger families on  limited incomes  , whilst financially 'poor' according to statistics , do not necessarily live a less happy or fulfilling life. Yes I see this in a personal sense but I feel more upset that yet again statistics are being manipulated to show what the researcher wants to show(I showed how that could be done). I have 2 daughters who have graduated from University, one who is currently studying in University and one who will begin her studies in October and another who wants to study art. They grew up having less than their peers(being in Welsh Medium Schools and on scholarships to private schools was always going to ensure that) but they have said that they never felt that financially they missed out on anything they wanted(apart from expensive trainers I guess). Colette Marshall, UK director of Save the Children, said it was \"shameful\" to see the UK at the bottom of the table. \"This report shows clearly that despite the UK's wealth, we are failing to give children the best possible start in life,\" she said. \"The UK government is not investing enough in the well-being of children, especially to combat poverty and deprivation.\"     Shadow Chancellor George Osborne accused Chancellor Gordon Brown of having \"failed this generation of children\".\"After 10 years of his welfare and education policies, our children today have the lowest well-being in the developed   world,\" said Mr Osborne . He also said government could encourage parents to have greater involvement with their children through \"a framework of more flexible working\".But he added: \"I don't actually think government has the answer to all these problems.\"This is not all about politicians in Westminster passing laws, it's about social responsibility, it's about parents taking greater responsibility for their children, it's about trusting teachers in classrooms, it's about us as neighbours in a society playing our part as well.\" I feel that much government money is being wasted on things that are less relevant(but that gripe can best be left for another day!) our children's generation are those who will wipe your shitty ass Mr Brown when you are old and in your dotage and ending your days in a nursing home, SO PLAY NICE! David Cameron  has a child with  cerebral palsy  and  epilepsy  and I really feel that his personal awareness of children with disability  has influenced his views on the difficulties of having a child with physical and learning difficulties. I wonder if  Gordon Brown  whose  son Fraser who was recently diagnosed with signs of  cystic fibrosis  will also come to this awareness..............we can only wait and see! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6359363.stm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_rate", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6359363.stm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/183/", "http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown", "http://www.cftrust.org.uk/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/statisticsmy-are.html", "title": "\nSTATISTICS...................'MY AR*E!\n"},
{"date": " January 28, 2007", "body": "\n MY FAMILY SLEEP OH WRIGGLESOME SLEEP! It is now 5:55am and Beauty has had a funny old night, more wrigglesome  and grumbly than usual.Her sleeping habits are so much better than before and she truly seems happy to go to bed at 9pm, next we shall try 8.45pm and so on. She is a funny little thing at bedtime and insists on being completely covered by the bed clothes.Educationally in many ways she is either at her age group or above but emotionally and developmentally in lots of ways she is still about 18 months and it is still like having a toddler in the house. If nothing else, she is always entertaining! I often feel regret that my parents never lived to know her as I think they would have been particularly fond of her with her funny little ways, she is a little sweetheart. A very quiet day yesterday with my body reminding me that I am indeed growing old, I spent a lot of the time lying down and Beauty spent her day between her toys, the computer and coming to give me hugs, kisses and cuddles. Beauty is a very affectionate little girl. Even with all her problems, Beauty is always aware when I am not well and comes to give me lots of hugs which then make me feel lots better.My little star! SUSHI SATURDAY Sometimes on a Saturdays I give an older gentleman, who is in a nursing home, a lift to the Conservative Club where he plays bingo and and there is entertainment.Well last night was one of those nights and on the way back we went to get some food in TESCO EXTRA which is open until 10pm on a Saturday. For a year now I have not been eating beef, pork, lamb or chicken or turkey and in January I decided they I needed to stop eating fish as well. Oh that is so hard, Saturday was sushi night! Tesco sell a wonderful sushi tray for \u00a35 and that was my Saturday night treat and it was only 500 calories and I can work that off in my exercise routine. I decided to buy CAULDRON Cumberland Veggie Sausages from the chiller section  instead and I had sausage sandwiches, with lots of tomato sauce. So not as good as sushi but pretty good anyway. I really need to get out more if my idea of enjoyment on a Saturday night is a tray of sushi or veggie sausage sandwiches! MY WEATHER OBSESSION Yes I am a true Brit, I have this daily need to discuss the weather! Others feel the need to shop, party, go to the cinema, drink alcohol etc, etc, etc well me! I just have to have my fix of discussing the weather. And the excuse that makes it ok! I have a daughter living in Florida and another daughter living in Vienna and I discuss the weather on my blog so they have an idea of what life is like at home. My mother used to say that I was a good letter writer and she used to enjoy receiving my letters(pre-internet) when we lived in England. I feel it is my duty to keep my girls in touch with what is happening at home(well that's my excuse and I am sticking to it). The weather has been very cold and windy here in the last week but yesterday when we went out in the evening, it was really quite pleasant because there was no wind. There were no clouds so the moon was visible and it was quite a nice drive to the shops. I am looking forward to the lighter nights so  once again we can take Beauty for walks down the Bay and around the Pierhead. The rest of the week is meant to be cloudy with a little  sun but no rain, it will be nice to take Beauty for a walk around the lake in her wagon.Each day when she goes in the car Beauty sees her wagon and eyes it longingly but the weather has just not been good enough to use it. Corralejo , Fuerteventura , Oasis Dunas. We go on holiday on Wednesday to Fuerteventura for the week so there will be plenty of opportunities for taking Beauty to take long sunny walks. My holidays are so exciting, we go to the beach and make sand castles, walk to the shop for my veggie food for the day, go to the park and play on the rides and in the evening go for another stroll. Where we are staying there is night life but any evening entertainment is merely going for a meal in a restaurant. The best place that we went to as far as Beauty was concerned was Malta, we went in July and the weather was beautiful(see weather again!) but in the evening the place came alive with lots of locals walking along the front and partying in their beach huts until the early hours. It was amazing.Oh and the second day we got there Beauty went down with chicken pox and it was so good that the holiday was for two weeks as the spots had gone off her face by the time we went home, if the holiday had been for only one week we would not have been allowed on the plane. The Doctor was brilliant and diagnosed it as an unknown virus and told the hotel that as well so there would not be a problem with the holiday rep and the flights home. And Zante, where we will be going this summer. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-miss-sushi-saturday.html", "title": "\nI MISS SUSHI SATURDAY\n"},

{"date": " January 26, 2007", "body": "\n Beauty's 15 nano-seconds of fame has definitely not gone to her head, at 9pm I put her to bed and within 5 minutes she was asleep! No after show parties for that one. update on blog MEAN PEOPLE It seems   that some of the comments that I made in this blog entry may have been misunderstood. I said Ariel has been accepted for Exeter to do Arabic, I would have preferred for her to go to St Andrews(far, far away!) but she likes the idea of Exeter. And why do I want her to go to St Andrews and not Exeter? The subtle nuance of the joke was if she is in St Andrews I am less likely to hear her verbal outpourings than I would if she went to Exeter!  Remember I also went on to say I am ok with her joining the army but if she gets a posting to a war zone I have warned her that I shall tell the army about her undiagnosed Tourettes(think about it, Tourettes in a war zone! scary).I think she would be good teaching Arabic in some safe army training college(well I can hope can't I?). I have also told Ariel that when she joins the army I shall tell her instructors that if anything untoward happens to Ariel(i.e Deepcut!) I will hunt them down for the rest of time and I mean it! I said the above because I LOVE HER and like any other mother if anyone tried to hurt her I would have to hurt them! OK? Understood Ariel? Would I really be ecstatic about you going to St Andrews when I am the one with the people carrier with the top box? Think about it..........I would have to take you there and bring you back. Driving to Tobermory was bad enough. I don't know how our Swiss family copes with the journey between Switzerland and uni on England's  south coast, compared to that, Cardiff to St Andrews would be a walk in the park! Anastasia and Belle overlapped when they were in uni, one in Swansea and one in Bath which meant lots of journeys but thankfully even though SnoWhite will overlap with Ariel  with uni, as SnoWhite decided to do her art degree in Cardiff it has meant no long journeys(just frequent short ones between Victoria Park and Pentwyn!). In my blog entry  Mean People  I also talked about  DOOCE  and the problems she has with Mean    people leaving comments on her blog, and funnily enough her entry for yesterday was also about another Mean person called 'Catherine'. Read the following, Dooces most recent bit of HATEMAIL Leta's room looks like a room that was cleaned and organized after a child had died. It is the saddest, most boring and depressing children\u2019s room I have ever seen. Btw, when you showed the pics of your house on a previous post, I had thought the same thing. Your house is so sterile and boring. Browse catalogs much? Every hear of having your own style? I have 2 kids (boys - [name withheld] 2yrs and [name withheld] 5 months), not that you care, and believe me I am a cleaning fanatic, like you. I am very concerned about germs, bacteria, etc. But you are out of control sterile. It is shocking. One more thing, my son is 2 yrs old and potty trained. Potty training is probably the easiest thing to do. Why are you waiting so long to train Leta? You work at home don\u2019t you? I go to work every day and he is trained on the potty. If  this person is being ironic then I'm afraid that I have missed it. If this person is not on medication then they need to be! Do people really get off on this kind of hatred? I personally don't care what other people do as long as they are not hurting someone else, I personally do not care what they think, what they do, how they do or don't clean their house, who they have sex with(or how) or how they potty train their constipated child as long they are not hurting anyone else. 'Catherine' definitely needs to chill out a bit more before her head explodes with all the spite that is swirling around inside of it. Which makes me think of  The Parable of the Talents , a remnant from my more religious youth( I now describe myself as spiritual). The parable tells of a master who was leaving his home to travel, and before going gave his three servants different amounts of money. On returning from his travels, the master asked his servants for an account of the money given to them. The first servant reported that he was given five talents, and he had made five talents more. The master praised the servant as being good and faithful, gave him more responsibility because of his faithfulness, and invited the servant to be joyful together with him. The second servant said that he had received two talents, and he had made two talents more. The master praised this servant in the same way as being good and faithful, giving him more responsibility and inviting the servant to be joyful together with him. The last servant who had received one talent reported that knowing his master was a hard man, he buried his talent in the ground for safekeeping, and therefore returned the original amount to his master. The master called him a wicked and lazy servant, saying that he should have placed the money in the bank to generate interest. The master commanded that the one talent be taken away from that servant, and given to the servant with ten talents, because everyone that has much will be given more, and whoever that has a little, even the little that he has will be taken away. And the master ordered the servant to be thrown outside into the darkness. The parable is apparently the origin of the use of the word \"talent\" to use a skill or ability, from the common interpretation of the story to teach that we are under a moral obligation to use our abilities rather than bury them. I have always liked this parable because it teaches that we all have talents, things that we are good at but the talents all come in different forms. I know my talent, my best talent is that I am a multi-tasker. My children think I am a good cook but really I am just a good microwave technician. I have learnt to be able to do many things at once, I can cook a meal and read a book at the same time, watch TV and exercise and my most favourite multi-tasking of all is to put on the dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer and go to sleep and wake up feeling that I have achieved something(gained quality sleep time and done household chores). And to all you perfect mothers out there like 'Catherine', I AM NOT ASHAMED. I am afraid like many other people in this world my life does not fit into the perfect little box and I do what makes me feel most comfortable or happy and fits into my family life(i.e a life that fits around Beauty!). Yes I can be judgemental of people, I hated the way Jade, Jo and Danielle treated Shilpa  on Celeb BB and I said so but I recently read in the METRO newspaper(Tuesday January 23 2007) that Jade is being treated for depression and shock because of what happened on her eviction from the BB house. Well I personally feel sorry for her, is this the mother or the nurse or just caring about another human being coming out in me I don't know but the media now needs to back off and give her and her family space and keeping Jack in the house without her is not exactly helping. I feel that we humans are too quick to judge and too slow to forgive, we should be more like dogs, no matter what you do to a dog they will always love you and come back. And my views on the news Child porn sentence is condemned Children's charities have condemned a judge's decision not to jail a man who downloaded child pornography, amid the row about prison overcrowding. Judge John Rogers QC suspended Derek Williams' sentence, saying he had to consider a Home Office request to jail only the most serious offenders. The lord chancellor has denied claims by opposition MPs that the judiciary's discretion appeared to be influenced. Williams, 46, of Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, said he was \"lucky to be out\". His six-month term of imprisonment was suspended for two years. Williams was also ordered to register with the police as a sex offender for the next seven years and placed under supervision. I personally weep for the abused children whose images were downloaded from the internet by this man who is now back on the streets. This man may as well have abused these children himself, it is his desires that fuel the production of such sites. My question is,' John Reid-How do you sleep at night?' How can our families and children be safe when this kind of idiotic decision is made? Early release a shoplifter, or somebody convicted of fraud or other non-violent crimes but please consider mine and other people's children when people like this are not convicted. This individual no longer has access to internet child pornography so how is he going to satisfy his unnatural desires? Resignation adds to Reid pressure Pressure on home secretary John Reid has increased after it emerged the head of the Youth Justice Board (YJB), Professor Rod Morgan, has quit. Prof Morgan attacked Labour's young offenders policy and said children's prisons were being \"swamped\". Mr Reid is already under fire on prison overcrowding after a man who downloaded child pornography was spared jail. The judge in the case said he had to follow Mr Reid's call to avoid jailing all but the most serious offenders. In an exclusive interview given to BBC Two's Newsnight, Prof Morgan, says youth courts and children's prisons are being \"swamped\" with minor offenders who are \"cluttering up\" the system. And yes I hope he does lose his job and the government learns from this  HUGE  mistake. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dooce.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Talents", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6300565.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6301125.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-after-show-parties-for-us.html", "title": "\nNO AFTER SHOW PARTIES FOR US!\n"},

I awoke this morning to blocked sinus' and a cold house which seems to be taking forever to warm up.Beauty is in the warmest room in the house, the middle room downstairs, and she is as warm as toast playing on the computer. I have only one request of  CBEEBIES , please update your games..............I am tired of hearing Christmas songs! What about Valentines games or winter in the sun games, we played on CBEEBIES in the Canaries  and there was no snow there!Yes I feel I have entered that 'nothing time' after Christmas and before spring that  C S Lewis  talked about in  SHADOWLANDS.   The snow is thawing rapidly, thankfully, as we are now at that dirty slushy stage. Beauty had absolutely no interest in the snow, Fiona dressed her all up and took her out to play in the street but  all she wanted was to get in the car and go for a ride. Fiona and SnoWhite were more thrilled with the snow than Beauty(remember they are  the 21 year old and the 15 year old!). So no snow angels for Beauty. And why the  Won Ton soup ? Well last night SnoWhite was making herself a 'just add hot water' meal for herself so I asked her to make one for me! This type of meal in our house is the exclusive domain of the  'princesses'  but I was hungry and so I asked SnoWhite to make one for me(I also very rarely ask  any one to make me food or drink either) so  when the Won Ton soup arrived I was surprised at how good it was. A vast improvement on the Vesta curry 'just add hot water' from when I was a child! In the 60's a  Vesta  Curry was seen as a wonderful invention, a bit on a par with the introduction of  own brands . I still remember when you could only buy 2 or 3 brands of crisps or pop ! Oh what advances we made in the 60's!

{"date": " January 27, 2007", "body": "\nHow many times in your life do you think you think you will witness an aggressive racist attack on the street? Most people would say that they would expect to not even see it once and having been brought up in  Rhoose  in the Vale of  Glamorgan  which, if my memory serves me well had less than a handful of families who were black or mixed race, I would not even expect to have seen it once. During the time I was growing up, I have no memory of my parents ever making a racist comment and I believe that I was influenced by them in how I feel about people whatever their race, colour or religion. When my children were small we lived in  Greenham (in a house!)in  Newbury  next to the airbase and Belle's and  SnoWhite's  best friends whilst we lived there were the children of black American servicemen. If my children had ever made a racist comment or joke when they were growing up(even now!) I would have slapped them around the back of the head, thankfully I never had to. On  SnoWhites  mobile, if she uses predicted text then when she puts in her name it comes out as P*A*K*I, what shocks me most is that predicted text has that word stored in it's dictionary.It seems to be a word that I have heard a lot in Cardiff and what angers me most about it's use is that people do not seem embarrassed to use it. I was recently in a class where we had a gentleman from one of the wealthiest areas of Cardiff, he lives about 2 miles from where I live in a road where houses average \u00a3750k and in all other ways he seemed the perfect gentleman but one day he described a group of people he knew as P*A*K*I*S! I was shocked. When I was 21 and I lived on Newport Road, Anastasia was a small baby and I used to walk her over to Albany Road to the shops. One day, coming back from the shops and pushing Anastasia in a pram, I witnessed a very aggressive verbal attack on two young Asian-looking lads by a group of men about my age outside quite a rough pub. I did nothing and I felt awful for doing nothing. The boys were  ok  and nothing happened to them but I felt awful that I did not say anything and I then made a promise to myself that if I witnessed something like that again then I would definitely say something. Within a few years I was standing outside a supermarket in  Splott  (brilliant name) and I witnessed another attack. A group of little 'gob-shites', I am sorry but this phrase is the only one that aptly describes them, were racially abusing two young  Asian girls. When I started shouting at the little    'gob-shites'  the girls ran away but the more I told the boys off for their behaviour the more they were  aggressive , rude and argumentative and could not accept that what they had done was wrong. In the end the little gob-shites ran off, they were aged between 9 and 12! Where could they have learned that behaviour like that was  ok . When Jade exited the Big Brother house she immediately had enough moral fibre to apologise for her behaviour and say she was sorry But did Jo  O'Meara  when she was evicted from the Big Brother house last night? No.........she was unrepentant. She  justified her behaviour by saying that she had family of mixed-race so she couldn't be racist! How so? Newt Gingrich the former speaker of the US House of  Representatives  would not agree, he believes that'  homosexuals are sinners' but his sister is a lesbian! I love my 15 year old but it doesn't mean that I love all 15 year olds because I have one in my family. Perhaps a few days in the big wide world might make Jo reevaluate her view of the situation! According to the news, it seems that police are getting involved. It's not looking good.       Police contact Big Brother's Jade Police investigating alleged racism on Celebrity Big Brother have made contact with former contestant Jade Goody.  Hertfordshire Police have approached Goody and her mother Jackiey Budden with a view to interviewing the pair.  Goody, who was evicted last week, was accused of leading racist bullying against Indian actress Shilpa Shetty while on the Channel 4 reality show.  Goody has denied being racist but told the News of the World she admitted making racist comments.  A police spokeswoman said: \"An investigation into allegations of racist behaviour inside the Celebrity Big Brother house is continui ng It's not looking good for the Celebrity Big Brother contestants and 4 and Endemol are probably rubbing their grubby little hands in glee. Remember 4 and Endemol allowed this situation to carry on, even  knowing what they were doing to the lives of the individuals involved. The program makers need to take full responsibility for what they have done. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gobshite", "http://www.theamericanview.com/index.php?id=331", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6302467.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6302467.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/fall-of-big-brother.html", "title": "\nTHE FALL OF BIG BROTHER\n"},

{"date": " January 13, 2007", "body": "\nOH Hello! Here we have a proof that 'you can't wear a crucifix around your neck because of heath and safety' is a load of rubbish.       School row over girl's crucifix A Roman Catholic schoolgirl's desire to wear a crucifix necklace has led to her religion clashing with her school's health and safety policy. Look at the Robert Napier School  prospectus , the uniform includes a tie, so you can wear a tie around your neck but not a small chain! The school  also says that in years 10 and 11 you can wear 'discreet jewellery', so why in years 10 and 11 but not in years 7,8 and 9? How are you safer when you are in years 10 and 11. So they are telling her that she cannot wear the chain NOW but when she enters the fourth year of high school she will be ok! I personally would not wear religious symbols BUT  I  do believe  in any individuals right to do so if that is what they wish. I believe that central government, after consultation with religious leaders and members of the public,needs to make a decision as to what is acceptable to be worn within in schools, with regards to religion. For many religion is part of their every day life and this needs to be accepted  and their needs met within the school environment. Everywhere you go you hear people talking about 'an holistic approach' but denying an individuals religious expression is hardly 'holistic'. AND NOW TO MY SHALLOWER SIDE Words fail me as to the departure of Leo Sayer on Celeb Big Brother, his behavior was worse than a toddler! Jermaine Jackson was gutted at his  departure,  Leo could have at least said goodbye properly to people who had been good to him and his language was shocking. And the papers are printing the story that Donnie wants to go back into the house.........look Donnie wasn't 15 minutes enough? Oh go on then, eek it out to 15 1/2 as you really were quite entertaining! I am also gutted that Dirk fancies Shilpa, Dirk is really quite cute(I am so sad, I sound like a teenager!). HOW TO CHEER UP A CRYING SIX YEAR OLD Just casually say Charlie and Lola and she instantly knows it is her computer time and will be at the computer faster than the speed of light.Whoosh.......she's there. SnoWhite has been at the house over the weekend so computer time has been even more limited due to SnoWhite's need to do research for her ART Degree Project. Try explaining that to an autistic 6 year old who only talks in phrases such as-WELL DONE, I TOLD YOU TO LIE DOWN, THE END,ONCE UPON A TIME, SCHOOL,STOP IT, DON'T,THE CAR, ASDA (LOVES THAT WORD) etc. It is so sad to watch Beauty cry when you say NO because she just does not understand and her face goes really blotchy with weeping. Autism is such a hard thing at times. We also have a slide lock on the outside of the living room door, it is a split stable door with a glass window in it. When somebody is in with her(usually watching TV), and somebody is sat at the computer which is close to the door, we sometimes lock the door to keep Beauty in with the person in the living room( Beauty has no sense of danger and has to be watched 24/7). To get out the person in the living room has to  knock on the door, now when Beauty knocks on the door she just doesn't understand why nobody opens the door for her.It is so sad to be so small and not understand the world that you live in. Things are getting worse with my left arm, I cannot even pick up a cup without it really hurting. The pain is constant so I think it is time for a return to the Doctor, I have become quite expert at one finger typing. It will probably be a week before I can get an appointment anyway and if the Doctor thought something was really wrong it could be 18 months before I was able to be seen in the hospital. The worst thing is I can no longer knit or crochet, I find it impossible to sit without doing something so I think I shall do some cross stitch  and if I were to buy a large frame I could do it mostly with my right hand. And of course I haven't done any painting or collage or photography in a while so I need to start on those again. BUT  I have started writing again and I have completed a children's story and if I were to do some paintings to go with the story perhaps I could start selling some of my work. I have thought about using the skills learned in my web design class to  create a web site to be a self-representing artist and sell my work online through places such as ebay W ell it is January and time for new beginnings, we shall see what happens! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6258451.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6258451.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6258451.stm", "http://www.robertnapier.medway.sch.uk/html/home.html", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/oh-hello-here-we-have-proof-that-you.html", "title": "\nON BEING BEAUTY.\n"},

I returned home to do a pretty convincing impression of  Arnold  Schwarzenegger  in  Kindergarten Cop ,the scene where he returns home from his first day as a nursery teacher and passes out on the bed.I overslept due to elbow pain keeping me awake through the night, Yes I know, pretty lame excuse! AND I have a zit on my face! I know even old people have zits on their face but in my entire life I can count on my fingers how many zits I have had on my face, I know it sounds unbelievable but it is true. My children are envious because their skins is pretty much the same as any other person who suffers with skin eruptions , however I tell them they are lucky as my back used to be covered with the kind of acne that only medication could deal with! Too gross too even contemplate on a Friday morning! Windy weather calms down( but hot air and wind  involving the Big Brother house continues to  create a   maelstrom). The weather in South Wales appears to be calming down and the drive to school this morning was a lot less blowy though the bad driving continues, others as well as me-I have been accused of 'confusing the car' by pulling away to fast and this from the person who thought perhaps the birds poop so much on my car because they are attracted to the colour of the car!( don't even try to figure that one out!).

In the strongest condemnation of the show by a minister so far, she said the behaviour had been totally \"unacceptable\".Ms Smith also attacked the programme-makers, saying that the editing had been wrong and that it was \"shameful to make money and publicity out of that sort of thing' and if any politician is out there composing a rap in response to the situation( as they seem inclined to do but why I don't know!).................for our sanity and your dignity, please do not do it! Stick to what you do best..........what is that again? Thankfully the beginning of the end should be in sight this evening as Jade Goodie and Shilpa Shetty are both up for eviction in the Big Brother house. I am sure that Big Brother will be disappointed when Jade is evicted as there will be less opportunity for fighting and arguing in the house. Here again I was wrong.........I discussed the possibility of this year being the most boring of all Celeb BB years but the three witches and their spitefulness has changed my opinion on that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6277301.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/end-of-maelstrom-hopefully.html", "title": "\nTHE END OF THE MAELSTROM!

Wedal  Road  is not a proper council dump just a refuse receiving centre in the middle of the city, this I find quite scary as there are a number of receiving sites around the city so the amount of stuff just dumped and not recycled is phenomenal. My washing machine had died so after Christmas I bought a new one because life with Beauty would be impossible without one. My washing machine is constantly  on and when I can it is a short eco-wash.I am very interested in sustainability and places like Brithdir Mawr  and I would love to live like that but with Beauty, life would be impossible. They are off the grid-for electricity! I would be spending my entire day washing. I certainly need to think a lot more about the way that I live with regards to the environment. My biggest guilt trip are crisp packets! If there are bio-degradable plastic bags why can't they be used for crisps? Beauty, like many autistic and non-autistic children for that matter has food obsessions , one of those being Walkers salt and vinegar crisps.I want the packets to be recyclable or bio-degradable. Carrier bags are recyclable so why can't crisp packets be? I recycle most things that come through my house but it is the sheer volume of plastic packaging that annoys me, perhaps if taxes were raised on products using non- recyclable  or no bio-degradable packaging then manufacturers would be forced to use alternatives. I try to use products without plastic packaging but it is damn near impossible most of the time, manufacturers need a financial slap around the head to wake them up to the damage they are doing. 11:45PM Beauty is still bouncing around like  Tigger , wearing a pink stripey Hello Kitty sweat shirt, pink wings and flourishing the wand of all wand, not only does the wand flash but it makes a noise! She looks like a very energetic pink bumble bee!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-search-of-tomorrows.html", "title": "\nIN SEARCH OF TOMORROWS..............\n"},

I am finally get rid of my tummy fat and I know that dieting alone could not have sorted out my stomach muscles.Boring news for everyone else but monumental for me. I would NEVER want to look like a super model..............being a UK size 12 would be fine. Today I took Beauty to town and I bought her a set of bongo drums and I put them in her lap and she said,'That's a good idea'. A set phrase I know but she said it knowing the meaning of it and using it in the correct context. It brought tears to my eyes. I also bought her a butterfly shaped tambourine which she loved. On the way home it poured with rain and Beauty and I got soaked.TYPICAL! We arrived home looking like drowned rats. 'Into each life some rain must fall, some days must be dark and dreary.'

{"date": " December 31, 2006", "body": "\nMY SONG FOR 2006 DONOVAN- CATCH THE WIND I apologise to anyone who has travelled with me in my car in the last year as they will have heard this song at least twice on the journey, thankfully I had new CDs for Christmas. Due to the government laws on child seats in cars, Beauty now sits in the rear of the car(and no she doesn't call her seat Henry-daft suggestion by some over-paid , too much time on their hands government bod who was trying to be 'cool' by giving ways to get 11 year olds to sit on booster seats.........save us! (Pianoman was a civil servant(now retired)so he is a fount of all wisdom on the daft things civil servants can do ...........or not do!) and thankfully whilst she has control over the CD , DVD ,TV and VIDEO in the house, the music in the car is ALL MINE. However, when Beauty's sisters are in the car I am forced to eventually turn to local radio and through forced smiles I always agree that yes I do like the music(well I honestly do like some). Although Pianoman has no such restraint, we went to a restaurant and he went and complained about the afore said local radio being played and got them to turn it off! Now if it had been jazz he would have been like a PIG IN POOP and sat there all day listening without eating! Now I do like some of the work of Jamie Cullum , James Blunt and Joss Stone which has been described as jazz but Pianoman prefers jazz to be a little bit older and more traditional, and yes I know that I have been to New Orleans and should know better but I am a product of the pop scene of the 1970's and would prefer to listen to anything from then. SORRY! (Apart from Gary Glitter of course !) I love PAUL SIMON DONNY OSMOND MEATLOAF DAVID CASSIDY JOHN DENVER The list is endless and yes I freely admit that I have a sad taste in music but hey..........it makes me happy. Born too late to be a hippy and somehow missed being punk.........one of the last baby boomers born into a world that was changing so rapidly that we had to invent our own roots.

Well to tell you the truth, I'm shocked. Saddam was a bad man and was found guilty by a court of law and I accept the law but for all the suffering he caused I feel that a life sentence would  have allowed him to suffer some. He would have had the opportunity to come to a realisation of his crimes had he lived(maybe). I just can't believe that this kind of legal punishment exists in the 21st century. How can anyone do the things he did is even more beyond me. All we can hope for is that the man who went to his Maker clutching the Koran receives the justice that is due him.

I dream about injections directly into my joints and this from the nurse who hates having or giving injections.

Gaviscon is now my drink of choice(and for once I am drinking it and NOT pregnant). I am so glad that I am exercising again. AND WORST OF ALL SNOWHITE IS AWAKE GIVING ME AN EAR BASHING ON CONSPIRACY THEORIES. We have done Diana, JFK, 911 and Titanic...............save us God. I blame me, I encouraged her to have an opinion on everything. Sorry family! We also briefly discussed Alexander Litvinenko and the possible involvement of the Russian government. I am glad that my children are aware of what is going on in the world  because when I was their age I KNEW NOTHING. I am ashamed that I knew nothing, I was so blond that I didn't even have a desire to know. I was going out with David(the clever one) in the late 70's(Winter of Discontent and all that)and I remember him being shocked at my lack of interest and knowledge in the news, sorry! I never cease to be surprised that I managed to get a degree, getting to be a qualified nurse and teacher was a bigger surprise. However, my knowledge is still so limited. How could  I have lived through  the recent European  Wars and really not know what happened? I blame  having lots of children and  the internet  not being available to  me.  So what's my excuse  now? Now  we are doing the Moon Landing................! Go to sleep girl. She is now in the living room taking photos of herself and watching a program about spys. And this is the 21 year old! Any suggestions on how to make her sleep? Yes you have guessed correctly, definitely on the spectrum. The two with aspergers can definitely be more tiring than Beauty. Fiona thinks I am the Encyclopedia Britannica whilst SnoWhite believes I am the fount of all knowledge when it comes to politics, and Fiona just thinks that I should know everything about everything(the phrase Google It upsets her). For all you Dr Who fans out there, in the Christmas day episode of Dr Who ,Catherine Tates's house was my house. Not my present house but the house we lived in in Birchfield Crescent. We saw it and started going.'ooh, ooh, ooh' and pointing. In the words of Muriel's Wedding,'What a coincidence'. And the wedding was at the New House hotel where I had also worked. Also, Catherine Tate's boyfriend in the Dr Who episode was gorgeous Nicky from 55 Degrees North and he accused Catherine Tate of being shallow and getting excited over' a new flavour in Pringles'. On BBC that was brilliant free advertising for the makers of Pringles! There are  a lot of babies  in church so I am busy knitting blankets, it is the sort of knitting you don't have to think about thank goodness but they are nice to give as presents. I am knitting on size 6 needles, never again, the next blanket will be on size 10s.I once knitted a baby blanket on size 4s and said never again, it also took so long that I have kept the blanket for one of the girls. I couldn't bear to part with that much work. 9:30am UPDATE Beauty and I are going to have a serious falling out, she has been awake since5:30am and she is bouncing around like Tigger, hopefully she will nap today as a result of this early wake up. She has returned to playing with the medieval archers and her wagon. And making up stories involving the soldiers,'once upon a time.............'.I love that kid! Tonight I will try and take Beauty to the Winter Wonderland. There is a carousel, a big wheel and a helter skelter plus of course the ice skating and lots of food. Today is so back to normal, the post returns and I receive a letter from the Liberal Democrats(they of the Cheeky Girls variety) and a letter and a DVD inviting me to the Vauxhall sale, and my car with them is not up for renewal for another 3 years...............do they not read their own records? So my boring normality continues.GOOD......we like boring and quiet. I am looking forward to cleaning and decorating my front bedroom, de-cluttering after Christmas and of course the offspring returning to school(oh happy day). 21:30 UPDATE After a nap I felt lots better after the early morning wake-up call. I took SnoWhite back to her flat , complete with her many Christmas presents but she also needed to go to IKEA to get some shelves. we took Beauty but she fell asleep under the table in the restaurant.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/day-after-boxing-day.html", "title": "\nTHE DAY AFTER BOXING DAY\n"},

Finding holes in West Bank barrier By Lipika Pelham Jerusalem \"Palestinians climb West Bank barrier Some Palestinians go over, through or under the massive barrier Six days a week Hani, a Palestinian from the West Bank city of Ramallah, comes to work in a shop in East Jerusalem.He works from 0800 until midnight, sorting vegetables in a cold, damp back room.He has no permit to work in the Israeli-occupied eastern part of Jerusalem, but like hundreds of others from the West Bank, Hani finds ways to travel through the barrier that zigzags through the West Bank. Israel says the defensive system of concrete walls and wire fence is needed to stop suicide bombers. Palestinians say it is part of an Israeli land grab of West Bank territory. Although many Palestinian workers get caught in the process of crossing illegall y into Israel or East Jerusalem, a huge number of them manage to get through. If caught, without papers or proper identity cards they risk being sent to prison for up to two years. Here we have the  brilliant  Banksy It has been a while since anything has made me cry, the last time I cried it was with laughing when I watched(again) The Two Pints of Lager episode where Johnny convinces his father-in-law-to-be to allow the wedding to go ahead, it is the episode with all the Brookside references.Hysterical. Today I was not crying tears of laughter, I cried for Babar Ahmad who has had his appeal denied FROM THE BBC NEWS WEBSITE UK pair lose US extradition fight Haroon Rashid Aswat Mr Aswat is accused of setting up a terror training camp Two UK men held on Afghanistan-related terror charges have lost their legal fight to avoid extradition to the US. Babar Ahmad, 32, from Tooting, south-west London is accused of running websites inciting murder, urging holy war and raising money for the Taleban. Haroon Aswat, from Yorkshire, is accused of plotting to set up a terror camp to train fighters for Afghanistan.The men said they risked mistreatment by the US, but High Court judges said these claims were not proven. I just cannot believe what is happening. If the US or any other country want to question these men then do it here. This could happen to anyone. I have always believed in justice, I also accept the legal system and the laws of the land completely even if I do not agree with them and sometimes I think they are silly. Pianoman and I have had many discussions about law, the government and justice and we have not always seen eye to eye. His view in many cases is old testament whilst mine is more new testament. I also feel strongly that if you do not agree with something then do something about it.Write, campaign and vote, just don't sit in your armchairs and bitch and do nothing about it. The evidence in this case is very debatable and the treatment of  Babar Ahmad  by the police  was not good. My thoughts are with the families of these men. The possibility of sending a British citizen to  Guantanemo  is just not acceptable.

I am exhausted, I think a nap will be in order today as well as housework.As I have said before, AUTISM IS A TIRING THING. Beauty took her quilt this morning and went to sleep for a few hours under the dining room table. Let me see, a choice of a bed or a floor to sleep on......the bed everytime for me. Last night I used my side stepper again whilst Beauty watched videos on the computer, she loved it and I lost weight. I can exercise and watch her at the same time, Beauty also thought it was great as to her it seemed like I was dancing along with her. When I first used the side stepper burning off 100 calories nearly killed me but last night I managed to burn off approximately 500 calories and it was manageable and yes I was perspiring like a pig and I drank a litre of water). The best time seems to be just as Beauty comes home from school, she has computer time then tv and exercise time(she bounces on her trampoline whilst she watches tv). I would like to lose weight before Christmas so I can buy a nice party dress. At the moment we are having a hail storm, I am glad that it missed the school run. The weather has gone so cold in the last few days, Dimitri said it was colder here than in Austria,OUCH! I am so  looking forward to Fuerteventura in January. TRY AND EXPLAIN THIS! I love to chew my nails, I do enjoy it and I know all about cross-infection and how infections live on your skin BUT I can't stop myself.............BUT that is only for six months of the year! Then one day I notice a bit of decent growth on my nails and I think,'Oh I can't chew that' and I don't and then for about six months my nails are really nice. AND then I chew them again(Ariel seems to be the same). AND the same with food, I am trying constantly to eat healthily and lose weight but usually I just manage to maintain BUT then one day something happens and I go into full blown healthy eating, weight loss mode and the trigger this time? My exercise! I have built up my exercise on the side stepper and now I can burn up approximately 500 calories in my exercise routine and afterwards I think ,'I'm not going to waste all that effort by eating junk(my beloved carbs)'. Beauty is now 6 and when she was born I weighed just over 18 stone and I have been trying to eat healthily since, I have had periods of maintaining and losing weight and now my weight is down to 11 stone 10 lbs and I have two stone to go and I thank WEIGHT WATCHERS. I have not attended Weight Watchers all that time but they taught me the healthy eating that means that I can maintain or lose weight. When it comes to eating I need volume to curb my hunger and so I eat huge amounts of vegetables with my meal and that is the answer. As life with Beauty is very tiring and busy I find it more convenient to eat the vegetarian option in the Weight Watchers frozen ready meals, I eat other things but sometimes my joints hurt so much I cannot do anything more that boil vegetables and put a meal in the microwave.

And this is St Jude the Patron Saint of Desperate cases. and this is St Anthony the Patron Saint of Lost Things...........I had a keyring with Saint Anthony on it, but the picture on it fell off and I lost it, honest. I'm having a not so good day! My hair looks like Crystal Tips because of the rain, my house is a tip(because of Beauty) and I haven't lost any weight at Weight Watchers after following the points plan religiously and exercising for an hour a day, everyday. I know the whole muscle heavier than fat thing, so after a restless night I think I shall have a nap and hope I feel better later. So in the meantime BOG OFF WORLD. Evening update- after a very good nap the world seems a little bit better place( thank you  Pollyanna). I had crumpets for lunch, warming comfort food with not too many  calories , fat, points or whatever! End of the world averted................Beauty put a video in the player,back to front and because it wouldn't work it was my fault. Her face is  puce  with crying. Thankfully the video  came out quite easily as I didn't fancy taking the whole thing apart. Now we are watching the King and I again...........and again! Weather here is atrocious, heavy rain and wind. I think I shall get my duffel coat out. I can see a lot of those outdoor Christmas decorations flying away this evening. there is a robin on the front opposite the Leisure Centre and he already looks like he has 'fallen off his perch'(dead,deceased, is no more as in Dead Parrot Monty Python Sketch) As a child Belle's favourite video was Meet Me in St Louis, it was also one of my mothers favourite films, but I think the family has a new favourite. The king and I is on constantly, I bought it yesterday for the family but Beauty has decided it is hers and already she is singing along with the songs. I trawled the charity shops in Albany Road for videos, Beauty damages DVDs so quickly that videos definitely have a longer life in our house. When Belle was small she pulled some of the tape out of a video and used the video as a handbag, so in our house when a video gets broken it is called 'handbagging'. The videos are Christmas presents and Beauty will love them. Some of the videos are repeats but that is  ok  because videos don't last forever but I definitely think it was a mistake to stop making them. Beauty is dressing as a robin for her school play at Christmas and will be singing along to  Rockin  Robin so we looked up the song on  YouTube  so she could hear it and learn it. We found this version and I have to say this is fantastic, the little girls are brilliant, they are so sweet.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqR8_UDCF1s\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXhZnNWxvlI/AAAAAAAAAII/N8VLMAz82_I/s1600-h/francis.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXhbr9WxvmI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/3dA9x6fm6yM/s1600-h/stjude.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXhcYdWxvnI/AAAAAAAAAIY/_M0ozdXfEX4/s1600-h/st+anthony.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXfe5dWxviI/AAAAAAAAAHk/6NfqFz7CepU/s1600-h/crystal+tips.JPG", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXhNddWxvjI/AAAAAAAAAHw/rxDS8PRdc38/s1600-h/deadparrot.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXhOv9WxvkI/AAAAAAAAAH4/SlitFUmPkyU/s1600-h/robin.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXfBnNWxvhI/AAAAAAAAAHU/MfduAcPWiEM/s1600-h/MeetStLouis2.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXfBP9WxvgI/AAAAAAAAAHM/CwUKmP4Tm-c/s1600-h/Deborah-Kerr.jpeg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/rockin-robin.html", "title": "\n"},

To feel you all around me, And to take your hand, along the sand, Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind. When sundown pales the sky, I wanna hide a while, behind your smile, And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find. For me to love you now, Would be the sweetest thing, 'twould make me sing, Ah, but I may as well, try and catch the wind. When rain has hung the leaves with tears, I want you near, to kill my fears To help me to leave all my blues behind. For standin' in your heart, Is where I want to be, and I long to be, Ah, but I may as well, try and catch the wind. If we had to find a song that would define our lives then I think that this would be the one for me. I feel that my life is all about lost hope, lost chances and what should have been and no I am not talking about husband number 2 (if there is a next life then when I meet him I will punch him in the head and tell him what an idiot he was for wasting his life and slap him once more for making me a young widow, selfish git) , I am talking about everything! I feel that most of what I have lost or missed has been directly linked to me having been a mormon. DON'T get me wrong about the church, I am not saying that I made evil choices but choices were made that I would never make today because I believe there is no God. If it were now I know I would have delayed having children until I could have given them everything they deserved, I would have finished my nurses training and worked nights as a qualified nurse as they were growing up. It could be said that my son Marc died at birth because I was young, living in a bedsit with no money-I was a statistic, even though I will always blame myself it is probably true that I was just a statistic. I see his face in the faces of of the boyfriends of my girls that have passed through my house and now in the first husband and it is not a bad thing, it is a comfort that life goes on and it can be good. They will never go through what I went through, I shall see to that. WOW! I sound like a lioness ready to protect her young. Perhaps it is these feeling that make me quite happy to spend the rest of my life on my own caring for Beauty. I actually think that Beauty will one day be good enough to care for herself and live her own life and then I will be content with my books, plants and paints and the visits from the grandbabies.

A pile of  jelly  left by the side of the road in Germany caused a major security alert after it was mistaken for toxic waste. Fire officers in protective suits spent two hours inspecting the substance before concluding it was jelly. The spillage was traced to a wedding party, the newly wed groom, who was woken up and informed of the alert, promised to clean up the mess. Well Belle aren't you glad you had alligator at your wedding and not jelly? I'm sorry but if they came to my house and examined some of Beauty's messes we would be on toxic waste alert until the horsemen of the apocalyse showed up( and then some!). Sad news about snooker player  Paul Hunter  who lost his battle with cancer after being diagnosed with neuro-endorine tumours on the lining of his stomach in March 2005. He was only 27.He leaves a wife and a baby called Evie who was born on Boxing day last year. Everyone said he was such a nice guy. My thoughts are with all of his family. The UK with 24% clinically obese, we are officially the fattest country in Europe according to  Mark Easton , who is an Editor for the BBC and is writing about a report written by the Department of Health. The red areas show the lowest life expectanc, for men that is under 75.5 years of age and for women that is under 80.2 years of age, and the green areas are the highest. I know that it doesn't show Wales but it scares me. What is interesting is the comparisons in these reports show that poor health is not just to do with poor people. It seems that how we live and die is cultural as well as economic. If I didn't feel guilty about eating before then I sure do now. Only this morning I had 2 pieces of toast for breakfast and without really thinking about what I had actually eaten, approximately 15 minutes later I was still full and remember thinking,'oh I've eaten too much today'. Them I thought about what I had 'actually' eaten and I thought,'shut up you silly moo, your going to make yourself anorexic'. I eat healthily so that I can live at least into my 80's but I want to also be active and enjoy life. Pressure for me is not to look like a super-model(as if!) but to be there for my family and to enjoy life with them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/jelly.jpg", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6035821.stm", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/paulhunter.jpg", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6035879.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6035225.stm", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/map.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/10/remember-dispose-of-your-jelly.html", "title": "\nREMEMBER-DISPOSE OF YOUR JELLY CAREFULLY!\n"},
{"date": " September 07, 2006", "body": "\n Last night I read about the book FROM NEWBURY WITH LOVE on the Amnesty International UK website. It is about a 15 year corespondence between a Russian fanily and a family from Newbury in Berkshire during the cold war and started because of an Amnesty letter writing campaign. It was a heart moving story and made more real because we had lived in Newbury. Because of it, I also wept for a man I have never met and never will. Over the years I have written hundreds of letters and sent many Christmas cards through Amnesty campaigns and getting any response is a very rare occurrence. Two years ago I sent a card to a prisoner in an African jail. it was returned with Prisoner Not Known stamped on it. The prisoner was reported to have been sent to that particular jail but then disappeared and no trace of him was found. The reality of FROM NEWBURY WITH LOVE hit home and it was as if I saw the PRISONER NOT KNOWN as a real person, I could imagine I could see his face, and I suddenly knew he was dead. And I wept. Not for me but for his wife, his children, his parents, his family and his friends and all those who loved him. I also wept for the dark space that existed in the hearts of those who had killed him and denied him his life. The work that people do for Amnesty at times can be a thankless one and the effects are sometimes a long time in coming or never. If I were to write every hour of every day I feel that I would be barely scraping the surface of the problem. I know that the program Lost is a shallow thing in comparison to the lives that I learnt about through Amnesty but two characters in Lost have confirmed my belief that there is good in the hearts of most people no matter how deep it lies. Eco and Sayid both have pasts that show them as being not such nice people but they reached the bad place in their lives slowly and were able to change. The Amnesty letter writing campaigns are there to reach people so they can know there are other ways to do things. And Amnesty is a good thing because history shows it does reach people. HEALTHY EATING UPDATE I am now 11st 9lbs and I have a BMI of 23, Weight Watchers  say that the lowest I can be in my healthy range is  9st 13lbs  so that is my goal.  I  need  a goal to work around,  when I  get to my target  I will still  check my weight  to  make sure that I don't lose or gain too much.

I am now washing bedspread number 3 and Beauty is happy to lie on the floor in the living room watching Victoria Principal's Beauty Secrets, so she must be ill! She is also merrily singing to herself. Beauty has quite a temperature but everytime I give her medicine and juice-she pukes! So no school for Beauty today but when she is like this she doesn't stray far from her bed, she is quite happy to take to her bed and be sick and be cared for. Sounds familiar! I have moved Beauty's small bed into the living room so she can stay in bed and watch tv and play with her toys. She has a pile of soft toys that she is enjoying playing with, she is playing with the Hoobs, Jesse from Toy Story and Shrek and Puss in Boots. She wakes up for an hour or so, has some sips of juice and then sleeps for another hour or so. It is difficult when Beauty is sick because when she moans or cries you don't know why she is moaning and crying. 10:57 AM- VOMITING VERONICA UPDATE I left Beauty for the length of time it takes to take a bedspread out of the washing machine and hang it over a door(it's raining!) to find her with her head under the bed puking again, over one of my Welsh waffle blankets which I can only wool wash! I am washing everything as fast as I can and spraying everything with fabric conditioner but with my lack of sense of smell I really don't know if the the smell is lingering. Thankfully I only have to contend with juice and what a blessing a laminate floor is.

{"date": " September 15, 2006", "body": "\nCOME ON BOYS, PLAY NICE. So Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech about the concept of Holy War and in it he quoted a 14 century christian emperor who said, 'Muhammad had brought the world only evil and inhuman things', before I go any further I would like to say that personally I think the contents of that statement is a load of b*ll*cks and don't get me started on the, 'evil and inhuman things' done by other major religions of the world. The question here has to be WHO was talking when this statement was made? Who as in was this a statement by the POPE or was it a statement by Joseph Ratzinger the man. The difference being if the POPE said the whole' evil and inhuman' thing then the POPE lied(as  Islam  does not seek to bring 'evil and inhuman things') and so the Catholic Church must be a lie as the POPE is meant to make infallible statements- as the POPE. So, by my deduction, the statement must have been made by Joseph Ratzinger the man and not the Pope. Joseph Ratzinger must make an apology and say that these were his own personal opinions and not the opinions of the Pope and the church, he must also admit that within the catholic church terrible things have also been done since the 14 century i.e the Borgia's, The Inquisition and Sexual Abuse Scandals involving Priests and Nuns, BUT these were the products of men not the church(many would say even covering up of sin was the product of men). Cardinal Ratzinger was Prefect of The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith which is the historical remnant of the Inquisition, before he was Pope, so he should be fully aware of what the catholic church would authorise a Pope to say and do. I am sure that God, the Church and the Pope would want Joseph Ratinger to apologise in his role as a man and a Pope for the hurt that was caused . He should also use this time to converse and to seek unity and understanding, free from mud-slinging. Much good can be achieved. My message to Pope Benedict XVI is to use this situation wisely and for good. And remember, I am not a scholar or academic, I am just a housewife with 6 children and this is how I see the situation. I am sure an academic could debate the subject with me and make everything I say look silly but the things I have said are just my opinions on how people who have a million times more clout than me should get off their butts and start talking. As Winston churchill said.' to jaw jaw is better than to war war'. 09:19 am Vomiting Veronica has a friend to stay,Moaning Myrtle. Poor Beauty. when she isn't sleeping she is vomiting or moaning-with her head under the bed. At the moment she is asleep(in the bed) so I shall have a nap as Beauty was awake a lot during the night. 11:53 am Wow what a difference a nap makes! Moaning Myrtle seems to have gone home and Beauty is sat on the floor watching CBEEBIES whilst playing with her armies. She is still very quiet but hopefully the departure of Moaning Myrtle means no more tummy or head pains, poor little love. I think a nice warm bath for Beauty this afternoon will make her feel lots better. Today is MAKE A HAT DAY-why? I don't know or for those among us who are more religious it is The Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows.

Get a grip on reality people - when the prices increase they just buy the cheaper supermarket alcohol and if they want the good stuff then they get the money the same way as people who who want drugs get the money. I don't need to spell it out. It is about education and a change of lifestyle not the Nanny State making you pay more to dissuade you from buying it, like that has worked with cigarettes. People smoke and drink for a reason and the reason is what has to be dealt with.   Crowding 'delays jail's progress' Early release for minor crimes and compulsory education and work experience and volunteer work on release and a change in the benefits system in line with much of the world which only allows benefit for a limited time. This to encourage a strong work ethic, self-esteem and self-sufficiency.

I am pleased for the man that he has a belief in something and it aids his coping mechanisms. It is something I wish I still had. Yet a judge in the Philippines who talks to three 'imaginary' dwarves loses his job. This judge never claimed that the dwarves influenced his actions but helped him in healing sessions. It was decided that the judge was suffering from a psychosis. Was Joan of Arc? Bernadette of Lourdes? Those at Fatima? No? So why is it ok for a christian world to hear God, a being we cannot see or touch but a Philippine judge who believes something else has a psychosis! We live in an increasingly secular world and many believe in alternative belief structures, are they all suffering from a psychosis? Some people believe in spirit guides and angels, is that who Armand, Luis and Angel the dwarves are? Native Americans believe in spirit guides and so do many other cultures around the world, do they all have a psychosis? This judge believes he was being helped spiritually on a personal level, surely to sack him would be religious discrimination. Perhaps if the judge went into the court room with a gun and shot all the lawyers and the bad guys and said, 'the dwarves told me to', then you would be safe in saying that the judge and his dwarf friends were Loop-the-Loop. Personally I think I would prefer to be friends with the trio of dwarves who just want to help heal people, 'imaginary' or not. Do you believe the judge is sane? Maybe ........... maybe not, he also believes that it is his purpose to cleanse the Philippine justice system of corruption(now that's ok) and calling down illnesses on his tormentors! Now that's not nice...I just hope the dwarves are not involved in the tormenting! P.S. The judge insists that he never said they were 'dwarves' or of restricted growth, that was said by a tormentor! Talking of tormentors....Beauty has been awake since approvimately 4.45am, thanks to a momma of all storms, thunder, lightning and enough rain to scare Mrs Noah into bringing the washing in.

Life was so much easier when I was Beauty's age, very few childrens programmes and all very predictable. This was one of my favourites, Sara and Hoppity. Sara's Dad had a toy hospital and Sara used to help him, Hoppity was an old toy that had been brought in. Hoppity was old and missing one leg when he came in and Sara's Dad had put on a leg slightly shorter, hence the name Hoppity. I am so pleased that the someone has been arrested for the murder of JonBennet Ramsey, the family complained that they were wrongly persecuted because of what had happened and they were not responsible. I remember a program about the case and it portrayed the family as evasive and refusing to be interviewed by police. At the time all I wanted was for them to be interviewed properly and to be found not guilty and everyone to know the family were not guilty, I really wanted them to co-operate fully and just show people they were not guilty. But they wouldn't. I will be really glad when there is a trial to show who was really guilty. A parent killing a child is an unimaginable thing and any evidence that could prove this not to be so would be wonderful.

I have a t shirt style sundress which I wear as a nightie and last time I wore it it was tight around the stomach and uncomfortable and now it is not tight and uncomfortable. Yippee! I am sure that people who are not fat think that it is easy to diet and wonder why fat people like me do not just diet, well the biggest problem that I have is lack of incentive. If I could SEE where the fat had gone from it wouldn't be so bad and whilst I am trying to lose weight I am still fat and you start to think....why bother? I just get some days where I want to go out and scream in the street,'I USED TO BE A SIZE 8'. Not that the locals would care.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.badplanet.com/bpimages/6802710.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/08/princess-of-trailer-park.html", "title": "\nPRINCESS OF THE TRAILER PARK\n"},
{"date": " November 24, 2006", "body": "\nBeing a true Brit(Welsh), I feel the necesity to comment on the weather whenever possible unlike my neighbor who ONLY  talks about the weather. It is raining AGAIN and I feel empathy for Mrs Noah, think what her life must have been like.......cooped up whilst it constantly rained with a bunch of animals who were only interested in pooping and eating!Hmmmm! As well as being called Beauty the 6 year old also has the nickname Mouse or when she really is being a pain she can get called Rat. Random question, after a lifetime of religious education the following question has just popped into my head, did Noah take rats and mice on his lovely ark on purpose? What purpose do they have? Are they sent to try us like carbs? Could we live without rats? No wonder I don't go to church anymore as my thoughts are so random! Question - can a man wear a pink tie for a church choir and still be manly? I may not still go to church but some of the family do so things filter through(though not the things women love to hear like new babies and their names). One of the American brothers feels it would not be right for the choir to wear  pink ties, personally I think the pink tie thing is not an issue in itself however my opinion is 'come on guys it's Christmas, how about red or green  or naked elves'(yes the elves was a joke) The question shouldn't be is it ok to wear pink but why wouldn't they want to? Is it too girlie f or them? Dick Chenney doesn't seem to have a problem. And Clinton....... And Jay Z........ And what about a pink shirt! And last but most importantly, a Beauty in pink-yes at present Barbie Rapunzel is a defining influence!        WHAT A  SAD END TO A LIFE Ok the Russians say it wasn't them but why are they  not saying the other things they should be saying if it wasn't them like WHO WAS IT  and WE WILL FIND THEM. My heart goes out to his family. D eadly toll of botched abortions Unsafe abortions in the developing world kill 68,000 women a year, research suggests.ead researcher Dr Susheela Singh said: \"The evidence shows that the health burden of unsafe abortion is large. \"The most effective way of eliminating this highly preventable cause of maternal illness and death, would be to make safe and legal abortion services available and accessible. \"A second, more immediately achievable, goal is to prevent unintended pregnancies in the first place through improved contraception use.\" HOWEVER......... Paul Tully, general secretary of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said Dr Singh's findings were guesses based on estimates. \"The burden of the study is clearly to promote the killing of more unborn babies in poorer countries, regardless of the fact that women do not want abortions,\" he said. He also took issue with the notion liberalisation of abortion laws led to a cut in death and disability among pregnant women. I feel that better health care for these women would negate the need for abortions, perhaps Paul Tully is right that these women do not want abortions but perhaps they do not want to be pregnant in the first place and they should be allowed to make the choice for themselves. Why can't these people have the same choices as me, why do they have to have the choice made for them by someone else? 21 TODAY ...............SNOWHITE IS NOW 21! And to celebrate we went to see her 'friend' referee wrestling! The last time I went to see wrestling(real wrestling) was in 1978 and I swore,'NEVE R AGAIN'.

I am surprised at how many people like Alan Rickman(why I don't know because he is amazing and I personally think he is stunning) and how many fantastic tribute videos have been made for him. The tributes that have impressed me most though are the ones to Brokeback Mountain, I have not seen the film but the clips of the film on the tribute videos have blown me away. The acting is outstanding and it made me weep, it truly made me believe that it is possible that out there there could be such a thing as love. I was once accused of thinking only of myself when I divorced my first husband and looked for someone else. The one thing I can say is that seeing the portrayal of the way others love each other convinces me that I have never been loved.

Approximately 6am-why? because the offspring are asleep and trying to get them out of bed before lunchtime would be seen as an insane act of aggression, too dangerous for a stronger, better trained individual than I. And.....they use the computer constantly from about 12md until 2am(or even later!). Beauty's favourites are 5 little ducks(the twins version) and Numa Numa(the classic lipsyncing guy), and when it comes to Youtube she can be pretty persistent. I love the way Beauty terrorises her sisters though, if she sees them on the computer then she wants in on the action and she wants Youtube on.The other night when Beauty refused to sleep she and I spent hours on Youtube and I found her a Barney song, or so I thought!!!!!! I left her to watch Barney and as I walked to the sink I heard a string of swear words, Barney was lipsyncing Tupac! And not just that, there are Barney autopsies online and even one murder of Barney by fire. If I disliked Barney then I think I woild be justified due to the way Beauty watches Barney on rewind but it's not as if other people HAVE to watch him. Perhaps we should have a  BE NICE TO BARNEY  campaign and Sno white could be our leader. Hey Anastasia have you seen the Sandi Thom video 'I wish I were a punk rocker with flowers in my hair'? Great choreography(if that's what you call it when their walking) look in the background and there is a rock singer with a guitar over his shoulder, well I think he looks just like Sawyer off Lost! Did you get the Jack and Sawyer video, I thought it was brilliant .Can you send it back as I forgot to save it and I can't seem to find it again. Why don't you email me and tell me about your job or email me about anything else you don't want online. Beauty is so cute. Yesterday evening I had planned on going to Tesco as they are the only shop locally to sell Biodegradable black bags(what a fun life I lead!) so I cooked food for everybody and we were ready to go when Runningman showed up. Beauty and I were sat in the garden and thought that Beauty would stay with Runningman, as if, she saw me get my handbag and she was the first to the the garden gate. In lots of ways she is a normally developing 5 year old though her behaviour around comics is getting a bit difficult. She doesn't go to the shop that often( well she didn't) and when we are there she wants a comic(that's ok too) BUT she wants the same comic that she already has and she goes nuts trying to get it. I swear children are an alien lifeforce that I do not even pretend to understand.

My neighbours of the not-so-quiet kind never dry clothes outside so they must use a tumble dryer constantly but my other neighbours are always cleaning and washing and drying clothes outside(but not nearly as much as me) so I apologise now for my impact on the environment and blame the smelly little monkey that is the 5 year old. Her philosophy on life is Eat, Drink and Be Merry and have a very good life. Sounds good to me............apart from the washing! At present we are having a heatwave, well compared to our usual weather for this time of year but compared to some European countries I have visited we are having a nice warm spell. It is difficult to sleep at night because of the heat especially as I sleep on the grou nd floor and I cannot leave the window open because of the local 'burglar' who actually appears to be on holiday at the moment. The burglar seems to have gone very quiet, it could be linked to my giving them a fright however! or perhaps the helicopter and 'swat' type police team that staked out their flat for a couple of hours one night might have something to do with it! Who cares what it was really, it's just nice to have a bit of peace and quiet. Hey, being a burglar wasn't really a job with a good career structure anyway so perhaps they can now concentrate on their legitimate talents.

{"date": " June 29, 2006", "body": "\n I'M  IN  LOVE -  WITH  POMEGRANITES! They have been out there forever and I have seen them in the fruit aisle wherever I go but I have never bought any. The other day I saw some Pomegranite juice and thought- oh that sounds nice and so I bought some and it was the most beautiful juice. I gave Fiona a drink but she only took the smallest of sips and she said it tasted flat- well duh....it's flat because it's fruit juice. I LOVES BLINKING, I DO Today whilst standing in a queue waiting to pay for a t shirt, a little girl in front of me started to blink at me, I blinked back and she started to laugh. She must have been less than 2 but she was well able to converse using just blinks. She was in a double buggy with a baby boy next to her, she introduced me to the boy(who as asleep) and we were blinking away quite happily. The little girl was with an older lady who was totally unaware of the fact that we were communicating. It was the universal language that Paul Coelho talks about in the Alchemist. It made me think about Beauty and how she is able to communicate with me without words and lives in BeautyWorld, where no one can hurt her and she is innocently happy. I think she is a blessed child who is not able to understand the horrors in the world that surround her. In the same way that we can only retain a certain amount of memory at one point or our brains would go into meltdown, I think that we HAVE to try not to ponder too much on the awful things going on in the world or we would breakdown. I do as much as I can but I know it is never enough so I have to try and put the full horror to the back of my mi nd.I believe that Beauty will never be truly aware and that makes me happy. When Bob Geldof brought the issues of Poverty to the fore it wasn't Bob Geldof who I put my trust in but the world leaders who made promises, promises to do things that I can not do. I do my best and any charity who sends me a request for money in the post gets \u00a35 , not a lot but I don't have a lot. I also put all my change into charity boxes everytime I go shopping. I give old clothes and bric-a-brac to charity shops. I regularly give money to World Vision and I raise money for The Hollies Special School in Cardiff but it will never be enough. World leaders have to do what we little people cannot do, they make the global decisions that are most important. They are the ones who can put an end to wars-if there were no wars there would be no problem feeding the people of the world. Have you heard the one about the lost handbag? This is a story that I swear on my life was told at a church meeting. On the way back from holiday a couple flew into an airport and the wife put her hanbag on the luggage trolley and left it there. A few miles down the motorway they realised that it had been left behind so they turned around to retrieve it. Racing along the motorway they prayed fervently to their God to let the bag still be there and lo and behold it was. They stated in that church meeting that they believed that God had answered their  prayers. None of the priesthood in that meeting stood up at anytime and said they were wrong. So it must be mormon church doctrine that a members handbag is worth more than the life of s starving child. I have heard it stated that God cannot intervene to save these children because it would be against Gods laws and these children are suffering because of the sins of mankind. Mankind caused their poverty so it is not for God to intervene. I have also heard it said that it is other people who learn from the suffering of these children. Well I don't want any child to suffer for me, I would rather go to hell than have to 'learn' something from their suffering. If there is a God and this is his doctrine then God is bad not good. I don't do anything that I do because I want a reward now or in heaven, I don't believe there is anybody who is truly altuistic, the reason that I do what I do is because I cannot bear the thought of the suffering of other people. I want the awful sense of knowing that people out there are suffering to go away, a feeling that has been with me since primary school when we collected clothes for Biafra(yep, I'm that old). The only way that we can ever feel better is by making world leaders play their part and do the things we can not do, write to the leaders of your country and tell the m how you feel. You pay taxes so you are their boss, tell them what you want.......TODAY. Recognise any of these men? They were at the G8 last year-tell them what you think needs to be done........before more children starve to death.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/pomegranites.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/geldof.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/hunger.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/g8.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/06/pomegranites-and-poverty.html", "title": "\n"},

I watched Highlander again last night(it seems to be on daily repeat at the moment), I never cease to be amazed at how gorgeous Christopher Lambert is. I think it is the eyes that do it for me-a bit like George Clooney...........it's all in the eyes! Thankfully he has a lovely voice too because I hate it when their voices let them down. I always thought that Gary Barlow from Take That was cute ..........until he spoke, and the same for David Beckham but I have to say that either David's voice has matured a lot recently or he has had elocution lessons. Am I shallow? Heck who cares..........film stars that have a nice pair of eyes that make me a film fan smile are ok. My mother loved films and she went to see a film a few days before I was born, I never thought to ask her what film. As long as it made her smile and brightened her drab little life then it was good. I would like to think that the film she saw was something classy like The Misfits that was released on the 1st February 1961 but that was probably the US release date and it probably didn't get to the UK unti much later. As I have said before, I feel pseudo-intellectuals who say 'oh I have never wasted my time watching a soap' waste their lives and never just relax and enjoy the moment. If it makes you happy go watch a film, watch a soap or chill by just doing nothing then go for it. In some peoples eyes you may not'achieve' much but by chilling and relaxing you could possibly achieve a peaceful and less stressed heart and that has to b e good. A big thankyou to  TWO-GOALS-TONI  from the Italian football team for scoring(obviously) two goals in yesterdays match against the Ukraine in the world cup knockouts. Italy won 3-0, now we have to watch Italy v Germany on tuesday 4th July at 8 pm! Anastasia who will be home will be supporting Germany due to her complicated but undisclosed European links and Running man(born within the sound of Bow Bells and the most typical sounding and acting Cockney/Londoner you could meet but whose father was born in Italy) will be supporting Italy. However ultimately he wants England to  win . During the match on tuesday we will be eating pizza and apple strudel and Running man will be drinking German beer, just to celebrate our families multi-national links. I am sure Beauty will enjoy the match on tuesday as she seemed to enjoy the Italy v Ukraine match as she spent the whole time drinking(juice), lining up her soldiers and saying,'It's a goal.....badda bing....badda bing.......' and every so often running around and kissing everyone-sounds like a footballer!     Fional was more interested in the internet and Sno White watched Big Brother turn bad..........What was Ashlyne  not  wearing? It left nothing to the imagination. So in Big Brother we now have a house next- door-and 5 new housemates-with so many new housemates this year Big Brother is never going to end! I know I like Big Brother but pleeeeeeeeeease.

This morning I awoke to Beauty turning on the tv and I heard someone say,' where is the Paraguayan embassy?' so loudly that anyone at the garage must have heard, what a wake up call! However, just one second earlier Dierdre from Corrie had suddenly appeared in my dream - smiling inanely , being  not a morning person  smiling people first thing in the morning test the limits of my ability to cope so waking up was perhaps a good thing. Don't get me wrong , I quite like Dierdre, I think I know as much about Dierdre as I do any of my family ( except of course my father, man of mystery Howell James), having grown up watching Corrie like any other self respecting Brit. Getting back to my father however, I wouldn't say he was a liar - I would say he was a man with a vivid imagination and reality and imagination with regards to his past are a little difficult to unravel. Beauty wore one of her pretty new dresses to school and of course she looked like a princess-WEARING A SAND COLOURED TRILBY VIENNA! At least it is a summer hat, one of the little boys who is a year older than Beauty had a thing about wearing his woollen bobble hat, scarf and gloves during the summer and to bed. If I don't take my tablets at 6 am then my joints really are a lot slower at getting started, unfortunately this morning it was gone 7 before I got to the tablets so I'll be shuffling until after my 2nd lot of meds. Thankyou Pollyanna for the thought that just popped into my head( no I'm not hearing voices and no church it was not,'that still small voice'), some people would love to shuffle, I know.......... I'm glad - give me a couple of hours and I might even be able to smile glad. To help keep my car seats clean I recently crocheted seat covers and they have been on approximately two weeks, there is a seat cover under Beauty's toddler seat and it looks quite clean but my seat cover compared to Beauty's is very dirty, you can see it is dirty. I wear clean clothes at least once a day, maybe twice so where does the dirt come from? Is it street dust? Are there naughty car dirt fairies that sprinkle dust into my car every night? Naughty fairies beware! These covers have left me feeling quite OCD, you'll all be calling me Anthea soon. If I were interviewing for a cleaner and they told me their name was Anthea, they would get the job- Anthea you are my inspiration! This afternoon I went over to Piano man's house and not much progress I'm afraid, I think we are going to have to get a cleaner in for an hour a day,5 days a week as Piano man is just does not well enough for the job. 15 minutes each for the 2 bathrooms, the lounge and the kitchen will be enough to keep them going. They will also need a dyson as their cleaner is just not up to the job. Help the aged are coming to assess Piano man's mother and the house on monday at 11am. I am working hard at de-cluttering the place- regular trips to Wedal road and the charity shops. 28 degrees this afternoon and it is way too hot for me, I have burnt my right arm in the car so I shall have to be slapping on the factor 50 (sun great for washing though). Break a leg to Belle  though-hope all goes well with the job interview. The 3 storey house on the corner( the place where children run into your car) had a 'barbie' last night, when I went to pick up Beauty the remains of the party was still in the garden-it must have been a really good party..........lucky people. Dawn is so early they were probably still partying when the sun came up. Beauty had a bit of an incident in school today- a poor little boy in the year above Beauty thought it would be good to take his shoes and socks off. School or Beauty not happy, Beauty was a girl on a mission and made him put his shoes and socks back on, she followed him around the playground with his shoes and socks and compelled him to put them back on again(or else). Neighbours of the spotless kind are having a party in the garden , it's a birthday party but I'm not sure for whom. Their house is for sale with Peter Allen and they now have photos on the web site, the house is lovely inside-have a peek Vienna. Read burbomats links- Russel M.

I'm just fed up of people getting divorced, people going off with someone else(don't get me started on Brian McFadden) and people being just nasty to each other. I've never been that keen on Heather Mills McCartney, I don't know why I felt that way as she never did me any harm but today I read that she and Paul McCartney are to separate and all I want to say to them is just stop it. I just want the two of them to be happy together. I feel quite miserable as I have a mega head cold, thanks to Beauty who is great at picking up any bug that is going around and then very generous with sharing them with the rest of her family. I am using a decongestant, painkillers and throat tablets but they don't seem to be doing very much. Perhaps I should play Pollyanna's Glad Game, you know the one she played with her Dad when a pair of crutches came in the Ladies Aiders barrel instead of the doll she wanted, he said be glad you don't need the cruthes. Well, here's the rub, I do need the crutches because of my arthritis - but you know I'm sure as hell glad that I only need the crutches and not the wheelchair that is gathering dust in my hallway at the moment. So what's a snivelling cold in comparison to a lot worse illnesses that I could have. I 've just re-read what I wrote and I sound like a right sap. However I am a sick sap, that's my excuse.

{"date": " May 12, 2006", "body": "\n THE LION SHALL LIE DOWN WITH THE LAMB This morning I took Beauty to school and the procedure is that we take the children into the hall and wait for the teachers to arrive and collect the children.The school that Beauty attends is for children with physical and learning issues that can only really be addressed in a non-mainstream school. When I enter the school I feel that somehow I am entering the real world and outside all the problems exist, not in the school. Beauty and her friends in the school have a natural purity that is sweet and beautiful and is something that 'normally developing'(whatever that means) people like me can strive a whole life time for and it still be beyond our grasp.On the piano in the hall I saw a toy lamb and a toy lion and immediately thought about something I had heard in sunday school as a child,  THE LION SHALL LIE DOWN WITH THE LAMB.  I remembered the story about how there would one day only be peace and I am pretty sure that the toys related to this story as the school is really into christian songs and stories. I did strongly feel that these children had nothing they could possibly learn from the morals of christian stories, I did feel however that I had a lot to learn from the children. If I lived all my life doing the best I could I knew I could never achieve what they have now. I had a really exciting day today, it was sunny all day so I spent most of my day doing washing......... can life really get anymore interesting? After picking Beauty up from school we decided to make the most of the weather and have our tea in the park. We decided to have our 'forget the diet' splurge. I had pineapple in batter and chips(I am pretty sure it wasn't organic but I console myself with it being vegetarian), Belle had a chicken burger with just lettuce and mayonaise, SnowWhite had just chips, Ariel had just chips, Fiona had fishcake and chips and Beauty had ketchup and a chip(she doesn't eat the chip, she just uses the chip to eat the ketchup!)NICE CHILD. The park was beautiful with the sun coming down over the lake. A crowd of people were chased by a spitting mother duck, the people came just a little bit too close to her chicks. This is my Pollyanna moment for the day, the weather was brilliant when we left the house but by the time we got back it had rained. I am now drying my cushions in the front hall and passage, I should be upset but my Pollyannaism is ..... at least I don't have to water my plants again tonight. Am I sad or am I sad? No, I'm just getting too philosophical for my own good with middle age. Oops...I can hear the helicopters out again, do the bad guys never sleep? This afternoon I was in my gardening knitting my bashful and blush blanket when the police helicopter swept over my house again and again and again and again, I felt the police were way too interested in a garden containing a middle aged women wearing a very modest below the knee shirtwaister dress whilst doing here knitting.Perhaps they liked the colours of the blanket?

{"date": " May 13, 2006", "body": "\n HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY OR How green can one family be on a council estate in a city suburb? I never say 'thank goodness it's friday but thank goodness it's monday'. I really appreciate that teachers need the weekend to recover but having the '2nd naughtiest child in the school' home during the day time really interferes with sleep recovery time. I really am impressed with the ability of my 5 year old to be up watching DVD's from 2.30am, then catch a nap from 6am until 7am and then still be able to get up and meet the new day with gusto and a smile. She is brilliant. I love automatic washing machines and dishwashers, you can put the dirty clothes and dirty dishes in, have a recovery nap, wake up and find you've done your clothes washing and washed your dishes. I love muti-tasking. All I need now is a dishwasher that will empty itself and put the dishes away and a washing machine that will put the clothes on the line, then iron, fold and put the clothes away. I read this article today titled 'Greens must come out of the woods' by Peter Gibson. Peter Gibson says 'Self-styled 'greens' are seen as out of touch in many communities. They should concentrate on local issues.,which are what many people,particularly the disadvanteged see as the most important ones. Hippies, loonies and anoraks-thats how the public views enviromentalists. Or so a recent British survey on recycling said. Well meaning but out of touch.' Peter Gibson talks about people in deprived neighbourhoods, where poverty, crime and drug addiction are very real and daily problems, the last thing on their minds is ozone depletion or the condition of the rainforests. He talks about how residents should take ownership of their land, and pride would be restored, crime could be reduced and an interest in environmental issues would snowball.' WHAT A LOAD OF B----CKS!(Yes, I know that is a 'rather weighty' statement) Who are these 'greens',' environmentalists' and 'they' that he is talking about? I live on council estate and I am a full-time carer for a child with a disability so I live on carers benefit. Even though it would be difficult for me to work at the moment, I try to give back to the community by fundraising. I reduce,reuse and recycle, just as Bob the Builder tells us. I take all my used clothes to charity shops and recycle and compost(in my composter in my tiny back garden) everything else. I also have a water butt to save rain water to water my plants. I eat an organic,vegetarian diet as much as possible and use all environmentally friendly  products in my home. I save as much power and water as possible in my home, I would love to have solarpanels and a small windmill but like that is ever going to happen on my money. And yes, I do care about the ozone and the rainforests even though I am experiencing poverty, crime and there is drug addiction where I live and of course I do live in a deprived neighbourhood, GIVE UP HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE. I have also  'taken ownership of my land' and I am proud of that, and so have a lot of my neighbours. This however has not  changed the poverty, crime and drug use in the area. I am still on carers benefit, somebody still tried to break into my home two weeks ago and people on this estate and probably every other estate , whether it is be a private estate or a council estate in this city, are still taking drugs. So who am I Mr Gibson? Am I a hippie, loonie or an anorak? Or am I a green or an environmentalist? Or am I one of the deprived experiencing the poverty, crime and drugged environment? So please Mr Gibson, fly down out of your ivory tower and visit my home for afternoon tea so you can see how the deprived live and see how little we care about the environment and how much we care for our world. Enough said. Beautiful afternoon spent in the park whilst Beauty was taken around the lake for a walk in her buggy, she loved the ice cream. I spent the time relaxing on a park bench knitting my bashful and blush blanket,it is coming along well. Knitting must be a very calming image to people as it draws people to me like a magnet. I felt like the knitting counsellor today, three lots of people chatted to me and one lady told me her life story. It was an enjoyable experience, however rain again stopped play. But of course, when it rains it means no plants to water. And luckily this time no washing got wet. Please excuse any spelling or grammar mistakes so far in previous blogs or in any blogs to come, I'm really not good at things like that. Anyway PINK IS THE NEW BLOG has made spelling mistakes so I am in brilliant company. PINK IS THE NEW BLOG and DOOCE are my favourite blogs, though I have never noticed DOOCE make a spelling mistake. Beauty just stirred but thankfully has gone back to sleep, Snow White is watching ER repeats and there is still wandering around upstairs from the others. I think I'll leave them to it and try and get some beauty sleep( get it?).

After taking Beauty my five year old to school, I returned home to find that Barney was gone, demised, no longer with us. Not only was Barney the video no longer with us but the video player was no more with Barney stuck inside. At times a child with autism can be very tiring, sometimes awake at 4am and bouncing around like a kangaroo,watching Barney over and over and over again. At the moment it feels like my life is upside down, awake at night with Beauty (and Barney) and catching some sleep in the day to recover. At 2.25am this morning I dropped Beauty's big sister Anastasia off at the station to catch the bus to the airport to fly to a censored location in Europe where she is going to live. ANASTASIA WILL LIVE THERE ALONE. Anastasia is 24, then there is Belle who is 22, SnowWhite who is 20, Ariel who is 16, Fiona who is 15 and of course Beauty who is 5. For along time my daughters have had the nicknames of the cartoon princesses they are most like, hence their blog names. Mine has been Cinderella because I am always cleaning but I am mostly known as Mother of Many. This blog is not just meant to be about the joys of raising a child with autism but about the trials of being the mother of six girls. It is also about keeping them up to date with the family as they are a widely travelled group of girls. Anastasia and Belle travel a lot. Beauty is watching The Care Bears Movie on the DVD player so she is not missing Barney too much at the moment.

{"date": " May 10, 2006", "body": "\n SPEAK ONLY IF YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON SILENCE I constantly wonder what goes on in the mind of a five year old diagnosed with autism. Beauty is at the stage where she is chatting or singining constantly. However, only by listening carefully can you make out what she is singing with the exception of Old MacDonalds farm and that can be HEARD and understood by the people in the house at the end of the street. Beauty will sing and sing and sing, even when you are trying to watch tv and no amount of persuasion will make her stop. Therefore, when Beauty is in school or asleep (which doesn't seem to happen often enough) I like to enjoy the silence of my own home. Silence in my home though is a rare commodity. Less than 1/4 of a mile from my house over the last six months two new housing estates have been and still are being built. So there has been constant noise. My 16 year old seems to have a form of tourettes that a high proportion of teenage girls seem to have, I blame tv. What does 'shamon ' mean ? Has a new language evolved that I know nothing about? However, one of the noisiest things in my house is the computer, some young people today seem unable to use the computer without music blaring out of it and they bash the keyboard so hard I am sure it will not last the summer holidays. Yes I am getting old, soon I will be wearing purple and sitting on the pavement in the street just to get some silence. As per usual, Beauty gave me an early wake up call at approximately 5am. Again we watched The Care Bears Movie. I can always tell when sleep deprivation starts to kick in, this morning I started to analyse the philosophical elements in the Care Bear Movie and then when I got tired of that I started looking for continuity errors in the movie. All this whilst knitting to try and keep myself awake. At the moment I am knitting a blanket which I shall call Bashful and Blush, I am making it with a light pink and a dark pink wool. Knitting has been described as Zen like, I enjoy the tactile element of knitting and the sense of acomplishment when I complete something. However at the moment I have no sense of acomplishment when I complete other tasks such as the cleaning of my living room, Why? because I know for a surety that within 10 minutes the five year old will have completed her demolition of the afore said room. Beauty does have an affinity with construction workers however so you can see where her demolition urges come from, her first words were not mum or dad but BOB THE BUILDER. Now is that wierd or is that wierd. Amazing thunder and lightning storm this evening(sorry if I sound like the  weatherman) , the sky seemed filled with fork and sheet lightning.Huge downpour saved me the task of watering my plants which are comimg along nicely.

This is a theory that I have heard before, some men express homophobic views because they are confused about their sexuality and are really in denial about possible homosexual tendancies. So  ANALYSE THIS,  is it too much of an impossible leap to possibly conclude that a person who very loudly and forcibly makes it their mission in life to be critical of all forms of mental illness and it's treatment, possibly be so critical because they fear they themselves have mental health issues?

Unfortunately I am a women and I have a really bad head cold, at times my head feels as if it is about to explode. As for todays sickday excuse from the Sickday Excuse Generator, the funny thing is on Easter Sunday I had a wound in my right palm that would not stop bleeding. It really looked like a stigmata however it was definitely not spontaneous but the result of 2 glasses falling into my hand as I tried to get a glass from the glass cupboard. I will never again attempt to catch a falling glass, let it smash. It probably only cost about 20p in a multi-pack from Asda/Walmart. However if it were an antique I am sure I would think differently. Can you imagine though  going to church on Easter Sunday with a bandaged bleeding palm, now what would the rest of the congregation think ? 1- You accidently cut yourself(most normal and sane guess) 2- You cut yourself so you could have a stigmata 3- You had a real stigmata I personally wouldn't go back to church until it had healed, I may be a fruit loop but I'm not that bad. Come to think of it however it might be worth going just to see the reactions and the swing on the fruit-loop-a-meter. Awoken unceremoniously this morning at stupid o'clock to find Beauty sat by my head poking her finger into my cheeks and eyes, she wanted to watch a DVD and couldn't get it to work. I don't do mornings. Last night Beauty spent hours going through her toy tub finding toys she could sing about, InceyWwincey Spider, This little fishey, Old MacDonald(of course) etc. This is something I have always done, the girls say that I have a song for eveything and that I only need to hear a word and I can find a song with that word in it. No testing please, I am sure there are words that I could not fit into a song for example - tourettes(oops I didn't mean this to be a challenge), there may be a song out there but I don't know it. It must be the bad weather and my cold but I keep thinking that a holiday in the sun would be nice.We have had two days of rain but I doubt that it will make any difference to the drought predictions for the summer, I remember the dry, hot summer of 76 and that kind of summer is nothing to look forward to. It makes you wonder though how countries like Spain cope every summer yet a few dry weeks and we have a drought. A bit like the wrong kind of snow I suppose! Mary Poppins said,'I never explain anything', this is a quote I toltally believe in. I feel that you should only share what you feel comfortable with as you never know when something you say might come back to bite you in the butt. Look at all the celebs and the kiss and tells that have been written about then. I desire no 15minutes of fame. My mother was born in the late 20's and was brought up by a great aunt as her mother and grandmother were dead. My mother was a very superstitious person and I think it was to do with being brought up by older relatives in an isolated country area. She was brought up on a small-holding in Lincolnshire and I once read the Country Child by Alison Uttley and that's exactly how I picture my mothers childhood. During my childhood I remember my mother having lots of superstitious sayings such as 'stir with a knife,stir with strife', 'never do washing on New Years Day', 'never touch the window sills when there is thunder and lightning', etc. Today I followed a link to an Icelandic group called Sigur Ros, they have videos on their website so go listen to them.

I am making a throw for Piano Man's mother's chair, I have finished one ball of wool but now I cannot carry on as I can't find the rest of the wool, this is the black hole that is my home. So I am back to knitting my pink baby blanket, I am convinced that one day I will wake up and think, 'Where is my mind', and I shall answer myself,'oops I have lost it in the black hole that is my home'. After yesterdays blog I felt a compulsive need to go to IKEA(as you do, like the time we watched Supersize Me and afterwards all I wanted was a Big Mac meal........go figure that one). As any addict of any standing will admit it wasn't for me of course, today is the day that I tackle Piano Man's back toilet/store room and so I will need lots of storage and IKEA of course is tub/basket/box heaven. My plan is to send Piano Man around his house with four carrier bags and to fill them with books he does not want and then we will drop them off at charity shops. I also plan to send him around his house/kitchen to find any gadget(including the square boiled egg maker) or appliance that has not been used in the last 20 years and also consign them to the charity shop. Piano Man believe......I AM YOUR NEMESIS. I realise that this will be difficult for him but counselling will be available to get him through this emotional and stressful time. I also intend to take my Dyson cleaner to the house as it reaches the parts other cleaners do not reach(more suck you see), Running Man's friend has also said we can use his industrial carpet cleaner for free. Fiona will also be coming with me so she can help to tidy the back garden at Piano Man's house, it is a bit( a lot) of an untidy wilderness and needs a good sort out. It is the sort of place that would give Diarmud Gavin palpatations, you could grow something illegal in it and no one would ever notice( come to think of it Piano Man would probably not notice either). Piano Man has a piano lesson later on so on the way I shall introduce him to my new found joy, Wedal Road, closer to my house than Lamby way and so much better organised, and what may you ask is Wedal Road?................. a local authority receiving centre for refuse and recycling-a perfectly  organic  experience. A very small plot but perfectly planned. The access road is U shaped, you Q on the left and follow the road around and down the right hand side are about 10 parking spaces and in the middle are the huge skips and at the end(my favourite place of all), the recycling area. An experience Piano Man will be initiated into today anf hopefully a place where he will become a welcome regular visitor. Had another dream last night- do not worry family it was nothing to do with IKEA or Darfur but George Clooney. We were involved in a long term on- off relationship, and for the record I am quite happy for this dream to come true, not a problem.

{"date": " May 31, 2006", "body": "\n I had the wierdest dream last night? I dreamt I saw Hitler in an alpine village asking the locals, 'what is it with you people and Ikea' and you know if he could communicate with us now and as daft as it might sound, it is quite possible that it is a question he might ask. Remember however that this was a way wierd dream, a cross between a Python film and a Carry On film. Just for the record, I have dreams that have a wierd way of coming true( remember the Barney video, sorry Beauty), however dear family I want you to know that this is on a par with my going to work in Darfur dream, not going to happen.Ever. I prefer to sit at home and crochet for charity, my Dercums and Darfur just would not mix. Back to the point, Ikea, as a young wife I would have loved the possibility of shopping in Ikea, my views on Ikea are the same as watching poo tv, go for it if it floats your boat. I have an Ikea day bed in my lounge as well as antique cupboards and a secondhand couch(thank you Track 2000), in the 5 year olds room are Ikea wardrobes, Ikea bookshelves and an Ikea bureau and of course a Thucka(pronounce it right guys) cot bed. In the dining room I have Ikea bookshelves, my mothers table and an Argos filing cabinet. In the kitchen an Ikea bench and in the back kitchen at the piano Beauty's old high chair which is now her piano seat. In the hall a Thucka chest of drawers and in the shower room an Ikea Billy bookcase, as the Borg would possibly have said,' assimilation is inevitable' and do I care? In the words of that great philosopher John Howell, 'to be honest and candid with you,NO'. I love Ikea like I love poo tv. And talking of poo tv, I am finding Big Brother unpleasent viewing, Grace,Sezer and Imogen are just not nice people. Last night I crocheted and read my emails rather than watch BB, a lot more entertaining. PETE TO WIN. Yesterday was spent cleaning the Piano Mans house,(Piano Man now home from hospital and recovering slowly), spring cleaning continuing in the kitchen. It took me two hours to clean the kitchen tops and wash the dishes which shows how bad the situation is, and another two hours to scrub the kitchen floor and make a start on the back toilet/store room. I am also cleaning all the paint work in readiness to paint through the kitchen. Tomorrow I am taking over my Dyson to clean the carpets, Piano Mans vac is almost suctionless, then we will be ready to hire a carpet cleaner and then the fun will begin. I have come to the point where I now just throw rubbish in his house away without consultation, yesterday we were in Asda and he was looking at more rubbish to buy so I told him to WALK AWAY.His kitchen is filled with every unused gadget you can imagine down to the gadget to make a square boiled egg. I despair. With Piano Man quality is not an issue, it just has to be cheap and gimmicky. At the right price he is the kind of tourist you could sell London Bridge to. Yesterday I took Piano Man to the Doctors in my car as he is unable to drive for at least 6 weeks, Piano Man doing well but I wore my new sparkly Dorothy style ruby slippers from Asda into the surgery and I swear the locals looked at me as if I were a serial axe murderer. I am sure I would have caused less of a stir if I had shown up in Janet Jacksons stage costume and had a wardrobe malfunction. My healthy eating is going fine and I have lost another pound(yes in weight Fiona) however increase in fluids and vegtables for me means increase in bathroom trips and I now know how a racehorse feels. If I go on holiday this year then my goal is thatI should be slimmer(and healthier of course!!!!!!!!!) however at the moment slimmer looks good. Looking at a size 8 dress yesterday in Asda, Piano Man asked me if it would fit me, my reply was,'in an alternate universe', I think this must be the same universe that men come from. I am definitely addicted to carbs, do you think there is an organisation such as Carbs Anonymous as all I seem to think of is carbs. At the moment all I seem to desire is thin, white bread toast with a small scraping of margarine and spread with brown fruity sauce(something I loved as a child}, yes I know that is wierd and no I could not possibly be pregnant. If I believed in a God or in a heaven then heaven would be a place where I could eat whatever I wanted and not have to worry about every morsel that passed my lips and of course not put on weight and I would not be afflicted with this bizarre affliction that whenever I put on weight it went straight to my stomach. I have my fathers bone structure and colouring which means I have sandy red hair and a shape like a man which means no hips or arse, I have been asked if I have a scandinavian heritage. I personally think I look like a female Russian shot putter. Beauty is watching 100 toddler tunes for the 7,000,000th time( I know, if I have told you once I have told you a million times. do not exaggerate),ok then 6,000,000th time,and having her 'EAST IS EAST' style breakfast,  biscuits. Beauty may be quite selective with her food but she does have quite a varied selection now, her favourite foods being Jettas, fish fingers and crisps, my heart goes out to the mother of the little girl with autism who will only eat chocolate. Ronald Reagan said,'You can tell a lot about a fellow's character by his way of eating jellybeans', well I personally think you may not learn a lot about Beauty's character from the way she eats anything but she is definitely my role model for someone who has no hangups about anything she eats. That is my goal( I also wouldn't mind having Beauty's beautiful frizz free hair). hwyl Mother of Many \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/ronald%20reagan.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/05/what-is-with-you-people-and-ikea.html", "title": "\nWHAT IS WITH YOU PEOPLE AND IKEA?\n"},
{"date": " May 24, 2006", "body": "\n Piano Man has had 3 strokes since friday but he seems to be doing well, speech is back and paralysis gone but just a little weakness left in his right side. He always said he had a constitution of an ox and could eat anything and I always told him that was a load of bloody bollocks AND now he believes me. I am tring to convert him to the way of the organic vegetarian but for the meat eating killing machine(ex-army bandsman) it is just a little drastic. He keeps threatening to discharge himself and I keep threatening to take all his clothes, shoes and money whilst he is asleep and he knows that I mean it. It has been 6 years since I worked at the University Hospital and the work force seems to have changed so much.I started nurses training in 1980 and there were always lots of asian doctors but now the makeup of the nursing force is diverse in ways it never was before. On the ward that Piano Man is on there is a nurse who is probably fom Malaysia, a nurse who I think is from India, a British born nurse of Pakistani descent a nurse who is muslim and wears a long sleeve top and the scarf and the cleaners are from Poland. The work force are very caring and very efficient and this city has always been very cosmopolitan but I was nursing before the nurses came from other countries in such large numbers so for me it is just so different. I love the summer, Big Brother is back, hurrah! I am not a religious person so I believe that you only have one life and so I feel you should make the best of it and live it to the full. If you want to watch Big Brother, Eastenders, Coronation Street, Emmerdale( one of the funniest tv soaps and Marlon Dingle is an amazing actor) and any other non-pseudo intellectual bullshit then go for it. What is the point of living a grey, miserable life devoid of all fun but being able to say, ' ah but I never watched rubbish tv'. Well good for you, all my adult life I have been a mother and a nurse( and I am happy with what I did) and I feel I have contributed to society but I am beginning to feel like I missed out on having 'ME time fun'. If you don't hurt anyone else then go have fun, I read a report that said by doing lots of different things it makes your life seem longer and following a boring pattern week in week out leads to the feeling of a shorter life. I love Pete in Big Brother,he is so sweet and there is no way he is being exploited for his Tourettes, he seems one of the happiest most well balanced individuals I have come across. I hope you win. I had the wierdest text message today, it said 'Mi3 is brilliant', ok well I'm really happy for you whoever you are, just take me off your speed dial. The Bubbles Baby Blanket at Crochet Pattern Central is meant to be really easy to make and can be done very quickly and my answer to that is 'WHATEVER', I have tried and tried and tried again but it just doesn't look right, it looks good but just not like the photograph. I have decided to make it up the way it is going now and when I see my Crochet Expert then she can show this idiot how to do it properly. I have just finished crocheting car seat covers, very hippy 60's looking, cool man. Remember, live and love life. Eat, drink and be merry ...............

Beauty is able to work the DVD player better than I can so I am awoken every morning to a different episode of Popetown- in quite a lot of episodes father Nicholas seems to have lost the Pope. Popetown is a DVD that Beauty found near the DVD player and has now claimed as her own. Popetown is a fictional Vatican where the ever good and long suffering Father Nicholas trys to keep a very youthful sounding and acting Pope happy. Popetown is meant to be a very naughty look at the Vatican but I actually find it quite sweet, and Beauty loves it. I am sure the Vatican is not impressed but funnily enough I think it improves the image of catholocism, Father Nicholas is a good man and of course he is Beauty's favourite character. There is one episode where the reporter keeps getting Father Nicholas' name wrong so Beauty keeps shouting 'Nicholas' at the tv. Go for it Beauty! Addition to my Karma list, apologise to Connect to Cardiff phone operator for being a little too harsh. When I ask are the council black bags and green bags biodrgradable I really want to know whether the black backs and green bags are biodegradable not what can you put into a green bag. In October the council intends to issue me with a black wheelie bin and a green wheelie bin, I must contact them and ask if they intend to issue me with a bigger back garden to keep them in. Beauty has just had her Hobbit second breakfast, yoghurt eaten minus wearing a t shirt-well the weather is warm and it saves washing a t shirt. Beauty seems a little quieter this am, no sitting in the china cupboard, no eating cake with her feet and no trying to lick the soles of my feet. For those of you who thought picking your nose and eating it was disgusting, Beauty has now cornered the market on disgusting with sole licking. My favourite tv show is back - Anthea Turner Perfect Housewife, it is car crash tv at it's best. The women is so OCD she puts a new spin on anal - she even recycles washing up liquid bottles to make pencil holders(thank you Blue Peter). If anybody thinks it would be funny to send Anthea to my house as a surprise-think again- I would hunt you down for the rest of time and make you suffer.In the same way I have promised Ariel's future employers- Ariel would like to join the army(or maybe the airforce) but I have decided that when she graduates I will tell the army(or the airforce) that I remember Deepcut and if anything happened to Ariel I would hunt them down until the end of time and make them suffer too . see no pressure!

This morning I got up and went outside at 7am to find the sky full of vapour trails and the sky was like a chess board. It is probably the pilots from RAF St Athan, having grown up in Rhoose I recognise their handiwork. Last night I had another stupid dream,(this one is for you Anastasia)I dreamt that Anastasia came to me and told me that she needed a fancy dress costume for a party and she said she wasn't sure what to wear so I suggested she look at the Vogue magazine. I thought she might want to go as a stylish film star but no, she decided to go as Alice in wonderland but the costume she chose made her look more like Heidi. Don't worry Anastasia, I have a new sewing machine so any costume you want, I'm your seamstress(even Alice in Wonderland/Heidi). OMG I've just realised , perhaps the costume I made was the Sound of Music, now it did look like that-sorry Anastasia. Today I went over Piano Man's house to help him clean, I took him two schedules that I had made and put one on the wall in the kitchen and one on the downstairs bathroom wall. How to clean the kitchen in only 15 minutes and how to clean the bathroom in only 15 minutes each day. When he read the kitchen schedule he said ' you mop the floor every day ?', I said ' YES', he said' you swear ', and I said ,' every God damn day.' One stressed bunny! Welcome to the real world. Two more schedules tomorrow, upstairs bathroom and living room. Remember, I am your Nemesis.

Yes this is one of my dreams and I think it is time I considered the sleeping pills because my dreams are getting wierder and wierder. Last night I dreamed that I had somehow discovered over a billion in diamonds that had been stolen in the war and it was my job to give the money from the sale to the poor, why the poor and not the real owners I don't know(remember this is one of my dreams!). Anyway. Robin Hood here was saved from the enemy(not clear who they were) and saved by the americans but later found out they only wanted the money for themselves, however I totally understand why someone would want to keep that kind of money so.... I escaped in the back of a taxi to carry on my Robin Hood work. Question ? - How when I cut my thumb to hide the diamonds in my thumb did my thumb not bleed(don't worry I am a nurse so no need to explain technicalities-? really rhetorical) Question ? -How was my thumb big enough to hide over a billion in diamonds and no one notice? I have always believed that dreams are a product of the experiences you have had in the day before the dream but the only connection I can find is me watching My name is Earl( I love Randy, he is a brilliant actor) and Earl thinking Kharma wanted him to give back his money and that's it. I need some seriously refreshing REM sleep, no dreams. Beauty seems to be sleeping less and less, I think it is possibly related to all the extra daylight with the summer. Anastasia and Belle never wanted to sleep during the summer as children, they would lay for hours in in bed reading Ladybird books whilst Snow White was asleep the minute her head hit the pillow. Imagine this dear family-leave the estate in the car and drive down Holly Bush road and turn left onto Cyncoed road, then drive down Celyn avenue and turn left to go to the post box near Hetty's, turn right into Carnegie and at the bottom turn right and drive back to the junction with Celyn avenue. Then have an elderly asian lady who is driving in front of you in an old beat up white car, reverse for no good reason into your lovely people carrier. I think she was trying to park on the corner over the junction as in front of her house was full of white vans(extension being built). Thankfully she did not speak english as from in side the car I called her a silly ' fresian' and luckily her ?grandson did not hear me. However, when I beeped the horn to make her stop(she couldn't see me as she was not looking in any of her mirrors) a posse of about 10 policemen looked around, they were all learning to ride pedal bikes. The whole situation was very farcical but thankfully no damage done. As I have always said I do not worry about my driving , just the driving of the other idiots on the road. Short entry today as I am exhausted from lack of sleep and I feel like Alice in Wonderland when she came across the little cakes which said EAT ME, well all I can hear at the moment is my poor sleep dreprived brain screaming LET ME SLEEP.

The last duvet is in the wash and the kitchen floor is strewn with cushions from the bedrooms. I wash my duvets at least once during the winter but in the winter I dry the duvet over the front hall door-the house is so warm in winter that the duvet is dry over night. In the nice weather I can wash and dry at least 3 duvets in one day + the rest of the washing. Listen to me-Do I make you proud Anthea? Quite normal dreams last night, I dreamt that I met Nancy Green in the street and we talked about not shopping on Holy days and I was also having a conversation with my mother over a pint of milk. I also dreamed about 504 Kevin Street-where or what that is I don't know. Did you read Blubomat Anastasia? I thought his blog on the mormons and the gays was very good. He has other chuch related entries that you should read. OOOOOPS there goes another duvet on the line-now for the cushions......wow I live such an exciting life. Beauty has confiscated Anastasia's sand coloured trilby and she wears it everywhere-even to bed! Good investment there Anastasia. Beauty tipped a drink over herself in school so she came home wearing a 1980's pair of girlie shorts, I told Fiona and Sno White that they looked like something Anastasia had worn in the 80's - and being children they didn't listen properly so all evening they have been convinced that Beauty has been wearing an actual pair of Anastasia's shorts. Sorry Anastasia - however they are quite cool in a vintage kind of way. Will post a picture.

He said,' it looked clean' and I said,' he was taking the p----'. He has promised to do it properly (or I will have to hurt him).

{"date": " June 07, 2006", "body": "\n I think I must be a tree hugger. I am of course a product of the 60's but in the last few days I have been thinking about how alienated some people have become to nature, including myself. We walk on pavements and go lots of places in a car and spend less and less time on natural surfaces such as earth and grass. I must be having my mid-life crisis- trying to make sense of my own mortality(wow- that sounded good)or perhaps I just have too much time on my hands. I am definitely thinking too much. Next you'll find me writing letters to save woodland and in support of wind farms - oops too late-Done That! Do you like my Buddha? he lives in my garden and is a symbol of my religious unbelief-he symbolises my spirituality minus organised religion. Whilst I would defintely not call myself a buddhist, the wisdom of the buddhist philosophy has given me more than my organised religion of choice ever did. How many Zen buddhists does it take to change a light bulb? None- they are the light bulb you've just gotta love it. How many of my children does it take to change a lightbulb? None- they didn't break it so why should they change it(true or what little lovelies) A PARABLE ( my view on life) Growing up I read the book and saw the tv series Pollyanna- I am sure you had guessed due to my previous quotes and in a very sad way it comforted a sad little girl. I am first to put my hand up and say I hate miserable childhood books, there are too many out there and they should stay where they came from- in the individuals past.  My childhood was not good, in fact it was pretty sad most of the time-  well that's my miserable childhood story over and dealt with. I liked the Pollyanna story because, yes as a child I was a geeky sap and the Glad game made me feel better(well some of the time anyway). But.......... I also liked the film The Singing Ringing Tree because that made me feel better(glad?) too. And I am sure you are asking ,'why did that make you feel better?'. Well here is the answer. The film is about a beautiful,talented princess whose parents loved her very much and they did all they could to make her happy, she had everything but there was still a coldness in her heart that meant she could not be truly happy. To make the princess realise how lucky she is and how much her parents loved her she loses her beauty and has to live in the forest as a servant to a bear(who of course is a handsome prince!). Bit by bit she changes and slowly regains her beauty as she realises everything that she has. The result is a beautiful person on the inside and the outside. And I am sure that your next question is. 'how were you comforted by that story?. Well of course the answer is very sappy sad. The princess had everything and it did not make her happy- I had nothing and I knew that getting money would not make me happy ( it would go a long way to make me feel more comfortable though). Because we had no money when I was growing up all I knew was the comfort enough money to allow me to have the necessities would bring. Then what? If you won the lottery what would you do then? Buy a house? Then? Buy some clothes? Then? Go on holidays? Then? Back to living your life of course! Even at a young age I knew that even with everything we owned at the end of the day that all that was left was yourself. And you were the only one who could bring yourself comfort and make yourself happy. So through those sad times I carried on with my small life, using the little things to keep me going. And what is the message to my parable? Of course it is live the one life you have well? Do things you will not regret. Be happy. Make others happy? Recycle( just kidding-but do it just to make me happy anyway) Live a life you will not regret. Forgive even when others are wrong- don't let others control your life. Say sorry even when you ar right- it can't hurt. Wash more often than once a week(oops sorry that was the mother in me) Liberate yourself from the bondage of too many possessions- someone somewhere in the word will gain much joy from the possessions you only store in a cupboard and never look at or use. Love your family- when all else passes away they will still be there for you no matter what a pain they can be. Remember,'other men's failures can never save you'(Sorry-that was way  too good not to use) In conclusion- So say the ramblings of a miserable old southern women- well 'ouiser from Steel Msgnolias doesn't have the monopoly on that one. I am getting older, like everyone I can be miserable and I live in the south. And I already wear purple!!!!!

Late nights and interrupted sleep have left me doing the soft ruby slipper shuffle(I have a comfortable pair of ruby slippers that I wear all the time) until about mid- day. My joints sieze up overnight and it takes a while for my tablets to kick in in the morning. This morning I was awoken to a little voice singing the calypso YELLOW BIRD. She may be a pain in the butt when she wakes me at 4am but YELLOW BIRD at 7am is quite sweet, thankfully she seems to have taken no interest in rock anthems. She so loves singing along to cd's and dvd's, I am convinced she will soon know all the words th Donovan's ,'Universal Soldier' as she has heard it so often in the car. Fancy that, in school Beauty will start singing, 'and he is fighting with missiles and with spears' instead of the usual Baa Baa Black Sheep. See, I am a product of the 60's. I so should have grown up on a commune in California or somewher like Findhorn, wearing hotpants and wearing flowers in my hair- except where did I grow up? A council house(not on a council estate Russell!) in a South Wales village. I never even had a poncho but boy did I want one. Regrets of the sixties? Not remembering seeing the first 'landing on the moon''( I love conspiracy theories-not that their true of course!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) or going to see the Tutankamen exhibition in London( or was that the early 70's) and being able to say that I remember a lot of the 60's. For the first time in months I went shopping in town, I got into town about 10 am so the temperature was still not too high and not too many punters around. I parked in front of the museum and walked through Gorsedd gardens where they were preparing the flower beds, I love it when the flowers and plants arrive fully grown and the gardens are suddenly ablaze with fresh bright colours. I started at a slow walk and ended up a very, very slow shuffle. It looked like I was moon walking forwards. I bought myself a skirt and blouse in Primark where I also bought Beauty a couple of summer dresses and in Debenhams I bought one of the fancy girdles that Trinny and Susannah rave about, to cover the part of my body that can only be cured by plastic surgery. I now have a flat looking stomach.Yippee! Continuing my healthy diet with only a few minor slips. Remember in Grease the film where John Travolta is singing Stranded at the drive in and behind him on a screen is a walking, dancing hotdog-well I almost (almost) see dancing chocolate doughnuts everywhere, I would love just one but I know I can't because one would lead to another and another and another- the chocolate covered doughnut is my nemesis. The nice weather is wonderful but why is it that people say their arthritis is worse when it is wet? My arthritis is worse in the summer when my joints seem to swell with all the heat, Oh well-just to be different I guess.

So far she hasn't put a button up her nose Belle. When I was in primary school one of the girls in my glass put a pencil in her ear, one of the ones with a little pink eraser on the end-that's right, you've guessed-the eraser came off and she had to go to casualty to have it removed.

Surely lying awake in bed with a slight pain killer buzz is better than lying awake in agony. Pain is usually not a problem at night and bad night pain only happens very rarely........so taking pain killers at night only rarely shouldn't be a problem. I am fully aware of what painkillers I can take in a 24 hour period so as long as I stick to that I should be ok. I have taken my early morning meds so very soon I should be all singing, all dancing(I Wish!) PM This afternoon whilst the England v Paraguay game was on I had the most brilliant idea - lets go shopping. The roads were clear, the parks were almost empty and the shops.......................almost punter free, it was a delight. I made an effort today to use my IKEA bags instead of carriers, I put everything straight back into the trolley and receipt very visable in my hand I was out of the shop in half the time. I packed the food into 2 blue IKEA bags and the 4 packs of pepsi max were carried by their own handles. Not only did I not pollute the environment with more carrier bags but it was so much easy to carry 2 well packed large bags than lots of little ones. I now use the biodegradable food bags for nappies so I have no need for carrier bags at all. I also went to City Road to by quilt wadding for a quilt that I am making for Beauty's school summer fayre raffle. So little traffic and so easy to park, an unheard luxury on City Road on a saturday afternoon. I shall be anticipating the next England match when I can again hit the shops-I love football! Fiona is still in her bed - I have to admit though she did get up earlier this morning - to present me with an armful of washing and then she went straight back to bed! Don't you just love teenagers????????????????????????? It is hot, hot,  hot here , late this afternoon it has been quite cloudy but it is still quite muggy. I'm off to watch the dyslexic CSI Hwyl Mother of many X\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/ants.0.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/06/ants-go-marching.html", "title": "\nTHE ANTS GO MARCHING...................\n"},
{"date": " June 11, 2006", "body": "\n As an adult I have barely watched a handful of football matches, why? because I cannot cope with the constant emotion of  Will they? Won't they?  I have to have the result straight away and I don't want the team I am supporting to lose-I cannot cope with the rollercoaster of emotions. As an adult I watched the Maradona 'hand-of-God' game and the England penalty's games AND IT WAS WAY TOO MUCH FOR ME. However, as a child I watched Grandstand every saturday with my father and my brother and watched Match of the Day in the evening-I was able to explain the off-side rule to my girls! But I have to admit I was a proper girl and I enjoyed watching wrestling rather than the football though WWE today just doesn't do it for me-I would rather the boring TAG wrestling matches of the 70's. I am very much a product of the 60's and the 70's, something I discussed with Sno white yesterday. She had read about someone who had said they were a child of the 60's and they felt they were born 10 years too late and she thought of me. I think that too, I was born 10 years too late on the wrong continent- I should have been a young adult in 60's USA. Sno white said she could not have coped without all the technology we have today but I could cope without it. My blog is technology I use daily but I had lots of penpals in the 70's using snail mail and hey this in it's own way is my journal. I long for one of those mobile phones they have made in Japan for the elderly, it is light weight but the size of a brick with large number buttons and all you can do is send and receive phone calls. I'm not a Luddite when it comes to technology but I know I could cope without it because I know I am not too clever at coping with it-never was technically minded though I am ok at changing a plug and I do love my dyson. LATE UPDATE Some bad news I'm afraid family-Running man's sister died yesterday, She was the one who used to visit on her own from England. She had just turned 60 and as yet we do not know the cause, she always seemed so fit and healthy. Running man of course is devastated as she was the eldest and closest to him but I think that he would be the same with any of his family. Anastasia and Belle could you please e-mail me a card or words of some sort that I could print out and give to him, he would appreciate that a lot. I bet you she was up there yesterday having a right old ding dong with who ever was on gate duty telling them they were making a mistake and they had to send her back, I think I would have been pissed off too. I would be thinking I just wanted to be with my girls and I'm sure she was thinking she just wanted to be with her boys. Running man's aunt and uncle are both 90 ish and they are fit and healthy, they do for them selves and seem to have a good quality of life and that's how I saw Running man's sister seeing out her days-she was like myself, an independent soul who would see out her days wearing purple and her home would be the hub of her family. As I shed a tear Running man's sister the tear is for your loss, the loss of you old age and seeing your family flower. Having lost a mother, a father, a husband and a baby I know the pain of loss is bitter for the ones left behind but my sorrow is for what should have been.

{"date": " June 15, 2006", "body": "\nDon't you just love Beauty? She eats what she likes and is happy. Oh for the halcyon days of our youth, may they shine long and eternal..                                              Beauty eating Wotsits in Turkey                                             Beauty eating ice cream in Roath Park                                            Beauty eating Daisies However the halcyon days of youth are getting shorter and shorter.You end up being told you have to be something and for me it is the cult of the yummy-mummy - may the cult of the yummy-mummy soon meet it's natural conclusion because trying to be slim and the perfect mother and homemaker is way too tiring. Whilst I was doing nurses training I met a community nurse who told me about people who had certain eating problems that probably came from their social/cultural situation and she called it famine and feast. Usually(though nothing is hard and fast in life), children from less well off parts of the community grew up not having enough to eat because there wasn't enough money to buy food or enough education in the family to provide a well balanced diet-though I'm sure the reasons are a lot more in-depth than that. However, when these children grew older they learned that if they were hungry they could just get food themselves and as adults just buy it for themselves. These children went from under-nourished, under-fed children to under-nourished, over-fed adults and so their weight gained as they grew older. As an adult I have thought that perhaps my weight gain has been linked to this, perhaps it has but now I'm not so completely sure. I grew up in a family with very little money for the basics such as food-sometimes lack of food would bother me but most of the time I was fine and my lack of appetite was not a problem for me. I'm sure that when I was growing up that people thought I was anorexic but I can swear I never was. I remember wearing size 8 clothes and not appreciating it(I only wish that were now!). After doing nurses training and being more aware of my personal health I think a lot of my health problems have been linked to Hypothyroidism. As an adult, because of varying symptoms, I have had bloods taken and tested and a number of times the reults have come back that I have a significant thyroid hormone deficiency. Thyroid deficicency can cause fatigue, weakness, weight gain or difficulty losing weight, coarse dry hair, cold intolerance, muscle cramps and muscle aches, constipation, depression, irritability, memory loss, carpal tunnel syndrome, heavy periods, poor appetite - to name but a few but significant problems that I have. I am one of those rare few who can say that their weight problems are caused by a hormone problem-does that make it any better? Like hell it does, it makes it 100 times worse. I think that what makes my problem more difficult is that sometimes my thyroid levels are ok and sometimes they are not. I have had courses of treatment but never constant tretment and I think that might be the problem. I can actually feel my appetite decrease and then increase again after approximately 2 weeks. I find having a decrease in appetite can actually make you put on weight, I don't feel hungry during the day so I eat less and then all of a sudden my sugar levels plummet and I need to eat quickly to make myself feel better, result-weight gain. I eat a good, healthy diet but I know there are times that I eat too much of the healthy food. I want there to be a day, an hour, a moment when I don't think about every mouthful that I eat. Do skinny models help? not a problem for me-I just look at them and think,'you silly friesians'. Now what does get me is the 'yummy mummy' image, the media needs to just stop it. I bet they think about big bums, saggy boobs and their weight-admit it, they are real too. When I was 18 the definition for eating disorders only included young people, now it's everywhere-from pre 10 year olds to people 80+. Should I be bothered about my roly-poly tummy fat? Beauty loves it-she likes to prod my tummy rolls but then this is the kid who likes to sniff feet-ugh! I think Beauty thinks that I am a yummy mummy. How about a national holiday to 'celebrate me day'? How about 'Love your tummy roll day'? Or 'Quality Cellulite Day'? Or 'I have some weight on my face so I don't look ill day'? 'Forget the scales day' 'Food has no calories day' Or 'watch the tv for a day without asking''am I as fat as that'' day' 'Cover the mirrors in the house day' 'Ban celeb gossip magazines from the house day' 'Eat potatoes and bread day' 'Eat like Beauty day-whatever you like' 'What diet? day' 'Put a diet book in the recycling day' 'I never ever wanted to wear a bikini anyway day'-honest I never did. ANY SUGGESTIONS ANASTASIA, BELLE, SNO WHITE, ARIEL, FIONA? cos I'm on a roll here! All is quiet on the western front-neighbours of the not-so-quiet-kind (they usually scream and fight until at least 3am)appear to have gone on holiday, they usually go caravaning for a week. Neighbours of the-not-so-quiet-kinds #1 son is singing cheerily and appears to be spring cleaning or building something in the kitchen. These neighbours are very vocal and like to fight and shout constantly, their arguments are on a need-to-know basis(which means I don't want to know & I don't need to know). The problem for me is that if they are not shouting then the dogs are barking or even worse there is fighting and barking. Thankfully I sleep on the opposite side of the house and the neighbours-of-the-spotless- kind are usually quiet. Fiona started her first mornings work at Piano man's house and she did very well, we cleaned the lounge, the hall, the kitchen and the downstairs bathroom. We also swept the front garden and took bags of recycling to the council local receiving centre for rubbish and recycling. I also helped Piano man realise that his study could be cleaned before he had sorted out his paperwork. We cleaned and dusted every surface in his study and we filled a black bag with rubbish and a black bag with recycling, we took the curtains down and washed them and Fiona took the Dyson to the carpet. I am way impressed, I shall take photos. Tomorrow Piano man and his mother go to the hospital for physio so we will have the house to ourselves-to clean(or dump!) at will. Beauty is happily playing with her soldiers, they are all methodically placed along the window sill- it may not be the memorising of phone numbers but it is better than foot sniffing. We call them her strippling warriors-her soldiers of God(yes I admit it, we are truly mad). They are even stored in a tub like the ones on toy story. I almost forgot to mention, Beauty had her bloods done in school today and the minute that I got there she stared me straight in the eye and kept my gaze and I knew she was trying to communicate with me even though she couldn't say the words. I asked her what was wrong and she put her arm around my neck and wouldn't let me go. Her teacher then told me about the bloods. I wonder if she understands that they are not doing it to hurt her? Beauty does not forget quickly and it will be along time before they get her into the nurses room again-the other day when the doctor came to visit Beauty was not too keen on coming into the nurses room and I think it was because she remembered the last time that bloods were taken. But for now she is home and happily playing with her soldiers. For Running man's birthday I have bought him 2 polo shirts from Peacocks- they were \u00a34 each and perfect for running-each with ITALIA on them of course and a running backpack that is really a water pouch. And for fathers day-a polo shirt from Asda(Coryton) with guess what? ITALIA on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! well I figured that not all the Welsh like England that much so I didn't want him upsetting anyone so I thought he might like the ITALIA shirts-he may be a cockney but his dad was born in Italy and he does have an italian surname. Anyway what do you buy the man who has everything? He is like me, if I really want something I will buy it myself. I don't know if it is the heat on the road today but I have seen a number of accidents, the last one was a motorbike on the roundabout outside Pengam Green Tesco. Our house is lovely and cool but outside is very hot- we have to have the lounge window open so everyone is keeping an extra eye on Beauty so she doen't try to leg it throught the window-again. I hope the weather in with you Anastasia is better. Yesterday I forgot to mention that one of the blocks of flats has been finished-the top floors are cream and the bottom is pebbledash-it looks so much better.

{"date": " June 12, 2006", "body": "\n ANGOLA V PORTUGAL Last night Running man and myself watched the Angola v Portugal football match( let me knit or crochet and I can cope with most tv-unless of course it is a speech by Bush or Blair). At the start of the match there was a round sign/poster of some kind on the middle of the pitch which said something about fighting racism, great I'm all for that. However, a few minutes later the commentator goes into a spiel about the history of the animosity between the countries because of Portugal ruling Angola for so long. A few minutes later the commentator starts shouting about the Angolans beating their lords and masters. Well I was Gobsmacked, I'm sure the commentator wasn't being racist but he just shouldn't have said it. I looked at Running man (who is not usually into noticing deep and meaningful)who doesn't have a racist bone in his body and he looked at me and we were both shocked at what had been said. I felt like shouting at the commentator,'  engage brain before speaking'. Angola lost but I think Portugal were just lucky and should watch their backs. Funny old weather  today, it started off grey then sunny then rainy then sunny again- hey I'm sounding like the weatherman-true brit huh? Talking of neighbours not of the spotless kind, major hoo-haa as I was bringing Beauty home from school. Mother, father, son1 and son3 all involved in the street so I rushed into the house and hid-mother legged it off up the street!!!!!!!! I don't like confrontation. Watched Big Love, I will e-mail you. No real gossip-my compost too wet so it smells( see how interesting my life is)-Ariel went out with her mates-Beauty starting to repeat words as you say them(be careful Sno-White)-I bought lots of wool in different colours to crochet granny squares-after months of waiting council finally sorted out my council tax- oh I love my life. Beauty foot smelling again-why can't she just memorise phone numbers? Piano man's cousin stayed over the weekend, she washed her own dishes once and messed in the garden and commented on how clean everywhere was but that was it. Hey woman I need a bit of help here.

{"date": " May 14, 2006", "body": "\n 'Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people .'  Karl Marx If religion is the opium of the people then I must be a recovering   a ddict.It is sunday so my thoughts are turned to religion. When I think of relgiion I always think with saddness of this quote from  Elizabeth Barrett Browning How do I love thee 'In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith, I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints.' I think of the faith I had as a child and the pure joy I had at knowing that Jesus was born the 25th December,all those years ago.In it's own way it brought it's own mystical specialness. Knowing that made christmas real, not having large and expensive presents didn't matter. When I found out that Jesus had not been born on the 25 December it was like a physical assault that I never recovered from. I was 14 years old and it was the beginning of the end for faith and belief. However the search has continued for it but the major doubts set in when I did a history degree. I studied the crusades which led to the same links that  Dan Brown  found, the real crunch came with reading  A History of God  written by  Karen Armstrong(many thanks).  The circle was complete. In between came The Church Of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints (the Mormons),which I must add I am no longer a member of and I requested they take my name off their member lists.I love the website  DOOCE , I am not sure if she has left the mormon church or is just no longer attending church but her reflections on life growing up in the church and being an adult with family who still do attend is so like my own experiences that her website is like reading my own thoughts and re-living my own memories(apart from the stone washed denim covered furniture of course). I laugh at her blogs in the same way that Catholics laugh at Father Ted and black people laugh at Chris Rock, I may no longer be a member but they are still family(and they are persistent beggars who still 'want me for a sunbeam'). At times in my life I have been asked if you could have one thing what would it be, I am sure everybody has been asked this at one time. My answer is always the same, I want to go back to a time when I had perfect faith and never to lose it.I think that religion is a wonderful thing but also a terrible thing.I want my faith back but I know it will never happen because my mind now will always see it as too imperfect a thing to believe in. My mind is very straightforward, I see things very literally, perhaps that is partly where certain aspects of Beauty's autism originates from.It has been said that everybody is somewhere on the spectrum. Perhaps it is true. When I think of the beauty of religion I think about places like The Basilica in Valencia, a place I just happened upon once on a trip to Spain. We walked in to the Basilica in the middle of mass, it was like stepping back in time. It was as if nothing had changed in hundreds of years,the priest in his vestments,the incense and the beauty of the paintings and religious ornaments. I may love Brutalist architecture but there is a time and a place for eveything and The Basilica in Valencia is definitely a spiritually provoking place because of it's glorious antiquity. Now for the deeply philosophical questions. Why when the Tweenies are being filmed in their playgroup/studio setting are the characters played by actors but when they are fimed on location,i.e visit to the park, they are played by puppets? Is Jake really 2 years old? He's most intelligent 2 year old I have ever come across. Is it possible the Tweenies playgroup is really some alt ernate universe? Normal things such as the Children's act just doesn't seem to apply. And the answer is ................... Follow the way of the Bella and enlightenment shall follow(you can tell I was awake way too early and still feeling sleep deprived). Spirituality can be found in all things, not just in attending a church. Follow the way, whatever your way may be.

{"date": " June 14, 2006", "body": "\n As from tonight, when I go to bed, the computer is locked. Why? well other people have Brownies that inhabit and clean their houses at night, me.....I have computer fairies that use the computer all night. Computer fairy number1 is not too bad, however computer fairy number 2 has a'let's pound the computer until it dies' problem. I was waking all through the night to furious tapping. Who needs to be on the computer through the night?Maybe ambulance control, police control, fire service control, Samaritans, Pizza delivery-none of the above?Then go to your beds. Beauty just awoke, toddling out of her bedroom she came to have a peek at the computer to see if she could find the CBEEBIES already up on the screen, sorry Beauty, just my boring blog. I asked her what she would like for breakfast, toast or an 'East is East' breakfast of biscuits-the little sweet heart belched in my face-I know, a mark of appreciation of food-yes, if you lived in the times of Henty VIII. Beauty is not alone in her need to show her appreciation in this way, Anastasia and Belle however are the only lady- like children in the family who are not quite so obvious with their need to show appreciation. Sno white however would make a good nurse, whenever her marks of appreciation are criticized she makes the fair comment that it smells much better coming from her mouth and of course less painful for her(nurses are a very well grounded breed of people)-such sweet children. Beauty has decided that Wotsits are to be her breakfast of choice whilst watching Bill and Ben the flower pot men. I remember watching Bill and Ben when I was Beauty's age(different cartoons of course) but Beauty also sometimes watches Scooby Doo and they are the cartoons from when I was her age, that would make them approximately 40 years old. Still the same story line, Ghost tries to scare people to get them to leave and the ghost is really the baddie dressed up as a ghost and Scooby Doo and Shaggy who are very afraid, save the day.....again, and again and again. The Teletubbies are just a new take on that theme - you know- again, again, again-repeat, repeat, repeat. Less work for the program makers and the children love it- a win-win situation. Sad showbiz gossip Anastasia-Big Brother's Helen and Paul have split-they seemed so sweet together, well I hope everything goes well for them and they will be happy in the future. Forgot to tell you Anastasia, Pavaas has finished his garage/loft extention and it looks pretty good, he has also cleaned out his pond and the fountain is up and working again. The house three doors down from Pavaas is also almost finished-renovations look almost complete , it looks like a new house. You can tell it is summer, all the building firms and gardening firms are out with a vengence on Cyncoed road, the 'study' house extention is also coming along well, it is an extention like the one Pavaas has but is is the size of Pavaas' house-massive! The water tower conversion looks brilliant but still not finished and the retirement flats on the SCOPE land are huge and making an awful mess of the road. One of the new flats next to the synagogue is up for re-sale, the first I think. Watched Tracey Beaker this afternoon and played recognise all the places, one of the scenes was on the cliff tops at Barry. You know when you park in Porthkerry Car Park well you walk to the front and on the left is the Golden Staircase, well you walk up the steps and up the top is Barry, it is a huge field with houses on the left and the cliff top on the right and the path carries on into Barry. I'm sure you and your mate from Barry went up their many times Vienna as it is near her house. Beauty went to Margam park to day with her school, she seems to have had a nice time , I went with Ty Gwyn years ago when I was doing nurse training. I washed her very dirty beige trilby especially. Good news(or is it bad?)- trilby came back-Bad news-hat dirty again(Wotsit stains I think!). Beauty also came back with a t-shirt, her name on the front and the school name and phone number on the back- must have worked because Beauty is safely home watching CBEEBIES. Beauty was given a gift of a bag of soldiers today from Running man, she loves them.They are now lined up on the window sill, they are the small green soldiers from Toy Story. Beauty's uncle used to play with them all the time when he was small then he grew up to join the army cadets and he is still there as an officer-perhaps Beauty will be a general one day! Looks like rain so for the first time for ages  I am tumble drying, sorry earth. Must be a decrease in the prozac in the drinking water as Fiona is less than happy today, probably lack of sleep(reason enough to lock computer at night). Ariel is usually the one that suffers from sleep deprivation but she is in work though I am sure it will still be service with a smile. It seems that Running man's sister had a pulmonary embolism-my thoughts are with her family and loved ones.

{"date": " June 17, 2006", "body": "\n--------------------------THE GREEN ARMY MEN HAVE LANDED---------------------------  The green army men have arrived in our home and like the OOOD from Doctor Who they live only to serve. Their mission is to protect my window sill from the tribulation that lives outside the window and day after day, hour after hour and minute after minute they are lined up and re-lined up and re-lined up by Beauty to keep us safe whilst she sings OH THE GRAND OLD DUKE OF YORK. Beauty has not yet grasped that my radiator cover only needs protecting from her- and she has tried repeatedly to line the army men up on the radiator cover and succeeded in kicking the fret work panel in, she is my destroying angel. Considering the anti-war feeling that is in our family it is surprising what a military family we really are. Grandad was in the army (until he allegedly shot himself in the foot in the 2nd world war), my sister was in the army, I was in the air cadets, my brother has been in the army cadets for years and Ariel is in the army cadets and possibly wants to join one of the services and of course Piano man was a trained killer(well bandsman really) in the tank regiment and they have an uncle who was a helicopter pilot. But perhaps it is the families with most connections to the military that really know that fighting is not the best answer( although at times it can seem the only one) as they have the most to lose. I am against war and fighting but I am not against self-defense. Is that an oxymoron? if you are going to have an army to defend yourself then the best army is a professional army not a reluctant one. I read a recent news report which said over a thousand military personnel have gone AWOL since recent hostilities began. Scarey or what! Remember Toy Story 1 where Andy's mom steps on the soldier in the hall? Well I swear it was an accident! What were they doing hiding under the sofa? I was cleaning this morning and I moved the sofa and there were 5 soldiers hiding(why I don't know) anyway, I didn't see #6 and I am afraid he became unatached from his base. And last night believe it or not Piano man Beauty brought me 2 soldiers who I at first thought were broken but no they were somehow linked and I had to disentangle them. They were in a very compromising position! I went upstairs this morning to get a strappy t shirt as it was really hot and I was confronted with a mess of nightmarish proportions, remember I don't go upstairs very often as I sleep downstairs with Beauty, I found a huge heap of dirty clothes and towels in Fiona's room and a huge heap of dirty clothes and towels in my bedroom. Remember 'TOWELGATE' where Belle said I couldn't have found 12 dirty bath towels in her room as I didn't own 12 bath towels, well bad news Belle you have lost your crown of the princess with the most dirty towels in your room. I found 13 dirty bath towels and Fiona said they all belonged to Ariel, this is the Fiona who comes out of the bathroom with a towel around her waist, a towel around her top and a towel on her head(all bath towels!) and me with almost shoulder length hair I am able to manage with 1 hand towel. I am sure however that Ariel will say they were nothing to do with her, it will be a bit like the 'I found it on the stairs' excuse. If one of my girls is found wearing clothes that belong to one of their siblings they will say,'I found it on the stairs' and the answer will always be,' and that makes it ok?' if nothing they are predictable, they would make lousy serial killers as they always stick to the same format. Remember to pass on the message I gave you  to Belle from me Ariel, thanks. Remember Belle,'We are the world'. Brilliant news, it seems the baby my niece is expecting is a girl so my girls are busy, busy, busy crocheting and knitting baby girl things and it seems that she wants to call the baby Ruby so that also helps with colour choices as knitting with white and yellow can be a little tedious. I have been knitting a pink with multi coloured flecks blanket for a while now so it is good to know who it will go to. My girls are so excited about the baby, we all think it is wonderful and my sister and her husband and my two nieces must be thrilled. I watched Big Brother this evening and I am so shocked that people act like that, some of the residents remind me of Imran Khan. Once Imran Khan was asked about something and he lied and it was really silly to lie because there was video evidence of what he was denying, the residents seem to forget that the camera is watching them 24/7. I really like Pete, Glyn, Ashlyne and Richard. I think that whilst Nicky can get on your nerves a bit she is still very silly and very funny. Imogen, Lisa& Mikey make me really angry at times and I don't like feeling like that.

Even with my literal mind I never for one second thought that the 'fake news story' was anything other than fake.

It talked about his IBS and how his doctor kept him on a high vegtable diet(big mistake), whenever I think of this I think of this picture of him-wind filled stomach. I have IBS so trying to lose weight has to be very slow as too many vegtables can be way too uncomfortable. Being a vegatarian anyway doesn't help because when you have IBS regulating your diet until you have the perfect balance is a normal part of your daily life. Then add to that trying to lose weight! I increased my vegtable intake slightly yesterday with no real problem but I had that unstable feeling I had when I ate mussels in Bruge. Today I had some crumpets for lunch, they are low in fat and calories and they settled my stomach. I blame the media for my pre-occupation with food. Brilliant article in one of the gossip magazines this week, it was about Charlotte Church and Jade Goody and it showed pictures of their vuluptuous figures and it said that curves were back. If the magazine is being genuine, great but if they were taking the pi-- them I'm not impressed. I have a 'mother's apron' of tummy skin(after giving birth 7 times what can you expect!)  which I will never get rid of. I could pay for a tummy tuck tomorrow but why should I? I have had MRSA once and MRSA once in a life time is enough. Also look what happened to Olivia Goldsmith the author of First Wives Club, little bit of liposuction and she died, well no thank you.

RATS LIKE TO LIVE THERE TOO-IMAGINE FINDING A RAT ASLEEP ON YOUR BED FIRST THING IN THE MORNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AM I BOTHERED?                                                    DON'T MESS WITH MY BEDROOM Stan  laurel   of Laurel  and Hardey always  used to say,'that's another fine mess you've got me in to' My theory is if someone comes to your house and it is a mess, do not apologise, merely say,'I don't know who could have done it, we have no enemies!' and feign surprise. The downstairs of my house is fine, when I have just cleaned even Anthea Turner would be proud of my Dyson and my basket collection. The upstairs however is a different country-the border of that country is the top step of the stairs and the people who live there are people I do not know or understand. They are a strange race of people who never wash, never pick up their clothes(or wash them), their dirty clothes are mixed with their clean clothes and each day I ask for dirty clothes and I am told there are none. And then-one day they show up in my kitchen with enough washing for approximately six loads of washing after telling me the day before they had no washing. They have nowhere to walk in their rooms as the floor is completely covered with mess-when asked to throw it away I am told it is their 'things'. I call their floor their 'midden' but they tell me it is normal for rooms to look like this. Boll---s, the rooms smell as if a skunk has died in there. I personally think that their collections of dead food and dirty dishes are the perfect breeding ground for rodents and insects and spiders. Be afraid 20 year old of the less-than-tidy-kind, you may not sleep in any other bed in the house and your room has to be tidied. When Anastasia was in school she loved to come home and find her room spring cleaned, she didn't care what rubbish I had thrown away. Sno White is different and will not let me in her room so I have decided if the room is not spring cleaned then I will do it myself when she is in work-I will go through her room like a whirling dervish, ha! Am I bothered? Hell no! On to other subjects- Beauty has found her beige trilby that was 'lost' boo hoo! Barney lives and is  playing on the new video player-boo hoo hoo! Belle's degree results should be through any day, congratulations in anticipation-hurrah! I am poorly tired all the time but Beauty is so delighted to have Barney and Popetown back that she is giving me a bit of a break-hurrah! Anastasia will be home for a visit next week-hurrah! but only for a few days- boo hoo hoo hoo! Fiona smiled today so all is well in Zion! hurrah!

{"date": " June 24, 2006", "body": "\n HOME AT LAST The funeral was in Chatham but we stayed near relatives in Hastings, we stayed in the Seaspray in Hastings. The Seaspay is a really nice bed and breakfast and the people who own it are brilliant. We stayed wednesday night and thursday night and now I am totally exhausted. These are pictures of the Seaspray, the front of the B&B and the room that we stayed in. The room was very clean and very comfortable, Beauty was fascinated with the fans on the ceiling above the beds, she liked to lie on the bed and watch the fans spinning. Here are some pictures that we took of Hastings on our last visit, we went up in the cliff lift and these were the views from the top. Obviously the funeral was a sad affair but the 'wake' afterwards was very civilised and I felt was an appropriate way to celebrate the life of Running Man's sister. The 'wake' was in a motel and we spent the time sitting in a large function room or out in the gardens. It lasted from approximately 4pm until 12 midnight, there was an open bar and everybody was well behaved and it was a sad but pleasent gathering. In the garden behind the function room was a squirrel who kept tapping on the window, he was so tame he was 'chattering' away to Running Man's sister's grandson and it really seemed as if they were talking to each other. The guests were told off for feeding the squirrel! It was nice to visit with all the family. We left about 8.30pm and when we got back to the Seaspray  thankfully Beauty slept BUT only until 6 am-I love children's tv. On the way back we stopped at Runningman's brother's family business- they have an upholstery/furniture restoration/curtain making business which they run from buildings on a working hop farm. The person who wrote 'The Darling Buds of May' lived only a couple of miles away. The family have also have taken over the cafe on the site and one of their boys cooks and runs the cafe. The farm is quite a little community as there are other businesses on the site and there is also a large fish pond. The main buildings on the farm are used as a furniture auction house so there is quite a bit of business passing through. Beauty and I played for a long time on a grassy area with her toy animals, she loved it but then she started throwing her lizards into the fishpond-well I guess they looked like they belonged! Beauty also had her first ant bite and was REALLY concerned and could not understand why I could not make the stinging stop. I also spent sometime taking pictures of Beauty and the farm, whilst we were sitting on the grass I was just lining up to take a picture of a daisy and I was looking through the camera when I realised that the daisy had disappeared! I looked up and there was Beauty chewing on a daisy-don't you just love kids? The whole journey was very tiring but this morning Beauty was still up with the dawn. It must be a combination of arthritis, fibromyalgia and Dercums because my body is moving very slowly and painfully today and my jaw is hardly working at all(don't worry I can still speak!). Almost forgot, last night I took Beauty and Runningman to the Village Inn for a drink and a meal. We sat in the garden and Beauty played her favourite game of terrorising the other children so I had to go back to the house to get Beauty's ball so she would leave the other children and their balls alone. She had a great time eating all the tomato sauce and some Wotsits that I brought with us. I feel sorry for the other children as they just didn't know how to deal with Beauty as very rarely do children with Beauty's problems stay in mainstream schools so they not really sure how to deal with the situation.

Beauty spent all of saturday repeating everything that was said in her hearing.We had the window open whilst we were watching 'Supernatural' and so a Daddy long legs flew in jim kalisch/unl entomology and Sno White was good enough to shout, 'Sh*t, it's a spider'  and FCUK which Beauty was later good enough to repeat. She was even good enough to answer the question ,' Who is going to win the world cup' with,'Italy', of course we had spent all of saturday at her elderly Italian aunts house so she was heavily influenced by the Italian contingent. The 'Italian' family spent the afternoon at the pub and then at their house watching the England v Portugal match and of course rooting for the England team being of course more recently good cockneys. I was impressed that Running man wore an Italian football shirt all day and nobody said a word at the pub, I think it is because nobody sees them as serious opposition, however I think if he had worn a German shirt there would have been blood shed. At the superstore just before the motorway on the way home I did see a brave soul wearing a wrist sweatband in the German colours. What was nice about visiting the wilds of England was to see all their flag poles with their English flags and to see how proud they were of their country, I am proud that at the drop of a hat the Welsh will bring out their Welsh flags, hats, scarves, shirts, shorts, dresses, socks to name but a few patriotic things but it was brilliant to see the English do the same. Whilst I was born in Wales and my father was Welsh , I a m very proud to say that I am of mixed heritage and my mother was from England. On the way home there was also a motorway diversion at Swindon and so we were diverted down the lanes between the Swindon motorway access points. What a nightmare! it was sooooooo very badly signposted that we now know what Swindon looks like. But we did see DITCHES(last week a crop circle now a ditch!)-something I haven't seen in years and I said, 'I bet my girls don't even know what a ditch is'. I was wrong-partly wrong- my girls were pleased to inform me that they knew what a ditch was because when telling them to be home by a certain time I had told them that it was because I didn't want to find them dead in a ditch. However, they had never actually seen a ditch-they were everywhere in the village where I grew up but even there they seem to have been filled in.

I wonder why you would purposely provoke someone like Zidane when you know from their past record that they could attack you?

She is however playing with the new DVD/VIDEO player at 7.15am, I know for some people that is not early but when Beauty has been awake a few times in the night it seems early. I like to wake at about 6 am, take my painkillers and let them slowly kick in, quietly. However, when you have a 5 year old in a tiny lilac nightie that makes her look like something from Barbie's Fairytopia punching buttons ( that I still do not know how to work!) and switching constantly between CBEEBIES(The Koala Brothers), The Wiggles and Winnie The Pooh it is just too much noise and stress. I must be grateful however that Ariel is asleep as her noise levels last night were nearing illegal levels and Fiona was not helping, every 5 minutes they were yelling,'Mummmmmm, tell her, she's been on the computer longer than me, it's not fair!'. Give it up girls. They are 15 and 16 not 5 and 6. Alert-just had to get Beauty down off the Rose cupboard again! In the last few days Beauty has been very persistent-not naughty-just very persistent and  climbing the cupboard seems to be her 'thing'. Beauty can now count to twenty but when she comes to 15 she says fiveteen, she is a star. Beauty has now calmed down and is watching Lazy Town and 'reading' her colouring book. I am quite happy for Beauty to watch CBEEBIES or videos or DVDs but Lazy Town is just plain wierd! It is a children's program created by the ex-world aerobics champion and it is all about healthy living and it is set in a fantasy puppet land and in it there is Sportacus(the superhero), Robbie Rotten the Baddie and Stephanie the friend of Sportacus and they are real people and the rest are played by puppets. It is all about promoting a healthy lifestyle for kids, which is good but tell me why if Sportacus is so healthy he sleeps in his clothes? And Robbie Rottens suit is just a little bit too tight-now if a girl wore a suit that tight there would be complaints( from some obviously not). Witnessing Robbie Rotten's lunchbox is not a pretty sight. I don't think it is that I am a prude(for goodness sake have you ever watched an episode of the Hoobs-they are so rude) I think it's just that it is a foreign production so it comes across as different and when I get used to Stephanie's mega watt smile blistering my eyes first thing in the morning it will seem as familiar as Pauline Fowlers miserable smile(not that I would ever watch a soap of course-yeh whatever!).

When I was in University I could pass exams brilliantly but I never managed brilliant marks at essays no matter how hard I tried, this made me feel inferior to the others I was studying with because the only way to progress academically is by written reports, essays and dissertations.

Are the decision makers more intelligent than me and see things that I am not clever enough to see? I am definitely not clever enough to be a judge or a police officer or a politician, I just see things so differently to them!

It is 3.28am and the video is being looped by Beauty(I almost typed Belle, now that would have been wierd), she is looping the start of the Fun Song Factory, same music, same words, over and over and over. Remember  Barney (8 May 2006), well never again, I love the Fun Song Factory. Definition of the phrase,' Terrorist Action'- Five year old of the autistic kind inflicting sleep deprivation upon parent. Not only is sleep deprivation kicking in but I woke up yesterday with a swollen eye , some kind of infection. I am way too old for this. This must be kharma for my boring blogs of late. Well is it wrong to want world peace and to save the earth? What about greater gun control and harsher punishments for parole violators?(well it was funny when Sandra Bullock said it!) Ok I promise to stop. I can't find my camera, of course eveyone blames the fairies! In a week it will probably turn up on the stairs and no one will know how it got there. I wouldn't be surprised one day to find the remains of Jimmy Hoffa somewhere in my house and the kids will shout,'well it wasn't me, I found it on the stairs' and I will reply that I knew it couldn't have been them because A) the house wasn't built when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared and B) None of them have enough energy to get off their butts and fill a dishwasher let alone be responsible for the disappearence of an American Labour Leader with Mafia connections.( Now does that sound like one p-ssed off Mama? GOOD). No wonder politicians say such stupid things, they claim they work so hard and get very little sleep, well I know how they feel. Perhaps this is my chance to say all the things I was too afraid to say before and put it down to sleep deprivation, wow I would make a good politician. Lets see.............. Tom Cruise..........I don't give a sh-t about your kid....Who does? Tony Blair............You're false and play to the camera! Britney Spears.....For goodness sake wash and there is no way you are OCD (oh and  get rid of that useless husband of yours) George Bush........ I pray your God exists so on judgement day you can be found wanting and be punished with eternal hell (like having to live on welfare or a low wage). Trent from Pink Is The New Blog..........To be the next president of the US. Time is officially dragging, I thought it was 6.15am so I have put Beauty's fish fingers and mash on to cook for her to take to school for her lunch and turned around to find the clock said.............5.15am! It will be another 45 minutes before CBEEBIES starts BUT Beauty does like the CBEEBIES program preview loop that starts at 5.30am and lasts until the 6am CBEEBIES start. It will be a nice change.We now have,'I Can Sing A Rainbow' on loop, I can not believe that people actually wore orange canvas jeans in 1995 when this video was made. The most popular colour for trousers or jeans around here in 2006 is white! White! White! I can't keep blue jeans or patterned clothes clean with Beauty and my washing machine is running constantly. I hear a new video going into the player............Ariel-The little Mermaid, well the Fun Song Factory kept Beauty entertained for 2 hours, now that's not bad, just 3 hours 15 minutes to go until I take her to school. I love school, I think all teachers should be made saints. Thrilling news.........fish fingers and mash are cooked! My painkillers must be kicking in as I am having strange thoughts, I am having an overwhelming desire to clean out my fridge........back you evil spirits go terrorise someone who needs you like Britney. Yesterday Beauty came home with very sore toes, her feet are sore under her toes and along the top ridge of her foot. I thought it was something to do with her shoes so we took her to the shoe shop and bought her a lovely pair of well fitting OSH KOSH sandals, however I now think the problem is the fact that she is too big for the buggy and she uses her feet on the floor and the wheels to stop the buggy. I will have to tell the occupational therapist so they can hopefully hurry up her new buggy. St Catherine of Alexandria, patron saint of teachers. I thought I was safe, it was 7am and we were watching The Bear With Very Little  Brain when all of a sudden, just when I wasn't looking,what should pop up but The Fun Song Factory. I love The Fun Song Factory. One day when Beauty is older and watching some random fluffy chick flick or coming-of-age film, each made and acted by airheads I shall look back and see The Fun Song Fsctory as deeply philosophical and entertaining in comparison. But for now I pray for the patience of Job and the hastening of time. It is 9.08am and ALL IS WELL IN ZION. I took Beauty to school and I got her out of the car, put her in the buggy and the first thing she did was pillow her head on her hands and say'Goodnight, Goodnight'.

' We're worried ' seems to be the message from the survey. With the little money that I have I feel that my hands are tied as to how much I can actually do.

{"date": " July 17, 2006", "body": "\n Recently I have written about Superman, the unholy state of children's bedrooms and the red paper clip that in 14 trades became a house but nothing about the situation between Isreal and Lebanon. You may or may not ask why! It is complicated but yet it is easy! It is complicated because the situation is complicated, the situation between Isreal and the Arab world is difficult and nothing I say here would make it better. I read the opinions of the people who have commented on the internet and I agree with some comments made about both sides. So what difference would my adding fuel to the fire make? I write via Amnesty International, and on my own volition, regarding any situation that I feel is wrong and that I feel that writing about might help but most of the time I feel that no one out there is listening. I always felt that I had strong feelings regarding the situation in the middle east and I felt I was pro one side but when I probed what I really felt I found that in my head were a lot of ,'ah buts....' Here is an example. I do not like, support or believe in the priciples of the BNP but yesterday I read a newspaper article about a teacher employed by Derby council who a teaching union say should be fired as a teacher because the said teacher stood as a candidate for the BNP. The argument against this is the fact that the BNP is a registered political party therefore they are legally allowed to stand as a candidate for the BNP without it affecting their job. The council believes however that there are no grounds for action.........well thank goodness for the voice of sanity. The council says that it has a statutory duty to promote race equality and the consequences of breaching this duty would be 'emphasised to Mr Jones'. Ms Keates from NASUWT states the following in a letter to the council,'I am sure that you will share the view of the NASUWT that those who subscribe to a racist and fascist agenda have no place in the teaching profession' The BNP made the statement that the NASUWT's stance was, 'outrageous and disgraceful'. As Forest Gump said(don't quote me on this),'I MAY NOT BE A SMART MAN(well I'm a women actually but I'm refering to the smart bit, see blog entry dated  Friday 14 July 2006 ), so I had to look up on the internet about the definition of what fascism is and the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines fascim as,' A political philosophy movement or regime( as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralised autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition'. I am sure that this is not the only definition of fascism. But what struck me about this definition was the part which said, 'forcible suppression of opposition', surely to fire somebody from their job because they have stood as a political candidate for a registerd party is an act of fascim by the ,' forcible suppression of the opposition'.I know I am not a clever person and I am sure some clever person could run rings around me in a debate but I just don't know how one can be a 'fascist' and the other not. I always thought that if you were a Catholic, a Protestant, a Hindu, an Atheist, a Mormon, Muslim, a Conservative, a liberal, a supporter of the labour party, a pagan etc etc then if you were a teacher in a non-religious state school then whatever personal philosophies you held to you were not allowed to teach them in the classroom. Many of the religions and political parties that I have mentioned I know I would not want their philosophies taught to my children in school unless it was part of a politics class or a comparative religion class and then I believe that personal opinion is not allowedby the teacher. So why does NASUWT feel they have the right to discriminate against one political party when there are other political parties out there and religions that I know have policies and tenets that are just as scarey. As an example, the PM who is a member of the labour party went into Iraq  WITHOUT  UN support and subsequently how many civilians and soldiers have died? Does the NASUWT feel that teachers are suitable to teach if they support the labour party? The NASUWT cannot be selective in 'their judgements', if they are then they are discriminating. Are the labour supporters being advised on the need to follow the law and not promote invading non-aggressive countries without UN backing? If not then why? If Derby council is advising teachers who support the BNP to understand the consequences of breaching their statutory duty to promote race equality why are they not asking fundamentalist mormons if their beliefs regarding black people will affect their ability to promote race equality? Are they even aware of the views of the fundamentalist mormons? Is Derby council aware of the view of the teachers who support other religions who believe that only members of their church will go to heaven? Would this affect their ability to promote race equality?Justice is about justice for all not just about who you think deserves justice. Derby council are being discrimatory by feeling the need to re-emphasise to the BNP supporter about their statutory duty to promote race equality. The NASUWT comments about the BNP are discrimatory. The BNP are a legal party, if the NASUWT have a problem with the ideas that the BNP promotes then they should resort to legal means to deal with the problem and not stoop to discrimination. So here you have an analogy of how my feelings are regarding the middle east, we do not live in a black and white world and remember it does take two to tango\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.forusa.org/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/LedererPoster-lg.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/07/i-may-not-be-smart-man-but-i-know-what.html", "title": "\n"},

In 1998 he won The Turner Prize with, 'No women no cry', which had elephant dung attached to it and it was stood on elephant dung. A lot of people were not happy with it. He also p-ssed off a lot of people with his Virgin Mary collage which had pictures of genitalia taken from magazines and stuck onto the picture. I think some of Frida Kahlo's work is very cutting edge but I don't hear bitching about that. Not only do I think his work is brilliant but it is also brilliant because it p-sses off snot nosed artists and critics. Wouldn't the world be a boring place if all artists were Fine Artists, what a waste of ceativity. I watched a program the other night about the making of cave paintings and part of the program was about spitting the 'paint' onto the wall and causing a stencil effect.

As a kind of acid test, years ago I remember somebody sending in a painting their toddler had createsd to the Summer Exhibition at the Royal Academy. It was merely splashes of paint and they had titled it Monkeys in the Trees. It was accepted. You've got to love it.

Don't even go there with what I hear they have been feeding tigers, just accept that the lollies were red! eeeeeewwwww..... Final update on the Zdaine incident Zidane banned foe 3 matches(remember he has retired so he will do voluntary work for Fifa) and fined \u00a33,620 whilst Materazzi was banned for two games and fined \u00a32,170. the French say that the response is 'intelligent, measured and reasonable' whilst the Italians are bitching like a bunch of girls.

The worst thing is I keep finding sand in between my teeth! Yuk...having a sand pit by the back door doen't help. Beauty plays in the sand pit daily and the sand is now everywhere. She seems to eat more and more of the sand....and how do I know? Well I am the poop checker. Yesterday I sat with Beauty whilst she played in the sand and the mama of all bees would not go away and insisted on buzzing around a plastic scorpion(very lifelike the  scorpion) so I drained a handful of sand over the bee and he was off like a shot. As a child I would have been too scared to do that as I would have been afraid that the bee and his bee friends would come back and get me! And don't say they wouldn't because Beauty and I have sat and watched Winnie the Pooh many times and I've heard that bee laugh.....it is way scarey Health update The Doctor says that I must stop taking Diclofenac as he feels that that this is causing my major stomach upset. He has now prescribed me Omeprazole to help with the acid production. This should please Ariel as MY belching at times has been seriously amazing and at her Trailer Park party in August for her birthday I would have been serious competition for the belching competition.

{"date": " July 26, 2006", "body": "\n After searching the web I found the above essay that was written in 1994 and even though it is dated I still think what it says is applicable. Parents hate Barney because of the over exposure and commercialisation of Bartney as a product. Teenagers hate Barney because of the forced, standard, behavioural ideals that he promotes and because they are the ideals of the establishment. Obviously there is a lot more in the essay than that but it is way too deep for me. It is written with regard to the social history of the US so it doesn't really apply to the UK, but I feel that the points the writer makes are valid. However, my older kids dislike Barney because they think he is an annoying, insipid , pain in the butt. And that is without the social/cultural heritage of the children of the US. The writer of the essay however feels that little children love Barney so much that they would fall on a grenade for him.......hmmmm! I think Beauty is getting there. At the moment she is squealing with delight whilst watching her Barney video.....on rewind. It's the bit where the egg falls...over.....and....over.....again. UPDATE ON SADDAM He is definitely not at any trial, that is a double! Just driving home from town I dropped Runningman off in Llanedeyrn and I saw Saddam with a women at the bus stop opposite the catholic church. I wonder if George W. Bush or Tony Blair know? Should I tell them? Let me see..............nnnaaaaaa what's one more mistake!!! Beauty was awake at 4.30am so today has been a little bit confused, so much to do but so little energy to do it and the warm weather didn't help. Unusually for me I have been drinking lots of water but as usual I have been lying down a lot with leg problems. It has been a long hot summer and it is only July, perhaps it seems long because the weather has been so hot. Sleep beckons me but Beauty is ready to rock and roll as she had a nap.

{"date": " July 29, 2006", "body": "\n A burnt out car with a body in it was found in the lanes behind where we live(up Newport road from llanrumney and up the lane behind the pub in Old St Mellons then DON'T turn left to Llanedeyrn church but follows those lanes and you come to Began road). I realise that that usually this type of thing is usually people who know each other(I won't say friends!) but it is way too close to home to be nice. I know violence is not the answer but please..... I'm sure who ever was in the car would have have rathered wake up in hospital after a good slapping than dead in a car. But then being a product of a tv age(I know too much for my own good from watching CSI,Without a Trace, Law and Order etc) it could just be something like kids taking drugs, one dies......hide the evidence. Or husband kills wife(why is it always the wife gets killed?) hide the evudence.Kill Jimmy Hoffa, hide the evidence. Naaaa, Jimmy Hoffa is in my dishwasher, that is why my kids won't go in there. Did you ever see the film Backdraft and the hero rescuing a dummy from a dress making factory? It is probably just a dummy in the car(I hope and pray). When I think of what we have learned from tv I always think back to Beslan. As we watched the horror unfold it became the whole family shouting at the tv screen, from watching tv we seemed to have a basic idea of policy in a siege situation that those at Beslan did not have. For a start the local police should have secured the perimeter and taken the crowds back away from the situation. The relatives should have been placed in somewhere like a village hall and the guns taken away from the locals. And where the hell was the camera? Even Fireman Sam has his video camera. For that matter where were the fire service and ambulance? Not there until later. Who was in charge? We have always said that with her knowledge of tv Fiona could have done a better job. The news reports said that foriegn special services were to go in and teach a Russian elite squad to deal with similar situations, I know that this is good but teach the locals as well because by the time the elite squad get there the situation, should it happen again could all be over but the funerals. AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT... Look Mel I think your cute, always have always will but do you think it was clever to get caught and arrested for drink driving? You want to be taken seriously as a voice on religious truth then don't be such a nit wit. Do not drink and drive, ever, it is not healthy for you or the other poor people you could run over and kill. You want to drink then get a chauffer service, let me see you have enough money get your own chauffer! If you really feel the need to drive under the influence of alcohol(though why anybody would is beyond me) then buy a big  piece of  land  and  with no people on it, drive to your hearts content but don't  blame  any one else when you  end up dead. Just think about what you will do to your poor family who love you.

I tried very hard to get onto the computer to day to finish my blog but Fiona and SnoWhite spent the day fighting over who should use it and what for? Well SnoWhite was on youtube constantly and Fiona was on Avatar-I must be getting old as I understand the point of YouTube but not Avatar(definitely an age thing).

If the pain could be reduced to a dull ache then perhaps I could get a little more done. Earlier on this evening I drove Running man to a race at Redwick and I took Beauty with me so she could play in the pub playground. I wanted to park in the pub car park next to the pub playground-but I was told no that I had to park in the runners carpark by a snot nose girl who talked to me as if I was stupid. I told her that I was parking here because my daughter was disabled and I had a disability buggy. She then asked if could I please unload and then park in the runners carpark as they did not want to upset the pub landlord and I told her no as I needed the car to change Beauty and any way I was going to be using the pub. I also told her that if the pub had a problem with a customer who bought drinks using their car park then they could come and tell me. The runners car park by the way is a field, with cow pats, stinging nettles and pot holes. The issue was not with the the pub but the running club - not very disability aware I'm afraid. They didn't tell the wheelchair entrant to use the field or perhaps they did,I hope he told her to sod off(get it?). And why was I so stroppy? painkillers not working well at the moment I'm afraid, usually I take the abuse. Sometimes not-One day an old dear in the street told me that I shouldn't be parking in a disability bay so I asked her if she wanted me to give my daughter back because she wasn't perfect, her husband couldn't drag her away quick enough, I can't remember what it was that day-lack of sleep probably. Anyway, Beauty thoroughly enjoyed her time in the park, most of the time was spent dousing her self in wood chippings or swinging on the baby swing. Anyway she also loved the sea-saw but of course she fell off. Today in school Beauty would not move from in front of the tv so one of the boys tied to move her and they fell in a heap together and Beauty hit her face as she went down - she now has a lovely big mark on the side of her face. And we were only saying yesterday that at the moment she was remarkably bruise free-well that'll teach me. Fiona has accepted the offer of a summer job from Piano man to clean his mother's house for an hour a day, hourly rate plus a bus pass-sounds good to me. At her age I would have been thrilled with the opportunity. No news yet on Running man's sister but will keep you all updated.

I always feel guilty if I do not blog but Dooce never blogs on the weekend so I shouldn't feel too bad. In the morning we went out to Barry Island with Belle and Beau, Barry has changed significantly since we visited last. Barry Island was clean and lovely, whilst we were there they were having a volleyball competition on the beach. One scarey thing did happen though whilst we were eating a bag of doughnuts, a huge seagull swooped down and tried to steal a doughnut out of Beauty's hand. She was fine but hey I grew up watching the film The Birds so it scared me. The seagull dropped the doughnut and though I was frightened I was so angry that I picked the doughnut up and binned it. There was no way that seagull was getting that doughnut! Beau must have thought I was a nut job. The rest of the morning was enjoyable but thank goodness it was uneventful. We went on the penny machines and we won Beauty lots of little toys, I understand why Victoria Beckham doesn't like touching money as those 2p's were pretty slimy and grotty. We then went to the fair and Belle, Beau and Fiona went on a swing-arm type ride. The fair has also changed significantly, all the workers were young eastern europeans and the park was spotlessly clean. They all seemed to be moving around and working constantly unlike the young locals who have worked there in the past. They probaly need a lot less workers now that they have a workforce that is prepared to work. We finished off with a tray of chips and they were probably the best chips we have had in a long while. It seems that Mississippi is not known for it's abundance of Curry houses so we took Beau and Belle to Mujibs on North road to celebrate their engagement. The food was lovely and I really liked the interior decoration, the food must have been good as the table next to us was a group of asian/indian lads and they seemed to be enjoying the food. Plenty enough to keep the vegetarians happy. Afterwards we took Beau for a walk around the bay and showed him the sights, the most important being an icecream at Cadwaladers ofcourse!

{"date": " July 20, 2006", "body": "\n Bad news 'Textiles', I've replaced Jensen Ackles with another little hottie, is she cute or what? I've decided to change the background daily, don't worry it will be your choice tomorrow. Today is a lot cooler and that is good because I am not feeling so good, Remember Brilliant Brenda the lecturer from British Rail? I saw her on monday , first time for ages and she is still one of the most lovely people I know. Brenda is generous to a fault and I think she may have given me a nasty sore throat. She has been off work for  ages with a throat probem but I might just as easily have picked it up from one of the boys in school. I am having difficulty swallowing but that is not it!! I also have a serious stomach upset, Gaviscon is my drink of choice and I'm not even pregnant. Whatever I eat gives me heartburn but I really have an almost non-existent appetite., I also feel sick when I eat, everything goes through me faster than the speed of light, I belch all the time and my stomach is always churning(such an attractive lot of symptoms). This has gone on for about two weeks and I have a doctors appointment tomorrow. What little I eat is now followed with copious amounts of cold water and it is really helping, no water and I would be seriously uncomfortable. My clothes are getting loose around the waist, one small Pollyanna blessing. Will update after doctors visit. I am so glad that the Brits are finally getting out of Lebanon, I know that there have been complaints that other nations have got out earlier but they travelled by land. I personally would not have liked to have travelled the road to Damascus, physically or metaphorically. I feel for those who are leaving and their relatives as Ariel would have to study for a year in somewhere like the Lebanon if she did a degree in Arabic, the stress was bad enough when Anastasia was in Russia. At least when Anastasia was in Russia if you stayed together and did not go off piste you could at least had some damage limitation but in the Lebanon when a bomb is dropped on your head there is not a lot you can do about it. I wonder how many Hezbollah the Israeli's have got so far,  probably not a lot. Over the centuries it has been unexcusable to persecute the Jews and the things that happened to them was terribly wrong but what happened to them during the 2nd world war did not justify the stealing of the land of the Palestinian people. But we cannot go back. Each side should accept that they are religious people and act like religious people. Sit down together, call a truce and accept that the Jews should never have been given a land that was not theirs and move on. Accept that the land has to be fairly split in two and these religious people have to live together in peace. Yes Israel may have more money, more fire power, more political power but the Palestinians have a weapon that the people of Israel just do not have and could one day rise up against them- a massive birth rate. For a religious people that has been so badly treated throughout history the people of Israel have the opportunity to be the authors of something really good-PEACE. Religious people shouldn't fight each other like this- surely the doctrine of the Jewish people and the Muslim people is to forgive and live in peace?PLEASE.

{"date": " August 10, 2006", "body": "\n Tigger has been bouncing since 5am and is singing along with her DVD. 'I Hear Thunder' seems to be her fave song at the moment closely followed by 'The Muffin Man'. Perhaps if she listened more to songs like 'Rock A Bye Baby' she might want to sleep more, YEH WHATEVER! As the old adage says , 'There's nothing like an execution at dawn to concentrate the mind' or something along those lines anyway. A wedding in the spring(new date!) can certainly do that for you. Healthy eating has begun! Not diet... Bread and fruit for breakfast( bread to take my tablets) Weight Watchers meals with lots of extra vegtables for lunch and dinner Weight Watchers yoghurt for snacks Lots of water(ready and cooling in the fridge) Even the scales seem to be on my side as they worked properly for once and didn't tell me I was 5 stone heavier than I really am. The Weight Watchers chart says that I can lose 4 stone but that would be in the alternate universe where crisps contain no calories, I am married to George Clooney and there is World Peace. My goal at the moment is dress size reduction....I want to be a size 12. Another example of how I know Beauty knows what is going on........ At 9pm I got up to use the downstairs bathroom, Beauty saw me going so she rushed to get my shoes, thinking she was just being helpful I put them on and carried on to the bathroom. Just as I was completing my trip to the bathroom(all my dignity covered!) Beauty slams the door open to check I was still there. Of course I then realise that Beauty knows what time it is and thinks that I am leaving to take Running man home without her and she is not going to let that happen! I head back to the living room and sit down for another 15 minutes and I can see that Beauty's stress level subsides rapidly.When I call her to go in the car she is up like a shot and all is well. This kid knows exactly what is going on. Beauty knows all the words of all the children's songs, even the ones that I make up for her. In the car I sang, ' Twinkle , Twinkle little star, My mum drives a big black ......' and I left off the last word and Beauty finished the line by singing the word CAR. She's such a clever girl. In the end quite a poorly day, such an early start left me feeling really ill. When Fiona got up I was able to go for a lie down but with very little rest as the neighbours-of-the-noisy-kind were being Noisy. I know I didn't rest very well as I was dreaming constantly, it was like watching the film 'From Dusk 'Till Dawn' when the Vampires or whatever they are appear in the film and you say to yourself,'well I didn't see that one coming'.My dream was a long dream with lots of wierd things happening with no real connections...... the main part of the dream was me and a group of other people who believed that we had aquired an illness that would allow us to time travel and we wanted to be tested for it! I also dreamed that I ended up in a tent with Pet e from Big Brother and there was no sign of his Tourettes! How I long for deep rem sleep......... Finally I have finished my blanket for Hayden, I shall call it,' little boy blue', I have started my next blanket and it is in earth colours and it is for Beau's mother. Hey Anastasia do you think I shoud make one for the mother of our continental family?Let me know, no is fine but they do have cold winters!

Horse-face Grace has no shame and did not care a fig that she was boo'd excessively because of her behaviour and her nastiness, she just so wants to be famous. Even with the fact that she knew Ashlyne disliked her because of what Grace had done to Suzy, Grace still wanted to go back into the Big Brother house. I am so glad that I KNOW that none of my girls EVER have the capacity to be like Grace. I was so pleased that the crowd chanted Lea's name and were nice to her because she is very sensetive to the publics opinion. The reunion of Nicky and Pete was the thing of fairy stories and it was very sweet, very rarely does Big Brother have anything nice like that and it has been a particularly nasty year. Roll on the eviction night drama. My predictions for the final #1-Pete #2-Nicky #3-Glyn #4-Richard #5-Ashlyne #6-Jennie BUT as with  politics .......... a week is a long time. Remember Eugene? Well he might have won but public opinion was swayed by the fact that he took half the prize money. Heck I would have taken it too! No problemo. When we went to Turkey a waiter was touting his restaurant by telling punters that they had Big Brother live and when I asked who the latest evictee was the waiter told me that he was surprised that someone my age would be interested in Big Brother, perhaps it was my zimmer frame, inconti pads and false teeth falling out on the pavement that threw him! Or it could have been the fact that in a country where men are #1 the fact that I spoke to him was more than he could cope with so he was sarcastic to me ! Nah, nobody would b e that childish. NEWSFLASH SnoWhite has taken possession of her new flat and she spent her first night there. Her flat is very good, a large lounge with a kitchen, a fair sized bedroom and a shower room and SnoWhite seems HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY. Hopefully by the end of the week her room here will be empty and I can get to work on decorating it for Beauty. I need to plaster the walls, paint the ceiling and the floor, new skirting and radiator cover and hey presto.........finished!. HEALTHY EATING UPDATE My scales are still working properly and I am still sticking to my healthy eating. I made my pasta sauce with vegtables and herbs and it was so much better than the spicy weight watchers variety. At 11pm I so needed a snack(but I know I wasn't hungry) so I had a tin of raspberries in fruit juice and they tasted lovely and it is amazing how good you feel just knowing that you are not eating food filled with fat. I know they were tinned but at 11pm I was not going out to find fresh ones! My fave breakfast at the moment is grapefruit and of course my bread for my tablets. My mantra of encouragement is A SIZE 12 IS ME. A SIZE 12 I WILL BE Poetry is a bit basic but if it does the trick who needs Shakespeare or Browning or Tennyson.

I'm sorry.....Apollo13 or Supernatural? no competiton, Supernatural wins hands down. I am still considering counselling for SnoWhite, to get her through the grieving process. I however was compensated with seeing about half of the film The Peacemaker which contained my all time love George Clonney.....it is all in the eyes (oh and he looks lovely in his dress uniform at the end). Hubba Hubba! HEALTHY EATING UPDATE Weighing scales are still working perfectly or just plain lying to me as they continue to tell me that I am steadily losing weight. At this rate I will HAVE TO join a weight watchers group just for the thrill of someone saying,'Wow you're doing so well'. It is nice to feel some benefit straight away with the flattening of my stomach, all I need now are for my 'shot putting' arms to go(and then my upper body fat and my leg fat......well everything really!)My 'mother's apron' is disappearing and only the sides really still exist. A size 12 is me, A size 12 I will be. I always find the 1st week easy but by the time the 2nd week comes it all catches up with me and all I want is to binge on carbohydrates. I am not hungry now but I could devour a packet of crumpets or 4 pieces of butter dripping thick toast or a six pack of crisps or a full British breakfast. I love food. I went to get a can of grapefruit salad out of the fridge and guess what idiot here has done....... I went and bought the in syrup kind, oh well Running man will eat them( with all his running calories do not touch the sides and when he has fresh grapefruit he loads it with sugar, all I can say is yuk.I hate the feel of sugar on my teeth, I hate the feel of sand on my teeth more though and that happens a lot with Beauty as she loves to sling sand around. When I walk around the house in bare feet I can always feel sand.

No the really cool people learn the Japaneese art of T shirt folding. SnoWhite was on the computer when I told her the latest thing I had seen Anthea doing( SnoWhite mentioned that she thinks Anthea has too much time on her hands-I agree)..........Japaneese T shirt folding, so to keep me happy she searched Youtube for T shirt folding and we found a brilliant video. We then spent the next 10 minutes T shirt folding until myself, SnoWhite and Fiona had a basic ability to T shirt fold. Hilarious.......sure beats getting p*ssed and no headache in the morning. Pity I don't have very many T shirts and the ones I do have I wear to bed and Japaneese folding is too good for them and you have to iron the T shirt for it to work properly anyway and sorry Anthea even if you were coming to visit I would not be ironing my for-bed T shirts. And Beauty's T shirts are finished off in the tumble dryer and so I don't have to iron them either. I am sure that SnoWhite and Fiona however will delight in Japaneese folding all of their T shirts! Saturday night so I took the girls for chips, I bought Beauty her very own piece of fish. Absolutely no tomato sauce involed she ate all of it apart from a few really rough bits and bones. Beauty was totally silent for about half an hour whilst she ate. Any one who knows Beauty knows that her gob goes into overdrive after 8pm, you can set your watch by it and it can be almost impossible to hear tv or even yourself think as she chats and sings to herself. Not a peep, she was absolutelt thrilled with her food. I was happy too as I was able to watch The Transporter and Jason Statham in peace. Oh  my-oh-my he is gorgeous, I loved him in Mean Machine and Snatch but here the whole black bodyguard suit thing going on was amazing. Now lusting after Jensen Ackles from Supernatural is wrong as he is only 28 and he has this man/boy thing going on where you simultaneously want to lurve him and mother him whilst Jason Statham is 35 and my-oh-my he is  all man. Have you seen his kick-ass moves? He was also an olympic diver-he certainly has hidden talents.

I re-arranged the kitchen to fit the dry cuoboard and the Ikea white box shelf so the builders can get into the room next to the back door to put the door in between the two rooms. I couldn't imagine a more fun filled day! Last night the film 'F ire Down Below' was on starring Steven Seagal so I had to watch it( I love kick ass move fims). I was surprised to see the actor Harry Dean Stanton in it, he plays Roman Grant in Big Love. I was totally shocked to find out that he is 80 years old this year, I would have put him in his late 50's. He has a very weathered face but it doen't make him look aged. Sorry, boring day, boring blog! I really feel tired and unwell and my back and neck have been hurting really badly for the last two days, I must be grateful it is not the West Nile disease which Blurbomat thought he had. Lets just call it Beauty-doesn't-sleep-well-and runs-me-ragged-disease! HEALTHY EATING UPDATE I have been waiting to say that I have lost a whole stone and that I have reached 12 st 9lbs because this is a magic numb er as it means I will be 25 on the BMI, the top end of healthy. But our notorious, pain in the ass scales are not co-operating. Last night I weighed myself and it said I was 12st 10lbs and so I thought GREAT, next stop 12st 9lbs but no! this morning the scales say that I am 12st 3lbs..........no matter how many times I weigh myself. Now that means they are definitely broken! Last night I tried on a dress that I haven't worn in a while and it fitted me great. I have this really unattractive fat-back thing going on and now that I have lost weight the top of my dress fits brilliantly. I can also tell that I have lost weight off my face, I'm just waiting for someone to notice my weight loss. My children are too close to me to notice, I think I could streak through the Millenium stadium with a red dragon tatooed on my ass and they wouldn't notice as long as there was enough food in the fridge and freezer to keep them happy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/imagedump/12887.jpg", "http://www.crimelibrary.com/graphics/photos/criminal_mind/scams/steven_seagal/5-1-Steven-Seagal.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/000SCALES.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/08/boring-day-boring-blogsorry.html", "title": "\nBORING DAY, BORING BLOG.........SORRY!\n"},

I am so glad that I cleaned the garden last night as today I could not have managed it( and it is peeing down). Ariel had a Trailer Park Princess party in the back garden and as I have said before, anyone who has seen my back garden will agree, it is tiny. Due to the extension our garden is half the size of everyone elses, so we put Beauty's toys on the extension roof(house, cooker, car and chair). I don't know what the neighbours must have thought. SnoWhite exited the house via the back bedroom window and pulled everything up onto the roof(she loved it!).She asked if it was safe to be on the roof and I told her what the builders had told me,'you could have a party up there'. Big mistake, they wanted the party on the roof! It may have been a trailer park theme but Tescos sell a lot of Hawaian theme party decorations so we were able to use those, we had lanterns, balloons, streamers, alligators, limbo pole etc. Fiona cooked the cake, it was beautiful. Chocolate heaven, complete with maltesers and chocolate fingers! All the 'moose' came and Steve. And no Grace BB, you will never be cool enougth to be a' moose'! Highlight of the party...... 'Shoo' trying to kill the Pianata! Oh and the moose falling on the pinata contents (cool 16, 17, 18 year olds-it was quite sweet) and shoo counting her stash. Shoo's hair looked brilliant, more bayou than trailer park but it was brilliant. This morning I must truly look like a trailer park Mom, hair...pre-brush fluff, pj's-shorts and top and Khaki jacket(it's cold!) and flip flops! When we came in last night from dropping Ariel and SnoWhite off at their respective homes, Fiona put Beauty to bed, I found Beauty in bed this morning complete with sandels and jacket on! Fiona you are a star! HEALTHY EATING UPDATE First goal achieved, I am no longer 13 stone something but 12 stone something......hurrah! My next goal will be 12st 9lbs as I will have lost 1 stone AND I will reach a BMI of 25, which means that I will be at the top end of a healthy weight. If I look sideways into the mirror I can see that the weight has come off my trunk.

Last night Beauty fell asleep at about 11pm and I went to bed at midnight but sleep was not forthcoming due to to really bad pain in my right hip. I lay there for about 1/2 an hour trying to psych the pain out(ok it works sometimes!) but at 1/4 to 1 I gave up when I started thinking about morphine based injections. So I took my painkillers and crocheted for about an hour whilst watching, wait for it........Supernatural! Probably randomly placed to fill some early morning slot on tv, it was the episode where the Striger(I think that is what he is called) takes the form of a doctor to steal the essence of children. Sam, Dean and their Dad had previously encountered the Striger approximately 17 years earlier when the Striger had tried to steal Sam's essence. When Sam hears the story from Dean as he himself was too young to remember, Sam says he now understands why Dean obeys their Dad without question, and Dean's reaction, 'please kill me now'. That boy needs to get in touch with his feelings before Meg and her posse mess with them. I fell asleep after an hour or so but within approximately ten minutes of falling asleep Beauty was yelping for a drink, I was so tired and dizzy from lack of sleep and probably the painkillers that I almost tripped across the kitchen floor. All I could think of was if she awoke properly before 7am then I would be crying, she slept in until 9am and I really did not feel too bad. THANKYOU, THANKYOU ,THANKYOU. WHY ARE DVDs BETTER THAN VIDEOS? Because you can't play a DVD constantly on rewind! Yesterday in Asda(Walmart without the guns for the US family)I found an episode of Barney on DVD so now I do not have to watch that wierd little friend of Barneys coming down a fireman's pole  repeatedly  whilst on a journey trying to find 'blankey'! Also in Asda yesterday I found 410g s cans(tin of ordinary size beans can size) of strawberrys in fruit juice(not syrup) for 35p. For something to thrill me in this way it shows how exciting my life is! As part of my healthy eating I prefer to eat fruit for breakfast but preparing fresh fruit first thing is really too tiring and too much effort after sleepless nights so opening a can of fruit(in fruit juice remember...no syrup) is so much easier. Asda also sell tins of guava and plums in syrup, are they mad. I would love to buy the tinned guava, do they really think that the people who would eat the guava would really want it in syrup? I will reveal my weight on friday, hopefully I will have lost a whole stone. When I hit that weight I will also hit 25 0n the BMI scale and for me that is the top end of h ealthy. I stick to a an eating plan though I do vary the actual contents daily. BREAKFAST Bread- to take tablets Fruit- today a mix of fruit salad and strawberries LUNCH Weight Watchers meal with lots and lots of veg, yesterday I had carrots, green beans and mushrooms. I also like brocoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussel sprouts and swede. EVENING MEAL Sir fry using LOW spray Usually a combination of aubergine,tomatoes, peppers, onions and courgettes. Vegatable stock cube SNACKS No more than 2 weight watchers fromage frais a day *NEWSFLASH* OH MY G*D! 'TEN DE AD IN MOSCOW MARKET BLAST' This is Izmailovo market in Moscow. I have been there at least 2-3 times and if I ever went back to Moscow it is a place that I would love to visit-I am very shocked. I would love to return to Russia but this is just too scarey. We visited Anastasia for her 21st Birthday when she was doing her Uni year in Russia. We went to Moscow and St Petersburg and whilst we were in Moscow we stayed at the Izmailovo hotel, we could see the Izmailovo market from our room and we visited it 2-3 times as it was a minutes walk from the hotel. The Izmailovo hotels were built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the athletes stayed there and it was a great hotel with brilliant room service(bargainous). Only recently I thought the world was getting better and soon I might be able to visit Israel(well look what happened there!). Now it seems that a return to Moscow is not going to be anytime soon. So I'm going to settle for Austria, so Austria please behave yourself and everyone else just leave them alone. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/babybop.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/vegetable%20market.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/RUSSIANMARKET.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/russian%20hote.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/08/blessings-on-child_21.html", "title": "\n"},

However, Fiona was happy to confirm that the stir fry I make each evening fills the entire wok and would feed a whole family and I eat it all myself. Fiona was unable to confirm the bread, fruit, weight watchers meals, vegetables and weight watchers fromage frais that I eat in the day because she never gets her 23.5 BMI ass out of bed before lunch-time to see what I eat. I feel that even though the vegetables that I eat are good I do over do it a bit on the amount. I keep the carrot farmers of the UK in business, as long as it doesn't turn my skin orange though. The BBC continues to put stories on it's website about obesity and how out of control the UK is. I never cease to be amazed at what obese people in Asda buy, a lot of their trolleys are overflowing with fattening food and they do not appear to be worried . Whenever I buy Beauty's food such as cakes, quavers and crisps( low fat) I always hope that people don't think they are for me. I never eat the cakes but once or twice a week I might have a packet of Quavers or a packet of crisps.

And thankfully the worst insults they sling at each other are confined to who is the biggest chav! Totally insane, the lot of them. Open invitation..........we have found a Sing-A-Long-A-Sound of Music at the Parc and Dare in the Rhondda on the 21st of September, Sno-White, Ariel and Fiona are all up for it but any men who come along with us have to wear Lederhosen. And yes I am being serious! Did anybody else read that letter the girl in  Vienna  is meant to have written? I hope somebody comes forward and says it was written by the solicitor or someone else because it was so wierd, if she really said all those things then now is the time to worry. She seems either to have or is on the edge of loosing the plot and the letter is really scary. The letter is such a'legal'construction that a genuine plea from the heart written by the girl herself would have allayed the fears of most people. I also feel that the 'experts' need to have the parents and child together more often instead instead of giving the namby ass excuse ,'well she hasn't asked to see her parents'. What's wrong with a 5 minute visit now and again? Sometimes 'experts' create more problems than they solve. This is a photo of the buses that ply the streets of  Marmaris  looking for punters. They are cheap and efficient compared to the UK but they look as if they wouldn't pass their MOT . This is the type of bus that was involved in the explosion that injured 10 people, they pack you in like sardines so it is a wonder that people were not killed. It was a great holiday destination but it was a place that made me feel uneasy. It seemed to me like the hard sell capital of the world and the best time I had was going into town on the bus alone to get some money from the cash machine. I was alone and I was totally ignored but when I went out with Beauty and Runningman the sellers would not leave us alone. We talked to a girl from Swansea who was living in Marmaris and she said it is because they assume if I am on my own then I have no money BUT if I am with a man then I have money. I also did not like it that in the evening there were huge groups of men everywhere just walking around, they were clean and tidy but where were their women? Were they at home? Men and women in area of Turkey that we visited seemed to live separate lives and men got the better deal. Today seems to be a series of comments on news events so I best not forget the JonBennet Ramsey case and the suspect being released. Well I felt all along that John karr who was arrested was just a 'confessor' going along for the ride. What a sad story! I hope they find and punish the real killer.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/sleepy2.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/lederhosen.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/dolmus.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/08/best-time-of-day.html", "title": "\n"},

At lunch time when I have finished my weight watchers meal and huge dish of vegetables I have a wonderful feeling of a full and warm stomach and I love the feeling. I don't want alcohol, drugs or any other addictive substance, they just don't do it for me. My daily life is a torture becauseI cannot eat the things I love but I still have to eat. That is why I think obesity is a problem because alcoholics and drug addicts to recover have to stop their addiction of choice completely, me I have to take my drug of choice daily to live! Are fat people weak? Hell yes but so are any other kind of addict. Are fat people stupid? Hell no, not more than any other addict. As a hospital nurse I of course saw a lot of sick people(duh!) but the majority of them had certain things in common, they drank too much, they ate too much and they smoked too much. But we were there to deal with their accute illness not the other kind of sickness that brought them there in the first place. And do I have another kind of sickness? Probably, I grew up in poverty- not relative but real. Nothing in the cupboards or fridge so I couldn't eat. When I became an adult I was still poor so I ate what I could afford, cheap unhealthy carbohydrates but carbs are warm and comforting and give you a hell of a  buzz. So now I am addicted to lovely , wonderful, gorgeous carbs. I want somewhere to go, not Weight Watchers-that wouldn't do it for me, where I can stand up and say, 'I am an addict' and the people around me know how I feel. I will always be addicted to food, like alcoholics will always be alcoholics even when they have stopped drinking. A lot of money is spent on helping people to overcome their alcohol, drug and smoking addiction but my addiction must cost the NHS millioms of \u00a3's every year and not enough is spent on helping mea and people like me to deal with our addiction. AT 12st 2lbs I am a healthy BMI but I can get down to 9st 10lbs and still be in the healthy range and yes I will pursue that goal and why? Probably there is a little bit of Posh in us all that thinks ,'when your thin your in' and we want to be slim so other people will not look at us and think , 'stupid fat cow',and yes for most people FAT and STUPID does go together perfectly.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/bread.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/SWEETS.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/SAVOURIES.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/ECLAIRS.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/fat%20cow.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/08/why-do-we-do-it.html", "title": "\nWHY DO WE DO IT?\n"},

I love the Sound of Music , it beats me why Austria are not so keen as it puts such a positive slant on the situation. Poor France didn't get off so lightly in the films and remember Remains of the Day? Did you know that in real life they escaped by catching a train to Italy and the youngest was actually a boy? And the grand-daughters(I think) are a singing troupe and will be performing in the UK next year? Perhaps it is to coincide with Andrew Lloyd Webbers new production. I would love to go to a sing-a-long Sound of Music and dress up as the Mother Superior. Any one else want to come? It would be better than Minskys AND we know all the words. Anastasia could be Maria, Belle you could be Liesel, Sno-White could be Louisa, Ariel could be Brigitta, Fiona could be Marta and of course Beauty could be Gretl. If we were to invite the continental family then the boys could of course be Friedrich and Kurt and Mama and Papa could be the Baroness and the Captain( but I know that will never happen). And for the only daughter of the continental family the only characters left are nuns or the housekeeper and that's not much of a choice at all. HOWEVER, people also go as all sorts of other things such as the things listed in my favourite things. You know  raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens and brown paper packages tied up with string kind of things. Some even go all in green, they are the 'hills'.

Obviously the fundamentalists will say that Warren Jeffs is a martyr and he and his 'church' are being tested and they will also say that the world is also being tested and we will all have something to learn from this. So what have I learned? I have learned that the fundamentalist mormon chuch has male members who are just there to be 'married' to lots of young girls. A lot of these young girls have very little education, a lot of them live in poverty, have poor health care and many suffer sexual abuse. In the 21st century this cannot be right! I know the world is not a perfect place but the USA is not a developing country and these young girls have certain rights which are being denied them and perhaps the case against Warren Jeffs may highlight their case and the situation for them will get better. I feel that the tv show Big Love has really helped to show what these poor girls who live in the fundamentalist compounds have to suffer every day. If they want to live in their compounds then fine but they don't have to live there uneducated, in poverty , with  poor health and enduring sexual abuse. So I hope that we see some magor changes in the lives of these girls in the near future. Off the wall comment- from somone who prefers dresses and skirts, I do like those Prairie dresses that they wear. (I felt today's blog was getting a little too serious) On a less serious note. Yesterday I spent a lot of time sorting out the middle room and the back room downstairs ready for when the builders arrive to install the doors. When you go into the middle room the armchair is to the left of the door and the bureau is to the right.Last night, leaving the joining doors open, I sat in the living room watching tv and Beauty went into the middle room to play. When all became quiet I went in to check what was happening. I found that Beauty had climbed up onto the back of the chair, trying to get to see what was on top of the bureau she had tried to cross the door area by putting her foot into one of my bags that was hanging on the door. And that is where I found her! Suspended from the top of the door clinging to the top of the bureau, stuck! She is mad! As mad as her sisters because Anastasia did something similar when she was little. Anastasia climbed up onto the first handle of the chest of drawers in her bedroom when she was little to get something off the top of the chest and could not get down. So that is where she stayed and fell asleep. She was meant to be in her bed having an afternoon nap. But she napped sleeping standing up leaning over the chest of drawers! However unlike Beauty who was suspended appeoximately 4 feet off the ground, Anastasia was only about 6 inches off the ground. I don't know which was funnier!                                                                      ON TV NOW! I sometimes wonder about the sanity of the tv shedulers.

The amount of times that clip has been rewound and rewound and rewound in this house has to be in the hundreds. I kid you not, any one who knows Beauty knows about her love of the rewind button!

I don't think this will be over anytime soon as anything to do with religion is so personal to people that things like this are seen as personal insults.The Pope needs for the sake of everybody in the world to say he is sorry for any hurt he caused and to invite Islamic people from around the world to come talk with him and for them all to discuss their differences and put the situation to rest. Yes I may be an armchair liberal and want world peace but this is getting too personal, I may not be a religious person myself but believe it or not Anastasia, Belle , SnoWhite and Ariel all have boyfriends who are catholic. Catholics do not have blue skin or wear distinctive clothes or wear badges which say, 'I'm a Catholic' which means that we are all at risk whatever the colour of our skin and whatever we wear . I have just been searching the teachings of Islam on the internet and the way the are instructed to act towards each other is to show respect, love and care the same as in Christianity. Bad things happen all around us everyday and involve all the peoples of the world. Surely the bad things that happen are a lack of control of that dark space in the hearts of all mankind. When people succumb to that dark space they use religion to explain their actions, look at Jim Jones of The Peoples Temple and what happened in Jonestown, David Koresh and Waco and more recently Warren Jeffs. Like I said yesterday, PLAY NICE. My global village is a very small place and I don't want anyone getting hurt, especially my family and those I love. 2:30pm SORRY? So it seems that the Pope is sorry for causing 'offence' BUT he 'hoped that muslims would understand the true sense of his words'. I have read the full speech and it says,' whoever would lead someone to faith needs the ability to speak well and to reason properly, without violence and threats.....to convince a reasonable soul, one does not need a strong arm or weapons of any kind, or any other means of threatening a person with death...'. ooooooooh! POT, KETTLE, BLACK. I am sure that as Prefect Ratzinger the Pope learned a lot about the history of the church. I read the speech and there seemed to be no mention of  'violence and threats 'coming from  christianity or the  Catholic church. The Pope also described the emperor he was quoting as ERUDITE. I understand why the Muslim people are not happy. I see this escalating, they so need to sort this out now. Amazing recovery with Beauty, lots better. Both Moaning Myrtle and Vomiting Veronica seem to have left us and Beauty has had a few baby cakes and two slices of dry toast. She is stil very weary but definitely in a better mood. I am so pleased. Happily watching CBEEBIES and playing with her toys. She has had a little wander around the house but she is staying mostly in the living room, sat in the chair with her toys.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/moaning%20myrtle.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/hedgehog.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/world%20peace.0.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/09/we-all-live-in-global-village-so-play.html", "title": "\n"},

The main support bar has snapped so we will have to get a new bed. Last night Beauty slept on the sette, at some unearthly hour I opened my eyes to see Beauty hurtling towards me, thank goodness I opened my eyes in time and was able to move or I would have had a broken nose. She went back to sleep straight away, warm and snug next to me. Beauty then woke about 6:30am screeching for a drink, I don't ask much just a nice,'can I have a drink please?' would do first thing in the morning rather than assaulting my ears with screeching. I AM THEREFORE I SCREECH With a screech like that Beauty will definitely be well enough to go back to school tomorrow. I don't know if it is because she has been unwell but Beauty has been very sweet and very lov ely lately, she has been a lot more smiley and cuddly. Today my back has been really bad and I spent all afternoon on the day bed as my back has been swollen where the damage is. I lie down and the pain goes and the swelling goes down but after 5 minutes of getting up the pain is back. At one point Beauty came next to me and lay down and cuddled me. She kissed my cheeks and my eyes and my nose and I thought she was being so sweet and then I realised she was doing it because she wanted something. She wanted me to press the DVD button for her so I said,'Don't ask me, shout for Fiona', and she did, right in my ear! I am so impressed that she understood that being nice to someone got you what you wanted and she understood to shout for Fiona when I told her to( though not quite as loud!). Oh and it has been really difficult for me to walk today due to the pain in my back and my hips and Fiona says it makes me look as if I have peed my pants..... Don't you just love kids? Personally I think it makes me look like a cool old lady.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/beautybed.jpg", "http://espelhodesombras.blogs.sapo.pt/arquivo/The%20old%20lady_Bernard%20Safran.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/09/i-am-therefore-i-screech.html", "title": "\nI AM THEREFORE I SCREECH\n"},
{"date": " September 18, 2006", "body": "\nANOTHER STAY AT HOME DAY FOR BEAUTY Beauty is still unwell, she appears very exhausted and her eyes look very grey and heavy. She is still only eating things like toast and cake but she is drinking lots, this one has hit her really badly. Every winter term she seems to be constantly ill but this one has been worse than usual, she looks so much smaller and frailer than a week ago. She is getting lots of enjoyment from her video's and DVD's, her books and her toys but she spends most of her day sat on the floor, in a chair or in her bed. She is even quieter than normal, she still chats and sings but nowhere near as much as usual. I WILL be glad when she is back to normal, even with the constant noise and activity. Other Beauty News. On saturday Runningman said to Beauty,'Hello' and Beauty said,'Hello, how are you?'.WOW, I'm impressed. I know it is only learned behaviour but it is so encouraging. Yesterday Beauty was messing with the DVD and I asked her if everything was ok and she put her thumb out to me in an ok sign, moments like this are so frustrating as they make you think, DID SHE REALLY MEAN THAT? UPDATE ON THE POPE THING According to the latest report on the BBC website there have been attacks on at least 7 churches in Palestinian controlled areas and there is also concern that the killing of an Italian nun in Mogidishu in Somalia was in retaliation for the comments made. Turkey State Minister Mehmet Aydin said that the Pope appeared to be saying sorry for the outrage caused but not necessarily for the remarks themselves. The Egyptian Brotherhood, the Egyptian Opposition Group also welcomed what it called the Pope's 'retraction' but later warned that it did not amount to a definitive apology and would not be enough to satisfy all Muslims. A spokesman for Hamas which controls the Palestinian Parliament said,'We do not view the statement attributed to the Pope as an apology'. The President of the General Assembly at the UN in New York has called on religious leaders to promote reconcilliation. She has said that religious forces could advance dialogue, reconciliation and peace and help people embrace difference. And my opinion on the situation is LISTEN TO THE WOMAN-SHE IS TALKING SENSE   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/un.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/09/let-women-sort-it-out-you-know-you.html", "title": "\n"},

So in the day she seems better but in the evening her temperature soars again and she gets all poorly and sad and takes to her bed. At the moment she is watching Justin on Something Special and digging deep into her basket of toys and getting them ALL out. Don't get me wrong, I think Justin is the best children's presenter on tv but after an early wake-up call even his smiley voice is enough to make you want to follow in the footsteps of Elvis and annihilate the tv. Sorry Justin, we still love you and think you are brilliant as Jake in the Tweenies, Jake is our favourite Tweenie. We love Milo too, but Fizzy is too squeaky and Bella too bossy. Yesterday was the big clean-up day, Beauty seemed better so I put Beauty's bed back in her bedroom , spring cleaned the living room and put back all the washed and dried throws back on the chairs and sofa. But later on Beauty's temperature rose again and Moaning Myrtle returned and back out came the bed. Now the living room looks like a war zone, complete with Beauty's soldiers. Sometimes I am so tired I despair of ever getting a proper sleep again. The second day of Beauty's illness I left Beauty asleep in the living room with Fiona watching her, I went to bed for a nap and took one of the house phones with me. Well I literally passed out and slept for about 2 hours( a long sleep for me), when I came downstairs Fiona told me the phone had rung and she gave me a message. I was shocked, the phone had been next to my head and I hadn't heard a thing! I find that scarey because of Beauty's desire to emulate Houdini I have to be watchful 24/7 and I mean 24/7. After Beauty's two escape attempts I am terrified something might happen if she gets out a third time.Leaving Beauty for even a second is tempting fate, the other evening she was in the kitchen with people aroud her and she got into the fridge and smashed 6 eggs onto the floor. Thankfully she hasn't learnt to take off lids yet! HOW TO TELL YOUR LOVED!

Sorry Princess but even Shrek would have been unhappy with that mess.

{"date": " September 28, 2006", "body": "\n I LOVE NEW ORLEANS Belle and Beau got married in Artillery Park, in New Orleans at 3:30pm on Saturday 23rd September 2006. I am so glad I was able to get to the wedding. THURSDAY We left Cardiff on thursday morning and caught the bus to Heathrow where we flew to Newark airport in New Jersey. Security was increased due to the gel and liquid bomb scares but I didn't feel it was a problem and everybody was friendly and helpful. When we flew to Spain the January after 9/11 the security was a lot more visible with police with machine guns, the airports we flew through seemed to mostly be protected with security guards with the odd Policeman. In the US airports a number of americans got a bit shirty with the customs over make-up etc and the customs officers got shirty back. I was very good, I followed all the rules, carried only what I was meant to carry and was very polite-I do not get stroppy with people who carry guns or rubber gloves! We arrived in Newark at 21:50 on thursday bu t our connecting flight to New Orleans wasn't until 7:05 am so we napped overnight in the airport, there was no real point in getting a room for the night as we would have had to be back in the airport by 4am to book in and register. Poor Fiona was very tired and wanted to nap but couldn't, she would happily have gone home to her bed. Having worked nights I have no problem putting my head on a table and falling asleep. There were lots of night staff milling around so it was very safe, we spent most of the night in the food court where other people were waiting for connecting flights. FR IDAY The plane was about 30 minutes late taking off but I didn't notice as I slept through it. We arrived at New Orleans at 9:30am , the weather was beautiful and sunny. We met Beau's parents in the foyer, Beau's dad was wearing a welsh t shirt. We waited about half an hour for Belle and Beau to arrive, they had spent the night in Hattiesburg having driven from Florida. Going out of the air conditioned airport to the car park was a shock, the air was so hot and thick it felt strange swallowing such thick air. I started perspring-profusely! Beau's parents drove us t o La Quinta hotel on Camp Street in their truck. The hotel room was lovely with two double beds and the bathroom was quite a good size and a nice big tv to keep Fiona happy. After a quick shower and a change of clothes Beau's parents, Beau and Belle, Fiona and myself and 'Yuh Dad'(not yuh Mum thank you Ariel) went for a walk in to the French Quarter and we went shopping and then for lunch. We also had a look at the cathedral and the park opposite and the park where the wedding was to take place. Here is is a view from Artilery Park where Belle and Beau got married, we did think about a buggy ride but they were way too expensive. This view of the cathedral reminds me of cinderella's castle with all the carriages waiting outside. We had to eat inside the restaurant because i t was way to hot outside, I had a seafood platter. When you think of BABY SQUID you think of this baby toy, I can't eat a BABY squid. I had to leave about 10 on my plate, they looked more like baby octopus. I'm sorry, even in batter they had what looked like faces and I DON'T eat things with faces. I know I'm going to have to stop eating fish altogether. The platter was huge so I had to take the rest of my food home in a box and I had it for supper(minus the baby squid of course). After lunch we went shoppoing and looked at all the Mardi Gras beads and Masks, they were brilliant. We even found a ZOLTAR MACHINE in one of the gift shops. Belle and Fiona both had their fortunes told-Fiona is going to marry an Ogre and live in a swamp(just kidding) AND Belle is going to marry a handsome prince and live in Far, Far Away(Well there you go!). Then the best part of the day, we went back to the hotel and I had a lovely sleep. I was exhausted. AND THEN IT RAINED! SOMETHING WHICH HAPPENED A FEW TIMES EVERY DAY OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS............BUT AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME IT WAS GONE(UNLIKE HOME).TAKE NOTE WELSH WEATHER. At 6pm we had a wedding shower for Belle. Beau's parents provided snacks and drinks and party favours and I decorated the room with wedding bells and cards. As is the tradition with a wedding shower The Bride-to-Be put all the bows and ribbons from the presents in her hair and Belle also wore a hen night veil and L plate and then we  MADE  her go for a walk in the street all dressed up. We went to another hotel and had a drink in the lounge bar. Then we went back to the hotel and passed out. SATURDAY We got up about 9am on saturday morning and went down to breakfast, it was the best continental breakfast I have ever had in an hotel. Lots of breads, cakes and pastries and fruit and cereals. Sausage and eggs and lots of juices and even a waffle maker which Fiona tried out. Then Belle, myself,Fiona and Beau's mum went shopping for flowers and cake-chauffeured by Beau's Dad of course. We found some lovely white roses and lilies in a flower shop not far away in the business district, after buying them we took them back to the hotel to put in water to keep them fresh for the afternoon. We then went to look for a cake shop but many had not re-opened after Katrina and after buying drinks and pastries in a boulangerie(but no cake) in the French Quarter we went to Walmart and bought one. We did have a bit of a problem with the cake as the one chosen by Belle was slightly broken by the shop assistant when she opened it to ice Belle&Beau's name on it and the names were also badly done, Belle complained to a manager who told us to choose another one and we had it done again. It was perfect. Whilst in Walmart I bought some Winnie-the-Pooh scrubs, they are so cute and a pair of size 12 jeans that fitted me-I told you the Mother-of-the-Bride had to be a size 12 or less. Then back to the hotel to get ready for the big event. Whilst Belle had her shower and did her makeup I made the bouquets and the buttonholes for the weddding, the white roses and lilies were beautiful. Little bit of a problem-Belle wanted her hair in curls and down but because of the difference in electricity we couldn't get the curling tongs to heat up properly so I did her hair up and I think it went perfectly with the veil and the dress, I was still making the veil in the hotel the night before. We looked at veils in Cardiff and the ones we saw were quite plain and started at \u00a312 0 so I told Belle I would make her one, I sewed white crystal beads all along the bottom. We bought the beads and material in a shop on City Road and it cost about \u00a310 to make. Belle threw a coin into the hotel fountain on the way to the wedding and made a wish. When Belle was ready Beau's Dad drove Belle, myself and Belles Dad in his truck to Artillery Park The earlier  rain storm had passed over   and the weather was stunningly beautiful. In fact it was stunningly warm, the wedding was very beautiful and very simple. I of course had to take lots of photographs to remember the wonderful day. When they finished exchanging their vows lots of people who had been watching cheered and clapped. After the wedding vows we walked over to the park in front of the cathedral and took lots more photographs. We encountered a' jobs worth' who told us we couldn't marry there, we told him it was too late and Belle and Beau were already married and we were just taking photographs and he told us that was ok then.WHATEVER! Photographs of every combination were taken including photographs with rosary, horseshoes,garter etc. We then visited the cathedral and we all lit candles and I bought Belle a wooden wrist rosary. Progress to the restaurant was quite slow due to all the locals wanting to congratulate Belle and Beau and Belle and Beau enjoyed every minute of it. We ate in the back room of the restaurant so there weren't too many people, there were Mardi Gras costumes on all the walls. The meal was really nice, Belle and Beau fed each other wedding cake(sorry cancel that-they fed each other alligator-well they did marry in New Orleans!). Belle and I went to the restrooms(!) and we chatted to a lady who was very friendly, when we left we saw her later she beeped her car horn at us, her police car horn! Belle is sure she must have stolen the car but I think she was probably just some out of town police in for the  Saints  first match after Katrina. After the meal we walked the streets again to the sound of Congratulations and then we went back to the hotel. Beau carried Belle over the threshold and then they cut the wedding cake. Belle sang us a song and it brought tears to my eyes and it also made Beau's mother cry. A perfect end to a perfect day. SUNDAY Fiona and I went shopping and Fiona found a shop that sold wonderful Hello Kitty things and we got back to the hotel in time to say goodbye to Beau's parents. They were off home via Slidell and a night's stop over at a casino. More shopping in the afternoon and a take-away from Wendy's. I also took my camera memory cards to Walgreens a chemist  and got my photo's developed and put onto disc. I gave Belle and Beau a copy of the disk. We visited  THE BUBBA GUMP  shop and what a brilliant place, there were lots of costumes like the ones in the film. I bought a smiley badge with STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES on it. We also went for a walk with Belle and Beau and went along the  LEVEE  and into the  FRENCH MARKET  and stopped for a drink at a pavement cafe. MONDAY Belle and Beau's final day, whilst Beau packed Belle, Fiona and their DAD and I went to look at the  Confederate Museum  and the  WWII museum  But they were both shut. Belle and her Dad also went into the local Federal Building to buy stamps at the post office. I stayed in the park outside with Fiona and took photo's an cha tted to a dog calle Buddy. There are views of this building in the film JFK and of the park. When we got back to the hotel we helped to pack up the truck, took lots of photos and waved goodbye to the happy couple. The truck was festooned with balloons, JUST MARRIED Banner and Belle and Beau's names on the window. We had only just been talking about THE RUNNAWAY BRIDE when what should show up but a FED EX van, perfect photo-op. Later we went for a walk to see the  LaFayette Cemetary,  after 20 minutes walk Fiona and her Dad decided it was too far to walk so they went back on the bus. 5 minutes later I came across 2 missionaries, Elder Whiley and Elder Miles(but it could have been Mills) from Provo and Salt lake(aren't they all?) who showed me the way to the cemetary.Wierd place, like a town in itself. Very 'Supernatural'-SnoWhite you would have loved it. I was in the  Garden District  which is very beautiful with very expensive houses(I would love a house like that).                                         Very Spanish City of the Dead Later that evening Fiona and I went for our last walk around the French Quarter and we picked up a take-away from the shop next to  Artillery Park TUESDAY TO BE CONTINUED.........................                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/artillery%20park.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/belle%20on%20steps.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/rings%20on%20their%20fingers.jpg", "http://www.africanmarket.com/pics/full/t_ba.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/airport%20no.jpg", "http://arestravel.com/appimages/hotels/69/5069/description.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/no%20shops.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/buggy%20ride.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/baby%20squid.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/zoltar.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/no%20rain.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/wishing%20fountain.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/out%20the%20car2.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/out%20the%20car.jpg", "http://www.neworleanssaints.com/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/gump.jpg", "http://www.bubbagump.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee", "http://www.frenchmarket.org/", "http://www.confederatemuseum.com/", "http://www.ddaymuseum.org/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/not%20the%20runaway%20bride.jpg", "http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Monitor/1248/", "http://www.inetours.com/New_Orleans/Garden_District.html", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/lafayette1.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/lafayette2.jpg", "http://goneworleans.about.com/od/tours/ss/jsqsurrounds.htm", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/seeing%20ground%20zero.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/09/wedding-in-new-orleans.html", "title": "\nA WEDDING IN NEW ORLEANS\n"},

According to a BBC survey 30,000 men in Wales have admitted to eating a take-away daily.   In the words of John McEnroe,'You cannot be serious'.  Who are these people?- Where are they?-Where do they get the money from? The BBC x-ray program also found that 40% of families eat a take-away once a week. I am appalled by the statistics about the eating habits in the young men but I do think that the statistic about the families is maybe being seen in isolation and the program may give a clearer view.   I eat healthily, everything low fat, no or low sugar and no or low salt and I am a vegetarian and if I was exercising regularly(but I am as active as I can be) then I think it would be a pretty poor life if you couldn't eat a take-away weekly, however even then I would probably eat the healthy option. I know all these food specialists and dieticians would not agree but when food is your joy and life then there has to be some enjoyment. You only live once. I think that the difficulty in educating people about a healthy diet is that they do believe that they only live one life and some people do not have much to look forward to in their lives. They eat what they want, drink what they want and smoke as much as they want because it gives them enjoyment and what else have they in life to give them enjoyment or to look forward to and they know that one day they will die anyway. Yes people eat unhealthily, drink too much and smoke too much but it is not enough to just keep telling people to eat healthily, drink less and stop smoking, we need to go a step further back and address the reasons why they do these things. Oh I would make a good nurse! I know I could have been a chiropodist because I used to love taking care of peoples feet when I was nursing. I used to enjoy washing their feet and putting cream on them but NO way could I have been a dentist-way too scary. When we went to the US my feet were in perfect condition but when I came back they were in a terrible state due to ill fitting shoes, my feet are still covered in cuts. A week ago I went on the internet to search about taking care of your feet and my feet are now in so much better condition. I found a wonderful suggestion which has made my feet really good in just one week. At night I smother my feet in Vaseli ne and put on a pair of socks and leave them like that over night-my feet are now lovely and soft and supple. In the morning I shower and then put EFASIT Intensive Moisture Balm for feet on and my feet are brilliant. I also use a foot scraper to remove any hard skin. I have always had trouble with my feet being dry and having cracks in my heels but hopefully no more. The one thing that I remember from when I was very  young is that my mother also had problems with her feet, they were always in a bad way. SnoWhite also has the same problems as me but perhaps the Vaseline and Efasit might make a difference for her too. Perhaps my feet will be like these one day(I WISH)!   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/me.jpg", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6038694.stm", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/heels.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/baby%20feet.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/10/jelly-belly.html", "title": "\nJELLY BELLY\n"},
{"date": " October 04, 2006", "body": "\n The mornings are definitely getting colder and the scenary more beautiful which yes is possible even for a sink estate in Wales. Living right on the edge of a city next to fields and country lanes can have its advantages, I still miss the cherry tree from our back garden that we lost when we had the extension built. Anyone who knows where we live can however access GoogleEarth and see that there the cherry tree still exists in our garden as does the bench and the parasol where the girls used to sit and eat their lunch in fine weather(Yes Wales does have some!). Ah memories. I love autumn and winter in Wales very much but not that time from January until the first signs of spring, C S Lewis described that time after christmas as, a  DEAD TIME...A NOTHING TIME (I am not sure of the exact wording) and when it comes I want to escape to warmer climates. At the end of January we will be going to  Feurteventura  and I know I will only start looking forward to it once January arrives as I enjoy the time leading up until christmas. I think it must be the change to stronger medication which is making me sleep so much better, this morning I woke at 8:15am and as Beauty's lunch was cooked last night and she also bathed and washed her hair last night, we were washed, dressed and out of the house by 8:45am and in school on time. WOW! even I am impressed-the Doctors have been suggesting the change in medication for a while but I was worried about taking anything stronger but they certainly seem to be doing the trick. The  tumors (fancy name for benign lumps) in my back and neck have become very enlarged and painful in the last two weeks but the new medication certainly seem to be dealing withh the pain and I even think the tumors are reducing again in size-Brilliant! So it seems that local councils want you to  PAY-AS-YOU-THROW . I recycle everything I can so what is left is not recycleable by the council and they want to charge you for taking it away! My answer to that is to send all the waste that cannot be reycled back to the manufaturers or shops that you bought it from, in the post , with no stamp attached and within one week they will get the message and start to package or explore ways to package everything in recycleable packaging. The councils need to get to the root of the problem and not penalise the punters who do not have a choice. 3:15pm Beauty was crying hysterically when I went to pick her up, something to do with putting her cardigan on wrong but refusing to let the teachers take it off to put it on properly. The poor teachers were gob-smacked when I said this could go on for an hour or so, I think they were hoping it would only ever happen on their day off. By the time we got to the house the crying had stopped and now she has a tray of cakes and is watching a Mickey Mouse DVD. She still has the blotchy face though! Car drivers are so impatient. On the way home we got to the traffic calming device in front of the Doctors and Dentist and the car on the other side stalled and can you believe that all the cars behind started flashing and beeping their horns. Eventually the lad got out and swopped with his mate and the mate drove the car away, he may not have had L plates but beeping and flashing like that could intimidate many drivers who could have had their licences a long time. When something like that happens when I'm there I usually let the person sort themselves out (I may be cursing in the car) because getting them upset will only cause an accident. Accidents are just that, accidents because you don't mean them to happen. I was in the car the other morning and I went to put my foot on the break and my foot slipped between the pedals, how I'll' never know but I was going very slowly at a junction and thankfully the nearest car was quite a distance away and I had enough confidence to deal will the situation so everything  was ok. Beeping at someone with little confidence can cause the accident. This is what I want- Gold Crocs, on the way back from Newark there was a a Buddhist monk on our flight and he was wearing a pair of crocs just like these.

{"date": " October 05, 2006", "body": "\n A NEW ORLEANS NIGHT SCENE   Is this brilliant or what? I love it-it is a painting by Angel Turner Dyke from New Orleans. I love the colour in her work and I especially like the abstract way the street flows, it reminds me of the tarmac in Hocus Pocus when the boy told the witches they couldn't walk on it because it was a black river(don't quote me!). I also love the moon and the sky, I love navy skies with white slashes in them, you almost feel as if you could open the tear in the sky and slip through it. So...... on to more mundane things! I am so tired of the strife in the world, I feel that I m getting battle weary so for a much needed relief today I read  Pink Is The New Blog  before the news headlines, I love that boy and he can be my mate any time. He so makes me laugh. Oh yes, note on the John Denver YouTube, if my memory serves me right it was   FOUR days ago that I sent that and it has only now showed up!HELLOOOOO! Perha ps they were checking if I was a possible flight risk............ get it? My breakfast! I got back from dropping Beauty of at school and I thought I just can't be bothered to do any housework and I thought I will sit down at the computer straight away. Couldn't do it.....I am so sad.So I sorted the rubbish and recycling, emptied the tumbledryer, folded the clothes, emptied the washing machine and re-filled the tumbledryer and turned it on , collected all the dirty clothes and filled the washing machine and put it on, collected all the dirty dishes from around the house and turned on the dishwasher and put some pans to soak that hadn't cleaned vey well in the dishwasher and all in under 15 minutes! The house is still a  mess but now I can sit down for half an hour and not feel too guilty. And then I ate my breakfast, yesterday Beauty made cakes in school and Beauty will not eat them and the family are not too keen so I had them this morning. They were lovely. the teachers insist the ch ildren NEVER touch what they make so that's ok wit h me. What do you think of this photograph of Ariel? SnoWhite took it and she dismissed it as not very good as there was too much light but I think it is absolutely amazing. I think I might get it enlarged and put on the wall. I have a new addition to my 'favourites' wardrobe- these are clothes that can be washed and dried and not need ironing. I washed and dried the blouse that I had worn at the wedding and this morning I took it out of the ironing basket and it was perfect, didn't need ironing at all. Sorted-anything for an easy life. On to more serious things. The story about  Natascha Kampusch  the austrian girl who was kidnapped gets more and more strange. It now seems that at the time of the 'kidnap' Natascha and her mother had a terrible relationship and her mother was an alcoholic who was only interested in making friends who were wealthy. It also seems that Natascha's mother also frequented the same bar as Natascha's abductor and she might have been complicite in the 'abduction'. Neighbours of Wolfgang Priklopil have said how they saw Natascha a number of times and when they saw her she waved and smiled and it seems they went on a skiing holiday earlier this year, something Natascha at first denied. 'Curiouser and curiouser', no matter what happened this is one confused, disturbed and unhappy young lady. This is a sad world. My very own  GROUNDHOG DAY - remember the scene in Groundhog Day when Phil Connors the weatherman sits at the bar drinking with his drinking buddies? Remember how Phil talks about being in the same place every day doing the same thing over and over again? And his buddies agree that they understand because that is their life too! Well that is me too.I may have just been on a trip half way around the world but it is back to the hour it takes to clean my filthy living room. I once wrote about my living room floor having enough cake and biscuit crumbs on it every day  to feed a small country- well it's still the same. Today it took me an hour to clean the living room.

{"date": " October 08, 2006", "body": "\n OUT OF THE STRONG CAME FORTH SWEETNESS TATE AND LYLE  has been named as Britain's oldest brand with their packaging for golden syrup not having changed much since it's introduction in 1885. I remember the tin from when I was young and I remember how I loved Golden Syrup but be warned-It rots your teeth! I remember the picture on the front of the can and I remember the story of the lion. 'out of the strong came forth sweetness'-Judges14:14 It is the story of Samson's riddle and how bees had made a home in a dead lion and produced honey. There are a number of ways to look at this story. The lion who was strong when he was alive is now weak as he is dead but his carcass is home for the bees who produce honey, a life giving food, a food which gives strength but in itself is weak. Deep huh! you still with me? Good, I knew you would be. Another way of looking at it is a weak thing can have greater strength and power than an outwardly strong thing. The power of women is often underestimated, they rear the children and at times have greater influence over the child, subtly instilling views and ideals that a torturer could not instill. I would like to feel that my legacy to my children has been to instill values of equality, especially for women and children. I would also like my legacy to include ideals regarding fair play towards the earth and all their fellow man and when they do anything make sure it does no harm and to always search for joy and to enjoy your life. Therese de Lisieux  was a young girl who lost her mother to breast cancer when she was 5 years old and her father later died as the result of strokes in, she was a religious little girl who followed her sisters into the Carmelite order at the age of 15 and whilst she was in the order she realised that it was not necessary to accomplish heroic acts or do great deeds in order to obtain holiness and to express her love for God. She wrote about 'The Little Way', some people have said she was over-sentimental but she has said that she was not able to read learned treatises and be inspired but the Bible with single words having the ability to inspire her to find God and the way she should live her life. She felt that the way to be was through living your life simply and striving for a child's perfection. She rejected a spirituality that was obsessed with one's faults and the imperative to store up credits for a next life. Many have said that she sought to show that people at all levels could lead a good life and find God and it would not be difficult and it was not necessary to be constantly punishing yourself for 'percieved' faults but to be always striving forward with joy and a newness of spirit. And the p oint of this story?.............she died of tuberculosis at the age of 24, she had always been physically weak but her strength of spirit outshone greater luminaries in the church. Therese has touched the hearts of millions with her 'Little Way' and has been a great force for good and continues to be a force for good still today. Remember  Aesop's fable  where the wind said he was stronger that the Sun and they had a competition and the Sun won, here the Wind used all of it's physical power to blow the traveler but it was the passive actions of the Sun that won the day when the traveler took of his cloak because he was too hot. 'Kindness affects more than severity'. Mother Theresa  was a small woman with the frailities of health that ma ny endure, yet she managed to influence the world hugely and in 1999 was ranked as' the most admired person of the 20th century'. I do not agree with her views on abortion, marriage and divorce, funding issues in her movement , acceptance of poverty, sacremental baptisms, politics and care issues in her institutions but I believe that her capacity to influence the world was immense. As Therese de Lisieux said it is not necessary to perform heroic acts or great deeds to achieve holiness, I believe we do not have to be 'perfect' to do good deeds. Mother Theresa can be seen as the Sun in Aesops fables, the Sun that influenced the Traveler to take of his cloak. We are all Travelers and St Therese as an ordinary person influenced us with her Little Way to live a good happy life and the same with Mother Theresa, Mother Theresa was just an ordinary person who made others believe they too could make a difference. So who are my heroes and heroines? *Just the ordinary little people who live their lives trying to make a difference. *Politicians who when they get caught out put their hands up and say,'Yup, it was me and I'm really sorry' *Famous women who when they have had boob-jobs and plastic surgey say,' Are you kidding, of course I've had a boob job, it's brilliant,isn't it?' *Famous people who use their fame for good like Bill Gates, Bob Geldof, Steve Guttenberg, Paris Hilton(oops scrub that last one). *All the teachers, helpers and staff in Beauty's school. *The teachers who taught me to read. *My children who I am inspired by daily. *My mother *People who work hard for the minimum wage. *Beauty's child minder( a God send) *Volunteers *Carers *Johann Gutenberg-the inventor of the printing press. GUESS WHOSE FOOT? This is Ariel's foot, the toes or toe are probably broken, two days ago I needed her to help me to take things upstairs before the builders arrived but she wasn't too keen(a bit of a paddy ensued), when I insisted she flounced into the room by the back door and came out at shouting, 'I want to be on MSN' at a speed of more than 30mph and went straight into the tins cupboard. After 5 very painful minutes spent rolling on the floor screaming,'I've broken my foot, I've broken my foot'. I think Ariel was a tad disappointed to hear that casualty would not x-ray her foot and would only strap it and give her pain-killers. So I took her to her Dad's in the car and on the way I bought her plasters and painkillers in Tesco in Cathays. The colours on her foot are quite attractive in a Goth sort of un-dead kind of way.

{"date": " October 06, 2006", "body": "\n WOULD A 200 YEAR OLD SET OF FALSE TEETH BRING A SMILE TO YOUR FACE? LET ME SEE ! NO! These are the false teeth recently found at the St Pancras graveyard when work was being done for the new Euro tunnel station.Yes they may be disgusting but the work on them is amazing for 200 years ago, they were believed to have been made by the top Parisian dentist  Nicholas de Chemant. Years ago I remember reading a report about the history of the implementation of child benefit and how when it was first suggested certain people(well off and out of touch) made the comment that such a benefit would only encourage the lower classes to have more children. Let me see, would the promise of a pittance a week encourage me to go through childbirth and the years of child rearing? I really don't think so. Yet I read about a similar argument allegedly being proposed by a group of parents from Manchester in regard to the implementation of vaccine to be given to 11>12 year old girls against the human papillomavirus which causes  cervical cancer . The parents are alleged to have said in a study that they felt this vaccine might encourage under-age sex as they may think it gives them security against sexually transmitted diseases. WHAT! When I first saw the title of this article I thought,'Brilliant-I would definitely want my girls to have that vaccine' and then I read the rest of the article and I thought ,'Do they really think that young girls are so stupid'. To have a vaccine like that, at their age , all the possibilities would have to be discussed with them to protect the girls and the medical staff giving the vaccine. I would love to see how that study was done and see how the researchers got those kind of answers, what questions were asked and how they were asked. I thought health care today was supposed to be all about education and prevention. The best time to vaccinate for this is when they are of school age, when all the other vaccinations are being given. When do the parents in the study think it would be a good age to vaccinate for this? When they are 16,18,21,when they marry(I'm sure Mr Bush would go with that one),30,40 or when they get the cervical cancer! Let me see! I once read a report which discussed the death penalty as a deterrent for the crime of murder and it was found to be no deterrent at all. I do not believe that any women who had been vaccinated against the human papilloma virus would think,'it is ok now because I am safe', they know that it doesn't protect against AIDS so what difference does it make as far as thoughts about protection from infection go? Giving this vaccine is the perfect opportunity for schools to teach in the Personal and Social Health classes about protection and relationships. I'm sorry but I seem to be on a roll today about news reports, this one has pi**ed me off the most. I'm sure you have read this one, it the  Jack Straw story . He feels th  facial expressions are concealed and so the meaning of what is being said is not obvious. Ok, I can go with that but facial expression isn't everything if it were then the police would have an easier time being able to convict people. I remember when Anastasia was younger she was addicted to 'NEIGHBOURS' and every day when she came home she would say,'What happened in Neighbours' today and after a while it can become just a little tiresome so one day with a deadpan face and a perfectly normal voice I said, 'There was an explosion, everyone was blown up and the series has finished', now I feel awful for saying it because she really believed me and she was devestated and after all the explosions in recent years I would neverat the wearing of the veil prevents proper communication because say it again, However when she realised I was joking she laughed and said'you bi*ch'. I now have a reputation amongst my children for saying things and them not believing me as I do it so well. I remember telling them Scarey Spice was going to marry Edd ie Murphy and all they said was,'you liar'. That was true(allegedly) according to the news. I personally would not want to wear a veil of any kind and I fully understand that it is a social thing rather than a religious thing but it is the choice of the woman if she wants to wear it and if she wants to wear it then her choice should be upheld and supported. In Iraq after the fall of Saddam more Burqas were sold than ever before because the women were able to go out more and choose their own. Jack Straw is sending out the message that he would be happier if the women who visited him at his constituencey office removed their veil when talking to him. Has he thought that this might prevent women attending his office as these women may feel that they might lose respect in their community if they are known to have removed their veil in front of a man. Even just being seen attending his office may make people assume that they have removed their veil even if they haven't. So what are they to do? Still trying to save money on meals, this one has vege mince and vegetables inside and I loved it. I don't care what anyone else thinks, I thought it was brilliant with gravy. I also made sundried tomato and parmesan cheese bread. THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!

As a five year old I went out with a neighbor to collect money, the National Coal Board and the Treasury stole from THAT money to clear up their SHIT. BASTARD'S. 30 years later they were guilt tripped into giving it back-minus interest. Pretty good interest for a loan over 30 years. THIEVING BASTARDS.

Well back to the early morning housework. I would like to say t hat I am busy cleaning the house in preparation for Diwali but I am not! At the moment I am still cleaning up after the builders and the PAINTER MAN! For the Hindu New Year homes are cleaned to welcome in the new year and windows are opened so that the Hindu goddess of prosperity Lakshmi can enter, it is also believed that she cannot enter a house that is not lit up.so every household burns special clay lamps called DIYAS to light the way for the goddess, which is why the celebration is known as the Festival of Lights. Today we are going to look for all our twinkle lights and put them up. Due to the increase of the importance of celebrating Halloween the decorating for Christmas has in recent years been pushed back further and further into November, something I and many people feel strongly about. Many people expressed their dislike for the way that shops like ASDA started putting out their Christmas Cards and Christma s sweets from AUGUST-give us a break! This is something that is not done as much now but they still had Christmas cake out in September! What are they thinking? Or perhaps they are just not thinking!

The day has started early with Beauty watching 'DORA THE EXPLORER', which means singing, dancing, counting and learning Spanish! She was awake at 4:30am which is waaaaay to early. At least I must be grateful that it isn't POPCORN POPPING ON THE APRICOT TREE ! Beauty has also tipped ALL her toys on the floor so there is no walking space.........Am I bothered? Heck no, there is still room to sleep(if  she would let me!). Beauty is also playing with her army of soldiers, her army are less bored as they now have trees, bushes, tanks and armored vehicles to practice their maneuvers with, oh and a missile on the back of a truck. If Beauty is happy, her army are happy then I am happy. AN AID FOR THOSE POOR  'EARBASHED'  DOCTORS EVERYWHERE When I did my nurses training I learnt my quotes off by heart for my final exams, the only one that I remember very well is, 'Pain is what the patient says it is'. 25 years ago when visiting a doctor who looked about 60 years old I remember thinking that he had trained in the early 50's and I remember thinking that doctors need to up-date their education regularly. Now they are and they also have the internet to use as a diagnostic tool but I still understand that the are only 'best-guessers' from their personal experience and what they can glean from the internet, reading books and up-dating courses. The BBC Health Reporter Jane Elliot has an article on the BBC website which talks about her trying out an arthritis simulation suit. She talks about how she felt after wearing the suit,'she felt great relief' at not wearing it anymore, she tells how she had a short glimpse into the pain of arthritis. I truly feel guilt when I go to the doctor and talk about pain to the doctor, something intangible. Some days I have to lie down all day as my lumps, joints and the damage in my back are so painful-I only go to the doctors when I have to but hey....they see the walking, talking, smiling me that is putting on a brave face so how can they possibly know how bad or real the pain is? A suit like this could be a good thing. PUPILS ZIG-ZAG PARKING PROTEST I have not encountered a school at hometime or first thing in the morning that does not have parking problems. There may be schools with no problems but it is just that I have not seen them. I have always felt that to deal with the school parking problems you need to educate the children who will educate the parents. There are two church schools close to where I live, one I refuse to go past first thing in the morning as the parents have suicidal tendencies due to their desire to get where they are going on time. The other school which I think have always been quite well behaved seem to have a constant police presence and the parking is now perfect, it is just the mothers with buggies who seem to want to hurtle themselves at my ca r without looking.

{"date": " October 15, 2006", "body": "\nHeadline on the BBC website questions whether MINISTER  'RECKLESS'  OVER VEIL ROW. I personally think that the situation has got out of hand and the school has not dealt with the situation professionally. Instead of asking the teachers aide to remove her veil they should have first tried to deal with the situation as it was, the class teacher should have had a private conversation with the teachers aide and explained the problem. Then they should have discussed ways to deal with the situation and then they should have discussed how the teachers aide could speak louder and more clearly-I am sure that the teachers aide would not have had a problem with that. When I was teaching English as a Foreign Language I never had a problem understanding women who were wearing a veil, obviously I didn't teach all the women in the world who wear a veil but of those that I did there was not a problem. I have more problems understanding Fiona who barely moves her lips when she talks and she doesn't wear a veil. It is definitely poor management skills on the part of the school if they think the only answer is for the teachers aide to re move her veil. Runningman ran the  Cardiff half marathon  today and raised just over\u00a3700 for Beauty's school, I am sure that they will be pleased. I am impressed with anyone who can run that kind of distance-especially for charity. Today I have felt 'proper poorly', headache, leth argy, joints and lumps hurting and lack of appetite and Beauty of course has been her usual hyper, happy self. She has been pinging of the ceiling and watching  FRAGGLE ROCK  over and over again. I couldn't cope with her basket of puzzle pieces and picture cards(there are hundreds of pieces and cards) and she likes to look at each card and piece and then throw them on the floor. So I collected them up and the basket is locked in the video cupboard and she is happily playing with her army of little green soldiers. The floor is now safer to walk across but when the DVD momentarily gets stuck Beauty shouts very loudly at the DVD player which is not that wonderful when you have a headache, Due to my feeling 'proper poorly' I have been lying on the sette, either sleep ing or reading. I am reading the latest P D James novel  The Lighthouse  It is very good, it is set on an imaginary island off Cornwall  in the Bristol Channel, however it reminds me so much of  Lundy  and I have always wanted to stay in one of the  houses  there. The story is about an alleged suicide which turns out to be a murder and is being investigated by Adam Dalglish from Scotland Yard. He is investigating because some high powered politicians had planned to stay on the island in a few months and this alleged suicide questions the safety of the island. One of the suspects at the moment is a German doctor(predictable!) whose father disappeared close by in the second world war, or a long term resident in her 80's(yeah whatever!) or the victims daughter because her father did not approve of who she wanted to marry(possible), anyway, we shall see. I love the work of P D James, I think she is a brilliant writer.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6053298.stm", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/marathon.jpg", "http://www.cardiffmarathon.org/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/fraggles.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraggle_Rock", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/pdjames.jpg", "http://www.randomhouse.com/features/pdjames/lighthouse.html", "www.lundyisland.co.uk", "http://www.lundyisland.co.uk/", "http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/otherOptions/lundy.htm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/10/is-world-going-mad.html", "title": "\nIS THE WORLD GOING MAD?\n"},

My day was spent entertaining Beauty as I couldn't get the video/DVD player to work, some idiot(probably me) had pulled the scart plug out. It took until 10pm to figure this out so when we figured it out she calmed down and watched the Ice age 2 DVD-we were all so pleased. At 7pm we all went over to Burger king to party and we all had a brilliant time.

I have read Lord of the Rings a number of times but even when I was a lot younger I had difficulty with the book as it was so long. The problem was my memory and I couldn't remember who was who in the sense of battles and locations so I would have to take notes and even then I was lost and as the years have passed it has got worse. Now an ordinary length novel and who is who with the characters confuses me and I am always looking back to the introduction of the characters. I have a degree in Welsh Studies and Welsh History and in the Welsh Studies part I read and analysed a lot of literature (like you did in your English degree Belle) but it would be a lot more difficult for me to study it today but then there is the possibility that exercising my brain would actually increase my memory power. But surely my two years of a masters degree should have done that? Oh well who knows how a brain really works, perhaps I should get one of those Brain Gym type books and see if I can increase my memory and brain capabilities........just don't ask me to do Sudoku as I just don't have the patience. DINING ROOM UPDATE Well the reason Gollum is chowing down on my neck is because I artex painted all the walls and ceiling and painted all the walls, today I shall paint the ceiling and buy and fitted a carpet and then we will be done.

They say I am just over 11 stone. I am so tired with Beauty that the extent of my cooking is a weight watchers meal and lots of vegetables so perhaps that is helping with the weight loss. I like ocean pie and vegetable chili best. I have been invited to a Christmas dinner and the meals options are quite entertaining. The vegetarian option is a tartlet with lots of cooked cheese so that is out for my unpredictable stomach but the vegan option sounds good.It is a  TIAN OF ROASTED MEDITERRANEAN VEGETABLES ON NEW POTATOES WITH ESSENCE OF RED PEPPER  let me save you the time of hitting the dictionary for Tian, from recipes and pictures I have looked at it means a PILE of vegetables in this case and as for ESSENCE, after many years of doing waitressing I couldn't even begin to imagine what ESSENCE stands for. It seems that menus have moved on considerably since I last worked as a waitress, when I last worked there was a backlash against poncy minimalist fo od and there were things such as bread and butter pudding on the menu and the punters loved it. Last year the Christmas meal was at the Millennium stadium and the food was fantastic, the Sushi starter was stunning and the vegetarian option actually had some taste to it. The year before was a meal at the CIA and I kid you not but the salmon tasted like it had been standing waiting to be served for two days and the green mush was meant to be vegetables BUT it didn't affect my diet in the slightest as my sensitive  stomach barely got home before it protested violently! I would NEVER eat at the Park Hotel as I have too many memories of a foul, stinking kitchen and staff who didn't care. The Angel was good but I have never seen the kitchen and the Hilton Christmas meal was plated with 3 roast potatoes, 4 sprouts, 5 carrots, a 'coin' of stuffing, a dot of cranberry sauce and pressed(yes pressed) turkey with a spoonful of gravey and all for \u00a325 and this was in 2000- I hope it has improved since!

Trench  coats are optional but recommended only if you live in a very cold place. If you live someplace warm, but really love that trenchcoat, cut off the sleeves.

And in the dream I had a life size blow up double decker bus that really worked(see how long that would last around here?) Trench coats are ok if you don't wear them into a convenience store in the French Quarter in New Orleans on a dark, wet September night.  And why ? I hear you ask, the answer is simple because idiot here watches too many US crime shows and assumes that anyone wearing a trench coat must be a criminal with guns under their coats. So when I am in a convenience store in the French Quarter in New Orleans on a wet September night(as I was) and I see two lads wearing trench coats guess what I think? IDIOT!

{"date": " November 27, 2006", "body": "\n  Russian mystery ignites message boards Have you read this article on the BBC website? But such speculation has raised the ire of Russian contributors to Have Your Say. The following is an extract......... \"Russia is no longer a wild country and we don't need to kill anyone, especia lly the 'enemies' of this  country, \" says Nora from St. Petersburg. I  was really puzzled at the way the British media covered this and at how people have reacted.  Larissa Sazolonova Many see an anti-Russian agenda in the reporting of the affair and ignorance on the part of message board posters from around the world. So they have flocked to the forums to launch their corrective. Ivan Obzherin in Russia is eager to point out what he sees as a cruel irony of the situation. \"  People accusing someone else without proof, trusting in everything that is written in newspapers - isn't that from Russian history, from the times of Stalin? Oh, no! That now happens in modern Western countries. I was very surprised to see that...\" When we went to Russia when Beauty was about 2 we discussed the fall of the Rommanovs with our tour guide in St Petersburg, the university  educated tour guide had a very different view to what had happened to what I had learned in history and I felt it polite to agree and not argue the situation. When I got home I checked what I had learned and it appeared to be accepted by the rest of the world but Russia. One of the above writers said that Russia was not a ' wild country'  but in many ways it is a very scarey place still. It is all to do with levels, it may not appear to be as bad as it was but the silent fears and threats are still there but in different forms. Did anyone else see the film CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER where the President of the USA clearly words his request for action against the drug cartels, a request that he clearly makes without saying the incriminating words so he is left protectected if it all goes down the crapper? WHAT IF SOMEBODY SAID ' Alexander Litvinenko is really causing a problem , I wish he would just shut up'  and now he has. The same with Anna Politkovskaya! Mr Litvinenko was a fierce critic of Mr Putin. He alleged that the Russian authorities were responsible for bombings in Moscow seven years ago that killed 200 civilians. The attacks were blamed on Chechen rebels and led to the second Chechen war. He had also recently been investigating the murder of another Putin critic, outspoken Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya.

On leaving at 5 past night 3 buses were coming in, I had moved to the front to leave and they BLOCKED ME IN! There were 5 spaces behind me closer to the door-so I confronted the driver and asked if she was moving and she said,'no, I have to get the kids out and any way there are buses in front of me', and I told her that there were buses in front of her because she had blocked their reverse and there were 5 spaces behind me to no avail she just stomped off and I mean STOMPED.

DOES TELEVISION CAUSE AUTISM? by Michael Waldman at Johnson Graduate School of Management Cornell University.This research work proposes that the increase in children watching tv since the 70's and 80's has increased the level of autism in children. What do you think? Beauty did not pass her hearing tests in her first year and by the time she was 9 months old she was given a preliminary diagnosis of autism which was later confirmed, all before she had a chance to indulge in watching children's tv. So what level of autism is this researcher talking about? Beauty has many problems and as yet her language skills are very limited, so are they talking about children who are high functioning  or diagnosed with Aspergers? I think that the increase in children with autism is a lot more to do with greater awareness, I think these children were always out there but just not diagnosed. There has also been a huge increase in car ownership and use since the 70's, does the research consider the possibility of car emissions? Also an increase in junk food eaten by children, less exercise taken by children, more working mothers........oh the list is endless. I blame the government! Why? because I can I guess. Like I could blame tv if I wanted to. When I was growing up my family, like most other families watched a lot of tv because entertainment in the 60's and 70's was limited and you went home after school and watched tv for most of the evening. So now that I watch a lot less tv there must be a lot of benefit to my way of thinking and brain power, Let me see ....NO. Sorry, I wish there were thought, oh w ell.

Well, it was also something that I did as a child and I have a WORD game whereby I can sing a song that contains most words, For example HONEY can be found in Sugar,Sugar by the  Archies - please do not test me with words like MORASS or ANAL. This game  is a constant delight to my children(well sometimes). I believe we are all on the Autistic Spectrum somewhere and I believe that I am higher than the average and so Beauty gets some of her tendencies from me. The other night I watched SOME(remember, not all) of  Midsommer  Murders- 'Dead' centre of the universe village with more murders per square mile than any soap opera can conjure up,  Prunella  Scales  was on it and she was a cape wearing, tricycle riding psychic.  She said in the show that madness was an  unword (don't quote me) but a better way to describe things was to say that we are all have varying degrees of sanity and I think it is so true. I realise there are the psychotic types of mental illness but for the rest of us I think we all get depressed or obsessed at sometimes in their life and it is not an illness but varying degrees of sanity and it is the way we cope with the day to day rigours of living. For those who suffer with the psychotic types of illnesses I do not believe that the Health Care System adequately deals with their needs. 'Community care killings' exposed 25 mentally ill people a week take their own lives, the study reveals More than 400 people have been killed by psychiatric patients released into the community over the last eight years, a report is expected to reveal.It will say almost a third of the killings were carried out by people who were judged to have been of \"low risk\". Now there is the evidence of a serious problem we will have to wait and see if anything is actually done because if the money isn't out there to pay for the  professionals to work with the people with problems in the community then nothing will change. More people will die unnecessarily. Union calls for more funds to  NHS Treatment will be available despite the cuts, the government claims.The country's biggest union is calling on the government to give more money to the  NHS , amid fresh protests across the UK against plans to cut services.Unison says the chancellor should use next week's  pre -Budget report to help  NHS  trusts tackle financial deficits.Royal College of Nursing ( RCN ) head Beverley Malone said she hoped changes to the service would be made for clinical, not just financial, reasons.Protests are taking place against cuts in various UK locations. These include demonstrations in  Chertsey , Surrey, and Hatfield and  Stevenage  in  Hertfordshire . NHS  deficit doubles to over \u00a3500m The  NHS  deficit tops \u00a3500m.The  NHS  deficit in England has reached \u00a3512m - more than double the amount last year.Nearly a third of the 566  NHS  organisations failed to break even with a hardcore group of 63 responsible for 70% of the deficits.The unaudited figure for the 2005-6 financial year is \u00a3100m less than mid-year forecasts.Over 12,000 jobs have been cut, wards closed and operations delayed as  NHS  trusts have struggled with finances. How many jobs will be lost in the  NHS ? By Caroline  ParkinsonBBC  News health reporter Tony Blair is under pressure to say how many  NHS  staff will go.Campaigners have reacted angrily to Tony Blair's assertion that there will only be a \"few hundred\" redundancies in the  NHS .They, along with the Conservatives, say the total number of jobs losses linked to the current financial crisis in the health service will be nearer to 20,000.So how many people will actually be out of work because of the current  NHS  reorganisation?Since consultations on proposals are ongoing in  NHS  trusts up and down England, it is not actually clear what the final tally will be.But it looks as though both sides might be right.Redundancies are the tip of the iceberg.As Tony Blair and  NHS  managers say, the total number of compulsory redundancies is likely to be in the hundreds.However, many more people will be affected. Posts are likely to close, staff will not be replaced when they leave and remaining staff may be moved to different departments and responsibilities.And adding up all the posts affected by redundancy, post closure, failure to recruit or staff movement could be near 20,000. Does anyone  else  find the situation really worrying?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXKMNSAZ_2I/AAAAAAAAAEg/sEOBEG1Dltk/s1600-h/03-12-06+002.jpg", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118401/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0768795/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6203256.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6202008.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5055602.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6059744.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/jingle-bells.html", "title": "\nJINGLE BELLS\n"},

US plans permanent base on Moon So the US government plans on spending billions(probably just a drop in the Sea of Tranquility) on building a base on the moon!I personally think th at the money could be better spent. I think the money could be spent on affordable housing, education, crime, natural disasters, mental illness and disability .......... ........the list is endless. Hunger Facts: Domestic Hunger persists in the U.S.     * 38.2 million people\u2014including 13.9 million children\u2014live in households that experience hunger or the risk of hunger. This represents more than  one in ten households in the United States (11.9 percent). This is an increase of 1.9 million, from 36.3, million in 2003. 1     * 3.9 percent of U.S. households experience hunger. Some people in these households frequently skip meals or eat too little , sometimes going without food for a whole day. 10.7 million people, including 545 thousand children, live in these homes.1     * 8.0 percent of U.S. households are at risk of hunger. Members of these households have lower quality diets or must resort to seeking emergency food because they cannot always afford the food they need. 27.5 m illion people, including 10.6 million children, live in these homes.1     * Research shows that preschool and school-aged children who experience severe hunger have higher levels of chronic illness, anxiety and depression, and behavior problems than children with no hunger. 2  People facing hunger are increasingly turning to the Food Stamp Program for assistance in feeding their families.     * Following years of decline, participation in the Food Stamp Program has been on the rise over the past two years. In Augu st 2005, over 25.7 million people participated in the food stamp program.6     * While it is not possible to determine what caused the increase in participation from the data available, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues it is likely that the majority of the increase can be attributed to the economic downturn. Due to loss of employment and income, mor e families probably became eligible for the Food Stamp Program. 3  Churches and charities are straining to serve rising requests for food from their pantries and soup kitchens, especially from working people.     * The U.S. Conference of Mayors reports that in 2005 requests for emergency food assistance increased an average of 12 percent.  The study also found that 54 percent of those requesting emergency food assistance were members of families with children and that 40 percent of adults requesting such assistance were employed. High housing costs, low-paying jobs, unemployment, and the economic downturn led the list of reasons contributing to the rise.4     * Over half the cities surveyed in the Mayors' report (52 percent) said they are not able to provide an adequate quantity of food to those in need. And 83 percent of surveyed cities reported they had to decrease the quantity of food provided and/or the number of times people can come to get food assistance , up from 67 percent last year. An average of 18 percent of the demand for emergency food assistance is estimated to have gone unmet in  the survey cities, down from 20 percent last year.4     * America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest network of food banks, reports an estimated 24 to 27 million people turned to the agencies they serve, as accounted for in their 2006 findings. 5  Cites and links to source material: 1  \u201cHousehold Food Security in the United States,  2004.\u201d  ERS  Research Briefs. 2  Pediatrics, Vol. 110 No. 4, October 2002 The above is a report on the Bread For The World website. Does humanity have it's  priorities  wrong? Have we gone so far astray? I so know I wouldn't make a good politician, I would get too emotional(not as emotional as  SnoWhite   of course !) I really need to get  a good nights sleep. I have to nap in the day to cope with the late nights,  interrupted sleep and early mornings. Naps are good and give me some rest but I always wake up having dreamt the  strangest dreams.  I feel like  Iolo   Morgannwg  after one of his laudanum induced 'episodes'(though I have never taken laudanum or any other drug to know for sure!). Today I dreamt that my mother was still alive and living happily in a little house that she had bought opposite the castle in town by the Duke Street arcade(not that there are any houses there of course) and she loved to do  scrap booking ! My mothers favourite pastime was reading books. I also dreamt that , as revealed by a prophecy(not real, just in my dream) that the end of the world was coming and in the sky above St Mary Street myself and everyone else who was there saw  a vision which showed the symbols of the 4 main religions of the  world. See what lack of rem sleep can do for you! It was a pretty realistic d ream.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6208456.stm", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXU9NyAZ_6I/AAAAAAAAAFU/CFoaKYZWPK4/s1600-h/Homeless_in_LA.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXXe5SAaACI/AAAAAAAAAGk/BR6xa_r5dsw/s1600-h/moon.jpg", "http://www.bread.org/learn/hunger-basics/hunger-facts-domestic.html", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXWe-iAZ__I/AAAAAAAAAGA/mm0DtlCSCV4/s1600-h/duke+street.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXWfCiAaAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/uKxJjngy94w/s1600-h/iolo.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/RXWftiAaABI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/5gP5V5KSE4A/s1600-h/st+mary+street.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/here-is-christmas-song-for-fiona-and.html", "title": "\nDECK THE HALL\n"},

{"date": " December 14, 2006", "body": "\nToday I did an online quiz on  TEEN SLANG I managed 6 out of 10 and I thought that was really good but the quiz said I was still confused.Listening to Ariel and Fiona is an education in itself, now they talk a foreign language! Anastasia and Belle were born  only 18 moths apart but they grew up like twins, Fiona and Ariel are also 18 months apart so they have also grown up like twins and SnoWhite was in the middle and a typical middle child and of course Beauty was born 9 years after Fiona so she will always be the baby. Anastasia and Belle and Ariel and Fiona have had totally different childhoods. Anastasia and Belle were brought up in the 80's and Ariel and Fiona were brought up in the 90's. The younger two also have had the advantage that their upbringing was influenced by the fact that when they were little I was in University and they went to the university daycare and we had more money. The older 2 would say they had been spoiled. though I am sure the younger 2 would disagree! The older 2 liked Take That, Brit Pop and Ant & DEC(big time!) whilst the younger 2 have liked Busted, McFly and CHAV music. Vicky Pollards twin sister. Kate Moss. I have a daughter who is campaigning the cause of the chav single handedly, she loves the clothes, the slang and the music and her philosophy is 'Well CHAV's are always clean whilst EMO's don't always look clean'(I kid you not). Whilst the other younger daughter wears dark clothes and loves Hello Kitty and insists she is not an EMO and I admit that she washes all her clothes(well I do!) everyday and showers everyday, so what does that make her? I don't know what it makes her but it helps to make us a very INDIVIDUAL family! For example.................. last night after picking up Ariel and SnoWhite from IKEA where they work we were discussing the IKEA Christmas  Breakfast  and the presents that IKEA give to their employees each year. They have previously given cameras , MP3 players and portable DVDs and they were talking about how long you had to work with the company to get the present. To try and help them understand the situation I told them the Parable of the Vineyard where The Vineyard owner gives them all the same reward even though they started at different times, it is a parable about Jesus, people who come to him and their reward in heaven. Well if I did, it turned into a frank and vigorous in ASDA car park about the rights and wrongs  of Jesus giving everyone the same no matter how long they have been his followers. now how many families have that kind of discussion at 9:15pm at night in ASDA car park in the BAY? My children need to take a chill pill! I can see how religious wars start And my children are basically on the same side (well I'm sure that SnoWhite would protest that one!). Just don't get them started on contraception, the death penalty, any church, war, Human Rights, Bush & Blair, poverty............ oh the list is endless. I know how Kofi Annan must feel. UPDATE ARIEL AND FIONA  demand that the world know that they have NEVER liked Busted , Ariel says she is a ChavEmo(whatever that is) and Fiona wants it made clear that she is not an Emo!

{"date": " December 17, 2006", "body": "\n I live on a council/ local authority/government housing  estate (the nearest equivalent in the US is the projects) but from the early 80's after the government introduced the RIGHT-TO-BUY scheme my house was sold to the tenant, then sold again,then sold to me in 1996. Of the houses(I don't know about the flats) I would say maybe over half are now privately owned. In my block of 10, 2 are still owned by the council and 1  possibly 2 have been purchased by Housing Associations(Google it,way too difficult to explain but part government owned). This is the second time I have lived on this type of housing estate, once in Newbury in England and both estates were designed by American designers in the 70's AND won awards for their designs. YET I would say that practically the designs are CRAP. In theory the houses are back to front, the roads are at the backs of the houses and the fronts of the houses lead onto a pedestrianised area. The council has had to make pavements on the estate as it is not practical to leave from the fronts of your houses, we are on a hill and the front of my house has  steps and anyway when I leave the house I go straight to the back of my house into the car. Last night I left the house at 10:30pm to pick up an elderly gentleman who lives in a retirement home who had  been for his Saturday night out to a social club, I give him a lift about once a month on a Saturday night. Well it was like the remains of a war zone, there were police and quite a lot of broken car glass AND I  hadn't heard a thing from the house. The lounge is at the front of the house and with an extension at the back of the house with double glazing, world war three could erupt and I probably wouldn't notice. I live at the back of the estate and my house is overlooked by flats, the top flat is rented by the council to the 'burglar boys' who are brothers who are constantly in and out of prison( I think their parole officer must have got them the flat!). Well what a dumb-ass place to put 'active'(oh yes they are active) criminals, the top floor of a block of flats in an intercom controlled access building. When SnoWhite was still in school she left the house one morning to find the road filled with police(even mounted police) waiting to storm the 'burglar boys' flat.AND why were they waiting? Because the police did not have the access code to the doors! When the 'burglar boys' were in the middle of their last spree the local SWAT team were called out, I kid you not the police came in all their black gear complete with helicopters and search lights. It turned into a light show for the locals, I swear it was more like a Benny Hill show, or A Carry ON film or better still St Trinnians! Once the police were called out to pick up a lad who hadn't showed up at his court appearance, the mounted police the works, why the cavalry I don't know, it was a terrified 19 year old with an IQ only   large enough to tie his white trainers, hiding in his mothers attic(more a loft space)-the police spent all day trying to talk him down. On their last spree the 'burglar boys' tried to break into my lounge window but I was asleep on the sofa in there and when he started to mess with the window I shouted at him him, it scared him so much he nearly pooped himself and that was the end of their last spree. The local criminals are not scary, most of them are just funny. In the 10 years I have been here I can honestly say that apart from the 'burglar boys' trying to branch out into a bit of 'your money or your life'(they weren't very successful!) there has been no real violence. Yes I would like to live somewhere  else but who wouldn't like a bigger or better or better location house. I live 2 minutes from Beauty's specialist school, we literally are on the edge of the city but less that 15 minutes drive to town and yes I do feel safe. AND I have four bedrooms, a dining room , a middle room(lounge), a sitting room plus the back kitchen where the piano and computer live plus a lot of kitchen storage and a freezer, a downstairs shower/splash room and all for approximately \u00a3130,000-now where else in Cardiff would  I get a house this size and for this price if it weren't ex-local authority housing?

I have the heating on but my toes are still cold. It is 6:10am and Beauty has been grumbling in her bed but like any self respecting 'teenager', getting out of bed is just too much effort. If I could sleep that would be where I would be. I have always wanted to go to a snowy place for Christmas but after Balamory last year and this freezing fog I'm not so sure, even for a holiday. Yes I am looking forward to the Canaries in January. HOCKNEY had the Swimming Pool series whilst Beauty has the Christmas Tree series. Last night I helped Beauty finish painting her Christmas cards and she definitely has her very own abstract style, 500% more talented than Tracey Emin and uses 500% more acrylics than David Hockney! And when she is finished Beauty likes to eat the paint! Now how many artists do that? Aboriginal painters used spitting the paint as a technique but I don't think eating it was part of the deal! Well duh! they must have used plants and berries as paints! Excuse my brain, it hasn't kicked in yet. Beauty's lunch is cooking, the sink is bleaching, the tumble dryer drying and the washing machine washing and I managed all of that in less than 10 minutes,  now I can get back to the real task at hand..............waking up slowly. I hate waking up with a shock or more quickly than my body is willing to oblige. I always have the desire to drop my head over the side of the bed and puke(I know, too much detail) when Beauty decides to shatter my brain into consciousness at some unearthly hour. Forced into wakefulness at stupid o'clock always  turns my brain to a philosophical soup and I find myself asking questions suchs as, 'WHY AM I HERE' 'WHERE AM I GOING''HOW THE HELL DID I GET MYSELF INTO THIS SITUATION' and the scariest thing is I start to answer myself AND the answers make sense! I think my brain gets confused and thinks I am a drunk pontificating on life, the world and everything! Dishwashers emptied, refilled and turned on, recycling and rubbish sorted, Beauty's lunch checked and all before morning medication , ok I don't remember it but aliens must have come and swapped me during the night because this is not me, GIVE ME BACK!

You haven't had to endure my weird dreams in a long time so here is the latest caused by lack of rem sleep which in turn is caused by the lack of sleep in an autistic six year old. Last night I dreamt that I had just come back off holiday from Dubai to find a small white elephant and a large black elephant  and 3 rhino's on my balcony and in the living room was a black panther and running around the house was a monkey. I called the police to come and take them away and they cordoned off the road in front of the house which turned out to be the road in front of my mothers house in Rhoose then they anaethetised the rhino who promptly deflated..............oh and it was all the fault of the man next-door!! Where this dream came from I have no idea, I have never been to or thought about going to Dubai, nothing happened in the last few days regarding wild animals  but I have thought about my mother but not her house in Rhoose. Dreams are such strange things. Moral of the story...............don't mess with the rhino! APOLOGY DUE Last Christmas I visited my sister Megara and her family and we also visited with her two girls Ashlyn and Edeline. Now Edeline is younger and at Christmas she looked like a skinny teenager but when we last visited in the summer she had grown up and Ashlyn and Edeline looked like twins, beautiful young women. Well I couldn't stop saying how they looked so mature and the same and when we visited last weekend I mentioned how they looked the same and I know Ashlyn was upset and I want to apologise. It is all in the face, yes Edeline may be pregnant but you  don't look anything like her like that. Edeline has a bump and you look very slim and I am very sorry. I bet you as well that within two weeks Edeline will be back in skinny jeans whilst I still have my belly and Beauty is six!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/prince%20charming.gif", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/anastasia.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/dot.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/11/sams-back.html", "title": "\nSAM'S BACK!\n"},

I flew back on a plane from Portugal on Christmas Eve when Beauty was six weeks old and  it was an eventful experience. We were placed in seats at the front because of the baby but we were also close to the toilets! I am so grateful that I have little sense of smell, every child on the plane decided to 'lose their lunch' on seats, walls and floors in front of my seat! I spent most of the flight being a nurse to kids who just wanted to be in their beds waiting for Santa. Oh and that was also when Pianoman went around a roundabout the wrong way, his excuse 'there were no signs'! It would have sounded better if he had reminded us that he had learned to drive in Germany(other side of the road)..............BUT he was in the army in the tank regiment(I kid you not!). I could write a book about my eventful life! Beauty is awake, I can hear her singing ' Oh Christmas Tree' , that would have pleased my Dad, it is to the tune of The Red Flag, my Dad was an 'old' labour man. He once went on a coach trip with the local conservative club(WHY? Don't know but it happened) and gave them a rendition of The Red Flag, he came home unharmed thankfully. The conservatives got their own back though, one election day they papered the front of our house with conservative election posters! Sadly I cannot remember his reaction!

We both ended up with a bleeding lip and she refused to get in her buggy.I Love Children.Beauty has her 6 monthly medical with her consultant at her school at 10:30 so no chance of a nap this morning. The weather is 0.5* and the thickest fog I have seen in a long time, as I came out of the estate onto Bryn Celyn Road the traffic was still doing 50 miles per hour, in a 30 miles per hour zone in front of a primary school! What they achieve is beyond me as at the end of the road is the roundabout to the dual carriageway and the traffic on there was nose to tail. Did they gain anything? I don't think so............oh apart from the fathead award. Did you read this on the BBC news website? Well I am absolutely appalled at the behaviour of this teaching assistant. What was she thinking? My neighbours boy has Special Needs and he is in his thirties and a relationship with him would be wrong as he wouldn't understand but to be like this with a child you have known since they were 12 is WRONG. My other neighbours grandson  is 12  and has severe learning difficulties and I can only imagine how his family would feel if a 43 year old was found not guilty of abusing him, the letter alone proves there was emotional abuse. At least this women should be put on the sex offenders register and NEVER be allowed to work with children or venerable adults again. What would have happened if she hadn't been found out, would the relationship have become sexual? A women in this situation can cause as much damage as a man, emotional damage can be worse than physical damage. WE LIVE IN A SICK WORLD. Woman cleared of sex with pupil A teaching assistant has been acquitted of having sex with one of her pupils.Karen Nash, 43, had always denied charges of engaging in sexual activity with a boy from the special needs school where she worked.The married mother-of-two, from Basingstoke, Hants, wept as a jury at Winchester Crown Court returned not guilty verdicts on five charges.The judge had already ordered not guilty verdicts to be returned on two further charges. 'Fantasy' letters The prosecution alleged that she had become obsessed with the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and had sex with him on several occasions between February and August last year.Christopher Parker QC alleged that when the boy was sent to a young offenders' institution, Mrs Nash would buy him gifts, gave him cash and sent him \"steamy\" letters. But in police interviews, Mrs Nash adamantly denied having had a sexual relationship with the boy, for who she had been a learning support assistant since he was 12. Mrs Nash said the letters were a fantasy designed to cheer the boy up, In the words of Jim Royle from  The Royle FAmily ,  'cheer the boy up'  'MY ARSE'. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS STORY? Wanted man may have fled in veil Mustaf Jamma is thought to have returned to Somalia Police seeking a man over the murder of Pc Sharon Beshenivsky are considering the theory he may have fled the UK dressed as a veiled Muslim woman.It is understood West Yorkshire Police - who have not commented on reports about the veil theory - regard it only as one of a number of possibilities.The wanted man, Mustaf Jamma, is the brother of Yusuf Jamma who was found guilty of the Pc's murder this week.Mustaf Jamma is believed to be in his native Somalia.The 26-year-old was released from jail six months before Pc Beshenivsky was killed.    airport between Christmas Day last year and New Year's Day. A BAA  spokesman told The Times immigration control staff always did visual checks on people coming into the country but added only random checks were made on outgoing passengers.On Tuesday the jury in the trial of four men over Shadow home secretary David Davies said the fact that anyone could be allowed through passport control wearing a veil was \"barely credible\".\"Doing so when an All Persons Bulletin for murder has been issued demonstrates that our borders are not just porous but non-existent,\" he added.Some newspaper reports have suggested Mr Jamma stole his sister's passport and wore a full niqab (a veil that totally obscures the face) to evade checks at HeathrowHeathrowPcBeshenivsky's death was discharged after failing to reach a verdict on a final count of robbery.Three men have been found guilty of killing the officer, who was shot after an armed raid in Bradford in 2005. Another man had earlier admitted murder.The jury could not decide if Raza Ul-Haq Aslam, 25 - who was cleared of murder, manslaughter and firearms offences - was guilty of robbery, and a re-trial was ordered.As well as Mustaf Jamma another man called PiranDitta Khan, whom the prosecution alleged was the \"architect of the robbery\", remains on the run from police.Pc Beshenivsky, 38, was shot and killed on 18 November 2005 as she arrived at the Universal Express travel agents in Bradford city centre on the day of her youngest daughter's fourth birthday.Her colleague Pc Teresa Milburn was also shot in the street as the robbers escaped with about \u00a35,000. I do not believe that anyone would get through airport security without a visual check and secondly, he would make one FUGLY woman! Fugly enough to raise the suspicions of anyone, airport security have my total respect. On my visit to the US they were  totally efficient, they were as efficient as the 'Dragon at Gates' receptionist at my Doctors Surgery and NOTHING gets past her. AND the airport security have plastic gloves in their pockets which they have the authority to use, would you mess with that? NOT ME! This man needs to be caught to stand trial for murder so if he is guilty he cannot hurt anyone again and to bring closure for Pc Sharon Beshenivsky's family.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpjKPy64NpM", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6194739.stm", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129711/", "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42351000/jpg/_42351803_mustafjama203.jpg", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/mad-world.html", "title": "\nON A COLD AND FROSTY MORNING\n"},

I am wearing the thick socks that I bought in Balamory as my toes are so cold.Bright clear sunny day again and the weather forecast says that it is set to warm up a bit, here and in Vienna and Panama city. As the Queen of weird dreams I have to share these with you. Wednesday night I dreamed that SnoWhite and I were walking down Newport Road near the infirmary and Westlife came out from a concert and Brian McFadden was still with them and he was walking with Kerry.Well Sno White ran up and was all over him like a rash and asking for his autograph and anyone who knows SnoWhite will know that this would never happen so I woke myself up very quickly before the dream became a nightmare. A nightmare which involved a lot of blood and body parts bouncing up the street. Weird dream number 2-Charlotte Church's mother was running a papershop/gift shop and I went there to get a donation for a school charity raffle. Charlotte was at the back of the shop and we started chatting and we were discussing me going to finish my Masters and doing a PHD but she wanted me to work in her shop for her. We had a lovely conversation, a very nice girl but the only weird thing was she was in full stage make-up whilst we chatted. Beauty has found a BARNEY DVD , save us. She knows all the words, sung and spoken. Well I suppose it is better than the plastic smiling WIGGLES because they always seem a bit bi-polar to me. PARANORMAL ORBS Do I believe in them ? Probably not, I have never had any in any of my photographs until last week and now I have had two. Dust or rain probably. When the lounge picture is larger the orbs on the floor by the chair are a lot clearer. Rain? Dust? YOU DECIDE.                            This is the activity corner in my kitchen! Here lives my washing machine and small dishwasher on the floor and above is the tumble dryer and rhe large dishwasher. When the kitchen was built we realised that with such a large sink unit we could only fit a small dishwasher. But it was just not enough and so I realised that if I could fit the tumble dryer on top then I could fit another LARGE dishwasher on top- and I did! Sooooooooooo.......................I have 2 questions 1: if I have so much space for dishwashing why do all the dirty dishes end up on the draining board(or just anywhere around the house) waiting for me to fill and empty the dishwasher? 2:why can't a certain teenager who wants to join Army Intelligence find any clean glasses? Yesterday morning she said,'MUUUUM, I've searched everywhere and I can't find a clean glass anywhere, where are they'? UUUUH! try the dishwasher! Perhaps the same is true for Bin Laden, perhaps he is in such an obvious place that nobody thinks of looking for him there, like his Mum's house! Here we have the disaster zone...................again! THE WORLD JUST  GOT COLDER It seems that  Darfur  Militia are killing again and it is reported that they have killed 62 people in the last week and 27 of those killed were under the age of 12.

In the shop the TechGuy said 'that no firewall is 100%' and I felt like saying,'well nobody told me that'. So I left the computer at the shop and was told it could be about a week before it will be fixed. So I drive home and try to get the old computer working again. Remember the purchase of the new computer in October was purely elective and so I thought the old computer would be ok to use. WHAT A PILE OF POO. I became so frustrated that I would have liked to have used the old computer as a football. I had been planning on getting a new, small computer for Beauty after Christmas to help her with school, especially reading. I  was so angry with the old computer that I went out straightaway and bought a new computer. So I spent the afternoon getting the computer  up and running and online, which I did only to be phoned a few minutes after completing installation by PC WORLD  to be told that the computer was fixed and ready for completion. I hit my head repeatedly against the computer desk! I have recently become friends again with my first boyfriend  David  thanks to MYSPACE. He is now married with two daughters and has his own  recording studio. He is such a good guy and I am sorry that we have missed so many years of friendship by drifting apart. He is a kind and loving husband and father and it is a blessing to know him again. Having one set of memories definitely gives a biased view, talking together has brought memories flooding back of when I was 18 and I was such a COW. It is a wonder that I didn't turn him completely grey with stress. My girls are angels in comparison. Don't get me wrong, I was no Hell Raiser(I WISH) but I was young and stupid and only 17 when we met and every email or conversation I have with him contains apologies. If my girls were like I had been I would slap them around the head and lock them in their rooms until they were 30! I think that I am a much nicer person now than I was at 17 but even now I definitely have room for improvement.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.solariserecords.com/artists/rock/holysmoke.html", "http://www.redbamboomusic.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/why-i-only-did-one-year-of-computer.html", "title": "\nWHY I ONLY DID ONE YEAR OF A COMPUTER DEGREE..........\n"},

Tonight(after previously asking and being told that everything was  in hand)  I asked  SnoWhite who is 21 , if all her paperwork was in hand for her appointment with the Passport office for  tomorrow. She said yes, so we quickly went through her list of what she needed to take with her. All in order apart from the identification signatures of a professional! And why didn't she have them? Because she thought they were only needed for children! This is the politically aware one, philosophically  aware  one and religiously aware one. The one who wants to put an end to all wars, promote peace and educate and feed the world. She is totally aware of the world situation and KNOWS all about the security and all the risks that are out there but this one just went floating over her head. When I  explained the situation she said,'oh yes, of course'. Imagine the following for one second SnoWhite............... A person  from Humpty Dumpty land, wears a dress and puts a brunette wig on  and uses an illegally  acquired copy of SnoWhite's birth certificate to get a passport to go to Far,Far Away and destroy the Gingerbread man's house. I know it sounds a bit far fetched(well the bit about the wearing of the dress other than at  a prom or whilst holidaying in Lanzarote) but reality is so much stranger than fiction! Thank you to my friend of thirty odd years who let us into her house at 8:40pm on NEW YEARS DAY! to sign the passport form, you can always rely on a nurse. Remember the 'what a coincidence'? Well I have another one. I am not a soap or TV  fan but I whole heartedly agree with peoples right to live this one life and enjoy pleasures that do not hurt anyone else. So many times I have heard pseudo-intellectuals proudly saying they have never watched a soap or certain TV program because it is a waste of time or that only people with no intelligence watch it. Well bully for them. In my life I have  watched a lot of soaps,  hundreds(thousands probably!) of hours of TV and for the most part enjoyed  it (apart from the Design Development of the Bollard-an OU program I watched years ago on a Sunday morning when the variety in TV programs was severely limited!)but now I tend to be so busy in the evening that I only get to watch TV quite late, just before bed. However, myself and my children seem to have an aversion to watching Emmerdale (though Marlon is a brilliant actor-we love him), Coronation St, Eastenders , Heartbeat, Where the  Heart is and The Royal(but we are up on all the story lines and gossip-hey what more do you need?).They may be entertaining programs but they just don't interest us enough to sit down and watch them, however they are Runningman's  favourite programs(though he tends to watch Sunday night TV at his own flat as TV in my house can be unpredictable-usually a choice between The Tweenies or Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer at the moment). So we let him watch them on New Year's Eve as it was a special occasion (and Beauty was diverted with her toys!) and I sat and watched Heartbeat and YES I did enjoy the time spent relaxing which is a rare thing. I named Try And Catch The Wind as my personal song of 2006 and it was the song that Heartbeat played their final episode of the year out to. It was particularly poignant in the program as it linked the problems and losses of the characters. CATCH THE WIND by Donovan In the chilly hours and minutes, Of uncertainty, I want to be, In the warm hold of your loving mind. To feel you all around me, And to take your hand, along the sand, Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind. When sundown pales the sky, I wanna hide a while, behind your smile, And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find. For me to love you now, Would be the sweetest thing, 'twould make me sing, Ah, but I may as well, try and catch the wind. When rain has hung the leaves with tears, I want you near, to kill my fears To help me to leave all my blues behind. For standin' in your heart, Is where I want to be, and I long to be, Ah, but I may as well, try and catch the wind. Chords:- C,F,G To many these may be sad lyrics but to me they make me think of a book that I read years ago by Richard Bach called THERE'S NO SUCH PLACE AS FAR AWAY The book explores the following Can miles separate us from friends? If we want to be with someone we love are we not already there? My parents, my sister, my husband, my son and some friends may be dead but I no longer feel sorrow for not being with them because I feel close to them in my heart(though accepting their passing was not overnight and in some cases took many years). I do feel sorrow sometimes for them though, for what should have been and for their lives being cut short.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/2007so-begins-new-year-in-life-of.html", "title": "\n2007...........SO BEGINS A NEW YEAR IN THE LIFE OF A MOTHER OF MANY\n"},

Though personally I think that is a load of rubbish! On entering the house Donnie was quite worse for wear..........in fact I think that Nissed as a Pewt would describe him better. My personal opinion on why the ROCKER WITH A REPUTATION TO KEEP left is quite simple. HE SOBERED UP, and with his newly acquired clarity he thought, 'Why am I doing this?', 'I don't need to do this','Who are these people?'. Remember, in Donnie's youthful naivety any one over 25 is  redundant and has nothing useful to contribute to his Brave New World! I love Donnie! I agree with the consensus of opinion amongst his fellow house mates and that is that he really is just a pussycat. I also think he probably misses his Mum! I honestly believe that the only appliance in the kitchen he is capable of working is the Chicken DING machine(microwave!) He will be missed and Celeb BB '06 will be way less entertaining without him. Will this be the  CAMERON (boring) year of Celeb BB? SIDE NOTE TO BB'06 As a nurse I was really worried about  Ken Russell , he was perspiring profusely and so exhausted he was unable to put his clothes away and  Shilpa  and  Jermaine  had to help him. I also noticed Jack Tweedy worriedly looking over.What was BB thinking? The man is 79 and on the third day he is unable to cope. Ken said that at home he usually goes to bed at 9pm! I think they need to keep an eye on him. School for Beauty resumes Monday and Beauty and I have missed it! I think that Beauty enjoys the daily routine of changing activities as she does bore easily at home(when not on the computer!). Her boredom at the moment is exhibited by taking toy boxes out of her toy shelves and just emptying them out onto the floor and Beauty shouting, 'No, you stop it'.

When considering the psychotic behaviour of the majority of the contestants , I have always wondered how Big Brother could find so many people for their normal Big Brother shows who did not take medication,vitamins or any supplements of any kind as I have never seen the contestants take anything apart from special medication for the likes of headaches etc. They may have but I have just never seen it.Well this morning  Fiona had the TV on when I got up and within a few seconds two of the celebs took what appeared to be supplements of some kind.I take all sorts of supplements, vitamins, kelp......you name it, I swear I must rattle but if it makes my life  healthier then it can't be bad(and stops any desires of a psychotic nature that would induce me to want to be on something like Big Brother!). BIG BROTHER UPDATE 14:53 I received the following update in my email........... Danielle burst in and interrupted with a news-flash: \"Listen to this...Ken just got changed...I was facing the room and he took his underpants off and bent over...\" Cringing, she finished: \"...meat and two veg between his legs and I've seen it!\" Oh save us please, John  McCririck  was bad enough, seeing Michael Barrymore and George Galloway in their red  Lycra  flashing their 'lunch boxes'  was way,way too far but do we really need to see a 79 year old in all his glory? Before I watch Celebrity Big Brother again I shall make sure that I eat VERY early! BLAST FROM THE PAST Remember this one Anastasia? It lives on, still going strong after 10 years! I found it at the bottom of the clothes cupboard in the back kitchen when I was looking for something to wear whilst I was exercising. Thank you Belle an Beau for the Christmas present, as you can see it is being used. Beauty loves it! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/celebrity-big-brother-is-back-im-sorry.html", "title": "\n15 MINUTES OF FAME!\n"},
{"date": " January 07, 2007", "body": "\n Christmas and the New Year are well and truly over, Beauty went out with the child minder and Beauty looked thrilled when she realised what was happening. Beauty has little or no sense of anticipation so when she turned the corner and saw the child minder, she loudly proclaimed , 'bye, see you soon' . I have watched Beauty on the computer and I am very impressed with her computer skills. Considering the fact that the last psychological report placed her emotionally at 12>18 months, I am very pleased at the way she is developing in other areas and educationally she appears advanced in certain ways. Her speech isn't clear but then 4 out of 5 of her sisters had speech and language problems and saw therapists. From what I am able to understand when she is chatting away with her toys, I can tell that she is making up stories. She is also able to name lots of animals, insects, colours ,shapes and food. Some of her speech is very appropriate, when I bought her bongo drums she said,'now that's a good idea'. She is developing daily and I am grateful, she has come so far from the day when she would sit silently rocking in a cot. Welcome back Anastasia, even with the lack of natural snow I hope the skiing was good, oh and the company amicable! The sign of a good holiday.................would you go back? Nice to hear from you again Belle, I would love to comment on your blog but it won't let me, can you add me? My love to Beau and Woody and the in-laws. Does the mother-in-law have another email address as she never opened the card I sent her? 3 weeks Wednesday I will be in Feurteventura, perhaps next winter will be the one where we stay for the winter! Maybe. But could I get to watch Celeb Big Brother? I remember watching the summer Big Brother in Turkey so I am sure satellite TV in Spain would, they have Coronation Street and Eastenders (save us!). Life in the BIG BROTHER house goes on and is as entertaining as ever. Jade's mum has a bad case of wind! Oops! The usually placid Jermaine is not at all impressed \"This flatulation is killing me. I can't deal with this passing of the gas,\" \"Right in the kitchen!\" According to ken \"Jackiey is upsetting everyone.

{"date": " January 12, 2007", "body": "\n BUT I CAN DO DEEP! Take David  Beckham  for instance, he has always wanted to end his football career in the ' relative soccer  backwaters'  of the USA  and that is where it appears his playing career will end.Is he going with his tail between his legs? Hell no! I am impressed at the business acumen of the guy and if that's what he wants and it makes him and his family happy then I am pleased for  them. I believe there is nothing shallow about earning as much as you can before your retirement to provide for your family later. Good luck to them. The 275 million dollar man         \"Golden Balls\" - as he has been nicknamed by the tabloids - may not have a golden share but he will make money from LA Galaxy, possibly as much as $10m (\u00a35.14m) a year in profits.                          BBC sports editor                          By  Mihir  Bose The above resulted in the following family discussion..........what would we do for approximately half a million a week. I was very surprised at what my family would be prepared to advertise or do for the above named figure!I was very impressed at the matter-of-fact way they viewed money though. We did not however  discuss the 'oldest profession' as I feel quite strongly about the difficulties that people find themselves in and what they are prepared to do to get out of it. Plus  Snowhite  was in the house and she has an even more dogmatic opinion on the subject(well any subject really!) than I do. With everything that has happened in Suffolk recently regarding the murders of the 5 prostitutes I would like to see extra funding for nurses and guidance counsellors to help these young people who feel they have no alternatives in their lives to receive better care and move on in their lives. Will it happen? Probably not but I would love to be proved wrong. Back to my favourite relaxation activity at the moment...............TV! I cried last night when I watched  the new program  with  Colin and Justin , it is about how they are trying to help transform a council housing estate in Glasgow. The situation is dire and nobody should have to live like that- the flats were squalid and nobody should have to live like that. Colin and Justin visited a flat occupied by a young mother and her 2 children, she had  lived on the estate for 26 years, due to damp her flat was appalling  yet  when  Colin and Justin visited she had prepared  tea and sandwiches.  Which just goes to prove that because  we live on a council  or housing association estate does not mean we do not have good manners and we shouldn't have to put up with  sh*t (literally). Luckily the estate that I live  on is going through serious regeneration work but I was shocked to see the flat that Colin and Justin were offered to decorate into a show flat to attract new tenants..............the balcony was a foot deep in bird sh*t! And no these flats do not come for free, you work-you pay the rent. Let us hope that politicians responsible for housing watched this program and were suitably ashamed. Something tells me though it would be like water off a ducks back. The  Baby Borrowers   never ceases to shock and amaze!I am shocked at how badly behaved and selfish  some of the teenagers are but on the other hand some are an absolute delight and their parents should be very proud. If nothing else I hope this program serves to show the powers that be that being a teenager, with a baby, living alone or with a partner is no bed of roses. I would have no qualms having them look after my 6 year old, though even the wonderfully capable Lauren or Alex would be on the edge of a nervous breakdown after 3 days with Beauty. Beauty's language skills are increasing daily, her teacher today told me that when  Beauty wants people to leave her alone she says, 'I told you to lie down and go to sleep!' and   thankfully the teacher thought it was very funny. In the two weeks up to Christmas and over Christmas Beauty was unwell with a viral infection so I moved the furniture around so there would be a sofa in her bedroom and at night I would sleep with her to make sure she was  ok . When I took Beauty to bed I would lie down to sleep on the sofa with her on her bed and get up when she fell asleep. Each time she sat up I say to  her,'I told you to lie down and go to sleep'. Thankfully I try very, very hard to use correct language in front of Beauty though unfortunately  SnoWhite  and Fiona have very little control when they fight. Fortunately there have been no reports home of bad language! Her favourite TV programs include  Charlie and Lola  and when I take Beauty to bed she says,'GoodnightCharlie, Goodnight Lola' every night. Charlie and Lola are also he favourite games and stories on the  CBEEBIES  website and one story about the grandparents makes Beauty giggle and giggle and giggle.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6253829.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6253829.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6253829.stm", "http://www.knightayton.co.uk/frameset.html?http://www.knightayton.co.uk/justin_colin.html", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/baby_borrowers/index.shtml", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/charlieandlola/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/am-i-shallowhell-yes.html", "title": "\nAM I SHALLOW................HELL YES!\n"},

As I have said before, I am not the brightest bunny and sometimes I do have a problem with memory retention but I don't understand why if they have all this evidence why the accused have been in custody for so long without coming to trial. I am a member of  Amnesty International  and I have written letters for them  for 15 years and I never fail to be shocked at the atrocities that occur in the world but I just can't rationalise how something like Guantanamo prison could happen and still be happening in the 21st century. I do believe in the law and justice but this just does not seem like justice to me. Whitehall:  We may never hit  superbug  target By Celia Hall, Medical Editor Last Updated:  2:14am GMT  11/01/2007 The Telegraph The Government target for halving cases in England of the hospital  superbug ,  MRSA , will not be met next year and may never be met, according to a secret Department of Health memorandum. It makes it clear that a second infection,  Clostridium   difficile , (C.  difficile ) is responsible for more deaths than  MRSA , that there has been a \"significant increase\" in cases and that it is \"endemic\" throughout the health service. Cases increased by 17.2 per cent in 2005 over the previous year. The memorandum suggests that \u00a3270 million needs to be spent on ward sinks for  handwashing , specialist cleaning kit and isolation facilities in the battle to stem the rising rate of C.  difficile  infections. Doesn't the  above  make you feel  so confident! Runningman broke his neck and he ended up with MRSA (his named nurse had the infection in her ears for 2 years and was unable to get rid of it and was allowed to continue working!) He also has Clostridium in his ears which he can't seem to get rid of. I had a baby and ended up with MRSA and the reason why people don't sue..........because they can't prove who gave it to them. When I had MRSA my Doctor did not think I would recover and I'm glad he didn't tell me that until afterwards! I hate to use the phrase BACK TO BASICS but the Health  authorities  just do not have enough money to pay for adequate cleaning. When Pianoman had his stroke I was shocked to see how dirty the hospital was, I noticed overflowing bags of rubbish and laundry and Doctors, Nurses , ward staff and other medical staff who either did not wash their hands or did it inadequately. Medical personal who wear their uniforms outside of work also pi** me off, they are either bringing infection from work or taking it in.       Doctor ties 'to go in MRSA fight'   Tuesday, 21 February 2006, Medics should ditch ties in a bid to combat hospital superbugs such as MRSA, doctors' leaders say.     The British Medical Association has urged its members to shun the neckwear as they are rarely cleaned and could be a source of infections. But the BMA said hygiene standards had been compromised as the number of cleaners in the NHS has fallen over the past 20 years from 100,000 to a low of 55,000 in 2003-4. The report said reduced bed numbers and higher patient turnover to meet performance targets had also made good infection control more difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It said the most important measure that could be taken was for patients, staff and visitors to clean their hands regularly.   This is how the Royal College Of Nursing feels in their Wipe It Out campaign on MRSA Uniforms: infection control issues Minimum professional and personal standards      Staff must change out of their uniform promptly at the end of a shift. Staff must presume some degree of contamination, even on clothing which is not visibly soiled. Hands must be washed and dried after handling fabric. Uniforms must be carried separately from other items - clean and dirty uniforms must not be transported together. Hand washing clothing items is ineffective and unacceptable. Entering commercial premises in uniform/clothing is unacceptable. Community staff should travel directly between locations. Staff must follow an organisation\u2019s dress code and guidance on the wearing and decontamination of uniforms Staff should not wear jewellery; fingernails should be short and free of nail varnish (false nails are unacceptable) and hair should be worn neatly in a style that does not require frequent re-adjustment. So the next time you see a medical professional in their uniform in ASDA  or TESCO  remind them that they are either taking infection into or bringing it from work. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6250095.stm", "http://www.amnesty.org/index1.html", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=FANIGOE3VW1DXQFIQMFSFGGAVCBQ0IV0?xml=/news/2007/01/11/nbug11.xml", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=FANIGOE3VW1DXQFIQMFSFGGAVCBQ0IV0?xml=/news/2007/01/11/nbug11.xml", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4735038.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4735038.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4735038.stm", "http://www.rcn.org.uk/resources/mrsa/healthcarestaff/uniforms/infectioncontrol.php"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-interests-of-truth-tolerance-and.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": " January 14, 2007", "body": "\nA few years ago whilst doing my teachers training  we discussed examples of student confidentiality. I was surprised to find out that my children could be exposed to quite dangerous individuals and the teachers and the parents  and the students did not have a right to know this information. Hopefully this is no longer true. One lecturer discussed a situation whereby he had taken a group of students on an Outward Bound weekend and whilst away the students had shared a dormitory type bedroom. There had been the usual high spirits and bickering but nothing too serious. Later on the lecturer found out that one of the students that he had taken on the trip was on bail for a serious knifing incident! He confronted the Head of Department who it turned out knew nothing about the situation. A decision had been made by higher powers in the college, they had decided that the confidentiality of the student on bail was most important! There were 16 and 17 year olds in the group, surely The Children's Act would  still have applied to these young people. As a parent I feel it is my right to know if dangerous people are in contact with my children. It seems that the  Conservative party does not agree with proposals to share information between government departments. I do appreciate some of the arguments against the proposals, The Liberal Democrats accused the government of stripping the public of its privacy. \"Blair's Britain now has the most intrusive government in our history,\" leader Menzies Campbell said. \"There is no part of people's lives which is free from snooping. \"State intervention and control expands every day. It is time we put a halt to this.\" he added. and also the comments made by the organisation Liberty. Human rights group Liberty said the government had contempt for people's privacy. \"This half-baked proposal would allow an information free-for-all within government - ripe for disastrous errors, and ripe for corruption and fraud,\" the group's director Shami Chakrabarti said.  I do not believe that the government has the capabilities, the intelligence or strong enough ethical base to implement their plans effectively. So where does that leave us and  our children? As always, at risk because of a lack of a cohesive safety system for our welfare. Our children can go to school and come into contact with individuals who have been police checked but go to church and be taught by  individuals  who do not have to be police checked. I have been a parent now for almost 25 years and I have learned to ask  the right questions. Questions with YES and No answers are the only ones I ask and I let them know if they put my child at risk then I will sue their ass. Obsessive? HELL YES! The year before my eldest went to school there was the tragic school accident whereby children were drowned at Land' End which subsequently gave me a fear of all school trips. I have never felt happy letting my girls go on school trips but I always let them go apart from Anastasia's first summer school trip. At the age of 5 they wanted to take them from their local school in Newbury in Berkshire to London on the train and then catch local transport buses and walk across London roads to the Natural History Museum. I said NO but they still went and nothing happened thankfully, Anastasia says she does not remember the situation but as an adult is glad I did not let her go. Ariel was on a train to London when the bombs went off on7/7, Anastasia was in Russia when the Theater siege took place, I was in Spain in a resort where bombs were set off by ETA and I was also in a resort in Turkey where bombs were set off on a local transport bus. Poo happens I know but doing your best to minimise the risks to yourself is so important. My personal mantra is BEWARE OF PARKED CARS- for me this means always be aware, trust no one but yourself to take care of you and your loved ones And why beware of parked cars? In Russia parents tell their children not to walk past the parked expensive cars as they belong to the new Russian elite and they have been known to be blown up in the past! AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. The three paintings at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff that I would love to own.

{"date": " January 16, 2007", "body": "\n Sleep in heavenly peace I seem to have spent Saturday, Sunday and Monday in a tired haze and any writings for those days should be regarded with suspicion. I seem to have spent Saturday and Sunday asleep with brief attempts at wakefulness, each waking episode spent asking,'How is Beauty?'and the rest of the time spent filling and emptying dishwashers, washing machines and the tumble dryer.........the sign of a true Mother! I was lucky enough to have Fiona  in the house to take care of Beauty and of course the child minder took Beauty out for three hours on Sunday afternoon and if I remember correctly I slept the whole time she was out. The tiredness is probably just life catching up on me. Beauty quite happily bounced off to school today leaving me free to tidy my house, last night I watched an episode of Wife Swap(when I wasn't nodding off!) and I promise I would NEVER  participate in that program  and why? Because my house is too much of a hovel! However as  SnoWhite  pointed out, if I were to do something like that I would clean the house from top to bottom AND get in industrial cleaners. How people allow strangers into their house when it is so filthy is beyond me. Once again to my shallower side! I also watched The Baby Borrowers and I an convinced that Sam and  Fisnik  are RINGERS, there is absolutely no way that two individuals can behave so badly. I believe they are older than they make out and really graduates from acting college! I'm sorry Sam you gave it away when you performed over the poor child being sick, no real person  behaves like that! And as for  Ceeleb  BB are they being racist? I couldn't say because I do not know what they were thinking when they made the comments they made(but the comments did seem more than just unkind) and when they impersonated  Shilpa's  accent but in the last few days I have found myself trying(not very well!) to impersonate Danielle's accent just  because I love it so much. Am I being racist? Danielle is English and I am Welsh and Wales and England have quite an  historically volatile relationship  and even now wearing a English rugby shirts at the wrong time in the wrong place can be seen as rather unwise. However I do believe that Jade, Jo and Danielle are just being typical girls who when they get together can become very catty and very spiteful and I do believe their behaviour is inspired by jealousy and does border on bullying but when they get out of the Big Brother house they will be appalled at their behaviour and regret a lot of what has happened. I really feel that BB needs a house meeting to discuss the situation before BB and the Celebs get themselves into anymore sh*t. Celeb BB update Not having watched BB properly for a number of days I have updated myself on what has been going on by accessing BB videos on  YouTube  and reading written  extracts  and I can say that my opinion of what has been going on has changed. Before I wasn't sure but now I am, the behaviour regarding  Shilpa  is unacceptable and should not be allowed to go on. This evening I watched Jermaine comforting  Shilpa  about the situation and he believed they were doing what they were doing because of the colour of  Shilpas  skin. It seems that Act against Bullying has taken pictures of Jade  Goodie  off their website, they said it was because she had not been acting properly. I no longer think it is bordering on bullying,  it is bullying. I know it seems as if I only ever watch TV but I only seem to manage to watch TV after 9pm and even then I am exercising or feeding the machines(dishwashers, washing machines etc!). As I have explained before I have quite wakeful nights with the adorable but active autistic 6 year old who wakes a few times in the night and then when she goes to school I catch up on my sleep. Whilst I nap I have the washing machines, dishwashers and tumble dryer running and then I am awake in the evenings and that is when I do a lot of my house work(well I try!). So in theory I work nights but I do not get any nights off. Even when I was a night nurse in a nursing home I only worked 4 nights a week, apart from the week when Belle got married and 1 night when I attended a church camp(don't ask!) I have been with Beauty constantly since she was born and since we knew about her autism it has been really difficult to leave her with anybody who doesn't understand her. I am sure that there are other mothers on their own at Beauty's school but I have just never seen them , I seriously wonder how they all seem to cope with relationships. Where do they find the time and the energy? Talking about rubbish! This morning I drove  SnoWhite  to university to do a presentation and to get there we had to go along the dual carriageway and the traffic was nose-to-tail because there were council workers on the  verges picking litter and so for their safety one lane was coned off. Most of the dual carriageway has deciduous trees along it  so as well as litter there are also a lot of leaves, now I understand the leaves but who in their right mind throws rubbish from a moving car because apart from being thrown off the bridges there seems to be no other explanation for where the litter comes from. I know my children would never drop litter and they also feel strongly about people dropping litter so what kind of person does this? Years ago when I was 15 I remember walking home from church with two other girls and one of them threw a large piece of rubbish on the road and we insisted that she pick it up and bin it, we were both shocked that she had no idea that what she was doing was unacceptable. The song of 2007? Since I found a CD of Daniel  Bedingfield  in my car(it belongs to one of the girls.......I think!) I have been playing it constantly and  I know when I have become obsessive about a piece of music because Beauty knows all the words when she hears it being played. My favorite track is   If your not the one  and this morning it was playing as I parked up in Beauty's school and as the car stopped I turned the CD off and Beauty kept on singing! Not as embarrassing as one of the other boys in Beauty's school, his Dad likes show tunes and they appear to be played a lot in their home as the boy is word perfect. I just can't help thinking about the song,'I'm just a girl who can't say no'. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/sign-of-true-mother.html", "title": "\nSIGN OF A TRUE MOTHER!\n"},
{"date": " January 17, 2007", "body": "\n       'Pay for surgery' option dropped Plans to offer  NHS  patients the option of paying for their surgery to avoid waiting lists have been abandoned. Chief executive of Northampton General Hospital, Andrew Riley, has withdrawn a letter sent on 8 January which outlined new plans for minor surgery. People were offered an option of paying certain amounts for their treatment but the move was completely unacceptable to the Department of Health. In a letter Mr Riley said the hospital trust had withdrawn the option.  I wonder what changed their minds? Public opinion perhaps? Common sense tells you that the above idea could not work. If  reduced price operations are offered in  NHS  hospital because of long waiting lists them it means that those 'jumping the queue' make the queue even longer for those who cannot afford to pay! And if the hospital had said,'Oh no, it wouldn't have affected the list because these would have been extra', my computer class were of the opinion,'Would you really want a major operation done by an already overworked, overtired  NHS  workforce?'.Had they even considered that some staff who remain in the public sector do so because of ideological reasons and do not want to participate in the private operations. Some Doctors do not have private patients or do any private work. I wondered how long it would take for the pompous self proclaimed  intelligentsia to rear their superior heads. According to the views on the BBC website regarding the Celeb BB debacle ,I am any one of the following because whilst I am exercising, embroidering or doing housework, I use my free agency to watch Big Brother. I just can't believe that anyone with a functional intellect bothers to watch this dumbed-down lager-swilling, kebab-munching,  chav  fodder. This must be the sort of television that the feckless watch, whilst their unappetising offspring are out  yobbing . We all need to get our own lives so this kind of programming will end. The people who watch big brother do so in the hope of watching something horrific unfold before their eyes, much like this incident. They are the sort of people who slow down on motorways to get a better view of a car crash. Why? Who knows, perhaps something is sadly missing in their lives. There is a big beautiful world out there - get outside and enjoy it and help break the cycle of morons idolising morons (who will sadly go on to breed morons!!) I am amazed that there are 4.5 million people sad enough to watch such a programme These reality shows are silly. Why would anyone waste their time watching them when there is always something better on the History Channel? This is pathetic!  Anyone dedicated to watching this programme needs to get a life ! According to the above comments on the BBC website because I watch Celebrity Big Brother the functioning of my intellect is called into question, I am feckless and my children are out  yobbing . I am told I need to get a life, I am the sort of person who slows down to watch a road accident and there is something sadly missing in my life. I am also sad and pathetic. The BBC has allowed these comments to be published about me and others like me and I find it  unacceptable . Which proves that you can be bullied in  or out of the Big Brother house, by stupid or (allegedly)intelligent people. I am an individual disabled by arthritis and  Dercum's  disease and I use my free agency to watch TV as an enjoyable form of entertainment as my capabilities to 'go out and do something less boring instead' is just a little bit limited. Come on guys, play nice! The Colour of Beauty Today I watched Beauty play a game with colours  and she was able to pick out red, yellow, green and blue quite easily                                                                                                                                                                            and then she went on to play with a game about time and she had no problem telling the time either.  Yep! Not only is she beautiful but clever too! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/pay-for-surgery-option-dropped-i-wonder.html", "title": "\nCOME ON GUYS...........PLAY NICE!\n"},
{"date": " January 21, 2007", "body": "\n SATURDAY JANUARY 21,2007 WOW! Yep I'm late writing tonight, sorry girls! Uninspiring day spent doing very little but then that is what weekends are for thank goodness. The weather has been appalling, rain, thunder, hail and wind. And it is definitely getting colder though I am sure it is not as cold as Vienna at the moment, any snow Anastasia? Any sun in Florida Belle? See I'm a true Brit, always talking about the weather! 17 years ago the roof of  SnoWhites  nursery school blew off in a storm, luckily the children got out in time but since then windy weather has left me less than impressed. I have a flat roof extension and it is definitely making noises! Think what I would have been like if I had been visiting Belle in Mississippi when the hurricane hit, I would have been a nervous wreck. I JUST CAN'T WIN Jade Goody has been evicted from the BB house and I don't think she seemed sorry at all and yes I still think she was a bully and being racist but I feel sorry for her. From the start of this furore I have felt that Big Brother was guilty of allowing the situation to escalate and not putting a stop to it. Big Brother seems to have been glad of everything that has happened but I think in this case that not all publicity is good publicity.Let us hope that  Endemol  and Channel 4 learn from this situation. Beauty  has had a good day singing, dancing and playing on the computer. In the last few months Beauty has improved dramatically with speech, understanding and processing. As I have said before her speech seems to be confined to set phrases but she has enough speech to let everybody know what she wants. I am convinced that Beauty's talking will get better and better. I read a blog daily called  Whitterer  on Autism  and the writer has 2 sons who are on the spectrum and  their speech is brilliant and very entertaining. I really hope that Beauty will get to be so good. In lots of ways I feel that Beauty has greater understanding and intelligence than  some other children locally who are the same age as Beauty, Beauty's problem is communicating what she knows. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://whitterer-autism.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/saturday-january-212007-wow-yep-im-late.html", "title": ""},

{"date": " January 10, 2007", "body": "\nAfter 2 days of blogging on politics I have decided to return to my shallow roots and discuss 'something less boring instead'..............that's right TV. Joy of joys Shameless is back and still one of the funniest shows on TV and yes it still reminds me of where I live. Mostly because it is filmed on an estate in Manchester that is similar to our estate, though our estate is smaller of course. It is constructed on the Radburn type estate which originated in the USA Radburn  was founded in 1929 as \"a town for the motor age\" Its planners, Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, and its landscape architect Marjorie Sewell Cautley aimed to incorporate modern planning principles, which were then being introduced into England's Garden Cities, following ideas advocated by urban planners  Ebenezer Howard and Sir Patrick Geddes. Radburn was explicitly designed to separate traffic by mode with a pedestrian path system that does not cross any major roads at grade. Radburn introduced the largely residential \"superblock\" and is credited with incorporating some of the earliest cul-de-sacs in the United States. So what does that mean? It means that people come and go through your back door because that is where the road is and councils up and down the UK are now re-designing the estates to incorporate pavements on the outsides of the estates. We live in what locals call a back-to-front house and you do not answer the front door because it is only people selling things! Rumor has it that drug dealers live in the flats, of course we have the 'burglar boys' in the flats behind us but for them I think it is really a part-time hobby as they are really not that good at being burglars. Like 'Shameless' we do have funny moments on the estate, we have one resident who chases cars like a dog when he is drunk and he also goes to the local garage which is also a 24 hour shop and picks up what food he wants and walks out without paying for it! Neighbors regularly call the ambulance to come and get him as he is lying comatose in the road. Apart from that he is no trouble really. When husband number 2 died we were leaving for the funeral and the  people at the end of the road were having a  fight in the road, the  wife could see the funeral cars coming  but not the husband who continued to shout and scream . The poor wife  looked as if she wanted the road to open up and swallow her. However, I think husband number two would have found the situation highly amusing.........most definitely! Shameless   saw the return of Monica, Frank's real wife. Marty shows up with a baby that Kev and Veronica have bought in an Eastern European country and the Maguires move into Kev and Veronicas house(imagine living next to the Maguires)...........oh yes and  the Maguires give Lip a silver knuckle duster for his 18(19) birthday! And scarily I find this funny. We also watched a show called  The Baby Borrowers  it is a reality show where youngsters who want more independence are given a house for a month to see how they will cope with house keeping, jobs, babies, toddlers, pre-teens, teens and finally seniors. One girl had previously looked after a pretend baby as part of a school project, when the baby wouldn't stop crying she put it in her wardrobe under clothes to keep it quiet! Funnily enough the pretend baby died BUT the girl got 33% for the project! What the FLIP! I call a dead baby a 0%, a FAIL even if the baby is pretend. She was very proud of her achievement. In the show she started arguing with the baby(a bit one sided I know) because the baby would not stop crying. Thankfully the mother, who was watching on CCTV , stepped in and explained the correct way to deal with the situation. Sam on the show bosses her boyfriend around constantly and does as little as possible and is always having a paddy and walking off , Fisnik  is a male  chauvinist  pig and is constantly telling his girlfriend what to do and is always having a paddy and walking off(see a pattern forming). Compared to these youngsters my 15 year old is a star, she is brilliant at multi-tasking. She can clean(sometimes without being asked), watch her 6 year old sister Beauty who is autistic and will even change nappies(not poop ones though-I am the official 'poop checker'). Beauty and Fiona are best friends but I don't know how long it will last as they now compete for computer time. Yes that's right, a 6 year old and a 15 year old fighting over a computer(guess who always wins!).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radburn,_New_Jersey", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377260/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/baby_borrowers/about_the_show.shtml"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/after-2-days-of-blogging-on-politics-i.html", "title": "\nI LOVE TV.............AM I SHALLOW?

{"date": " January 21, 2007", "body": "\n IT'S HAILING AGAIN! WEATHER AGAIN! Yikes it was cold this morning when I got up, having a very large stone kitchen floor doesn't help! I definitely think the Romans had the right idea with their underfloor heating. We have an area between the front and the back of the kitchen where the hot water  pipes run under the floor and that spot is really good to stand on, it is a pity the rest of the floor can't be so warm. Well at least the hailstorm has finished! My neighbour,The Weatherman would be impressed at my increasing ability to discuss the weather, his ability far surpasses my own however and I am sure if requested he could discuss isobars and The Beaufort scale. WHEN BEING COLD CAN BE A GOOD THING       Duck survives two days in fridge A duck in the US state of Florida has survived gunshot wounds and a two-day stint in a refrigerator. A hunter shot the duck, wounding it in the wing and leg. Believing the bird was dead, he left it in his fridge at his home in Tallahassee.The hunter's wife got a fright when she opened the fridge and the duck lifted its head, a local veterinarian said.Staff at the Goose Creek Animal Sanctuary who are treating the bird said it has a 75% chance of survival. So  Pianoman , when is it a good time to eat duck? NEVER! Last night I watched the drama  The Trial of Tony Blair  and whilst it was hugely entertaining and very funny in parts, I have decided that teaching your children to be constantly questioning can sometimes be a pain in the butt. We sat there saying, 'Ooh that wouldn't happen' and Ooh it wouldn't quite happen like that,' but even still we did find it accurate enough to watch a lot of it through our fingers. I would like to say however that in the  University Hospital of Wales,  before they had the Casualty Unit(Emergency Room) I worked on the Emergency Admissions Unit . Here we had patients who did not need to go through the casualty(more medical emergencies) but straight to specialist wards such as patients with continuing conditions, women with gynecological and obstetric problems, heart problems etc. Within minutes of the patient entering the unit their observations( Bp , pulse,  resps  etc) were started and continued throughout their stay in the department. They may not have seen the Doctor straight away but their conditions were monitored by the nurses throughout their stay. The staff in the Emergency Admissions(which is now combined with the casualty unit) were totally professional, efficient, friendly and kind and you couldn't have wanted for better staff to take care of you. AND the walls were always clean! I do not believe that Tony Blair would have been left so long unattended and the situation implied that he wasn't seen by anybody. However, I was glad to see it portrayed this way, I was glad that the reality of long waits in a casualty unit were shown and also Mr Blair seeing  faeces  and blood splattered on a wall and an almost total absence of staff due to them being being busy elsewhere. And all this as a result of the government mismanagement of funding. I also believe that Tony Blair watched this program because there is no way he wouldn't want to see how he was portrayed and I hope he was suitably shocked and warned about the future. The acting in it was absolutely brilliant but I do not think that there will be a Knighthood any time soon for  Robert Lindsay  who portrayed the prime minister! \"Night has brought to those who sleep, only dreams they cannot keep\" Enya Good news on the sleep front, Beauty fell asleep at 9pm and awoke at 8:30am! A few wriggly-wakes during the night but she pretty much slept through the night! Perhaps with this increase in sleep time my memory and clarity of thought might return...............nah! I think that my ability to think clearly and remember things went long ago, about the same time as my knees! At the moment Beauty is playing on the computer whilst reading my Knitting and Crochet book, Beauty loves to turn pages of books and  look at pictures . \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6283677.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6283677.stm", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.channel4.com/more4/drama/t/trial_tony/index.html", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.cardiffandvale.wales.nhs.uk/portal/page?_pageid=33,480679,33_480680&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.robertlindsay.net/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/hold-my-hand-for-it-is-cold.html", "title": "\n\" HOLD MY HAND FOR IT IS COLD\"\n"},

It is  ok  for the likes of Michael Jackson as he is a fruit loop(remember we are all mad but some are madder than others!) but please-are they just crazy or lazy? If I showed up at Beauty's school wearing my pj's I am sure they would contact social services! AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON BIG BROTHER! I watched five minutes and that was all I could cope with, Jo is such an obnoxious moo! Dirk came into the bedroom after being outside and Jo asked how Dirk was and he said,'Good' and then she asked him something like how are you feeling today and he said 'It's bloody cold out there'. And then when he left the room she bitched about him saying he was rude and ignorant and I was just amazed at where she got that from. No he isn't her best friend and that is because she has been such a sh*t to  Shilpa . Cleo has joined Jo and Danielle's little group and they have become the new 'Witches Three'. Yep, enough is enough, even 5 minutes is too much time out of my week if they are going to be mean to each other all the time. MY 15  SECONDS  OF FAME! I saw this article on the BBC Wales website        Tell us how Wales should be run     The Welsh assembly has power over key areas of our lives - including health, the environment and education. In May, voters will go to the polls to decide who will run Wales for the next four years. As part of its election coverage, the BBC is looking for 60 people from all walks of life to give their views on crucial issues right up to polling day. People from this group - the BBC Wales 60 - will take part online, on radio and on television. Anyone living in Wales can be involved - whether or not you intend to vote - with the chance to have your say on election issues as varied as the  NHS  and public transport, teaching standards and recycling.  So I decided to email them and see what they thought and they got back to me and today Beauty and I were interviewed and filmed for and will be on Wales Today. I shall get somebody to record it for me but I don't know if I could ever watch it. Yes I know I am very sad, well at least I got to give my opinion on the Welsh Assembly and education and Special educational needs funding. I definitely have no desire to be famous, I could not imagine anything more awful.

{"date": " January 24, 2007", "body": "\nLast night I had a rubbish sleep and it was nothing  to do with the 6 year old, believe it or not  the 17 year old and the 21 year old were both vying for the place of biggest pain in the a*se! The 17 year old is a teenager(enough said!) but the 21 year old should know better. On the ground floor of my house I have had a bedroom  and kitchen extension built because of my disability and because I sleep downstairs I hear anything that goes on in the downstairs of the house.LAST NIGHT WAS NO EXCEPTION! SnoWhite is sleeping over as she is going to Vienna today to visit Anastasia and Dimitri and Ariel is at the house because she saw her young man last night who lives in a place called Pontprennau which is 5 minutes from the house(though I am not happy that she came in at 1:30am on a school night).I love the way 17 year olds think you are stupid and at 45 you cannot possibly remember what it was like to be 17, I do remember only too well which is the problem! Last night Ariel and SnoWhite just would not shut up, anyone would think I did not have an upstairs with 4 bedrooms. Churches unite over adoption row The Church of England has backed the Catholic Church in its bid to be exempt from laws on adoption by gay couples. Catholic leaders in England and Wales say its teachings prevent its agencies placing children with homosexuals and they will close if bound by the rules. Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and his counterpart in York, John Sentamu, have written to the PM. They say \"rights of conscience cannot be made subject to legislation, however well-meaning\". The Equality Act, due to come into effect in England, Wales and Scotland in April, outlaws discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services on the basis of sexual orientation.  The head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, has denied claims by secular and gay-rights activists who have accused him of using \"blackmail\" in a bid to secure exemptions. So the Catholic church says it will close it's adoption agencies if it can't discriminate against gay couples. Good. 'Religion' should have nothing to do with how a child is placed with an adoptive family . An unsigned British band have reached a settlement with Coca-Cola over the soft drink giant's use of their material in a television commercial. The band, 7 Seconds of Love, argued that Coke used their song Ninja and its distinctive kitten-filled video without permission in a South American advert. After talks, Coke agreed to an out of court settlement of an undisclosed sum. Good. I have never been impressed with  Coca-Cola  and their employee relations. Yes the companies that produce their product in certain countries maybe 'concessions' but Coca-Cola should still take responsibility for how these companies treat their employees. Last night I read a blog entry from my friend at  holyflamingsmoke oh no, what have I done? . The blog entry is about crime and it made me think about where I live and how safe I feel.Cardiff probably has the same crime rate as any where else but I don't think that it is really that bad. However,  did you see this news report about Cardiff High Belle?       Girl robbed on her way to school A girl was grabbed by a masked man and robbed as she walked to her secondary school through woods in Cardiff.     The girl, a pupil at Cardiff High School in the Cyncoed area, handed over the money and continued her journey to school while the man ran away. The incident happened near Lake Road North at around 0820 GMT on Tuesday, say police, who want information.   She must have been walking through the wild gardens.DUH! I would never feel safe walking through any woods during the day.Nowhere is really safe today but I think the criminals where I live are like Bernie from TORCHWOOD. They would sell their own grandmother(metaphorically) but harmless really.......well where I live anyway. The estate that I live on is a Local Authority housing estate but approximately 60% of the houses are now privately owned. Even though the houses were built in 1976 the estate has the atmosphere of a more established estate with families who have lived here since the estate was built. We have the Burglar Boys, small time drug selling(well gossip says so) and vandalism but it really isn't too bad a place to live.Compared to  The Estate  that Colin and Justin are working on where I live is positively idyllic. Anyway, I am one of lifes worriers and have somebody murdered so close to your own home must be very scarey, my heart goes out to anybody who has to live in that situation. It seems that tomorrow that I will be on WalesToday, the lunchtime and evening news. You will be able to see the recording on their website. I shall record it from the TV but not watch it, I am not brave enough!Watch out for Beauty's 15 seconds of fame!This morning I dropped SnoWhite off in town at the bus station for her trip to Vienna, I hope everything is ok as she is flying from Stanstead and there is a lot of snow that end of the country( It also seems that within Stanstead airport you have to catch a train to get to your  departure gate, a bit like Newark I guess but SnoWhite is afraid she will get lost and miss her stop!).

I am ok with her joining the army but if she gets a posting to a war zone I have warned her that I shall tell the army about her undiagnosed Tourettes(think about it, Tourettes in a war zone! scary).I think she would be good teaching Arabic in some safe army training college(well I can hope can't I?).

It seems that she may have been attacked for her handbag, most people would give you their last penny if they thought you really needed it but killing for what was probably only a small amount of money is so pointless.

I may give my opinions on others on TV but you know my name and you can email me and tell me if you think I am being unfair or a sh*t anytime you want to . What is it with  cyberbullying?  I think it is  a bit like the  school text bullies  who are so big and strong that they do what they do anonymously. I am not ashamed to watch TV and enjoy it. As a family we watch a lot less TV  than other people we know because we do such a lot with our lives but that doesn't give anyone else the right to be so pompous and judge us. Last time I looked the laws of this country said that watching TV was not illegal(not even reality TV!) and as I have free agency I shall continue to exercise my free agency doing something that I enjoy that hurts no one else.

{"date": " January 22, 2007", "body": "\n       'Altruistic' brain region found    Scientists say they have found the part of the brain that predicts whether a person will be selfish or an altruist. Altruism - the tendency to help others without obvious benefit to oneself - appears to be linked to an area called the posterior superior temporal sulcus. I personally have always felt that altruism was more a learned behaviour. On the TV show CHILD OF OUR TIME there was an episode that talked about how much empathy a child had towards other people and in an experiment one child seemed to have no empathy towards the mother at all. I also felt this mother came across as cold and unloving(why I don't know, it could have been post-natal depression) and I felt this  resulted in the child failing to show any empathy. The article goes on to say   He added: \"If you can educate from an early stage to be more altruistic that would be good for the community, and if you could also show that had an impact on brain development that would be very interesting.\" He said true altruism was a rare or even intangible thing. I have also felt that adult behaviour  is never truly altruistic. Yes you have those who do missionary work, Nuns for example who live a religious life but can you ever be fully altruistic? Why do people do what they do? Yes I agree that people do good things for many reasons, I donate to charity as much as I can and I try and do charitable acts but why? I do them because I want to ease the pain and suffering of others, I want others to have a better life AND because it makes me feel better when I do it-I feel good about myself. Why does a religious person do what they do? Same as me I guess and they want a reward in the next life. Sounds good to me, we all have our own reasons for doing things but I don't believe that you can be 100% altruistic. I believe also that mankind was  physically created with the inability to be truly altruistic and to need to  do things for 'selfish ' reasons so as to make them actually do things. An example- think about sex........take away the sex drive, attraction, the lust aspect, the emotion and what have you go? Just a very embarrassing, stupid thing-people would say,'I'm not doing that!'. Mankind had to reproduce itself in some way so the emotions served a purpose. The things that parents do for children however are different and here I think that you can be truly altruistic, the parent who gives food to their child and doesn't eat themselves because there is not enough, parents who give kidneys for children - you know the kind of thing. However, perhaps the 'experts' would not put the child -parent situation in the mix. I do believe though in what was suggested in the article about educating from an early age so you could see changes but it is not something that could happen in isolation, you need to teach the parents and the children at the same time or it might not work. I feel strongly about green issues, healthy eating and living and community values being taught in schools as the children then go home and teach the rest of the family. I am  suggesting that teachers(as a lot of them already do) incorporate the positive into their existing teaching schedule. AND yes I know that teachers time is limited  but many teachers already do these thing and do see a change in the attitudes  of the children for the better. AND before you all think that the whole of what I have just written was to culminate in this final rant on one of my 'issues'  I need to say that  I only just thought of the relevance of this. Parking outside of schools. It is a nightmare everywhere, not just in the two schools close to my house. But I do think there is a solution. I have heard of a project whereby the parents, teachers and children take it in turns to be parking wardens outside of their schools. They cone off the Zig-Zag lines and the dangerous areas and confront parents who do not park considerately and legally. They also take photos of persistent 'offenders' and give them to the police. I do believe that educating the child in this situation would have a huge impact on the behaviour of the parents and so produce greater safety and anti-social behaviour and when the child is older they are less likely to park in a dangerous and anti-social way. Children though I think are different, I have heard of many instances of truly altruistic behaviour in children. I have a niece who when she was little would have given you her last sweet, I don't know if she still would but I think that children lose their naturally altruistic behaviour by watching adults. Now that is a really sad thing. Perhaps instead of  us looking to teach the children  perhaps we adults should look to learn from the child........little children are a lot nicer than the average adult! Remember don't quote me on any of the above, I could be wrong. I am certainly not an expert in psychology or any other -ology for that matter , just a mother who sees her own children and the world around her and comments on it. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6278907.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6278907.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/be-nice.html", "title": "\nBE NICE!\n"},
{"date": " January 30, 2007", "body": "\nAs I sit here necking back medication , I think again about what life must have been like before the advent of all these drugs.I think watching  Cadfael  on TV was my first real experience of seeing somebody prepare and use natural products in healing and yes I was impressed. I also remember seeing the girls making a love potion in  Practical Magic but I think I was too interested in  Goran Visnjic  to notice much else of what was going on! I love the idea of using herbs and natural products as healing remedies and if that was my only alternative then I would definitely use them but unfortunately they just  do not do it for me. Hobbling around first thing in the morning with joints that have as yet not woken up with the rest of my body  is not fun and the thought of a life without their effects is just too awful to contemplate. Yes I am lucky to be able to live in a country where I can make an appointment and see a doctor, and get the medication I need(well if the Welsh Assembly has approved it and doesn't think it is too expensive).It must be awful to need expensive medications and find that your county or country does not provide it. I am grateful for everything that Beauty gets but getting certain things for her can be a lot harder work. I am a strong advocate of justice and I  believe  that all children deserve the best but when the Local Education Authority makes me me grovel and beg for money to pay for essential services at Beauty's school I want to shout at them that they at least need to give me a little dignity. Whilst my employment history has been patchy due to my child bearing years, I have contributed whenever I have been working and Beauty's dad has worked all his adult life so don't make me feel that that I am begging. But them I should be grateful that they treat all parents equally and fairly, they make us all beg and grovel! PROOF POSITIVE THAT I AM IN NEED OF A HOLIDAY This morning after dropping Beauty off at school I went up to ASDA, Pontprennau to buy some things for my holiday. For a while now I have felt that ASDA has had a supply and demand problem, it is a case of you buy a product when you see it or the next time you go it is gone and it never comes back. Last week SnoWhite went to Vienna to visit Anastasia and Dimitri and she bought a really nice suitcase from ASDA to use, so this morning I thought I would go and get one as the zip on one of mine broke on our trip to New Orleans. Big Mistake! all the suitcases were gone, totally gone, shipped out, not to be seen again. Then on the way out the clothes that I had bought for Beauty went off on the security alarm as they hadn't gone through the till scanner properly!Save me. Then I went to WHAT! a bargain shop to by some painting supplies and close to the  entrance as you went in was a 4 poster bed for a dog! F-O-R---A---D-O-G! I kid you not.Oh please! I am so losing my sense of humor. And the final  straw came at the till where a  'fur and no nickers' type watched as the shop assistant scanned all her purchases and then after paying and receiving her receipt, Mrs 'no nickers' stood there and allowed the assistant to pack her purchases(you are meant  to pack your own), unabashed. I would have been mortified and insisted on doing it myself. ON THE NEWS Big Brother bullies should seek professional help says Shilpa  Shilpa Shetty today spoke of her shock after seeing footage of the bullying against her for the first time.She told a national newspaper she had no idea the bullying was so bad until she watched the complete footage of her ordeal.The tearful Big Brother winner said she was \"deeply hurt\" and added: \"I can understand why people complained so much. It isn't just one or two attacks - it's incessant.\"And she said bullies Jade Goody and Jo O'Meara must seek \"professional help\" to overcome their problems. I couldn't agree more! Now this has p*ssed me off! Lone parents facing benefit cut Lone parents could face cuts to their benefits under government plans to get more of them into work. Currently, single parents receive payments until their youngest child is 16. Ministers want to cut that to 11. Work and Pensions Secretary John Hutton says this will stop lone parents moving \"seamlessly\" on to incapacity benefit once their child-related benefits stop. But charity One Parent Families said many of those affected by the plans were caring for disabled children. In a speech later, Mr Hutton will say Britain has one of the lowest levels of lone parent employment in Europe, with almost half on benefits. He will say he has evidence that up to a third of lone parents move on to incapacity benefit once their child benefit ends as their youngest reaches 16. Why just Lone Parents? What about couples? So if you are on your own and do not find a job you will lose benefit but if you are a couple it is ok! Is 'Welfare to Work' working in the USA?

{"date": " January 29, 2007", "body": "\nBusy day today yet I do not feel I have achieved much. My web design class this morning and a Doctors appointment this afternoon. I wonder why I bother making an appointment to see the Doctor.My surgery operates a system whereby if you phone before 9am you can see the Doctor that morning but you may have to sit and wait for an hour or two so I try the best I can to make an afternoon appointment and what happens? The appointment takes 9 days to get( and yes my toes could have dropped off with gangrene in the meantime ............imaginary example!) and what happens? I sit and wait for almost an hour so the Doctor can fit in EXTRA appointments  to be seen for less than 5 minutes to be told that yes my arm is really painful but the Doctor doesn't know why and do I want stronger tablets( remember I need to drive and take care of a very active 6 year old) and get a prescription for antibiotics for a not quite toe infection caused by bumping my toe repeatedly.They allocate 10 minutes per patient but I aim to be in and out in 5 but my Doctor assures me that many patients come more  for the chat than the medical advice. The government wants to  cap GP's wages , poor sods deserve every penny they get as I know I couldn't do what they do. GP pay 'should have been capped' By Nick Triggle Health reporter, BBC News The government should have capped the money GPs can make out of their new contract, the health secretary says.The proportion of profits GPs take out of their practices has increased since the new contract started in 2004, pushing average pay above \u00a3100,000.In an interview with the BBC News website, Patricia Hewitt said in hindsight ministers would have wanted to ensure doctors did not take so much.Doctors criticised Ms Hewitt, saying she was \"denigrating\" GPs. Being a nurse I have seen what they have to do and it is not always that pleasant and the smell would be an issue for me. I have very little sense of smell but today I noticed that two other patients next to me were smelling badly and if I could smell them it  must have been pretty bad. I think that my lack of smell has come from years working in nursing homes, I can usually  be directly over something and not smell it. Recently there was a celebrity Salon program on TV and the woman who usually did pedicures couldn't do one punter because her feet smelt so badly. I love doing feet, being the matron I used to do medications, dressings and paperwork and if I had time over I would do patients feet. I would soak them, wash them,put cream on and cut toe nails because whenever I saw a patients feet they were almost always dirty between the toes and none of the carers seemed to want to do them. Everyone whitters on about HOLISTIC care but in theory most(not all) carers that I have come across are more interested in doing as little as possible. Doctors have to deal with patients from all walks of life, from the streets to the very wealthy so they are put at risk daily from physical and verbal abuse and at risk of catching some pretty hideous infections and diseases. The constant stream of physical, social and mental problems with no end  must be soul destroying. I have a friend who trained at the same time that I trained as a nurse and he is now  a consultant, he deals with children with heart problems and I so could not do that. It takes a special person to do that kind of work. However, I also think it takes special people to clean toilets, deal with waste, clean and service drains, do basic rate jobs and be proud of what you do. I have been happy to work as a cleaner, cloakroom attendant, cook, and many other basic rate jobs to ensure my children were fed and clothed and warm. I feel that the government fails to to value work when it tries to push further education on people who may not be able to cope with it,I know there are certain things I could not do because I mentally could not keep up with the work. I was brilliant at exams thet had essay type answers but cold facts...........sorry I'm just not up to it. I could never have been a doctor because I could just not remember things in that way, I would have failed all my exams as I do not have a rote type memory. I have constanly told my girls that yes I am glad that they went to university, are going and will be going but I would have been just as happy if the had decided to be a nanny, a carpenter, a bricklayer, a plumber, a plasterer...........they all sound good to me. BIG BROTHER FINAL I have to comment but YES I am so glad it is over. I am glad that Shilpa won but I also feel that Jermaine deserved to win as he was such a class act. Danielle was wrong with what she did but she did go along way to redeeming herself by saying sorry whereas Jo says she stands by what she has said and would say it all again, NICE GIRL! Ian was also brilliant and should have come ahead of Dirk because I think that Dirk blotted his copy book by not standing up for Shilpa when he was meant to like her.This years show was such a revelation on how people really think and how life is a big act.Whereas life in my house is more a pantomime!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4918040.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6276793.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/busy-day.html", "title": "\nBUSY DAY\n"},

My 15 year old asked me  about the snow when I was younger, and she was thrilled to hear that I have memories of HUGE snowfalls from when I was small. I really have a memory(no not a collective family memory) of the winter of 1963, I would have just turned 2 and I remember looking out of the front bedroom window and snow drifts were up the side of the house to almost the bedroom window. I once told my sister who felt that my memory must have been of a later winter with really bad snow which I think was maybe 1969, but I have separate memories of that. My 21 year old also has an amazing memory and can remember things from when she was really very small. Yesterday I couldn't tell you about but 40 odd years ago is crystal.I remember holding a boys a hand on my first day of school, we had to go into the dining hall and we had to go in 2 by 2. Neil whose hand I held is now a London barrister, hearing about him on the internet, in the news etc. now is quite surreal. The later snow storm happened the year that the fire station in Cardiff Airport was being built, my father and the local policeman cut across the airport field(which was just behind our house) to help somebody .Whilst they were crossing the field the policeman fell into the snow filled repair pit in the fire station garage, the snow was that deep. I also remember the winter of 1977, traveling on a single decker bus from Rhoose to Cardiff through the airport, the snow drifts were bigger that the sides of the bus and there had been a couple of feet of snow underfoot. The 15 year olds response to this was WOW! And for once her comment was not tinged with sarcasm. When I was doing my degree we learned about the  LITTLE/MINI ICE AGE  and because of that I became fascinated with the history of climate change and how it has affected history. For instance Antonio Stradivari , the famous  violin maker, produced his instruments during the LIA. It has been proposed that the colder climate caused the wood used in his violins to be denser than in warmer periods, contributing to the superb tone of Stradivari's instruments. Well would you Adam and Eve it! One of my lecturers gave an example from popular children's literature, remember The Famous Five books? Well his opinion was that they had cold winters and hot summers, perfect weather , after the end of the mini ice age with the warming up of the climate and when the books were written with the escalating climate change, that time frame did have more predictable weather. Allegedly! Well its a theory anyway.

I left them to it and drove to  Tesco  to buy food for Beauty for school, I was too tired to go to the shop last night.

I arrived home to find the electricity working and a little bit of normality restored(if that is possible in my home!).

Yesterday I found Beauty playing with a pumpkin light that we had at Halloween and I asked her what it was called and she said,' PUNKY ', well it's close enough for me.

{"date": " February 13, 2007", "body": "\nUPDATE ON MY BIRTHDAY Well I am absolutely frazzled after such an early start, and most of my day has been spent at a funeral.A long term family friend, Emily Butler died, she was 93. I have known her since I was 14 and she was an absolute star. A lady in the true sense with a fantastic sense of humor. As the years have passed my attitude to dying has changed so much, when they have lived a full life like Emily then their passing at a good age holds no regrets only peace and is a blessed release. It was an honour to have known her. Her family were all at the funeral and it was nice to see them all again. Whilst we were standing at the grave I was reminded of a story, forgive me for not remembering it exactly but I shall try my best. I was about a mother whose child died and she was so distraught that she took the dead child to a wise man and begged him to bring her son back. The wise man told her to go to the houses of all the people in the town and collect a pebble ( I can't remember what it was exactly) from the homes of all those who had not lost someone and suffered. She was not able to find any house that had not lost someone and suffered and so was able to accept the loss of her child. As I stood at the grave I looked at the group of people who had come together, family and friends, people I have known for over 30 years and  I could not see a  person that had not lost a child, a husband, a wife , a parent or a loved one. Such is the path of life, we love, we care and loved ones pass on and we carry on but not forgetting. I still think of loved ones who have left my life and I think of them in the way you think of a relative that you do not see very often but you think of every now and then with affection. So whilst going to a funeral on your birthday is not what most people would choose, celebrating the life of a great lady was a fine thing to do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/in-celebration.html", "title": "\nIN CELEBRATION\n"},
{"date": " February 11, 2007", "body": "\n I love watching TV commercials and I find them highly entertaining but usually the more entertaining they are then the more likely I am not to remember who made the advert. For instance *the coloured balls falling down the hill(is it in San Francisco?) *the copycat advert of fruit falling down a hill in what looks like Swansea *the exploding paint and the tower blocks if my life depended on it I couldn't tell you what they were advertising. There is an advert out at the moment where a guy talks about your sinuses being the size of pinholes when you have sinus problems, this being the result of inflammation not from being blocked up with snot(nice thought!). I remember the advert because of the representation of lights shining through pinholes, I believe that the advert is for medication to unblock your sinuses but it could be for something like  Swarfega  for all I know.Sorry. Anyway, the point of the story is , I have mega blocked sinuses at the moment and I am not taking anything extra for it because of the medication I am already taking seems to be having an affect on the sinuses. And how do I  know? Well I take my horse tablet strength anti-inflammatory tablets to combat my arthritis issue in the day and my sinuses seem to be better and in control but during the night my sinuses get worse again and in the morning I awake to a thick  head ache and completely blocked sinuses again. And from this little life experiment it can be seen that yes the advert is probably true. And the real point of the story.......how many of us really believe anything anymore? we see adverts for cream that will make you look 10 years younger, cereal that will make you 10 lbs lighter and a car that if you purchase it  will turn into a metal ice skater and skate around a frozen lake for you! So when you see an advert that says your sinuses  will be helped by taking anti- inflammatory medication and not antibiotics ,do we believe the advert? Possibly not and why? As a people I feel we have become cynical and unbelieving because we have all been told so many lies and we have heard so many conspiracy theories. Please forgive me for going all deep over sinuses (I blame being sick) but I feel that by becoming a Global Village we have on the whole lost our  naivety . For instance, we all knew he had had 'relations with that woman' even when he said he hadn't, yes we knew that Kate Middleton and Prince William were an item even though they insisted they were only friends and yes we knew that Gary Glitter was a pervert even though he denied it. I believe that lying is all around us and little lies are ok as they make life acceptable( please lie about my fat bits...........I am happy with that). BIG lies are what causes problems, yes he was wrong to lie about his 'relations with that woman', the Prince William thing.............just don't treat us like we are all stupid and as for Mr Glitter, again do not treat us as if we are stupid. As with the whole Big Brother racism debacle, just because you say you are not racist doesn't make it so, we saw and heard everything you did and said. Tony Blair p*sses me off most. Taken from Pm's  Respect Action Plan Launch Speech  10 January 2006 Chaotic families lack the basic infrastructure of order. Not all parents find the task easy. The usual barriers against a teenager falling into low-level crime are often absent. Often young men lack role models. Drug addiction leads directly into criminal markets.    There are a small number of families who are out of control and in crisis. It is those families whose children are roaming the streets and disrupting the classrooms. We have to help those oparents and their children. Mr Blair of course has a perfect family without problems. The incident for which Euan Blair was first attracted significant attention in his own right was in 2000, when, aged 16, he was found by Police collapsed and incapable in  Leicester Square , having spent the night celebrating his completion of his GCSEs   with friends. After being taken to a police station, he gave the police a false name, an old address, and a false date of birth that would have made him 18 (the legal age to purchase alcohol). The leaking of this to the press caused considerable embarrassment to Tony Blair, who had recently introduced measures to deal with young offenders. Regarding a potential prosecution, he told the  BBC 's  Question Time  that his son should not receive special preferences. In the end, Euan apologised for the incident, and was neither prosecuted, nor formally cautioned. Subsequently, the term \"Euan Blair\" has been satirically suggested by some as  rhyming slang  for \"Leicester Square\". But yet Mr Blair thinks his life should be private. He has a son who was found drunk in the gutter but whenever anyone tries to publish stories about his family he screams invasion of privacy. RESPECT. What a rant!

{"date": " February 15, 2007", "body": "\nI HAVE STARTED A NEW BLOG. The new blog is called ME AND MY WORLD. I shall continue to write on this blog about Beauty, the family and Autism and my new blog will be me writing about my views on   the world around me and my thoughts and opinions(I know, scary stuff!).On the new blog I  get to talk about politics, philosophy, religion(sorry guys!) and general world goings on. Just a separating of what I write about already. You can link under ABOUT ME on the main page , in my links or in my profile. Remember the film  ICE AGE ? Remember when Sid says,'Why am I the poop checker?' Well that is me! Beauty has been in nappies for 6 years and 4 months and that is way too long, I am afraid that we are going to have to deal with the situation. Over the last few months Beauty's language skills and understanding have increased immensely, so now is the time to put her new found understanding to good use. I think she will cope. Autism or not I am sure she will cope. A couple of years ago I bought  Potty Training in a Week  by Gina Ford, Beauty was obviously not ready for it, will I use the book this time? I was so impressed with the book that I did something I never ever do with books! I got rid of it! To all the Gina Ford fans out there.........sorry! Please do not comment on Gina Ford's book as she threatens to sue people who discuss it adversely  or criticise it. Autism can be a very tiring thing at times ,unfortunately autism is not a 40 hour a week job with two days off a week and 20 odd days holiday a year. Oh I wish at times! It is the night times that leave me most exhausted. However, Beauty learning to use the computer has been an absolute blessing, she loves it and it is definitely stretching her brain. I found this on Amazon  Toilet Training for Individuals with Autism & Related Disorders: A Comprehensive Guide for Parents & Teachers       by Maria Wheeler          , does anyone know if it is any good? I think I shall order it and give it a go. This a good article  Autism and Toilet Training -By Danica  Mamlet . This I thought was important impaired social interaction can be demonstrated by  \"the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction.\"  Impaired social interaction can also be regarded as a \"failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level\" as well as \" a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people\" and a \"lack of social or emotional reciprocity (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. 70)\". Often autistic children are happiest when left alone, not seeking out connections with parents or peers. Autistic children may actively avoid interactions with others, straining away to avoid eye contact or being held. An autistic child does not get pleasure, as typically developing children do, from making their parents happy or proud. They may be taught to say, \"I did it!\" or \"Look at me!\" but rarely think to do this on their own. That is so true. Beauty is not really interested in being praised for what she does which is an incentive for a normally developing child to do things. Beauty has learned in the last few weeks that she has to let me do her hair or she doesn't get to go back on the computer and she has become very obliging, this I feel might be a very good incentive to make her sit down on the toilet for a few minutes.A lot of children with learning difficulties have treats as incentives such as sweets and chocolates, as yet Beauty will not eat any sweets but will eat chocolates but I do not want to go down that road as she has such thin enamel on her teeth and at the moment she only eats chocolate rarely. Half term begins tomorrow with an inset day( a  buzzy  bee day) or teacher training day. I really feel that the teachers at Beauty's school really deserve the half term holiday as they are so hard working. I did part of my nurses training at another special needs school in Cardiff and it was such hard work.The communication difficulty I felt was the biggest problem that the children had and as communication increased then so did their ability to do other things. Here's hoping! Life will be quiet in Cardiff for the next 10 days as Ariel has gone to Florida to visit with her sister Belle and brother-in-law Beau. It will be the first time that Ariel has met Beau as Ariel was away when Beau visited us from the US and she was in Spain doing an expedition with army cadets when Beau and Belle got married. The weather here is still grey  and that 'nothing time' that C.S Lewis talked about in  Shadowlands  seems to be easing a little as I noticed at about 6pm that there was still some  daylight. I have never been one to  suffer from SAD( seasonally adjusted/affective  disorder) but I really do like it when the evenings start to draw out again. One summer we spent two weeks in Malta and I loved the way the locals spent their summer evenings either promenading along the front or sitting on the beach, it was brilliant. My idea of a relaxing life! We visited with family friends whilst we were there and they had moved from inland to a summer chalet for the summer and the father had to get up at 4am to be in work to lay a load of cement early as the weather was too hot later. The only thing I wasn't  keen on was the lack of anything green, because of the heat everything was brown and burnt. But I am sure that I could cope! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/ice_age/", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Potty-Training-Week-Gina-Ford/dp/0091912733/sr=8-1/qid=1171564878/ref=pd_ka_1/203-3041559-0689521?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Toilet-Training-Individuals-Related-Disorders/dp/1885477457/sr=8-1/qid=1171566992/ref=sr_1_1/203-3041559-0689521?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://www.behavioradvisor.com/Autism&Toileting.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/another-genesis.html", "title": "\nANOTHER GENESIS\n"},

{"date": " February 20, 2007", "body": "\nOops!Late again, sorry Vienna..........I know that you check in to see what's going on in the mornings. I must have been looking less 'miserable' this morning because Fiona asked me if I was feeling better! Don't worry , Fiona wasn't showing her softer side by showing an interest in my welfare, just wondering if I was well enough to take her over to the hairdressers to make an appointment for her. Which reminds me of Philip Schofield from This Morning when they had the knife throwing act on, even after the assistant had been struck(not badly of course) by a knife he could still be heard asking how many knives had gone into the board!That's it Philip, the show must go on. I think I must be feeling better,for the first time in ages I have woken up without feeling like I have been kicked in the head by a donkey. If it had been half term when I was really ill then I don't think that I could have coped with Beauty as well. Good news on the child minder front though, I have been granted extra respite care during school holidays which means that Beauty will be going out for an extra 3 hours tomorrow afternoon. Beauty went to Roath Park on Sunday but she wasn't too impressed with walking around the lake so they went back to the child minders house and Beauty happily played with toys for the rest of the afternoon.Oh what a fickle child, she usually loves walking around the lake. Momentary panic over, I couldn't find Beauty........I found her on the floor in the bedroom by the back door. Fiona is fast asleep on one of the beds and Beauty had made a bed for herself on the floor next to her sister and saying , 'Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight'. Beauty has gone into giggle mode(again) whilst chewing on a dinosaur, you couldn't make it up! Reality is definitely stranger than fiction. I was searching blogs today and I found one where a mother said that in Europe Doctors still believed that autism was caused by cold parenting.I haven't heard any doctor actually say that but I honestly believe that any Doctor who suggested to me that my child's autism was caused by my cold parenting would witness my less than cold reaction! A couple of times Beauty's sisters have commented on how affectionate I am with her and I think they feel that I was less affectionate with them but that wasn't true. I was just the same with them but they don't remember. Beauty was assessed by a psychologist when she started school and the psychologist said that her emotional development was that of approximately a 12 month old. It feels like we have had a toddler in the house for 5 years so they have witnessed the affection that you give to a toddler for a prolonged length of time. When Beauty was assessed by the psychologist her separation anxiety was also a major issue but I feel that has improved immensely. Now she is happy to go to bed, stay in bed on her own and will go to sleep without anyone staying with her. Though we do think that she has an issue with the window and maybe it frightens her a bit when she goes to bed so I am going to put up some  larger, wider curtains so she can't see the night sky at all (though she does love being out in the dark so I wonder if she is afraid..............only when she starts talking properly will we really find out).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/oopslate-again-sorry-vienna.html", "title": "\nBETTER LATE THAN NEVER!\n"},

{"date": " February 17, 2007", "body": "\nAND I CANNOT GET BACK TO SLEEP! WHY? This time it is not daughter number 6( who is profoundly autistic, she is sleeping like a baby!), it is not daughter number 3 (who is somewhere on the spectrum and woke me at 5am yesterday!) BUT daughter number 5 (who is also on the spectrum and lives on the planet Fiona!). I awoke to to find her asking me could she cook pasta! I blame all night TV, she is watching a house makeover show! When I was growing up there was no all night TV and only at the weekends did we have late night films. Fiona like  SnoWhite (21 year old sister) is somewhere on planet autism. I have read a lot about autism(hasn't every parent of a child on the spectrum?) and there seems to be approximately 4 boys who are on the spectrum to every girl but that is just a statistic and obviously varies from area to area. I was quite surprised to read recently that in Utah in the USA the ratio for girls being on the spectrum is higher(I wish I had noted the article) and this was being discussed on someones blog in the light of Utah's polygamist history(possible reduced gene pool) and the possibility of autism being a genetic thing. I have also read that autism is a male-brain thing.........you cannot comprehend(unless you have been there!) what it is like to be in a household where 3 girls, with three sets of female hormones rushing around and on the spectrum, can possibly be like. Fiona and  SnoWhite  are like a pair of feral cats when they set to each other, fights between them are infamous!Yet it is usually not a physical thing, they have the same nasty habit of giving one punch and then running like a squealing rodent. When the civil partnership laws came in in the UK I read what one gay man said, 'if you thought divorce was bad before then you have no idea what it will be like when two gay men separate', yep,I can imagine that the fur would fly. Autism in our house is definitely not a totally male-brain thing. I have seriously hurt my wrist on one  occasion  holding one of them back. AND don't forget my autistic tendencies too.........but I am more the type who likes no noise, everything in it's place and just a quiet life really and there is nothing wrong with that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/i-am-awake-and-it-is-0425-am.html", "title": "\nI AM AWAKE AND IT IS 04:25 AM!\n"},
{"date": " February 16, 2007", "body": "\n AND BOY AM I PI**ED OFF! Why am I, I hear you ask? Because it is 5:30am on a school inset day and I and Beauty should be still asleep. Who woke us up? The daft bat of a 21 year old who has been on the computer all night photo-shopping photos of Beauty, suddenly she decides to watch a Grey's anatomy video on  YouTube  , WITH MUSIC..........! 'I'm sorry' she says 'I thought it was on quiet'. HELLO..................NO It woke Beauty up and she got out of bed and came and stood next to me and said,'READY'. Yep, I'm ready at 5am on a school in-set day to get out of bed and sit in a chair trying to wake up, doing a fair representation of someone experiencing catatonic symptoms! Autism and it's behavioural tendencies are not reserved for the likes of Beauty,(profoundly autistic children) but can be seen in the likes of you and me and a daft 21 year old! Don't get me wrong, I love the 21 year old but her  issues can be a heck of a lot more tiring than the 6 year old. When I look back and assess the signs that were there I can honestly say that yes it was easy to see she was autistic but the Doctor couldn't accept that she was autistic because she could 'pretend play' by pouring a toy tea pot into a cup! Give me strength..........Beauty can do that. Oh good the consultant was wrong, Beauty can pretend pour tea so she can't be autistic. I am sorry for my sarcasm, yes I accept that this was coming up to 20 years ago and autism had only really been defined 40 or so years before that BUT If I knew about it and could read the signs then so could the Doctor. The Doctor was just a little bit older that me, not an out-of-date GP who had qualified in the 1050's. SnoWhite  saw a speech therapist because she had speech but lost it, she had a lot of obsessive behaviours (I know, who doesn't!), a serious lack of awareness of danger and very little empathy but having said that she was the sweetest darling little girl. She very rarely spoke to teachers in school all the way through her primary school years and Fiona was diagnosed with the same type of selective  mutism  after also having speech but losing it.  SnoWhite  was diagnosed as having the same type of processing problems as Beauty but at the age of 21, not 2. In school the teachers were just grateful to have a quiet, well behaved girl. I do feel that  one  of the reasons for so many more children being found to be autistic is the fact that we are now more aware and have the confidence to say to doctors what we really think. If  SnoWhite  had been diagnosed early like her sister then I would still have wanted a mainstream education for her but I doubt whether it would have been through the medium of welsh. I feel that learning a phonetic language didn't help with her processing and she would have made greater strides just being taught through her first language  which she is being taught through now in university. I  once attended a lecture where the idea was explored that we all are on the spectrum and exhibit signs. I  can look back on things my parents said and did and yes they each had a number of behaviours that were autistic. I also have a lack imagination in certain areas and have difficulty accepting many things, at times my mind can be very literal. I look back at the behaviours of the girl's fraternal grandfather and he also had a lack of imagination in certain areas and lived a very set lifestyle. Sorry girls! You didn't stand a chance. And as for Beauty's Dad..............a distinct lack of imagination and rigid behaviours there too.What was I thinking? Remember the old joke.............look at the mother-in-law to see what the daughter will look like one day ! Well I think the same is true with the way we behave. In the evenings I can be found sitting at the kitchen table reading a book- I also love books. I prefer to stay in rather than go out and I love my garden..........now that sounds like my mum. Or are they just learned behaviours? Who knows. See..........she should be asleep.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/i-am-awake.html", "title": "\nI AM AWAKE!\n"},
{"date": " February 18, 2007", "body": "\nBefore I went to sleep last night I instructed my children that A-They were not to wake me up by asking me stupid questions ie Can they cook something at stupid o'clock. B-They were not to listen to music and wake me up C-They were not to make ANY noise and wake me up The warnings worked. Beauty slept in until gone 8am! And me with her. I agree with the theory that autism cannot be 'cured' but it sure as heck can be taught. Having a sense of humor definitely helps when you are not well. I have been unwell now for about 3 weeks, it started when I caught a cold on holiday in Feurteventura. Beauty bounced back after about a week of being unwell but I think that I caught different bugs from different people rather than the first bug lasting so long. Everyone in my website design class was ill with sniffles etc and everyone in my digital scrap booking class also had coughs and colds. Also Beauty's teacher and teacher's aides have also been off with the 'winter flu' virus that seems to be hitting the local hospitals. I spent yesterday feeling dizzy and disorientated and I was worried(as a nurse I worry about all medication) that it might be to do with the decongestant medication I was taking so I did not take my last dose last night. After a very bunged up nose kind of night, with dizziness and disorientation persisting and head throbbing I am now convinced that the decongestant tablets were not the cause of my dizziness etc but were making me feel tons better! My nose and head feel like my nose is broken,  I dropped a lava lamp on my nose  when Beauty was a baby and it feels just like that.(Yes, what kind of idiot drops a lava lamp on her nose I hear you ask!ME)It is actually quite surprising how strong Beauty's head is, she re-broke my nose a few times by accidentally head butting me! We seem to have a tendency for breaking noses in our family, Anastasia was the first. Swiveling on an office type chair when she was about 6 or 7 she fell forwards onto the edge of a desk and broke her nose! SnoWhite was helping to pull the fold-down seats up on our 7 seater and it swung back so fast it caught her in the nose! Ouch. Anastasia re-set it for her on the spot!Thank you Anastasia, you are not just a pretty face! Ariel seems to break toes and wrists a lot(like me) but not noses, and Fiona and Belle have broken their wrists but again not their noses. I don't think that we are a particularly accident prone family, it is just that there are a lot of us. Beauty went through a spate of being in  Casualty every few weeks or so but thankfully that is over! Beauty's first visit to casualty was  her second Christmas when she found a twinkle light holder under the Christmas tree and put it on her finger like a ring, it was so tight that she had to have it cut off(the ring not the finger) with a ring cutter before her finger, which had turned blue, fell off. Beauty has a very high threshold for pain so we have to watch her carefully as she could break bones and not make a fuss! Beauty continues to wear her new hat, with the bells tinkling on the hat I keep thinking that next-doors cat must be somewhere in the house. I wonder if giving an autistic child a hat with bells was such a good idea! Beauty loves to jump and flap her arms so the noise can be constant at times, there must be a lot of angels out there getting their wings at the moment. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/every-time-bell-rings.html", "title": "\nEVERY TIME A BELL RINGS..............\n"},
{"date": " February 19, 2007", "body": "\nBeauty has her giggle pants on today! Everything is a laughing matter as far as she is concerned. I took her out to the shops today and every few minutes she would burst into spontaneous laughter, perhaps she was seeing fairies again! As we turned into ASDA (WALMART)car park, Beauty could hardly contain herself with joy, ASDA(WALMART) means a new comic.Beauty is now a connoisseur of comics, when we get to the comics  she has to handle each comic and assess the quality of the free gift.I don't think she realises how lucky she is when it comes to comics, on Fuerteventura we found only one comic all the time we were there, thankfully we had taken some old ones with us. Today's toy is a xylophone and Beauty went around the shop playing and singing. Even though I am still feeling really rough, Fiona informs me that I do not look  ill only miserable! Such is honesty. Who needs friends when you have children on the autistic spectrum. Perhaps I look o.k because the sicker I feel, the more slap I put on.Gee you can't win.Definitely the worst illnesses are the ones you can't see, not a lot of sympathy going begging when the only evidence of illness is what you say it is. My idea of sympathy is a child spontaneously filling or emptying a dishwasher for you without the threat of physical pain or being thrown out of the house. WONDERFUL NEWS! Beauty is 6 years old but wears clothes between 6 and 10 years old as she is quite tall for her age. ASDA(WALMART) recently started to sell an adult range of clothes which included a size 4 which is the same as a US size zero.Personally I think that ASDA should be ashamed of themselves. A size 4 is the equivalent of a child size 8, only very rarely can an adult be a size 4 and be healthy. ASDA(WALMART) has just reduced this new range of clothes and LOTS of the reduced clothes are a size 4. GOOD! Let us hope that ASDA(WALMART) has learnt from this. Morally and financially! ON THE SPECTRUM OR NOT? A-The young person who goes out on a winter's day in canvas pumps, flared jeans(scraping the floor by about an inch) wearing a white(!) coat and is shocked when they get soaked to the skin on their way home from university. OR B-The young person who when I mention that this months phone bill is approximately \u00a315 more than usual laughs naturally and honestly says, 'It was probably me'. Both of the above are the behaviour of SnoWhite, one would think that the behaviour in situation A was the sign of someone with a few issues but no, as a mother of six girls I would say that was pretty normal behaviour(for my girls and other girls locally) whilst admitting to the phone calls promptly and without guile is a bit unnerving and a bit more to worry about. A lot of children would probably hedge their bets and say nothing(or deny it). Thank you anyway for the honesty Snowhite!(Well I think I'm supposed to be grateful!).

BIG NEWS The BBC phoned me today and told me that they wanted me for their panel regarding the elections, so the serious  diet starts now, not tomorrow but now. And they want a photograph of me for their website so I have to seriously airbrush a picture of me. And to the news.       Elderly at risk in nursing homes link Elderly people were put at risk in two substandard nursing homes, says the Commission for Social Care Inspection.      A  whistleblower , who worked at Laurel Bank home in Halifax, told Panorama of \"mental torture\" and verbal abuse.The ex-worker said she had seen residents hit with towels, splashed with water and shouted at. One resident said she had been slapped in the face.The homes watchdog says Laurel Bank has improved but plans to shut another home in Halifax, the Haven. Tariq   Malik , whose family run the Haven, declined requests for an interview but said in a statement: \"Problems at the Haven are symptomatic of a much wider picture. Many small homes are struggling because they cannot afford to pay good salaries to get the right managers.\" Mr  Malik  said funding from local authorities was inadequate but that the company had learned \"painful but valuable lessons\". The Haven was appealing against closure and it wanted time to bring in a new manager, he said. Mr  Malik  insisted staff training had been improved, that \"improper restraint techniques no longer apply\" and that any member of staff accused of abuse was suspended while investigations were carried out.                 So what's new? When I worked as an agency nurse in many  of the care of the elderly establishments in South Wales I was shocked to find that much of the work was done by a core of hard working caring staff whilst the rest of the staff did as little as possible. Many of the staff were also  very unkind to the residents and did not care about them or their feelings, whilst others were downright nasty to them. To leave a person all night in their own waste to me is abuse and many carers would rather leave their residents all night and only change them and their beds at 6am. And what happens when you try and tell these carers they are caring enough? I have seen in the news of carers who have 'reported' qualified nurses for alleged abuse and it has turned out that there was no abuse and the abuse claims had come about because of the qualified nurse trying to make the carers 'care' more. Yes qualified nurses have abused patients and yes carers have also abused patients but as is suggested in the above article, it is 'symptomatic of a much wider picture'. The whole system of   residential and nursing homes needs to be thoroughly investigated and measures implemented to ensure the residents and patients are kept safe and are well cared for. Would I work in a  nursing or residential home again with the system as it is? Not on your life! The staff and the residents and the patients are just too  vulnerable as the situation stands. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6354867.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/better-late-than-never.html", "title": "\nBETTER LATE THAN NEVER\n"},
{"date": " February 22, 2007", "body": "\n Last night I watched a program on TV called My Family and Autism. Jacqui Jackson  had seven children, and all four boys have a form of autism. 14-year-old Luke tells the story of his family and provides a unique insight into how the world can seem to a child with autism. For his mother, Jacqui, the challenges of caring for her sons includes a relentless search for anything which may improve their life - a special diet, a consultation with a research optician, and a visit to an educational psychologist. But as Luke is always saying, \"different is cool\", and this special family more than proves it.  It is a repeat of a program that was shown on TV in 2003. At the time it was shown Beauty was approximately 2 nearly 3 years old and I remember being upset watching the show the first time because the youngest child who is profoundly autistic was so much better than Beauty. BUT I can now look back with experience and can accept that all children are different, even children on the autistic spectrum. The show had so many similarities to my own life and seeing the connections to my own life made me laugh. For instance, the typical night where the  children would not sleep!!!!!!!!! Sound familiar? How many nights have I spent with SoWhite and Fiona wandering around all night. As in the TV show, the sleep pattern of the profoundly autistic one is really the easiest to cope with. I have thought many times that The  Borrowers  must live in my house as so much seems to go missing. My children call my house the Black Hole of Pentwyn. In the TV show all the laces went missing from their shoes..................that is so something that would  happen in my house! Things disappear and show up years later! I have stopped asking why when I come across something weird in my house, now I just think O.K it is better not to know. We have many situations like 'sausage (or was it a chip) down the side of the cooker' in  Adrian Mole. For instance, I went on holiday approximately 18 months ago and returned to find the living room mirror cracked! My offspring had no clue as to how it happened and I really believe that they did not know. Bloody Faeries Again! I don't want Faeries in my house, I want  Brownies.  All my girls have been through Brownies and Guides and I love the story they tell in Brownies about the Brownies that secretly live in the house and do jobs and acts of service. \u00a35.50 an hour to any Brownie(of the adult helper variety) who wants to come live with me! Story Once upon a time, there were two little girls who lived in England with      their granny and their father. The girls played all day while the granny and      father had to work very hard. One day granny told the girls about the      Brownies, who used to do lots of things to help around the house. They are      gone now, she said, but we were always so much happier when they helped. The      girls wanted to know where the Brownies had gone and how to get them to come      back. Granny said, \"only the wise old owl knows!\"       That night, when everyone else was asleep,      one of the girls ran out of the house into the magic forest. There she found      the wise old owl. \"Please\", said the girl, \"where can I find the Brownies to      come and live with us? The owl said, \"I know where two live \u2013 right in your      house!\" She was very surprised! Tell me how to find them, she begged. He      told her to go to the pond in the magic forest, turn around three times and      say, \"twist me and turn me and show me the elf\u2026 I looked in the water and      saw\u2026\u2026.!\" The wise old owl said, \"When you finish the rhyme, you will see the      Brownie in the magic pond.\"       The girl went to the pond in the magic      forest and did as she had been told. She went back to the forest and found      the wise old owl and said, \" something must be wrong, I did all you told me      to do and I only saw myself! And I am not a Brownie!\" \" Are you sure?\" said      the owl. To be a Brownie, you must be ready to help those around you, make      friends wherever you can, and every day try to discover something new. \"I'd      like to be a Brownie\", said the girl. Then go home and try, the wise old owl      said kindly. He touched her hand with his feathers, and suddenly she was      back in her house, in her own bed.            Quietly, she woke up her sister, told her      all that had happened. Together the girls tip-toed into the kitchen and      began to clean the house. In the morning, when granny and father saw the      house, they wanted to know what had happened. \"Who did this?\" said granny      and father! The girls danced around and shouted, \"it's the Brownies!\" And      from that day on, theirs was a very happy house near the forest, all because      of the Brownies!  Last night SnoWhite's boy 'friend', a boy who is a friend came over to visit. He hadn't been over in a long time because SnoWhite has her own flat but recently she has taken to spending most of her time in my house(her flat is very cold). When he came and sat down in the living room the first thing that he said was,'Where is Beauty' and for a second I was a bit confused and said,' in her bed of course!' not remembering that the last time he visited Beauty was still awake and wandering around until 1am. How quickly you forget, having her in bed and asleep a few minutes later is such a blessing and something I thought would never happen. She now goes to bed promptly at 9pm, any earlier and she is up at stupid o'clock! perhaps going to bed earlier will come in time. Last night SnoWhites's boy 'friend' did not show up until about 11pm because he was at  Magic. That is Magic of the card variety, not tricks. No matter how hard I try and get my head around it ,Magic is just something I do not understand. Magic: The Gathering  (colloquially \" Magic \", \" MTG \", or \" Magic Cards \") is a collectible card game created by  Richard Garfield  and introduced in 1993 by  Wizards of the Coast , which was later purchased by Hasbro .  Magic  was the first example of the  collectible card game  genre and still thrives today, with an estimated six million players in seventy countries.  Magic  can be played by two or more players each using a deck of printed cards or through the internet-based  Magic: The Gathering Online  on a computer.   Each game represents a war between powerful  wizards    who use magical spells, items, and fantastic creatures depicted on individual  Magic  cards to defeat their opponents. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role playing games such as  Dungeons & Dragons ,  Magic  bears little resemblance to pencil-and-paper adventure games. Rather,  Magic  is more similar to  bridge or poker but with substantially more cards and more complex rules than other card games.  The world-wide popularity of  Magic  has spawned an  organized tournament system and a community of  professional magic players  as well as a secondary market for  Magic  cards.  Magic  cards can be valuable due to scarcity arising from their power and utility in game play or the aesthetic qualities of their artwork. Perhaps if I saw a game being played it might be different. SnoWhite also bought her boy 'friend' a steak as he hadn't eaten, I can still smell the steak this morning. Even though I am a vegetarian I still love the taste of meat. I don't eat meat because I really don't like the thought of the animal I am eating but that doesn't mean that I don't like the taste of meat. When I used to go out for a meal I ALWAYS ordered steak or a mixed grill and I loved every bit of it. I know that I physically could not eat meat as the thought would make me sick but still I lust after it. Ariel is still in Florida visiting Belle and she has been there about a week and comes back on Sunday. Yes Ariel I do miss you(and not just because it is quieter) and you being away reminds me how much I miss you and Belle and Anastasia in Vienna. See you soon Ariel and see you Anastasia and Belle in May for the wedding.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/listings/programmes.shtml?day=yesterday&service_id=4224&filename=20070221/20070221_2320_4224_28801_60", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118755/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Mole", "http://http//www.girlguiding.org.uk/brownies/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.epilogsys.com/ScoutingWeb/SubPages/Browniestory.htm", "http://www.epilogsys.com/ScoutingWeb/SubPages/Browniestory.htm", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_the_Coast", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_Online", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/last-night-i-watched-program-on-tv.html", "title": "\n'TWIST ME AND TURN ME AND SHOW ME THE ELF......................'\n"},

{"date": " February 24, 2007", "body": "\n BEAUTY SLEEP-Beauty made herself a little nest on the floor and fell asleep. Well last night was an experience that I hope not to repeat too quickly! Night terrors! Beauty woke up about an hour after going to sleep and she was absolutely hysterical with fear, nothing I could do would comfort her or make it better. She went back to sleep after about 30 minutes but her sleep for the rest of the night was very troubled. AND how do I know about night terrors? Well we've been there before but that was about 20 years ago with Belle who also had night terrors which lasted for about 2 years. And what are  night terrors? Well according to Wikipedia A  night terror , also known as  pavor nocturnus , is a  parasomnia   sleep disorder  characterized by extreme terror and a temporary inability to regain full consciousness. The subject wakes abruptly from the fourth  stage of sleep , with waking usually accompanied by gasping, moaning, or screaming. It is often impossible to fully awaken the person, and after the episode the subject normally settles back to sleep without waking. Nightmares and night terrors by  Trisha Macnair on the BBC Health Website Night terrors are more common in children than adults, tend to run in families and usually start before the age of 10 (most common age two to six). the  Wikepedia  article also goes on to say While each night terror is usually different, all episodes of the same person will generally have similar traits. One of the most common qualities of night terrors is a strong sense of danger. For these people there is always a being, tangible or otherwise, who wishes to hurt the sleeping person, or the sleeping person's loved ones. Many sufferers of night terrors are reluctant to speak of them because of their violent and often disturbing nature. Well that explains a lot(and no I am not being sarcastic). As I have said before, pre-internet was almost like a dark ages time and getting information on anything was a major undertaking. When Belle was experiencing her night terrors I could find nothing on night terrors in the library and so I asked a psychologist we knew if she had any idea what it was and she merely said that it could be caused by stress in the day time. Looking back that wasn't a lot of help and not completely accurate. I remember as a child waking up  from a dream and not knowing what the dream was about, I always felt that remembering the dream was just like a word on the tip of your tongue that you cannot remember. I have memories that the dream was something terrible and awful and it was about something I had done which was really bad(like a pre-schooler could have done something that bad!). And if I had these night terrors as a child why didn't I mention them? Because I was afraid that what I had dreamed, the really bad thing, was real and that I had done something really bad. There were  3 things I remember about the 'dream'(if there ever had been a dream), a huge endless dark cavernous space, a tiny black boat with sails on the sea with an ink black sky and the awful terrible feeling that I couldn't change something(what I don't know). I have had flash backs of the 'I couldn't change something' part of the dream and I still occasionally get it as an adult and each time I get it I feel sick with anxiety/ fear whatever...............not pleasant. The thought of a  a child like Beauty going through something like this is not pleasant. I remembering waking from these 'dreams' and being hysterical and crying and crying and crying and nobody coming to me. I am wondering now if the reason nobody came was because it wasn't the middle of the night as I had previously thought but Night terrors,  on the other hand, occur during a phase of deep non-REM sleep usually within an hour after the subject goes to bed. If everybody was still downstairs they may not have heard me crying which is comforting to know now but wasn't much help then. And because of the terrible fear I never discussed it with any one........silly moo! And as an adult I still occasionally get these night terrors, I awake with a terrible jump, I am absolutely terrified for no reason that I know of and my heart is racing and will not calm down. I then cannot sleep because I am worrying about what  happened to wake me up and what terrible things might happen(oh Anastasia I am so glad you are no longer living in Russia- I had a lot of sleepless nights then). SnoWhite had 1 night terror Christmas eve 1995  when she had the flu and it was a scary experience for her and me. Fiona also had night terrors  when we lived in Victoria park in 1994, she would have been 3 years old. Who needs the Genome project when there is my family? What with vitiligo, autism, night terrors, arthritis etc we could keep researchers going for years! And it is nice to know we are in good(!) company according to Wikepedia H.R. Giger who created the designs for the alien  in The Alien films also suffered from night terrors and he was an architect by trade and his first paintings were a form of art therapy with regards to his night terrors. H.P Lovecraft  was also widely believed to have suffered from night terrors. Lovecraft was an American writer of fantasy, horror and science fiction. Lovecraft influenced many of the US fantasy, horror and science fiction writers including Stephen King. I can see how these individuals have been inspired by fear. Minds are scary things. The Wikipedia article suggests the following way to deal with night terrors The consensus for treating night terror episodes is three-pronged: gentleness, disposal of anything nearby that might hurt the subject, and avoiding loud voices or movements that might frighten the subject further. It is also critical to remember that the person experiencing the terror is unaware that they are experiencing one. As a result, they may become even more agitated if told that \"it was just a dream,\" as they are quite convinced that the experience is real. The quickest remedy is simply to calm the person by telling the person that you are there for them or simply say, \"I'm here\" or \"I love you\". Telling the victim \"It's OK\" or \"nothing's there\" may agitate the sleeper further because feelings they are feeling are very real to them and obviously not \"OK\". However, simply knowing the person's source of \"calm\" helps immensely. If he/she has a favorite companion dog or cat, telling them that the cat or dog is warm in bed, safe and asleep, and that they need to sleep as well could also be a good trigger. Calm the person and convince them to \"go back to sleep\" In some cases, they may be calmed by the mere presence of familiar person. As far as Belle, SnoWhite and Fiona were concerned , the above suggestions would have been a perfect way to deal with the situation but with Beauty I am never sure that she understands what I am saying and touching and holding are not always a good idea even when she is well or not experiencing a night terror, such is the contrariness of the autistic mind. I should imagine  that the percentage of children with autism who suffer from night terrors is probably the same as the percentage of normally developing children who suffer from night terrors. Next on my to-do list.............surf the net to see how other parents of children with autism deal with night terrors. Just in case it happens again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_terror", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasomnia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Sleep_physiology", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/nightmare2.shtml", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_terror", "http://www.nightterrors.org/", "http://www.nightterrors.org/", "http://www2.blogger.com/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/night-terrors.html", "title": "\nNIGHT TERRORS\n"},
{"date": " January 09, 2007", "body": "\nMy blog yesterday was written after a very  sleepless night! That is meant to explain the viciousness of the attack against Mr Blair and his government and his policies, I still believe all those things but usually I am not quite as vocal(well not on the internet anyway). I apologise to my keyboard and the way that I pounded out yesterday's entry but yesterday's news report was quickly followed by a date from the school for Beauty's Annual Review which I now feel should be renamed  A MEETING TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY I CAN SCREW OUT OF THE COUNCIL TO GIVE TO THE SCHOOL FOR BEAUTY'S EDUCATION  or if it were the council naming the meeting it should be titled A MEETING TO STOP YOU AND YOUR KID GETTING A SINGLE PENNY FROM US BECAUSE YOUR KID DOESN'T DESERVE A PENNY. And this is how I feel after sleeping! According to a report in the  Daily Mail regarding Ruth Kelly \"Her claim that her son has \"substantial learning difficulties\" was contradicted by local authority sources quoted in The Sun who claimed he had only \"mild dyslexia\". What did Ruth Kelly really think that the LEA would do for her child? I have been saying that my 21 year old has had problems since she was 2 but did THE lea do any thing .........NO! she was diagnosed with dyslexia in University. RUTH KELLY SNUBBED SIX STATE SCHOOLS Kelly goes private despite 'excellent' local record By Oonagh Blackman, Political Editor RUTH Kelly rejected six state schools that help children with dyslexia to send her son to a \u00a315,000-a-year prep school.The former Education Secretary's local authority has an outstanding record for supporting youngsters with learning difficulties. Of 20 specialist primary schools, six are rated as \"excellent\" by Ofsted and 14 are \"good\".A spokesman for Tower Hamlets, East London, said: \"We have a strong track record in helping children with a wide range of learning needs.\"Ms Kelly defended her decision, saying: \"Like any parent, my first thought was for my child. \" So does this mean that the former Education secretary visited 6 schools in Tower Hamlets and thought that their provision for Dyslexia(mild dyslexia) was not good enough? Does this mean that the children in these schools are receiving an inadequate provision for their dyslexia? Cartoons to aid autistic children By Jane Hughes BBC News, health correspondent Whilst reading this article on the BBC website all I could think about were the other autistic  children that I knew and their obsession with Thomas The Tank Engine and when going to pick Beauty up from school I always  see at least one Thomas backpack or toy. Yes this sounds like a good idea. Professor Simon Baron-Cohen is director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University.He said: \"We've got to somehow find a way to get autistic children to overcome their fear of looking at people's faces so that they can start learning about how expressions arise. \"This is a way to ease them into reading faces.\" When Beauty looks at me directly in the eyes I worry as this is a very rare occurrence. Once on holiday when Beauty was about 2 we were sat at the dining room table in the hotel and for the first time ever Beauty looked me full in the eyes and I was so pleased UNTIL she lunged for my face and grabbed both of my cheeks with her hands. Her nails were small but razor-like and my face started to pour blood-it was like the bit in the OMEN films where Damien's parents try to take him into a church. The restaurant came to a shocked standstill whilst we tried to get her off my face. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=427525&in_page_id=1770&ct=5", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_headline=ruth-kelly-snubbed-six-state-schools%26method=full%26objectid=18424389%26siteid=94762-name_page.html", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6241733.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/my-blog-yesterday-was-written-after.html", "title": "\nI HANG MY HEAD AND WEEP\n"},

{"date": " February 21, 2007", "body": "\nWhilst searching blogger search today I came across a blog entry where an individual wrote that they had sex 2 days ago and my first reaction was,'bully for you'. I am just gob smacked sometimes at the things I read on the net. I was watching an episode of  NCSI  a few weeks ago and it was all about pay-to-view sex and I could not believe that all this was going on and I know nothing about it. Obviously I am aware of the 'child porn' cases in the news but I don't think my mind has ever really processed the vastness of what is actually out there and I find it very scary. There was a case in the news a few years ago of an ex-marine in his 30's who abducted a teenage girl who he got to know on  NeoPets  and my 15 year old  used to be on  NeoPets  a lot. Thankfully my 15 year old would NEVER have gone off with a total stranger in this way, she just would not have had the confidence to meet a stranger in this way. Being only 'somewhere on the spectrum' thankfully only affects aspects of her life and I do not believe that her judgement in a situation like this would be adversely affected. However, I think that I am going to have to be more aware of the net in future with regards to Beauty because obviously I do not know how she will progress.Autism can affect a person in many different ways and not always how you would expect. Children on the autistic spectrum can have obsessions i.e specific toys, cartoon characters etc which can make them  vulnerable  because these things can be used to entice them away. Sometimes Beauty can meet  a person just the once and she loves them to pieces and treats them like her best friend. She once had a visit from a psychologist who she had never met before and when her left she cried for hours and was inconsolable  and he could have been a mad axe murderer for all she knew. Quite regularly Beauty turns Ariel's  MSN  on without realising it and I only get to know when I hear Ariel's friends PINGING her. One day we found that Beauty had opened a window accidentally and it was a French person asking if she wanted online sex!O.K DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME When  SnoWhite  was younger and a lot more naive(it is possible!) she got angry with the computer and repeatedly typed in the word S*H*I*T and it turned up page after page of porn. My girls are very careful now what words they actually ' google '. I make sure of that! Even now I am occasionally surprised at what a  google  search will throw up, usually it comes from typing in a girls name or getting a well known websites name slightly wrong. Being half term I was quite impressed with Beauty having a lie in and letting me sleep until past 8am but waking up to constant nursery rhymes can be a bit trying. Rock-a-bye baby seems to be the favourite at the moment. Beauty however is always thrilled though when I say 'O.K I'm getting up', she stops singing instantly and bounds out of bed. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx DORI, YOUR COMMENT WOULD NOT LET ME LINK.

{"date": " February 23, 2007", "body": "\n I really believe that my poor Beauty needs to go into isolation during the winter to be able to cope, she has JUST recovered from that flu bug thing and now she has a a temperature and a really productive cough and she is really poorly bad. I don't think that she will be able to go out with the child minder on Sunday and possibly she might not be well enough for school on Monday. Hey I'm with the 'let's wear hospital mask's in public' brigade if it stops my Beauty getting sick all the time. When Beauty was small, Anastasia, Beauty and I went to Paris for the weekend and we saw a  group statue and one of them was wearing a hospital mask.The funny thing was I didn't notice the mask until we looked at the photo's when we had them developed at home! I would make a rubbish expert witness. That visit was also the first time that I saw  street statue  artists.................there are so many now that you trip over them in the street! I personally find them very odd and they unnerve me a bit. A bit like a picture on a wall where the eyes seem to follow you. After weeks and weeks and weeks of being badgered by Fiona to have her hair cut, YESTERDAY WAS THE DAY. She looks really good. Whilst she was having her hair cut I took Beauty for a walk to see the other shops and I bought her the cutest little 'primpesque' hoody. Her sisters inform me that not only will she hurt me when she is older for dressing her like this but she will also never speak to me again when she finds out that I put the pictures on the internet! I personally think that she looks really sweet. She's a little kid for pity sake, it's not as if I am dressing her like a mini-lolita. When we were on holiday recently we went to the hotel entertainment every night so Beauty could watch the mini-disco. I was shocked to see little girls of Beauty's age dressed like 21 year old out on the pull. One little girl who was about 9 years old  constantly wore mini-mini skirts and cut-off halter tops and a face full of make-up. AND her dancing was so provocative she made Christina Aguilera's dancing in 'Dirty' look positively modest in comparison! I don't think that the parents are wholly to blame either, shops manufacture  and sell this rubbish! Children are enough at risk as it is without dressing them so provocatively, you may as well put a neon, light over their head which says, 'come get me'. Last night I watched a TV show about child anorexics and I was appalled to see that the youngest receiving treatment was 12! There has to be something wrong with a society that has such young girls suffering from such an awful illness.Magazines bombard them with 'PERFECT' images, they see stick thin celebrities, they see it on TV and all around them and nobody will accept responsibility and the parents have to pick up the pieces. The human psyche is such a fragile thing, those responsible for the damage should be made to address the situation rather than merely profit from it. The definition of anorexia used to be something that we were led to believe only affected young girls but today I believe we all have food issues. I think about everything I eat and yes guilt is a big part of it, I eat healthy food but I eat too much healthy food. I think SnoWhite is one of the few people who I know who has no problem with food. She is a slim10-12 and eats whatever she wants, she has the same high metabolism that I had at her age. Sadly it will not last. Last night the girls were watching a stand up comedy show and one of the comedians made a joke about autism, it was just a play on words ........autistic/artistic. I actually found it quite funny because in it's own way it accepted autism as a normal thing. I did not feel it was patronising or mean  in anyway and it was no different to somebody telling a joke about flat feet. Perhaps that is what we need more of , conditions such as autism being treated as different not special.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/differentnot-special.html", "title": "\nDIFFERENT.............NOT SPECIAL.\n"},
{"date": " March 02, 2007", "body": "\nI am amazed that even though I have had a number of viruses over the last month my sense of humour is still intact. Yesterday saw a change in symptoms, I now feel like I have a head cold.........runny eyes, nose, headaches and sneezing. As hurricanes get their own names perhaps I should start naming my viruses, Virus Aristotle,Virus Burke, Virus Camus and now Virus Descartes. I awoke at 4:20am, unable to sleep because of a headache that resembled a kick in the head, so I took some pain killers and sat and watched TV and waited for the pain to subside. VIRUS DESCARTES I watched a program on  ITV  called  MAKE ME PERFECT . Make Me Perfect  is currently being shown on  ITV 1. This program follows 15 women who have each suffered emotional trauma because of how they look. The women are helped by a team of experts using hair and make up, psychological counselling and extensive cosmetic surgery to enrich their physical, mental and spiritual well-being Well it certainly made me squirm, me the nurse, the poop-checker. I think it was the sound of breaking bones int he  Rhinoplasty   that set me off! Whilst I was a student nurse I went into theatre and watched an operation that involved re-breaking bones that had not healed properly and I have also seen a number of amputations and none of them have ever been a problem for me. As a nurse I have been able to see anything and do anything but the minute I see it on TV I get all  girly  and  pukey  and start squealing the likes of ooh, ooh, ooh! My first day as a student nurse on a ward saw me helping stem the tide of blood on a patient with  oesophageal   varices   and the blood was projected half way up the ward. Where were you when the  Iranian embassy in London  was stormed in 1980? As a young student nurse I was doing an assessed dressing on a  huge   Pilonidal  Abscess  , the patient was lying on their front watching the TV, to distract themselves from what was happening, and I was packing the wound with gauze and liquid paraffin( pre -bung days). It was not a simple technique and it entailed dipping the gauze in the liquid and then packing the wound with it, this was done by by using 2 forceps. I had perfect marks at the end of the technique but half way through the patient shouted,'STOP' and wouldn't let me continue the dressing until the storming of the embassy had finished! I was  also sent looking for a cranial pack when I was in theatre, it was on stand-by in another theatre and when I entered the theatre I was surprised to see the theatre was full and photographs were being taken of the patient. On opening up the patient an unusually large growth was found and the patient had been extensively opened up and was in an upright position so the photographs could be taken. I did not find the situation upsetting at all, just unusual. I seem to have been hardened from a very young age to things that I have witnessed in hospitals but anything on TV just makes me all queasy. I started my  pre -nursing course when I was 16 and worked on the ward for 2 days a week. My first ward experience was in a small casualty unit in a Welsh Valleys town. The staff there thought it would be funny to send me into the surgical dressing room for something, only for me to discover the 2 male nurses doing 'something'(maybe cleaning him up-I couldn't tell you) to a patient who claimed he had caught something off a toilet seat in a local bar! Even then I had a sense of humour and thankfully saw the funny side of it. I also cannot cope with people talking about procedures but yet I can be in the room and see it being done! I just can't explain it. I am obviously one strange bunny! I am however, obviously a very shallow person because I saw the program(with all the yuk) and thought,'Well I wouldn't mind having cosmetic surgery'. A bit like when I saw the documentary,  SUPER SIZE ME,  it made want to go out and have a Big Mac Meal! I would have the brow lift to rectify my lop sided brow, my eye bags removed and a tummy-tuck and liposuction. And what would stop me having it done? Money of course and the fear of  MRSA (I'm great at excuses!). I worked on a  gynecological ward before I had Beauty and the sight of an infected  Cesarean  section wound made me adamant that I would NEVER have an elective Cesarean...........   I had a cut when Beauty was delivered and I contracted  MRSA  anyway. I would be too afraid to work as a ward nurse again because of  MRSA . I took  SnoWhite  to  Tesco  last night to buy a few things and I managed to get  IMMUNACE which  states the following Nutrients for immune function Valuable antioxidants to help support your immune system. With highly effective antioxidant vitamins to help eliminate harmful chemicals, including free radicals, from the body. Plus trace minerals and amino acids used in the synthesis of more complex antioxidant molecules. Research shows that sometimes our diets are unbalanced and some of us may not always be getting the nutrients required to maintain a strong and efficient immune system.  Immunace \u00ae is a synergistic dietary supplement of 24 nutrients for the immune system, to help maintain every day healthy immune resistance and optimal cell defence. \"The best way to support the immune system is to maintain your general health with a balanced diet, mild exercise and sufficient sleep. Diet is probably the major factor in supporting the immune system and for those who cannot maintain a varied and balanced diet, products such as  Immunace  may help to provide important  micronutrients  that are missing in the diet.\" Professor Ronald  Eccles Cardiff School of  Biosciences Free radical defence Antioxidants such as vitamins E, C and  carotenoids , help defend against harmful free radicals which can damage cell DNA. Certain amino acids and trace minerals such as selenium are also used in the synthesis of more complex antioxidant molecules. Free radicals are found naturally in the environment, caused by sunlight, cigarette smoke, pollution, and other factors in modern day-to-day existence. The activity of viruses in the body is also thought to be mediated by free radicals, so antioxidants are particularly important to immune system defence.  Immunace \u00ae includes antioxidant vitamins, trace minerals, amino acids and five natural source  carotenoids  to help ensure comprehensive antioxidant defence. Nutritional Support for your Immune System Immunace \u00ae provides a comprehensive formula for the immune system, with effective levels of antioxidants. Vitamin C and E circulate in the body to help protect against the damage caused by free radicals. Other nutrients such as  betacarotene  protect DNA and cells from within.  Immunace \u00ae helps safeguard nutrients required for: The short term - to help maintain your resistance against infection. It also helps replace the vitamin C lost during colds. The long term - to increase the body's level of protective substances for long term cell protection. Comprehensive support Immunace \u00ae provides a comprehensive range of vitamins and minerals, taking the place of a regular multivitamin / mineral supplement. These include nutrients for all-round  wellbeing , as well as vitamin B complex for the maintenance of the central nervous system, which helps to regulate immune response. Well it all sounds very impressive.....if it works but read between the lines and it says, 'Maybe it will help but don't sue me if it doesn't'. Well it only costs \u00a35 for a months supply so I shall take it and see. However, when I opened the pack the tablets were the size of horse tablets........well if they kick like a horse I shall be happy! I am very impressed with how Beauty is coping with all these illnesses, I have said before that she has a high threshold for pain but even with this and her communication problems she is still a happy little bunny and only took to her bed for one day. Fiona however seems to be sleeping night and day.............and I would if I could! When Beauty was little she caught her fingers in a door and whilst her sisters and myself would have been rolling around the floor crying and screaming, she did not bat an eye lid. This I feel is a significant problem for Beauty because she could hurt herself in all sorts of ways and I not know. As I have said before, she may even have broken bones that were never diagnosed. Her communication is increasing daily though, last night I put her to bed and kissed her and said, 'Good night' and she responded by saying,'Sweet dreams', yes she is a little sweetheart. Perhaps this is a Pollyanna way of looking at things but I wonder if she would have been quite so sweet and lovely at 6 if she were not autistic? I think she probably would have, I remember Fiona when she was 6 and she was a little doll. Ariel and  SnoWhite  were also little darlings at that age and whilst Anastasia and Belle were the loveliest of little girls they did have a volatile relationship with each other which meant our home was never quiet when the older girls were little. Anastasia and Belle were very popular little girls in the church that we attended when they were young, and everyone loved them. So as my other 5 other girls were wonderful at 6 I think that Beauty would have been lovely with or without autism. I think the fact that developmentally Beauty is very young in lots of ways is a factor in how sweet she is. Even when she is being 'naughty' you just want to pick her up and hug her because she is so sweet. I sometimes wish that Beauty's older sisters were little again so I could pick them up and hug them again as hugs and kisses are no longer on the agenda. Oh well! It seems as if Beauty will have to get their share of hugs and kisses! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=4993", "http://www.transforminglives.co.uk/make-me-perfect.htm", "http://www.transforminglives.co.uk/make-me-perfect.htm", "http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/rhinoplasty.html", "http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40000857/", "http://www.britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Iranian-Embassy.htm", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilonidal_cyst", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.supersizeme.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://pregnancy.about.com/od/cesareansection/ss/cesarean.htm", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus", "http://www2.blogger.com/www.vitabiotics.com/immunace/immunace_cap_proinfo.aspx?ID=8&gclid=CJ7o6brC1YoCFRnHEAodwntRBw", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/make-me-perfect.html", "title": "\nMAKE ME PERFECT\n"},

{"date": " February 25, 2007", "body": "\n Last night, some local little sh*t trashed my wing mirror! And why am I  really not upset? Because the little shit did the same thing to the other wing mirror a few days previously. Which means that I only have to pay for 1 repair instead of 2! Said like a true Pollyanna. Probably done by a group of hoodie wearing young gentleman I saw  earlier wandering the estate with golf clubs! I may not be psychic but I predict their next holiday will be at her Majesty's Pleasure. The  little band of brothers (aged between10-15) should have been home with their parents...........and where were their parents? That I couldn't tell you but the mother of the leader of this little band of brothers is a known drug user and has had hysterical screaming episodes in the street, so whilst not inevitable, I suppose you could see the behaviour of this leader of the band coming! Frequently you hear people saying ,'ah but they have nowhere to go and nothing to do?' and things like ' oh they need youth centres and places to go' Well as a mother of 6 my  strong feeling is that, 'NO.......they don't need somewhere else to go and something more to do'. They have a youth club in the week in the local community centre and my friend John runs an after school computer club and  we live 2 minutes from a leisure centre with a swimming pool and the local council has spent a lot recently on a skate park and a basketball/football court with an all weather pitch. What more do they want? They need to be where their parents know where they are. My children only went out when they had somewhere specific to go and that was their choice, they did not want to go wandering the streets. They went to Brownies, Guides, youth club, dance, art classes, music lessons etc and if not out doing that they watched TV or did homework or went on the computer. I think that laws should be amended so that parents can be held responsible for their children's bad behaviour, obviously there will be exceptions when children get to an age or a size where they could not be physically controlled but that can't be the case for every under 16 year old wandering the streets after dark! And there is also the possibility that these under 16 year olds who are running around in the dark unsupervised could also be harmed in some way. And if something did happen then the first thing that their parents would say would be.'Why my child?' So what's the answer? Beats me! I'm just a mother. Beauty has been coughing and spluttering all morning so no trip out with the child minder for her. She has spent her morning either in bed( but not sleeping) or playing on the computer on CBeebies .  Thankfully there was no repeat of night terrors last night just a very disturbed wriggly night. Difficulty in communicating is a major issue in autism,  especially with regards to Beauty because I do not know how she is feeling. I do not know if  is she is sad or in pain or hungry or thirsty. Whilst she can make desires for food and drink known I would especially like to know about pain etc as  she  appears to have a very high threshold for pain which does worry me.Fiona is also unwell and after sleeping all night is sleeping again on the sofa. SnoWhite is in work and in a couple of hours Ariel will be back in Cardiff from Florida. Dare I say it has been very quiet without Ariel? Oh well, back to school tomorrow, half -term will be over but I doubt if Beauty will be well enough to go back.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/02/last-night-some-local-little-sht.html", "title": "\nHUG A HOODIE.\n"},

{"date": " March 05, 2007", "body": "\nAfter a week of half term and a week of illness, Beauty is back to school today. I know that she will be thrilled and delighted as she loves school, for her school is not an option..........she loves it! Beauty is a sweetheart of a little girl and when she isn't on the computer or watching TV then she is reading her books, playing with her toys or making up stories. However, when she is home from school the once thing I do miss is the opportunity to have nap breaks between doing housework. Beauty, like many autistic children(many normally developing children for that matter) has no awareness of danger and has twice escaped from the house.Thankfully the last escape attempt was over 3 years ago and since that time we have battoned down the hatches and doors are meant(!) to be locked at all times and Beauty has to be watched 24/7. Therefore,when she spends time home from school she has to be watched constantly and this can and does increase tiredness. SnoWhite also had an escape attempt when she was little and  she has an amazing memory and is able to tell us what happened and how she felt. In a way it is like looking into Beauty's mind, an autistic mind, listening to what she has to say. SnoWhites memory of the event includes no empathy about how she might worry her family by walking off, just about how she wanted to see the way a certain path went and then a desire to see her friend. I recently read an article about how researchers felt that in autism there was a lack of communication between areas of the brain. When SnoWhite had her escape attempt as a small child I know that she had no idea she was being 'naughty', her brain failed to process that by walking away from her family she would cause upset. When Snowhite was diagnosed recently in university, the psychologist said that her main  problem was a processing problem, not her mild dyslexia and I think this is so true. Even now I have to get her to phone home every 2 days to let me know she is not 'dead in a ditch' because if left to her own devices I might not hear from her for 2 weeks! Fiona is different to SnoWhite and Beauty though, she would look at her home and think,'Why should I leave what I have? I am way to comfortable'..............now that too is autism. Yes I can look at other children in the street and recognise the fact that they are autistic but as I can also accept that all individuals with autism are the same and yet all different! Whilst virus Dante continues unabated and I spent most of yesterday in bed, I did manage to watch one TV show................. Supernatural  of course. I have such an exciting life, I spent the morning, afternoon and early evening in bed, watch an hour of TV and then go back to bed! And talking about all things supernatural, just before I went to bed  last night I was sitting at the computer and Fiona came and asked who was in the downstairs bathroom. I said no one but she insisted that someone had to be  because she saw someone walk past in a white jumper. I told her that SnoWhite had just walked into the living room but she said no, she was adamant that someone had walked towards the bathroom in a white jumper(and Fiona would not make up something like that..............she couldn't be bothered!). Well SnoWhite was sat in the living room, her friend who is 'a boy but not her boyfriend' was asleep on the settee, Beauty was in her bed and that left me sat at the computer. I have a partial view of the hall from where I was sitting and I did not see Sam, Dean or any of their supernatural friends and if I had you sure as heck would have heard about it because I would have been screaming like a banshee. I may have had a number of unexplained incidents in my life which some may say were  of the supernatural kind but I am too afraid of the dark to embrace something like that. Look at  Mia Dolan  on ITV's  Haunted Homes,  I'm sorry but you would not catch me walking around peoples houses in the dark. In the last episode of Haunted Homes a Buddha went flying through the air and the camera footage could find no evidence of someone throwing it. I would have been a basket case after something like that. SnoWhite and I love the show because we are such skeptics and love watching the reactions of the punters taking part in the show. SnoWhite and I are all the way with  Professor Chris French  the resident skeptic, whilst we believe everything that Mia and the punters on the show say, we go with Chris French every time(apart from the flying Buddha.........now that was scary).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://supernatural.warnerbros.com/", "http://www.miadolanltd.com/", "http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=6002", "http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/apru/french.php"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/supernatural.html", "title": "\nSUPERNATURAL\n"},
{"date": " March 04, 2007", "body": "\nVirus Dante appears to be descending into a chest infection! I shall maintain my stance of forgetting the 'deep and meaningful' and discuss TV. Yesterday was spent either sleeping, playing with Photoshop or watching TV(sounds a good weekend to me). Whilst SnoWhite was 'flicking' last night, yes she had the remote, we managed to see  Roland Rivron  sing Stand by your Man on  Comic Relief does Fame Academy . I was way impressed, the man knew he had no singing talent but he had the bo**ocks to stand up and sing and make a complete idiot of himself for charity. I thought he was brilliant. I once watched Roland Rivron on a holiday show and guess where he went on  holiday?  Tobermory ........we spent Christmas there, 2 years ago and apart from the cold it was brilliant. I think all the other visitors at the time were also  Balamory  fans, I still wear the fisherman's socks I bought whilst we were there. We also managed to watch some of the film, ' About a Boy ', I know people say that  Hugh Grant  plays the same character all the time in all his films but I don't think this is the case with,' About a Boy'. I think he plays the 'shallow but not bad son of a songwriter whose royalties he lives off' really well. His performance is a bit like that of Julia Roberts in  Notting Hill,  remember when they are sitting at the dinner table and each person has to say why they deserve the last piece of dessert?  Julia Roberts  actually makes you feel empathy for the rich A-lister who apparently has everything! Though I dislike intensely Hugh Grant's role in  'Bridget Jones', when an actor make you hate them in a role it proves how good an actor they are. Whether or not Hugh Grant is a good actor many people would question but I think he is good because he is entertaining and he makes me laugh. Not every one can act the same as  Marlon Brando  or  Lawrence Olivier. Whilst Brando and Olivier were brilliant actors, wouldn't life be boring if that was all there was? I am afraid I love my comedy and sci-fi and  Brit Flicks   too much to  confine myself to just watching the classics. Though I do love   watching Shakespeare and every summer I watch a live performance in  St Fagans. When Beauty was younger a social worker came to the house to discuss childminders and respite care and from the second she came into the house I knew that I had seen her somewhere before. Being a nurse this is not difficult because I have met many people through my work but this was different, it took me a week to realise where I had seen her before. She had played  Prospero  in  The Tempest  the previous summer in St Fagans. Last night SnoWhite and I also attempted to watch the program  The world's most Extreme Tv but with little success. Why Russian TV makers think it is entertaining to show police finding de-composing dead bodies on TV is beyond me and they show it in Russia at 6pm! They also show interviews with the murderers at the scenes of their crimes and they re-tell the crimes they have committed. Whilst they may be helping the police to solve crimes, I also feel they are creating warped children who witness these terrible things on TV at prime time.It doesn't bode well for their future. They also showed clips from Dirty Sanchez and the panel on the show thought this was the worst show they had seen. I couldn't comment as I have never seen it but SnoWhite assures me that the Dirty Sanchez boys are from Cardiff and totally mad. Wikipedia says Dirty Sanchez  is a TV series (and film series) featuring three  Welsh  men,  Pritchard ,  Dainton ,  \"Pancho\"  and Londoner  Joyce , all who have a total disregard for their own health and engage in extremely self-harmful acts. It is known as Team Sanchez in the U.S. I shall take SnoWhite's word on them being mad!

We have had sunny weather for 2 days now which means good clothes drying weather, Ariel accused me of thinking like a mother when I mentioned this but I told her I was merely thinking like someone who wants to save electricity! As we are on the subject of Ariel, over the weekend she went cycling up the Taf Trail to practice for a charity event that she wants to do for Beauty's school. She is now moaning and groaning like an old woman(me) and is barely able to walk due to her having used muscles that she did not know she had. She wasn't impressed when I dropped her off at school and she asked if she could just turn around and go home and I said that if she were in the army(her plans) then she wouldn't be able to turn around and go home. Grrr !Was her reply. Talking about injuries..........SnoWhites friend who wrestles, dropped a 16 stone man on his knee  on Sunday during practice, accidentally (well I hope it was an accident!). Now that is a scary profession. He has merely(!) strained and bruised his knee and ankle and is walking around on my crutches. We seem to have had a breakthrough on the whole  cleaning issue.Snowhite washed the car and cleaned the upstairs bathroom though she did fall asleep mid-cleaning(I kid you not!).When Snowhite was still in school, first thing in the morning when she had been compelled to wake up she would go the bathroom and make a heap with the towels and go back to sleep on the floor! Ariel put away all the  washing and cleaned the living room, whilst Fiona cleaned the downstairs bathroom and cleaned the inside of the car. I was suitably impressed. As I said before, I wouldn't ask them to do something that I wouldn't do myself, so I did the washing and drying and the dishes and cleaned the kitchen and Beauty's bedroom. Whilst SnoWhite and Fiona seem to be getting into the swing of things, Ariel did need a little bit of persuading! Last night I watched a program called  The Retreat,  ever the seeker for truth and spirituality, I found it really interesting. 'Six British volunteers embark on a journey of self-discovery when they leave their everyday lives behind to join an  Islamic retreat in Spain  for four weeks of prayer, daily work and contemplation.' It was really a unique experience for me to watch a program where the seekers of truth were searching for meaning to their lives in a non-christian environment. I really felt that I learnt a lot about what it means to be Muslim for many people. I was very impressed with Abdullah Trvathan    leading the retreat who focused on the spiritual but then one of those who lost it for me was a girl who was already a Muslim but she had a very different  approach. I really believe that religion is about spirituality and the inner person and the individual journey  and concentrating on the outward impressions we make just detracts from the spiritual journey. I am afraid I let the side down and watched no rubbish TV whatsoever last night but a lot of that could have been to do with Beauty's 4:30am wake-up call! Yes autism can be a VERY tiring thing, I am afraid there are no holidays or days off with a child on the autistic spectrum.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/noise/?id=the_retreat", "http://www.al-madrasa.com/eng/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/true-brit.html", "title": "\nTRUE BRIT!\n"},

I''m not much of a day time TV watcher but I did catch a few minutes of  Loose Women  a brilliantly funny chat show with a group of presenters. Today they were talking about Size 0 at one point and  Carol McGiffin  commented about how nice it feels when you have been ill for about a week and unable to eat and your clothes fit you so well and I thought 'hey, that is how I feel now'. But then Coleen Nolan from the  Nolans  said she had never been so unwell that she couldn't eat and I felt quite guilty because I know that I have control over my eating if I want to but some people don't. I also caught a glimpse of the Breakfast program on BBC this morning and was seriously shocked to watch an interview with a morbidly obese woman who was bed ridden due to her obesity. From the little I watched of the interview I got the impression that the woman felt that she had to eat or she had panic attacks. I really felt that the TV Doctor wanted to tell her that she wasn't having panic attacks just temper tantrums when she didn't get the food she wanted. I really did feel sorry for the women's husband because he seemed to be being blamed for the obesity problem as he brings the wife the food. Remember though, the wife must have been able to feed herself until she was so big that she took to her bed. If she gets upset that she is not being fed then the husband is being blackmailed into over-feeding her. This also made me feel guilty because I have seriously thought that if I had the money then I would have a  tummy-tuck  to get rid of my 'mother's apron'. I am now a UK  size 14(US size 10) and my stomach seems to be disappearing daily, no I will never be perfect but the tummy tuck is definitely out. Already I am having problems with jeans, one size too small.........one size too big, I am looking forward to buying smaller new clothes. Anyway, at 46 I think I would like to be a size 12(8), nothing more, nothing less. What would I do with being a size 0 anyway?Lets get real. I think one of the biggest problems that society has is the Celebrity Lifestyle that we are all being sold as normal. Not only are we being sold size 0 but the lifestyle that goes with it and we are made to feel a failure if we do not achieve it. So many people get into debt trying to live the lifestyle, the Jimmy Choo's , the Chloe bag and the D&G dress. One piece of research showed that many youngsters wanted to be famous, they didn't know how, they just wanted the celebrity lifestyle. Me personally, I would want the money but I wouldn't want to be a celebrity or anyone to  know me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=5336", "http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=5335", "http://www.nolansisters.com/", "http://www.bupahospitals.co.uk/asp/cosmetic/women/body_reshaping/tummy_tuck.asp"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/celebrity-lifestyle.html", "title": "\nCELEBRITY LIFESTYLE\n"},
{"date": " March 14, 2007", "body": "\nAs a family we operate the Shotgun Rules as far as who sits where in the car. Ariel emailed me this, charming child!Allegedly, on the autistic spectrum she is not, well you all know my theory on that one! History Lesson: The term shotgun refers to back in old wild west days, when a person would have to sit next to the driver of the wagon with a shotgun to protect them from highway robbers: Rules So far: 1. The  Shotgunner  must be in clear sight of the car, and shotgun can be called regardless of whether the driver is in sight of the car 2. If you are the first to be picked up on a journey, you are automatically given shotgun, until you violate the other shotgun laws and thus, forfeit your position, the seat is yours 3. you cannot declare shot gun if someone has previously declared shotgun for that journey. 4. when simultaneous shotgun is called, there is then a foot race to the passenger side door from the all the people who called 5. shotgun cannot be called whilst inside a building (unless you are in a multi-  storey or underground car park!) 6. shotgun cannot be called in advance, only whilst on the way to the car for the journey 7. on the call shotgun if the driver wants to mix things up a bit he can call reload, this means that all calls of shotgun before that are void and the first person to call shotgun again gets the seat... and if u plain don't like the person who called shotgun.this is often used when there is a simultaneous call and the driver is unsure of the outcome, also a shotgun can have 2 barrels so a reload can only be called once 8.  ja  rob rule...if hes in the car shotgun now means back left so he cant punch you every time a yellow car goes past 9. Once shotgun has been called for the front seat then back left and back right can be called, thus leaving the fifth person who is traveling in the middle (or the \"bitch\" seat) 10. Being as how everyone is created equal, men have the same right as women to the front seat of the car. i.e. women don't own the front seat! 11. In the instance that the normal driver of a vehicle is drunk or otherwise unable to perform their duties as driver, then he/she is automatically given Shotgun. 12. Once the journey is underway, the person occupying shotgun becomes controller of stereo/radio and it is their duty to sort out the tunes.HOWEVER, if this person is being an arse,abusing their position and pissing everyone off with crap choice of music/constantly changing/or just generally not in control then the driver can stop the car, tell them to give up shotgun and then it is up for grabs for all other persons in the car. 13. Shoe Rule, anyone calling shotgun must have their shoes on, this is to stop people running outside and calling shotgun, then having to go back inside to put their shoes on, thus slowing the journey 14. Shotgun overrules Dibs,  Baggsy's  and and other  girly  calls! 15. despite the debate, shotgun can be used to shotgun things other than the front seat (e.g. back left, back right, women, not going to answer the door etc etc etc) 16. If traveling with a couple, one of the couple must shotgun the front.....no one wants to chauffeur two of their mates whilst they are sat in the back all over each other 17. If someone has successfully called shotgun, this gives them no right whatsoever to correct the driver on their navigation skills (\"take a left here you dick head!\") or driving ability (\"I'd be in third gear if I was driving\") if the passenger does this then they forfeit their position as shotgun holder 18. if someone says \"whats shotgun?\" after it has been called then they have to walk 19. If you come up to the car and you already have who's shotgun..the driver gets in and reaches over to unlock the shotgun door. if shotgun opens it before its actually unlocked..(this happens when the driver is still trying to unlock it and person pulls on handle) they have to give up there rights as shotgun. Therefore..shotgun suicide! 20. The successful  shotgunner , in the front of a vehicle, assumes the responsibility for all gate opening, off licence nipping into, takeaway ordering and question asking. He/she is, in essence the co-pilot and therefore the enforcer of behaviour in the vehicle and exacter of slaps/punches/water spraying/bag throwing at the passengers in the back. 21. automatic \"couple's rights act 1997\". This is that, if the driver is the boyfriend/girlfriend of a passenger in the car, they have the right to the seat of their choice. 22. The Pirate Rule - If One of the potential occupants of the vehicle is dressed (convincingly) as a pirate then they are given automatic shotgun. In the  occurrence  of more than one pirate then a sword fight shall determine the  successful   shotgunner . 23. When driving past a woman walking a dog, everyone in the car must shout of the window \"who's walking who\", it is the  shotgunners   responsibility  and failure to spot a potential heckling results in demotion to the bitch seat!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/shotgun-rules_14.html", "title": "\nSHOTGUN RULES\n"},

I stopped by the local shop on the way home from dropping Beauty off at school to get a bowl of fruit for breakfast. Just to do simple things like that again is something I have missed. Taking Beauty anywhere is a major expedition and I have to put her in her buggy to move her around because if she says NO and refuses to move somewhere then I am stuck. Pulling her along a wooden floor in the house by her foot is one thing but trying that in a supermarket is a whole different ball game. Once her sisters had to carry her from the back to the front of a huge supermarket by her arms and legs as she refused to be carried in any other way. I have my dishwasher, tumble dryer and washing machine humming away nicely so now I have time for a guilt free nap. Time to dream about unobtainable luxuries such as a housekeeper! Speak to you later! I have had one of those days where you feel that someone needs to pay for your bad day but you don't know who. As I said earlier, today was going to be a slow day...........a little work..........a little rest.........a little work..........just to catch up. But it was not to be! Each time I lay down to have a little rest and I could feel myself drifting into a comfortable nap........then someone or something woke me up! My bank took the biscuit, they phoned to try and sell me some policy or other and were suitably chagrined when I told them that no it wasn't a suitable time to talk as I had been awake all night! Oh well, better luck tomorrow! Beauty is back home having enjoyed her day at school, contentedly catching bubbles on a CBeebies game. Yesterday I sat with Beauty whilst she was playing on the computer,she was mostly reading stories but she could definitely read every word on the computer. I don't know if she has just learnt certain words from reading the same stories over and over but she can definitely read them. I need to give her the opportunity to read other stories and see if she recognises the words in those stories. I have heard before of children on the autistic spectrum who have a spontaneous acquisition of reading skills, with Beauty though I think it could be linked to her really good memory. She loves songs and can remember and sing dozens and dozens. Beauty only needs to see or hear something once to remember it.........I wish my memory were that good! I worry about Beauty's understanding because of her lack of communication skills , I am never completely sure what is going on inside her head. I think that most of all,   especially because of the autism,I want to know that she is happy. I hope one day she will be able to tell me. Picking Beauty up from school I was pleased to see that the local cherry trees were starting to blossom, at last signs of spring. Living on the edge of the city we are lucky enough to have quite a lot of wooded areas  around where we live, the only problem however is that the majority of trees are  deciduous  so the countryside during the winter is quite barren and the trees are very skeletal looking. Thankfully I still have the ' I am too sick to do much else ' excuse and last night I watched some of the film  ME , MYSELF AND IRENE.  Whilst the acting of Jim Carrey was brilliant and he always makes me laugh, I think the 3 actors who play his sons Jammal, Lee Harvey and Shonte are stunning. Those boys are so funny, they make the film. I love the way they make the microlite using the sewing machine engine!. My children however find the chicken equation funnier! What can I say?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://imdb.com/title/tt0183505/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/r.html", "title": "\nR&R\n"},

{"date": " March 19, 2007", "body": "\nWell Mothering Sunday was GOOD(my 15 year old has told me that I shouldn't write things in capital letters to emphasise things, her English teacher said so!). I ate enough chocolate to rot my teeth, my gut and my brain.........and the remains are still in my fridge. But as suggested they did donate money to charity and no flowers showed up, so in the words of  Lou Reed's Perfect Day   Just a perfect day, Problems all left alone. Thank you girls. However back to the real world. Before I relate to you this story I have to say that I am surprised that I am not more pi**ed-off. Due to Mothering Sunday I have spent the entire weekend trying to find my camera because obviously on Sunday I would need to use it but as with many things in my house( hence the term  The Black Hole of  Pentwyn )  it appears to have sprouted legs and just walked away. Or so it would seem! On Thursday I went to my digital scrap booking class and I put my camera in my lap-top bag(but I didn't take the lap-top thank goodness) just in case I needed to use any of my pictures on the camera during the class. Well I didn't need the camera during the class, in fact I forgot it was in my bag.Well big mistake! I accidentally left the camera in the bag during break-time and when I went to look for my camera in my bag on Saturday it was not there. If somebody so badly wanted a digital camera then I would have bought them one, my camera is old(but I love it) and even the cheapest newer cameras have enough pixels to make my camera green with envy. If they wanted the camera to sell to make money for desperate necessities that they need like food then I would have given them the \u00a35 they would have been very lucky to get for it. Thankfully there were no special photographs on the memory card(the card is probably worth more than the camera!). It could have been a lot worse , the teacher had his wonderful new lap-top in the room and enough hardware to make Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator look like spare parts in a boot(garage)sale. As I said earlier ,I am surprised I am  not a lot more pi**ed off. Last night I watched the film  Patriot Games  and when  Samuel L Jackson 's character asks Ryan why he got involved in the attack by the IRA his answer was something like,' They pi**ed me off, they just made me mad' and Samuel L Jackson's characters retort is something like ,'Well I hope I never pi** you off like that'. I put my lack of emotion on the loss of the camera down to my getting older and becoming more mellow with the years (or more likely just the effects of too much pain medication!) A P.S on Patriot Games, I love that film but I made the mistake of reading the book first and because you obviously get a lot more thoughts and emotions in the book I found the film lacking in some way. But don't get me wrong, I still loved the film. The following is posted today on the BBC Health website       Warning over hidden salt in foods People are making progress on cutting their salt intake but too many still forget to check for hidden salt in foods, campaigners warn. Three-quarters of the salt we eat is already lurking in the food we buy, says the Food Standards Agency. Sandwiches, ready meals, pasta sauce, and pizza are some of the biggest sources of \"hidden\" salt, it says. The agency's next round of TV ads, launched on Monday, shows consumers how to check food labels for salt content. In my house I ensure that everything I buy is low or no fat, sugar or salt but I rally don't think that manufacturers help. When I want to buy margarine I am faced with the choice of low fat, diet, low salt, tastes like butter, sunflower, cholesterol lowering ...........you name it, the choice is there! I just want one that is the lowest fat, lowest salt but the best taste. One that is all singing, all dancing but in one tub! If anyone can figure this puzzle out please let me know because the vast array of  margarines  on offer have got me beat. My children are not too impressed with my healthy eating choices, when going to  Asda  ( Walmart ) they have been known to buy their own Baked Beans because they feel that my healthy option...... low fat and low sugar Baked Beans are low on taste! I also rarely use sugar, I have brown sugar in my dry/cooking cupboard and I use granulated  sweetener . Last week I heard cupboards being banged open and shut in the kitchen and the call of an exasperated voice, 'Do we have any sugar in the house' , looking back I can see that my answer of ,'Don't look at me' was not the best response to give a child on the autistic spectrum! Weather Update(for Anastasia and Belle). I dropped Beauty off at school today and I looked up and there was snow on the mountain! I know they said there might be some but it was still a bit of a surprise. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.purelyrics.com/index.php?lyrics=ubgwanny", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105112/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000168/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6458607.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6458607.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/just-perfect-day_19.html", "title": "\nJUST A PERFECT DAY\n"},
{"date": " March 17, 2007", "body": "\nWell here I am at 4:41am blogging early! That's right, little Miss Sunshine has decided that because it is a Saturday morning then we all must be up bright and early. Well it is EARLY but I couldn't tell you if it is BRIGHT because it is still dark and  it is really and truly too early for me to feel BRIGHT. When I was working as a nurse in a nursing home working nights there was definitely a time during the night when you felt particularly tired, before you got your second wind and that was roughly between 3am and 5:30am. According to a report on the BBC health Website Poor sleep clouds moral judgement A couple of sleepless nights can cloud a person's moral judgement, study findings suggest. Army researchers found soldiers struggled to make snap decisions in emotionally charged situations after being deprived of sleep for two nights. The authors say this could be important for other professions, including doctors, who have broken sleep and need to make quick decisions in a crisis. The US work is published in the latest edition of the journal Sleep. Oh Well, what does that mean for me? I haven't had a decent night's  sleep in over 7 years!   It is well established that poor sleep can impair many functions, including concentration and memory.Some people say they need as little as three hours of sleep in every 24 hours to feel rested, while others need 11 hours.Experts generally advise people get about eight hours of solid sleep per night to be on top form.Lead researcher Dr William  Killgore , of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, stressed that the findings did not mean that sleep deprivation leads to a decline in \"morality\" or in the quality of moral beliefs.\"Our results simply suggest that when sleep deprived, individuals appear to be selectively slower in their deliberations about moral personal dilemmas relative to other types of dilemmas,\" he said.   Perhaps this explains my dreadful memory, I have been doing computer classes at my local community education centre for over 4 years and I am still having to ask the most basic of questions as I seem to forget what I have learnt from one lesson to the next. I take very strong painkillers for my  Dercum's  and my arthritis and I have always put my memory issues down to the medication. So what does 7 years lack of sleep  say about my morals? Interesting thought. On Thursday  SnoWhite  my 21 year old told me that she would not be home that night as she was going on a University trip and she wanted an early start(she has her own flat close to University). Yesterday Fiona asked where  SnoWhite  was and my reply was,' She could be in another country for all I know as she is on a Uni trip'.  SnoWhite  assumes that a lot of information that she has in her head is passed by thought transference. Sorry  SnoWhite  that doesn't often happen in real life. Well about 10pm I get a phone call ,'could I pick her up from Uni as they are back late from their day trip to Chelsea in London(the King's Road and all that!)' So she was in another country.........England. It sounds odd to think that you can go to another country for the day or to work  daily in  another country because you live so close. I visited Anastasia in  Geneva  in Switzerland a few years ago  whilst she was visiting the family there and when I was in the airport you could either exit into France or Switzerland as it was so close. CERN CERN  which is the laboratory featured in  Dan Brown's   Angels and Demons  straddles the border between  France   and  Switzerland , so you could spend your day working in two countries! Confusing thought...........does it mean that some people would need to carry their passport to go to the rest room or the canteen? Liechtenstein Did you read about what the Swiss army did recently? Swiss Accidentally Invade Liechtenstein ZURICH, SWITZERLAND \u2014 What began as a routine training exercise almost ended in an embarrassing diplomatic incident after a company of Swiss soldiers got lost at night and marched into neighboring Liechtenstein.According to Swiss daily  Blick , the 170 infantry soldiers wandered just over a mile across an unmarked border into the tiny principality early Thursday before realizing their mistake and turning back.A spokesman for the Swiss army confirmed the story but said that there were unlikely to be any serious repercussions for the mistaken invasion. \"We've spoken to the authorities in Liechtenstein and it's not a problem,\" Daniel  Reist  told The Associated Press. Officials in Liechtenstein also played down the incident. Interior ministry spokesman Markus Amman said nobody in Liechtenstein had even noticed the soldiers, who were carrying assault rifles but no ammunition. \"It's not like they stormed over here with attack helicopters or something,\" he said. Liechtenstein, which has about 34,000 inhabitants and is slightly smaller than Washington DC, doesn't have an army. I would  rather read news stories like this than the usual gossip mongering that is out there. Who thought that we as a nation were remotely interested in the way that  David Cameron  dressed his hair? Please!       Hair buzz as Cameron moves left Tory leader David Cameron's decision to part his hair on the left has sparked a buzz of speculation from commentators. Some argued the new look was an attempt to look more \"butch\", others that it was actually more feminine, or an effort to cover up a receding hairline. Daily Mail  sketchwriter  Quentin  Letts  said it symbolised the direction in which Mr Cameron was taking his party. But a spokesman said of Mr Cameron's change: \"There is no political significance in his decision to do so.\"     Mr  Letts  told the BBC he thought Mr Cameron's wife Samantha probably had a hand in the decision.\"Blair's hair do has changed colour rather oddly once or twice but now Cameron seems to be changing direction - which is of course a very good metaphor for what he's doing with his party.\" \"You can be a little bit high-minded about this, but I think that's to ignore the very important element that image does play in the way people vote.\" The report carries on ....... He added: \"Unlike the last three Tory leaders he at least has the luxury of parting his hair. This is an improvement, arguably, in image terms. \" Ouch girls , there is no need to get bitchy! Well going back to David Cameron.......... David Cameron is growing on me(and no not like a fungus!). I have always proudly said that I have never voted Labour or Conservative but David Cameron definitely has been changing my opinion of the  Conservatives  . Tony Blair and the  Labour Party  (new Labour) are more conservative than the Conservative party and David Cameron and the Conservatives are more Liberal than the  Liberal party ! Did you all get that? And the worst part is I think the reputation of the Liberal Party has plummeted for me after  MP  Lembit   Opik    dumped   Sian  Lloyd  for a  Cheeky Girl . Another Oh Please! MP  Lembit   Opik   Sian  Lloyd Cheeky Girls I really did respect the judgement of  Lembit   Opik  when he stood by  Charles Kennedy. What can I say? Helen Mirren I am also have a change of feeling towards the Queen due the recent  Helen Mirren's  portrayal of the Queen in the film  The Queen . I have seen clips of the film  and I am a lot more sympathetic to the Queen after what I have seen.I have always felt that the  Royal family  were not very sympathetic to  Princess Diana  and I felt that they used her and were not very nice to her. But real life is always more complicated! However I do not think any film would change my opinion of Charles and Camilla. Well going back to SnoWhite and her trip to Chelsea in London( sorry about the diversion). SnoWhite is doing an art/textiles degree and yesterday her and her course visited shops and fashion houses in Chelsea to check-out the shops and the way that these companies market themselves. SnoWhite was a little put out by the attitudes of the shop girls towards them. To put it bluntly the shop girls were not very pleasant to them, very similar to the shop assistants in Pretty Women. These fabric shops allow you to request a number of swatches and have them posted to you but the shop girls were not very co-operative and treated SnoWhite and her friends as if they were not good enough to be in 'their' shops. The lecturer took SnoWhite outside the shops and explained the situation. These shop girls work in a shop and that is their life whilst  SnoWhite and her friends all work in shops part-time but are also studying for a degree and have plans for the future. SnoWhite is doing her degree, she works part-time, rents her own self- contained one bedroom flat and has also managed to save money in her deposit account. I think that these are pretty good achievements for a 21 year old who is on the autistic spectrum and she has done it all herself. Can these shop girls say that they have done the same? These art/textile students are the young designers of the future..............don't shoot yourselves in the foot girls! Julien MacDonald  Julien MacDonald was a student once, at the same university that SnoWhite attends, he did a one year foundation course in Art and Design and I am sure that he visited London shops to see how things were run , so play nice girls!

{"date": " March 23, 2007", "body": "\nSleep(or lack of it!) seems to be taking over my life at the moment. Last night Beauty went to sleep at 9pm but was awake(!) again at 1:30am with a  night terrors  episode. Thankfully it wasn't as long as last time and she spent the time between my bed and her bed, repeatedly getting up and going into the other bed and falling back to sleep complete with snoring then up again after a few seconds and into the other bed! She finally fell asleep in my bed but I wasn't going to move her(do I look stupid to you! Answers on a postcard). Beauty's bed has a nicer mattress than mine so it wasn't too much of a hardship. When my body stands still I seem to fall asleep on my feet, I fell asleep at 6pm and woke at 9pm the I went back to sleep at 10pm , awoke for the night-terrors incident and then slept through until 5am. I am impressed with anyone who can do this and work during the day, they must be super-human. About  ten years ago I fell down the stairs in my house and my Doctor feels that this fall is probably responsible for or contributed to the arthritis that developed in my back. The arthritis in my back is not in the usual area you would expect to develop degenerative arthritis with age. I  also have lots of pain in most of my joints and especially the bones in my feet and in my neck. At 46 I am not getting any younger and it is normal for the body to deteriorate and to wear out but I want to be as fit and healthy for as long as possible. I have been considering for a while now to have a Bone Density Test done at a private hospital because of my advancing years(I sound ancient) and arthritis etc, I would like to be aware of the possibility of Osteoporosis and ways that I can deal with it. I would be prepared to seek private treatment because I do not believe that I would meet the NHS  criteria  for referral for such a test. Today I read the following article Crackdown on screening proposed There should be a clampdown on private medical screening, government advisers are set to recommend. The National Screening Committee is considering how best to regulate the industry, Pulse magazine reports. It is acting because of fears there are too few checks on the sector - and too  much pressure on the NHS. Tests cost from \u00a310 for a cholesterol check to thousands for a body scan, but people can then be sent to the NHS for further - often unnecessary - checks. Sir Muir Gray, programme director of the National Screening Committee, said the whole industry would face close scrutiny and tough new regulations. He told Pulse: \"We are thinking of how we control private testing because it's an example of low value activity which generates work for the health service, may cause harm and does not benefit the individual. \"Lots of GPs I know are very concerned about people who go to a private clinic for a blood test and then the people who run the private clinic say 'Oh your kidney results look a bit funny - just go and see your GP'.\" The Royal College of GPs is backing calls for tougher regulation. Professor Mayur Lakhani, chair of the RCGP, said: \"Screening is becoming increasingly popular and is not without hazard if done in an unprepared way. \"Working to national standards would bring added peace of mind.\" Dr Peter Mace, Bupa Wellness' Assistant Medical Director said: \"We refute the allegation that health assessments cause patients anxiety. Our experience is quite the opposite. \"We identify a health issue for around a third of customers which they were previously unaware of.\" Pianoman was asked by his Doctors if he wanted to take part in an NHS research project on Prostate Cancer due to him fitting the age and lifestyle criteria and he agreed. He had tests taken and when the results came back he had small but raised levels of the the indicator that showed he could possibly have cancer. Had  it had come back at this low level whilst receiving normal NHS  care he would have been told that this could be normal and not  indicate cancer and  not to worry(information that he was given by the research Nurse and Doctor) and no further tests would have been done. But because he was part of the research program he was sent for further  tests and cancer was found. He has since had radiotherapy and there are no signs of the cancer returning which of course is good news. But still there is the possibility of what could have happened if further tests had not been done. I know that financially the NHS cannot do everything but to limit the choice of the individual to seek private medical care is in my opinion immoral. Doctors who work in theses private hospitals are either NHS trained and still work within the NHS or have trained in other countries and have received approval to work in this country so they are competent practitioners. I want to go to have a Bone Density Test and for the Doctor I see to give me a plan of action as to how I can best take care of myself. I can't see anything wrong with that. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nightterrors.org/", "http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?printPage=1&articleId=582", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6475421.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/return-of-night-terrors.html", "title": "\nRETURN OF THE NIGHT TERRORS\n"},

This is the reason why the night of the crem\u00e0 (in which the Fallas monuments burn down) is always on March 19th, the Festivity of San Jos\u00e9. THE NIGHT OF THE CREMA One day I would really like to go and see the burning of the Fallas. Once on holiday I visited the museum in Valencia and I was so impressed that it is one of those memories that really stay with you. FALLAS MUSEUM FALLAS The museum hold a small number of Fallas(obviously not many as they get burnt!, photos and  Posters from the poster competition. I once witnessed a Fiesta whilst on holiday on Malta at  Rabat  and it was an amazing experience, the fireworks were VERY noisy but funnily enough Beauty loved it. RABAT  Though I think that the burning of the Fallas would definitely be a different kettle of fish. FUENGIROLA I have also witnessed a Fiesta in  Fuengirola  and the one thing I like best was the emphasis on the children, the sale of sweets , balloons and toys. Beauty was happy, she loves getting new toys on holiday. On our last holiday to Fuerteventura Beauty came back with a red parrot called Polly, a blue parrot called Paulie, a camel called Camel and a chess set(she chose the chess set!). THE PASSION PLAY OBERAMMERGAU I have also wanted to visited Oberammergau 1633    At the beginning a solemn promise was made: During the Thirty                        Years' War the Black Death came to Oberammergau in the year                        1632. In 1633 nearly every family bemoaned one or more victims                        as a consequence of the Black Death.    At the Cemetery (Beinhof) the Black Death invalids promised                        to act the history of Jesus Christ every ten years. The                        inhabitants of Oberammergau erected a Symbol for Jesus Christ.                        This is testified by an etching of the artist Hans Schwaighofer                        from Oberammergau.On Pentecost 1634 the inhabitants of Oberammergau acted                        the Play on a stage which was built at the cemetery and                        constructed over the fresh graves of the Black Death victims. and in 2010 I will DEFINITELY go. I have wanted to go since 1980 but money or life always got in the way BUT 2010 is definitely the year. OBERAMMERGAU Did you know that the men have to let their hair grow to take part Ash Wednesday 2009 : The  \"Hair Decree\"                           - from this date on  all the men in Oberammergau                          taking part in the play are  requested to let the                          hair on their heads and faces grow Love it! I may not be a traditionally religious person but I love to see how people express their religious beliefs in their way of life. Having a high proportion of relatives and in-laws that are Catholic I have witnessed and participated in many Catholic services and celebrations and I have always felt huge surges of spirituality at such gatherings. THE BASILICA VALENCIA   When I was in Valencia I attended a service in the  basilica which  was constructed between 1652 and 1667 . INSIDE THE BASILICA It was like stepping back in time with the older women in black dresses and head scarves, the incense and the prayers and the service was all conducted by candlelight ST JOHN'S VALETTA Whilst on Malta I visited the St John's co-cathedral at Valetta and it was one of the strangest churches I have ever been in, very eerie.

{"date": " March 25, 2007", "body": "\nFor someone who has never considered themselves to 'suffer' from  Seasonal Affective Disorde r  I certainly seem to whitter on enough about how I can't wait for the clocks to go forward an hour in March. And here we are ...........and I am ashamed to say I missed it. Silly moo! At 6:30 this morning Ariel got up to go to work, she told me her bus was at 7:50 and I gently reminded her of the time. She looked at me pityingly and told me in a manner I have witnessed too many time in Care of the Elderly establishments (sorry probably not a very  pc description but one most people use) that the clocks had changed. A few years ago, when the clocks all changed in the spring  I altered all the clocks BUT forgot my watch and ended up in work an hour early for a night shift! It wouldn't have been so bad but that ward was staffed with a few very unpleasant members of staff and that night I was working with a particularly unhelpful member of senior staff. One hour extra can seem like an eternity in those circumstances. As a result of working on that ward I left the NHS, I was newly qualified and a newly widowed mother of 5 children trying to keep it all together and I asked a senior member of staff for help with a certain procedure and she said , 'F-ck off, I'm not doing your   work for you'. Considering I was allegedly meant to be mentored because I was so newly qualified, the mentoring was non-existent.I left the NHS  and went to work in the private sector doing agency work which was as-and-when work and therefore better suited to a single parent. I loved working with older patients and I would never return to work on a ward in the NHS because of my fear of MRSA. I am currently studying for a Masters in Special Needs Education(Autism) so when I return to work my career will take a very different path, it will probably be something in the community with individuals with Special Needs. Thankfully no night terrors last night and no  Sporticus  this morning, Beauty seems to be happy dancing with  Boogie Beebies. I seem to be losing touch with TV at the moment, due to Beauty's  unpredictable sleeping I don't think that I have watched any TV in days which proves that I am not totally addicted! Even in the summer when I watch the likes of Big Brother I  only catch the highlights and the eviction show(well that's my excuse and I am sticking to it!).A while ago I bought the the first series of Life on Mars on DVD and as yet I haven't got around to watching it. I actually really enjoy watching TV and it is something that I do for an hour or so at the end of the day to wind down, I usually watch TV between 9 amd 10pm and maybe more if something interesting is on. Oops I have just remembered I did watch some TV last night! I saw the CAULIFLOWER episode of Two Pints of Lager............ even though they are repeats, Two Pints is one of my favourite shows on TV at the moment. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sada.org.uk/", "http://www.sada.org.uk/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/characterpages/lazytown/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/boogiebeebies/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/one-of-best-days-of-year.html", "title": "\nONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF THE YEAR!\n"},
{"date": " March 28, 2007", "body": "\nSecond stupidest thing that I heard yesterday, 'are the Buddhist's the ones who don't believe in sex?' If Buddhists didn't believe in having little Buddhists then the whole Buddhist world would not carry on! And the first stupidest thing? All my family knows not to give Beauty Daisies because she likes to eat them.........that's right EAT THEM! But after Beauty had eaten a daisy that had been given to her by her sister, her sisters response  when being told off was, 'But she likes Daisies' What like a shark likes to eat passing swimmers? But would you let them come and eat  you by advertising your where about with a sign that said,' fresh human for lunch' and jumping into the sharks mouth? SnoWhite  and  Fona  nominated the 'stupidest thing's' heard,this was totally their own idea! The other day I discussed  idealism  with the girls .........BIG mistake! As an example for greater understanding I talked about when a fridge is open you see a lighted fridge but when the door is closed then what you have previously seen does not exist. According to Descartes, we really know only what is in our own consciousnesses. We are immediately and directly aware of only our own states of mind. The whole external world is merely an idea or picture in our minds. Therefore, it is possible to doubt the reality of the external world as consisting of real objects. \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d is the only assertion that can\u2019t be doubted. The answer to this is  that an analogy is not a good way to discuss anything with a child on the autistic spectrum. Fiona could not grasp the analogy and got pretty pi**ed off when her argument against 'because I don't see it then it doesn't exist' was that the light isn't always on when you open the fridge because she likes to mess with the light and turn it on and off  was not deemed as  relevant ! Beauty was awake at 4:45am  and so my mind just cannot deal with the deeply philosophical and all I can think of at the moment is, 'why turn the fridge light on and off?' She got quite upset with this philosophical idea because she did not agree with it and thought it was stupid, and when I tried to explain it wasn't me who had expressed these idea but Descartes and he lived a long time ago and that she needed to take a chill pill , she was less than impressed. If there is ever the us of an analogy again with Fiona then Hello Kitty will feature prominently to grab her attention, with  SnoWhite  it will be Jared  Padalecki ! However,  I am the first to admit that stupid moments are also not just reserved for my children. Once on Big Brother a contestant asked how they could grow an egg into a chick and the production team made fun of the contestant! Well I am the first to admit that at the time I knew nothing about egg production and fertilisation and I am grateful for Google   who has now filled that gap in my knowledge! When I asked my parents questions that they didn't know the answer to they would tell me to look the answer up in a book,I tell my children to 'Google It'!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/google-it.html", "title": "\nGOOGLE IT!\n"},

Very clever! On Monday I stopped by the Doctors surgery to make an appointment for one of my daughters but was told that I could not have an appointment for her until the third week of April! For the last year my Doctors have been using a system whereby you phone at 8am and try and get a place that morning to see the Doctor, if it is non-urgent and you fail to get a place then you have to phone back the next day but if it is urgent then they will fit you in somewhere. In the last year I have NEVER made a morning appointment because I see those as being for more important or urgent things. I have only needed antibiotics once and I was lucky enough to have an appointment anyway. I feel incredibly guilty going to the Doctors as they are so busy and usually my appointment is medication related so I try to keep the appointment as short as possible, the appointments are in 10 minute slots but I try to be out of there as quickly as possible. My daughter's  appointment would also be a short one, we need some information and possible referral but the quandary is do you wait nearly a month for an appointment or go in the more urgent cases in the morning? If private health care did not exist then the NHS would go in to meltdown as it would not be able to cope with everybody but if you go for the private option then you are made to feel that you are queue jumping in some way or causing  trouble. I don't have spare money for private health care and any money I might spend on it would have to come from non-essentials such as food and clothing but if I had to spend the money I would find it. Twice I have used private health care and each case resulted in the need for an operation but I want to add that in no way did I queue jump, as a Nurse I personally could not have done that. If any of my children needed an operation and I felt that the wait on the NHS was too long and by waiting it would cause them stress or concern then I would re-mortgage my house  to pay for it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/help/safesurfing/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "http://www.privatehealth.co.uk/hospitaltreatment/treatment-news/february-2007/health-mots"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-quandary.html", "title": "\nWHAT A QUANDARY!\n"},
{"date": " April 02, 2007", "body": "\nToday I did the unthinkable...........I phoned the Doctor's surgery to make an emergency appointment for this morning for Beauty. Beauty has always chewed her hands and due to her lack of understanding her hands have never been scrupulously clean. You know the sort of thing, scratches her body and messes with her nose............a bit like many men you see in the street! Is that a gross generalisation? Well it's gross anyway. Anyway, back to Beauty, she had small holes in her skin from where she had been biting her hands and these have now developed into large infected holes on her hands and the wounds look disgusting and smell. Remember my lack of sense of smell? Well I can smell the wounds so I would say we have an urgent situation here. I looked up my Doctor's surgery on the web and the website said that to make an appointment for this morning I had to phone to make an appointment and the appointment line opened at 8am. I phoned at exactly at 8am and the phone line was engaged, it took me almost 30 minutes to get through and I was able to get one of the last appointments at 12 mid-day! Talking about wounds...............last night I watched  How Young Can I get? A new BBC 3 documentary - How Young Can I Get? - on April 1, explores the beauty industry in our age-obsessed society as Nicky Taylor undergoes a variety of treatments from skin care regimes to a tummy tuck Documentary-maker Nicky Taylor explores the often extreme world of anti-ageing for six weeks by using herself as a human guinea pig to be subjected to a vast array of treatments, from skin creams to tummy-tuck surgery.The documentary titled How Young Can I get? follows her through her ordeal, which explores the ways in which women in an age-obsessed society achieve their younger looks.In just six weeks, the 41 year old mum of three puts every product on the market to the test. From the latest creams and potions, to shock temperature treatments, botox, fillers and tummy tucks, Nicky does whatever it takes to return her face and body to a time before it was characterised by wrinkles, sags and bulges. But do they work, or are they just gimmicks in our youth-obsessed times? The results are surprising. I was all for Nicky Taylor having the tummy-tuck until we met the the lady whose tummy tuck went wrong, the wound became infected and left her horribly scarred. As I have said before, I have been in theatre and seen the most invasive of surgery but let me see it on TV or in photographs and I am a quivering mess. Well last night after seeing the photographs of the surgery that went wrong I was a QUIVERING MESS! Would I have cosmetic surgery after seeing that documentary, not a chance! I have always felt that after having lots of children my stomach was a problem but my stomach was not as large as Nicky's(sorry Nicky) and I am now ecstatically pleased with my stomach. I will never be able to wear hipster jeans but I never liked them anyway. I will stick to M&S high waist jeans with longer shirts. BUT after all the work that Nicky had done she did look brilliant but I didn't think she looked old before. We tried to guess Nicky's age(at the start of the show) and put her at middle to late 30's when in fact she is 41. After the surgery I didn't think Nicky looked any younger than our first estimate but she did look good for her age. That is what I have always said, I don't necessarily want to look younger for my age, just good for my age, and I think after a lifetime of not smoking, not drinking alcohol, using very little makeup and eating healthily I look OK for my age.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lemagazine.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1285803.mostviewed.how_young_can_i_get.php", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/time-heals-all-wounds.html", "title": "\nTIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS\n"},

I know that is a strange comment but imagine those ghost films where you hear the ghost children laughing but you don't see them? well that has been what it is like.

{"date": " March 31, 2007", "body": "\nDid anyone read this in the last week? Call for blogging code of conduct The support for a blogger hounded by death threats has intensified with some high profile web experts calling for a code of conduct in the blogosphere. The female blogger at the centre of the row has been shocked to discover that hers is not an isolated incident. It has led her and others to question some of the unwritten rules of blogging. It could force a re-examination of the way the tight-knit blogging community behaves. the article goes on   Ms Sierrra has personally witnessed the usually harmless feuding that is part and parcel of blogging take on an altogether more sinister tone, with threats of a violent and sexual nature gathering pace over the last month. She agonised over whether to publicise what had happened to her, she told the BBC News website. Since describing the campaign against her, she has been shocked to discover that cyber-bullying is widespread.\"As well as around 900 comments on my blog and hundreds of comments on other blogs, I have received around 300 personal e-mails and about 70% of them say they have been through a similar thing,\" she told the BBC News website.Among the messages is one from a blogger Ms Sierra described as \"far more prominent than me\" who has been avoiding industry conferences because of persistent online threats. Ms Sierra herself pulled out of a planned appearance at ETech in San Diego this week. She believes it is time the technology blogging community sat up and took notice. \"I think there is a culture of looking the other way. When other prominent people look the other way it is creating an environment that allows this type of behaviour,\" she said. She also thinks it could be time to re-examine whether the blogosphere needs to be completely uncensored. \"There is an unwritten rule in the blogosphere that it is wrong to delete nasty comments. It suggests that you can't take criticism but now there is a sense that this is nonsense,\" she said. Denise Howell, a US lawyer and blogger, believes that the blogosphere is no place for legal requirements. \"The tools of the Live Web have made it easier than ever for ordinary people to communicate and express views in their individual capacities, and to provide platforms, e.g. on their blogs, for others to do so,\" she said. \"I think anyone who enjoys any aspect of the Live Web would celebrate this fact, and agree its vitality would be impaired if the law expected or required these ordinary people to envelop themselves and their sites in elaborate legal provisos and conditions if they hope to be shielded from potential responsibility for the bad acts of others,\" she said.The Kathy Sierra situation is, she said, \"forcing bloggers to examine their moral compasses on a number of fronts\". But, ultimately self-regulation is the only way forward, she believes. The first I became aware of cyber bullying was on  DOOCE's  website. Dooce is the US woman who was sacked for talking about her workmates in her blog, hence the term ..........to be  'dooced' - to lose your job because of blooging. Every few months or so Dooce publishes some of the emails she has received that  are not so nice. Her latest batch of hate mail was published on  15 March 2007 , I never cease to be shocked at the awful things people say. Here are some of the best(worst) bits You\u2019re an absolute joke of the worst kind\u2026GET  A FRIGGIN LIFE. And I hope your dog runs away and never comes back because that would be the best day ever! Hi my name is deland i\u2019m from salt lake i seen your story in the paper so I thought i would check out your blog . Well I think its Lousy it really sucks I bet the only thing  U R GOOD AT IS SUCKING ON DICKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, yes you have to be one of the most pathetic people I have ever seen in my life. for God\u2019s sake (and I\u2019m not even religious) please stop abusing your child.Your family should sue you too. I\u2019ve enjoyed your blog but I thnk that you have some serious issues. I read about your legal battles, your depression and all of your other problems, and I can\u2019t help but think that bad things keep happening to you because you are a bad person. I mean look at how much you husband and your child have suffered because of you, and the more publicity you try to get for yourself the more awful things seem to happen in your life. In addition when your child gets older and goes to school everyone there could know that her mother is literally crazy. Imagine how hard that will be for her. Why are you doing this to your family? Do you really need the money that badly? Why did you turn comments off? Mad because they point out that you are medicated fool? That you really have nothing going on? That you really aren\u2019t that sharp? That you act irresponsibly and foolishly? That you aren\u2019t that attractive? I just started reading. blogs like last week. I do\u2019nt really care what mundan nerds do and then write about. But, you are so cynical. I c\u2019ant get why you would have such a depressed. blase, I dont give a fuck, mean-spirited-attitude. Is that supposed to be \u201ccool?\u201d Its really dorky. Even the \u201cdooce\u201d thing is dorky\u2026what is that? poo? a gambling reference? (SAHF) or a Shit Ass Ho Fuckingbadass? what does that mean? its soooo fuckin dumb\u2026.  oh, the only reason I feel compelled to do this, is cuz you get paid for it and its your job. Therefore, I am within my right to criticize. I certainly would\u2019nt go picking on some 14 year olds blog, about the same mentality tho\u2026 Every time I read the hate mail Dooce receives I am gob smacked that people can behave in this way. What are they trying to achieve? If it were fame from being published on Dooce's website it is a weird kind of fame, fame for being a nasty piece of work! I try never to be nasty about people on my blog, I now feel really guilty because of the picture of  Lembit Opik looking really dumb  that I put on my site( I previously discussed how I felt I had lost respect for Opik because of him cheating on Sian Lloyd with a Cheeeky Girl). I try never to be nasty to people as I really think there is something in  KARMA . Yesterday within minutes of writing Would I be happy to be a patient in the NHS? The only way you would get me in to a ward is if I were unconscious and it was an emergency situation I had fallen and hurt myself....................now there's Karma for you! Beauty was playing on her computer and something was really upsetting her, she likes to play lots of different games but doesn't understand how to play them all so she gets very frustrated. I got up to help her and my arthritic knee just collapsed under me and I fell hitting my ankle, my knee, my hip and I really hit the side of my head hard on the door frame. I lay on the floor shocked, trying to decide whether I should puke or pass out but when I realised that neither were going to happen and the stars I had been seeing had settled, so I decided to see if I could stand up. I suddenly realised that I had forgotten about Beauty but all was fine, just as I decided to try and get up she came to me, stepped over my head and sat down at the computer again! The fact that she was totally unaware that anything had happened and her totally lack of empathy scared me more than the actual fall. What would have happened to her if anything had happened to me? Ariel my 17 year old is convinced that I need one of those emergency button things that you have on a string around your neck, if you have a fall then you press it and they contact somebody on your emergency phone numbers list. I managed to get up fine, a bit of a sore hip and a lot of a sore head but I am sure no real damage has been done. Imagine if Karma is real and I had said something really bad?(just joking). \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6502643.stm", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/03_15_2007.html", "http://www2.blogger.com/dooced", "http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/03_15_2007.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/03/cyber-bullying-and-karma.html", "title": "\nCYBER BULLYING AND KARMA\n"},
{"date": " April 05, 2007", "body": "\nI hear I have a possible new group of readers.............the ex-in laws. When told by one of my daughters my only thought was OK, as I have said before I think a blog is better than a diary because diaries get too personal for my liking but I have never said anything on my blog I wouldn't want anyone to read. However, I am still selective about who I tell about my blog because going to the school playground and having someone start to discuss something I had written would be too weird. I remember  Dooce  saying something about a relative reading something she had written(no not her Mum and the face cream episode) and being surprised that they read her blog. As for the whole diary thing, any parent  who could possibly read a child's diary has to be a braver person than me. In the 6 th  form Belle was an avid diary writer and once on an expedition to find dirty laundry in her room I found her diary, when I realised what it was I dropped it like a hot potato! I have read pieces of paper that started life as a journal when I have been cleaning my girls bedrooms and I always feel real sad when I read them because I feel that I have failed my children when they talk about things they have wanted or never had and I can't go back and change the past. I have one such sheet of paper that even made me cry and I have it in a safe place. That is one of my secrets. I have become addicted to reading  Postsecret , am I the only one who on the whole finds  Postsecret  sad? I want to wrap these people up in my arms and take away their sadness.........go on, call me a daft cow. It must be the mother in me. And back to who is reading my blog.............. I know members of my family read, friends from a long ago religious life, friends from my current journey to find spiritual truth, autism friends, TV lovers(like myself), ex in laws, politics friends, computer class friends and a whole lot of others because all those mentioned do not add up to over a hundred views a day! I know that people like  Dooce  get thousands of views a day but who are these people who could possibly be interested in what I have to say? Whoever you are ..........thank you for being interested. Well today is the day when I have to phone the Doctor's surgery back as there is no real change in Beauty's hand. The wound actually seems bigger but when I changed the dressings yesterday the bleeding seemed to have stopped. The time before when I did the dressing the wound seemed to pump blood. Hopefully the results will also be back on the infection. I have very  sensitive  skin and the scrupulous hand washing seems to be taking it's toll on my hands, I am using a lot of  Sudocrem , my magic cream! Yesterday I went with  Runningman  to his hospital appointment with an  ENT  specialist because of his tinnitus and deafness.  Runningman  ALWAYS has infections in his ears and nothing seems to get rid of the infection and I explained this to the nurse and said that she might want to wear gloves as the infections were so virulent. But she didn't want to and messed with his infected ears with bare hands, didn't wash her hands and then proceeded to touch equipment, her clothes, her pen,  Runningman's  notes. The food hygiene advert off TV came into my mind where someone is preparing meat and doesn't wash their hands properly and every thing they then touch turns blue to show how cross infection happens. After 2 minutes watching the Doctor extract ear wax without wearing gloves I couldn't look anymore. It was where the ear wax extractor was being constantly placed that got me, it was being placed directly onto the patients reclining chair. The extractor also touched equipment and the Doctor's clothes. I really believe my GP was grateful when I insisted on taking Beauty's dressing's off and putting new dressings on. I really did not want my GP to have to touch Beauty's yucky hands and someone else come into contact with the infection. Does anyone remember this from last year?             Doctor ties 'to go in  MRSA  fight'                                                                                                                                                             Superbugs  can be carried on ties, the  BMA  says                            Medics should ditch ties in a bid to combat hospital  superbugs  such as  MRSA , doctors' leaders say. The British Medical Association has urged its members to shun the  neckwear  as they are rarely cleaned and could be a source of infections. It said the most important measure that could be taken was for patients, staff and visitors to clean their hands regularly. Hospital infections are linked to the deaths of up to 5,000 people in the UK every year, and cost the  NHS  up to \u00a31 bn  annually. In England, the report said, 300,000 patients acquire infections in hospitals every year and at any given time some 9% of hospital patients are infected. A 15% reduction in the incidence of hospital infections would free up around \u00a3150m a year for other  NHS  resources, the  BMA  said.     Dr Vivienne  Nathanson , the  BMA's  head of ethics and science, said: \"It is unlikely that any health service will ever be completely free of hospital infections but there is a lot more that doctors, nurses, cleaners, patients and their visitors could be doing to reduce infections spreading - the fact is around 15% to 30% are preventable. \"A lot of the solutions like hand-washing may sound simple. While strict guidelines are in place about how health professionals need to wash their hands, there are barriers to compliance. \"One of the major barriers to doctors following these guidelines is time and the pressure to treat patients and meet targets. \"Another can be the layout of clinical areas and access to washing facilities.\" Shadow Health Secretary Andrew  Lansley  said: \"The level of  healthcare  associated infections is unacceptably high and the government have failed to curb the rising number of cases. \"Patient confidence in the  NHS  needs to be restored. But this can only happen if there are clear and workable guidelines for staff.\" But Health Minister Jane Kennedy said reducing  MRSA  was one of the key priority for hospitals. She highlighted the measures already taken to improve hospital cleanliness and the Health Bill going through Parliament, which includes plans for a hygiene code and tougher inspections to tackle infections. Don't get me wrong, in every other way this Doctor was really good but \"One of the major barriers to doctors following these guidelines is time and the pressure to treat patients and meet targets.\" \"Another can be the layout of clinical areas and access to washing facilities.\"  was not an issue. And why didn't I say anything. Because the Doctor was professional in every other way and can you imagine having to go back to see that Doctor after questioning his ability? I think it is probably best if  Runningman  goes to the next appointment alone.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dooce.com/", "http://postsecret.blogspot.com/", "http://www.sudocrem.co.uk/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4735038.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/welcome_05.html", "title": "\nWELCOME!\n"},

{"date": " April 09, 2007", "body": "\nLast night I watched  Wife Swap  on TV and it made for uncomfortable viewing. The one husband ended up telling  his wife Ruth that  if they carried on the way they were going that  they would probably end up thinking about divorcing..............not your usual entertaining Sunday night viewing! Ruth insisted on eating totally healthy food, taking her children to out of school activities and doing lots of sport herself but there was little one to one time with  and her husband. She was also a  paraplegic  and confined to a wheelchair. I think that one of the daughters from the swap family described the situation well, she told Ruth she was a bitch and that she did things because she wanted to prove she was as good as everybody else. Ruth had previously talked about her need to live life to the full and not letting anything stop her. Sue the other wife described Ruth as a control freak. Now I found nothing wrong with the whole healthy eating issue, ours is a low or no fat, low or no salt and low or no sugar household but I don't make a huge deal of it. My 15 year old loves strawberries, she loves the genetically modified looking gigantic ones and every time she wants them I tell her she is going to wake up one day and find she has grown an extra head! Which of course she doesn't find funny! She is also not keen on the healthy option beans that I buy but if she wants to buy ordinary beans then that is fine by me. SnoWhite is renowned for being able to eat anything and everything and she does but her eating habits have definitely improved since she has become a vegetarian . I may tell her that some food is not good for her and she is going to end up a heffalump but I don't stop her eating what she wants to eat. Ruth in the wife swap went into the second week and made the rule changes and part of the changes included healthy eating. Whenever I have seen this sort of thing happen on Wife Swap and other such shows I think that the big mistake is to go from one extreme to the other.  Make them pizza and chips but make  the healthy option, I make soya mince  spaghetti bolognese and lasagne and you cannot tell the difference, home made chicken nuggets............when trying to convert people to healthy eating it is important to give them what they like BUT the healthy option. However, I remember reading something Jane Fonda said about when her family first started healthy eating, she spoke about birthday cakes being huge, heavy , healthy masterpieces but then she realised that having treats of things that you like now and then is not a problem and they went back to having sugar filled birthday cake creations. Becoming the food police is just not going to work. I was shocked on the program to see Ruth appear to become quite manipulative, when one of the girls wouldn't get up in the morning after constant calling . Ruth went up the stairs and started crying and tried to turn everything around to how unhappy she was. Do I sound cold and callous to a disabled woman? I don't think so, Ruth wants to be seen as a capable women and to be treated equally. If it had been me in that situation then I would have said SOD THEM,  and left them there. If they want to be late for school and get into trouble then it is up to them. Some times I can barely  lift my head off the pillow in the morning  due to  pain from the arthritis and the Dercum's and the last thing I would be in the mood for is dealing with stroppy teen aged girls. I also do not think that taking your children to ballet , Brownies, swimming and violin lessons  once a week are too much  for a child if that is what they want to do. I think the whole issue was the control aspect of Ruth controlling everything they do is more the problem. The funniest and sweetest bit was Sue's daughter Tierney who is autistic asking Ruth about how she managed to have sex because she was disabled. I really don't think that Tierney could get her head around the fact that even though Ruth was disabled and couldn't walk she could ever manage to have sex. Tierney saw it very literally, your legs do not work so everything else must not work. I really liked Sue's and Ruth's girls and felt that they were a credit to their parents. The best thing that I liked about the show was the fact that Sue was a big girl but she was bright, happy and confident. Being a tall and athletically built  person I feel that too often society makes you feel as if you are a failure  and stupid if you are not a UK size 10. None of my girls are short and Fiona is already 6 foot plus at 15  and from the look of it Beauty is going to be taller!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/tvpdb?d=tvp&id=170321828&cf=0&lineup=uk&channels=europe_ch4&chspid=166005000&chname=Channel+4&title=Wife+Swap&normalized=Wife+Swap&progutn=1176087600&.intl=uk", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/wife-swap.html", "title": "\nWIFE SWAP\n"},

{"date": " April 11, 2007", "body": "\n5am wake up call! Beauty is happily flitting between watching BBC 2 clips and Balamory whilst I attempt to stay awake. I watched the last episode of Life on Mars last night and it was a good ending , better than I expected. I shall definitely miss the series , it was brilliant acting. Later on I heard somebody on TV saying that Life on Mars had ended and that Sam had killed himself to go back to 1973 but that's not what I thought had happened. In the end in 1973 Sam is sat in the car and he hears on the radio that he is too deep in the coma and they couldn't get him out. So does that mean he never really came back to the 21st century and that he was just imagining coming back and that was not real? Way too deep for me. But the good news is.....................there is a sequel set in the 1980's with Gene Hunt. Brilliant. The only other programs that I watch every week now are Supernatural and Dr Who, though of course I still sometime watch the re-runs of 2 Pints of Lager and I always find those funny. SnoWhite spent the night at her own flat, I had forgotten just how quiet the house is without her(no offense!). Fiona spent the evening in her room watching a new DVD so that made the house quieter and Ariel spent the evening working in her most favourite place IKEA. Yesterday I managed to finish washing all of Ariel's extensive collection of hoodies, Beauty's small toys and Fiona's duvet and cover. Today it is on to Beauty's larger toys, any other duvets and covers and anything else that isn't nailed down! Over the last few days I have spent many hours in the garden, pegging out or bringing in washing and sitting down whilst Beauty plays in her sand pit, I had forgotten how much that insignificant little area plays in my life when the weather is good. I put out blankets and throws and cushions on to the bench and the gravel and we all generally spend more time outside together. It will be brilliant when the builders come back and change the front window into a door and a window so we can access the play area that has been built out the front garden. We have a 6 foot fence and a safety play surface but no safe way to access it. Let's hope it is finished before the end of the summer! As you can tell from the above I have such an exciting life, the highlight of yesterday was going to ASDA to buy a watering can! One of the main advantages of the better weather is that Beauty can play outside more and when she does this I sit with her and read and I have a lot of new books that I have bought and never read. At the moment I am reading John Connolly's  Book of Lost Things , I love John Connolly's books but as I started to read this new book I kept thinking, 'I have read something like this before'. Then it hit me, it reminded me of the childhood of  C S Lewis  in his book Surprised by Joy, not everything of course but it reminded me of it. Did anyone else who read Book of Lost things think the same? Book of Lost things is so different from John Connolly's other books but I am enjoying it, I wish I could be such a good writer. This story is so sad. A woman left infertile after cancer therapy has lost her fight to use embryos fertilised by an ex-partner. Natallie Evans, from Trowbridge, Wilts, and Howard Johnston began IVF treatment in 2001 but he withdrew consent for the embryos to be used after they split up. She turned to the European courts after exhausting the UK legal process. Ms Evans, 35, said she was \"distraught\" after the Grand Chamber of the European Court ruling, but Mr Johnston said \"common sense had prevailed\". I feel so sorry for Natalllie Evans, I just do not understand why eggs were not stored at the same time as the embryos and this situation would never have happened. Having never been involved in this kind of situation I obviously do not know the ins and outs of what happens but perhaps in future the storage of both eggs and embryos will stop these terrible tragedies happening again. I know I could not make the decision in this type of situation to say I wanted the embryos destroyed and I certainly could not destroy the embryo physically myself. Sorry yesterdays blog entry was somewhat brief but I have a really bad pain in the neck and I am not referring to any of the girls! I have quite a few lumps(Dercum's Disease) in my neck and my back and the ones in my neck occasionally swell up and become really painful. Well the neck pain is agony at the moment and the only things that help are distraction(hence the constant cleaning )or lying down with a support under my neck and the lying down is not usually an option with Beauty. Leave Beauty for a second and she is raiding the fridge.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.johnconnollybooks.com/novels_lost.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/i-promise-im-awakei-just-look-still.html", "title": "\nI PROMISE I'M AWAKE...................I JUST LOOK STILL ASLEEP!\n"},

Go on,  google  BBC2  ident s .........there are websites to this stuff, I kid you not! Last night I watched  House , and it frightened the life out of me.

Beauty is constantly eating sand, at home and in school. Our sand pit has recently been cleaned out but I don't know the situation with the school box so I shall have to check that out. But then even normally developing children eat things that they shouldn't, Anastasia and Belle ate a tub of  Tums  when they were younger BECAUSE they tasted like sweets! Beauty's speech has really accelerated in the last few days and she is really enjoying naming everything, this means we are getting to hear more of her voice. Can anyone explain why she speaks with what sounds like a Russian accent! Occasionally we could hear it before but now she is speaking more we hear it all the time. And no girls I do not think it is  relevant  that she visited Russia when she was 2! She seems to speak from the back of her throat, very low down.

I also went back to my computer class today but I spent most of the time printing off photographs for SnoWhite, she has been taking lots of photographs of flowers for a Uni project. Belle will be home for two weeks from Florida tomorrow so there is a flurry of house cleaning. Fiona is busily painting a kitchen cabinet of mine powder blue, I intend to paint the shelves in the kitchen the same colour. Anastasia will also be back for the funeral as well so I am looking forward to being able to take photographs of all the girls together, it will be the first time in ages that the 6 of them will all be together. The last time the 6 of them were all together SnoWhite broke her nose whilst putting up the fold down seat in the back of the Zafira, Anastasia clicked her nose back into shape! Ouch! I have also caught my head on the seat as it returns to the upright position VERY quickly, not nice! My nieces baby Dotty is being christened on Sunday so Belle will be able to attend the christening, maybe Anastasia will be able to go too. We shall see. I took Fiona and SnoWhite to the fabric shop today and I bought lots of fabric at \u00a31 a metre, on the way back we passed the park and as we passed Beauty said, 'ice cream' and she was devastated when we didn't stop. Later on I had to go to the chemist and so I stopped at the garage to buy a tub of ice cream...........she was thrilled-but what a mess! It is no longer just BBC 2 idents that Beauty is watching but she seems to have found idents from other channels and program theme tunes, she is now word perfect on the Neighbours theme tune. When Anastasia was 6 it was her favourite program! Children can do such strange things! I have been quite busy this afternoon so for tea I put some individual soya mince pies into the oven and first of all Fiona said she didn't want any but eventually decided that she would have one. I asked her what she wanted with it and she made herself a tin of sausages and beans and had that with the pie!

They have just finished the final shop in the new row of stores in Pentwyn............ a  BETFRED -just what we needed! I have known 2 serious gamblers in my life and it has not made them happy people, one was massively in debt and the other lost his family because of his gambling. I have decided that I know why I do not drive my car around town much in the daytime because the roads are filled with too many idiots. On a roundabout an old lady pulled out in front of me and went I beeped at her as I nearly hit her the look on her face was.'oh dear, did I do something wrong'. A taxi driver undertook me and a huge row of lorries were playing convoys and wouldn't let anyone into the dual carriageway. Next time I will avoid the dual carriageway but I had to go out today as I needed to hand in a form at the County Hall. I watched  Half Ton Hospital  on TV last night and boy was I really shocked. I know I am over-weight and I am trying to lose weight to live healthily and longer to be with my family and of course like everybody else I want to look good but if this show was meant to shock then it certainly worked. I was shocked! Whilst I was ill and after I hit my head, I didn't exercise but now that I am feeling better I am definitely going to be exercising more. It must be devastating to be so morbidly obese that you cannot get out of bed. I really do not believe that food addiction is taken as seriously as addictions to alcohol, tobacco and drugs. I love making bread and I love eating bread, I wouldn't need anything else and I really believe that my love of bread is an addiction.

Actually if it were just the music I would probably let her watch them because they are quite good but it is actually the images that are a problems. I do not know if it is actually an episode of South Park or photo shopped in some  way  but  a  Telly Tubby has his head explode  in an episode.  This is probably the tamest of what she has been watching. I can see how adults and teenage boys might find this kind of humour funny but it is definitely not suitable for six year  olds . Well I suppose it is better than the time we found somebody on-line offering her  cyber  sex...........in French! After the Telly Tubby head exploding situation I now think I was overly harsh to the BBC2  idents ! I can certainly see the evidence of getting older. When I was younger (which seems far, far away in some other life time) my body seemed to naturally take care of itself and healing and repairing seemed quick and easy but as time has gone on it seems to take a lot more effort to keep fit and healthy. Without going in to gruesome details too early in the morning, take my feet. When I was younger they were fine and I never really thought about them but in the last few years they have got dryer and dyer and my heels have previously split which was really painful. Now I am constantly working on the heels and if I were to leave it off for a week then they would get bad again. I LOVE looking on the  internet  for ways to take care of myself. I found a suggestion on line which I have found works a treat on my feet. After  pumicing  my feet last thing at night I smother my feet in  vaseline  and put on a pair of socks and in the morning my feet are so soft. Since Christmas I have also been wearing  Crocs  and they really are wonderful on my feet, they have a really good arch support and I wear them everywhere. As I have said before, I really dislike going to the doctors as I always feel like a time waster. What I usually do is when I go to the Doctors for medication updates , I discuss any problems that I might have had since the last visits and how I have dealt with it and the doctor has always said that was fine. Obviously if it were anything serious I would go to the doctor as quickly as possible(!) but as yet everything has been fine. My children find our doctors mode of diagnosing conditions extremely funny, I actually have no issue with it because I have always said that doctors are 'best guessers'.  SnoWhite  has  vitiligo   and the  vitiligo  patches are pretty obvious. When she went to the doctor about it initially he used an on line diagnostic tool to diagnose the condition. Remember........... SnoWhite  was a lot younger when she was first diagnosed, her reaction was 'I could have done that'. I then explained the training doctors had to go through and how I wouldn't do it in a million life times and she was a lot more impressed. I personally have a lot of friends who are doctors from my nurses training days and as a family with also have a lot of friends who are doctors and I honestly do not know how they cope. I trained at the same time as one family friend, his eldest is the same age as Fiona  and they are also  friends so  we have seen  the father who  is Children's  Specialist Consultant throughout his working career and I don't know how he copes. How can you possibly go home and turn off after the kind of day he must have had. I only worked with adults in the  NHS  so I do not know what the funding is like with children but I certainly hope that the services are provided a lot faster than they are for adults.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=LadyHeartilly", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/come-back-bbc2-identsall-is-forgiven.html", "title": "\nCOME BACK BBC2 IDENTS..........ALL IS FORGIVEN!\n"},

Getting up early is not nice at the best of times but for your every movement to be accompanied by the barking of a pair of mutts is just downright irritating. Remember the story of  The Boy Who Cried Wolf. What about The Dogs Who Barked? Due to circumstances, I had to go out again in the car during the day and everywhere I go I am surrounded by drivers who believe that they do not need to indicate. As I tell my children, I am not psychic and I do not have eyes in my butt! My day has been no better at home, I feel like Nicole  Kidman (though obviously not as pretty or as thin) in  The Others. Am I a ghost and I do not realise it? I ask my children to put away the clothes I have washed, dried and folded- repeatedly but still at 7:30pm they are in baskets in my kitchen!

{"date": " April 24, 2007", "body": "\nSometimes because I don't consciously think about being disabled, I wonder ,'Am I really that bad?' I have thought about going without my medication for a day or two to see but thankfully thought better of it. My first medication of the day no longer seems to work as well as it used to and my joints take until about mid-day to get going but even then I still feel a numbness in my joints for the rest of the day. The only way to describe it is it is like your face being numbed up when you go to the dentist and it  slowly comes back to life except I never quite get full mobility. Beauty's computer is on a small table with a small chair so if you have to do anything for her you have to bend down and getting down there always seems like a good idea but getting up again is just not so easy. I also have damage in my lower back from a fall and walking a few steps is OK but any more seems to irritate and the area of damage becomes swollen and painful. When I have been sitting down for even for a few minutes my joints seize up and getting up and walking around is quite difficult. My children find it quite funny and they say that I look like an old lady hobbling around! I think it is quite good that they see  my disabilities in such an  ordinary way and accept them( a little help wouldn't go amiss though!) but I think because they can't understand the pain and lack of movement they do not always appreciate the severity. It has even been suggested by one of them that I should go back to work though who exactly would employ me at the moment would be a difficult one to answer! Any wakeful nights with Beauty leave me considerably less mobile the next day and with my lack of mobility I would probably be a Health and Safety risk but then I suppose that I could use my wheelchair. I think the worst bit is that half the week all I want to do is get Beauty to school so I can come home again and lie down for a nap just to recover from the sleepless night! And who I could get to care for Beauty whilst I worked would also be a problem, I can't get respite care now. Any employer would laugh me off the premises. Perhaps I could work from home. Perhaps I could write a ' miserable childhood' (mis lit,painful life,real life) book as they seem to be  selling quite well at the moment. Anonymously of course! I know I hate reading 'miserable childhood stories' but do all these people who write them really do it for  cathartic reasons? Beauty had a small episode of night terrors last night but she went back to sleep quite quickly. Even with the very dark curtains on the window I still think that the window is an issue for her and she is worried by it. Even though Beauty is very autistic in lots of ways she still does some very normal childhood things, she gives hugs and kisses if she wants something badly enough, she is very aware of clothes and loves wearing pretty things and of course she is afraid of the dark. If she sleeps on my bed which is further away from the window then she is a lot happier. We have three living rooms downstairs since the extension was built and the middle room has wooden double doors to the lounge and wooden double doors with large glass windows to the back room but no outside window and Beauty spent a few years sleeping in there with no problems but the room was stifling hot all year round and difficult to sleep in . Perhaps I might have to rethink bedrooms again! Sorry I am late blogging today but I am just off to pick up Anastasia from Stanstead airport, just a tiny road trip of 6 1/2 hours.

If asked to describe the little sweetheart I would only be able to say that he was a teenager wearing a hoodie and a baseball cap and driving a red escort.What frightened  me most was the fact that as he cut across in front of me was the thought that he was being chased by a police car and we were all going to get hit and be killed by the police car!

The National Union of Teachers and the British Heart Foundation are among 10 groups highlighting \"inconsistencies\" with the rules governing TV adverts. The industry said there was no need for more restrictions like those on TV ads. The new code for non-broadcast adverts, including those appearing on websites, was unveiled this month by the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP). Its measures - to come into force on 1 July - do not include \"rules to restrict the volume or frequency of food advertising to children\" and failed to \"differentiate between healthy and unhealthy foods\", said the 10 groups. How many children like to go to the supermarket with their parents? They would rather stay at home....... so the only places they would really see  an array of food products is on TV or the computer or in their friends school bags at lunch times. Food ads need to have tighter rules. My children may have wanted all these wonderful things in the supermarket when they were growing up but they knew that we could not afford them  so they accepted this and didn't ask more than once if they could have something. Educate the children when they are young is the answer. I KNOW that teachers have a national curriculum but they still need to teach Personal and Social Education  and Biology where they can teach about healthy eating, they can teach about healthy eating in Maths and English. The government should set out regulations whereby only  certain products are allowed into schools and make this the same for all schools. Some times country wide  rules are a good idea. After watching  Home and Away  and  Neighbours,  my girls have said that they would have loved to have worn summer dresses like the seniors do in these shows if it had been the school rules then everyone would have had to and it would have been OK. Ariel's  school made them  wear full uniform in the summer, shirt, tie and blazer even in the 5th form during the summer but Belle's school was more sensible and they wore open necked shirts. I don't think teachers fully realise the power that they have, how many times has your little sweetheart come home and said things like 'Did you know that passive smoking causes cancer?' 'The world is choking on exhaust fumes' I was taught about the environment in school in the 60's so I am quite happy for my children to be taught now.

I have found reports which say it is only a temporary measure and we should concentrate on long term projects and another report said that tree planting can actually harm certain  eco -systems by the trees drying up rivers. I had wanted to buy a  Sun Oven  for a  family   wh o otherwise  would not be able to buy an oven,  the  Sun Oven  serves the  purpose of helping a poor family to  make the purchase and also to stop the use of burning wood. I saw the website a few months ago but I forgot to bookmark it and now I cannot find it. The project provided Sun Ovens for individuals in either South America or Mexico.

And talking about Maltesers Mars starts using animal products Masterfoods' brands are household names Some of the UK's best-selling chocolate bars, such as Mars and Twix, will no longer be suitable for vegetarians.Also affecting brands such as Snickers and Maltesers, owner Masterfoods said it had started to use animal product rennet to make its chocolate products. Masterfoods said the change was due to it switching the sourcing of its ingredients and the admission was a \"principled decision\" on its part. The Vegetarian Society said the company's move was \"incomprehensible\". Masterfoods said it had started using rennet from 1 May and non-affected products had a \"best before date\" up to 1 October. Masterfoods' decision to use non-vegetarian whey is a backward step say the Vegetarian Society Rennet, a chemical sourced from calves' stomachs, is used in the production of whey. It will now also be found in Bounty, Minstrels and Milky Way products, and the ice cream versions of all Masterfoods' bars. \"If the customer is an extremely strict vegetarian, then we are sorry the products are no longer suitable, but a less strict vegetarian should enjoy our chocolate,\" said Paul Goalby, corporate affairs manager for Masterfoods. The Vegetarian Society said it was \"extremely disappointed\". \"At a time when more and more consumers are concerned about the provenance of their food, Masterfoods' decision to use non-vegetarian whey is a backward step,\" it said in a statement. \"Mars products are very popular with young people and many will be shocked to discover that their manufacture now relies on the extraction of rennet from the stomach lining of young calves,\" it added.

One rider who was banned for dangerous driving told BBC TV's Week In Week Out that he would do the same again once he gets his licence back. Police have said too many riders are using the roads like a racetrack. Bikers Ross Hallam and Leroy Osowiecki were filmed by a North Wales Police helicopter crew riding at speed, weaving between the traffic and undertaking on the hard shoulder while driving home to Stoke-on-Trent from Llandudno. \"It was dreadful and, of all the years I've been policing, it's the worst motorcycle driving I have ever seen,\" said Pc Dafydd Hedd Evans, who was in the helicopter.  I have known 2 people die in motorcycle accidents, 2 people too many. One left a wife and 2 children. OK they may love the thrill of it but being left a widow with children is not a thrilling thing.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6647137.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6653175.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6655021.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/05/eating-her-curds-and-whey.html", "title": "\nEATING HER CURDS AND WHEY\n"},
{"date": " May 14, 2007", "body": "\nI have set Google Alerts to my email that cover a number of issues, mostly to do with green issues and autism and I never cease to be amazed at how the same problems seem to occur over and over again ALL over the world. For the green issues it seems that we all want *Less, no or bio-degradable packaging *The ability to recycle everything easily *Guidance and advice and help on how to lessen our eco-footprint Now does that sound too much to ask? For the issues regarding autism we also seem to want the same thing *Equality of educational and social care provision for our children *Acceptance and no discrimination *Better education about autism and educational and social provision I am sure that the list is endless for what other parents feel that they would need. So why is everything so difficult? My theory has always been that if you do not like the way that something is being done then don't bitch about it but actively do something to solve the problem. But even the most active and capable and intelligent person it seems  can only do so much before they have an intense desire to hit their head against a brick wall. And what do the majority of people from my Google Alerts seem to think the biggest problem is? MONEY......................MONEY..........................MONEY.......................... CLEAR AND SIMPLE! For green issues *bio-degradable packaging costs more money *The ability to recycle everything easily costs more money *Guidance and advice and help on how to lessen our eco-footprint-effort and costs more money BUT surely these COST issues are shortsighted and will cost much, much more in the long term? And for the issues regarding autism *Equality of educational and social care provision for our children costs more money *Acceptance and no discrimination - lack of acceptance and discrimination can happen  because of lack of equality in educational and social care provision which happens because of the failure to invest enough money into these areas *Better education about autism and educational and social provision-are you going to be educated on what you are entitled to if they don't have the money to give it to you? It seems ethically wrong to deny a child full provision of social and educational care if their parents have spent their whole adult life working and contributing through taxes for the provisions they are entitled to. It seems ethically wrong to deny a child full provision of social and educational care if their parents have been unable to contribute to taxes due to ill health t seems ethically wrong to deny a child full provision of social and educational care if their parents have been unable to contribute to taxes if  their parents are long term unemployed which is not the fault of the child. I have to say that the civil servants who allocate the SEN funding in my area are totally unbiased as to your circumstances as described above-they treat you all the same and make you all grovel and make you all feel like you are  scroungers who are  not entitled to anything. I once told one of these individuals that if it were their child they would work the system and not rest until they got everything for their child,the individual said she was offended that I should say that and it was not true. I told her that I didn't care if she were offended and It was true and if she surveyed all the local parents of children with SEN's the would feel exactly the same. You can guess how popular I am with the local council! And as for the green issues, well we all know the results of what is happening there . \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/05/google-alerts.html", "title": "\nGOOGLE ALERTS\n"},
{"date": " May 02, 2007", "body": "\nOnly when they they start happening again do you think about early wake-up calls............well that's my theory. This morning I awoke with a start to see it was already light and hurriedly looked at the clock to check that I wasn't late but I wasn't ,it was only 4:30pm. Over the past few weeks Beauty has been sleeping quite well, so well that I hadn't even noticed that the mornings were getting lighter and lighter. I was very surprised this morning when I saw it was only 4:30am. I used to love working nights as a nurse, especially with the light mornings. Today is the day I get the chance to air my views on Special Needs Issues. The election is tomorrow and today  Radio Wales  are doing a last minute question and answer show-are there any issues that we do not feel that the politicians have answered? My question will be- On Sunday at the debate in the  Senedd  ,                                                                                                                                                          Rhodri Morgan  was asked about funding problems regarding  children with special educational needs , funding for health, education and social needs. Rhodri answered by giving general stats and by saying he couldn't comment on the case of the individual who asked the question because it was an individual question. It may be an individual case but it is not isolated but across the board, I have not met another parent who is happy with the funding or provision that they have received for their child in the last 6 years. What is also a problem is the fact that parents have to beg and grovel for everything they get, the system does not respect the family. What will politicians do about  the situation. Tomorrow is election day and I will be on holiday and I have sent off my postal vote. It would have looked a bit silly me being on the  Wales 60 Group  and not voting, especially when my TV interview was all about my Dad's views on the need for every body to vote! This election has definitely re-awoken my interest in politics and the need for the individual to get involved. One of my neighbours has a  Plaid Cymru  placard in his garden and I think it is wonderful, I have never seen placards before-residents don't like drawing attention to their property for fear of vandalism but nothing seems to have happened. Jenny Randerson  is our current AM and unless there is a landslide somewhere else which there doesn't seem to be any sign of then I think she will be re-elected. All day yesterday SnoWhite has been doing her essay  for University on my laptop but she is not happy using the keyboard on the laptop so whilst  Beauty  was having her bath, Snowhite  took Beauty's keyboard from her computer to use. When Beauty came down from her bath she noticed that the keyboard was gone and came to me, put her hand on my shoulder and said, KEYBOARD. I was so impressed, Beauty has never used the word keyboard before but she said it with what appeared to be understanding of the situation. Beauty totally understands what is going on around her even though she may appear to be in her own little world. We can no longer say ICE CREAM  as she understands and wants one when ever she hears the words so we say HUFEN IA which is Welsh for ice cream but that will not last long because Beauty is now exploring Welsh language websites and can count to 10 in Welsh and say a number of words and sing some Welsh songs. If Beauty were not autistic I would still be impressed with  her ability to learn Welsh. When Beauty understands Hufen Ia we can always go on to using the Spanish HELADOS but thanks to  Dora the Explorer  that probably will not last long. Even the sign language for Beauty is a little obvious!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/radiowales/", "http://www.assemblywales.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodri_Morgan", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6428299.stm", "http://www.plaidcymru.org/", "http://www.jennyranderson.com/", "http://nickjr.co.uk/shows/dora/index.aspx"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/05/helados.html", "title": "\nHELADOS\n"},

Hola Dora! Beauty is now learning to count in Spanish, she can already count in English and Welsh. Beauty's conversational skills maybe limited but she seems to be picking up words rapidly, words which she can use with understanding. The other night we were watching  Katie and Peter  on their reality TV show, I love that show.Those two are so well suited and they are so good with their son Harvey, Peter is such a good Dad to Harvey. Harvey reminds me in so many ways of Beauty as far as behaviour is concerned , obviously Harvey has his sight and growth problems as well but they do such a great job with their son. Peter took Harvey and Junior out for a walk to a Farm Shop and Harvey got upset for  apparently no reason the way Beauty used to (thankfully Beauty hasn't had an episode in at least a year) and Peter took Harvey home and nothing seemed to pacify Harvey........except for a nappy change! With Beauty it was a sleep. When Beauty was really small she was assessed at home by a psychologist and when the psychologist left Beauty cried constantly for over 2 hours and nothing would pacify her.It is so sad to see Beauty like that as you just feel so helpless when she just will not stop crying. The night terrors are similar but in the night terrors Beauty is very afraid of something but in the crying episodes she is just very, very sad.

{"date": " April 22, 2007", "body": "\n Lola is sick and Charlie and Lola are trying to count the germs in Lola's mouth! A game on  CBeebies  that Beauty is currently playing. It may sound a little weird but at least it isn't the Terror  Tubbies  or Die  Tubbie  Die! Beauty and I now have an understanding, if I hear a 'naughty 'video then I shout  CBeebies  and she knows she must stop watching the 'naughty' video and turn back to  CBeebies . How do you explain to an autistic 6 year old that they must not watch a  Tellie   Tubbies  video because it has probably been made by somebody with way too much time on their hands and the video is just not nice? I may not be the biggest  Tellie   Tubbie  fan(sorry Ariel and Fiona- favourite childhood toys) but seeing a  Tellie   Tubbie  head explode  is once too much and don't get me started on Die  Tubbie  Die! Today is Dotty's christening,  SnoWhite  is going to be a Godmother! I will explain the full significance of this later.................. All the girls will be wearing pretty new summer dresses and I shall be wearing my dress that I had for my birthday for the first time, Fiona says that I 'look like a mother in it'............. as a mother of 6 girls I couldn't possibly begin to fathom what she means by that statement. Talking of unfathomable statements, we were in the car last night and Ariel had a  Tourettes   moment and told Fiona that she smelt of bums(don't ask!) , when asked where the rationale (to prove she was not a  Tourettes   sufferer) came from to say such a random thing she proceeded for approximately five minutes to explain why this insult was chosen and not another! I then joked that she would not be much good in the army as I could see her sat behind a wall, gun in hand and she would suddenly shout something  random and bizarre like 'Saddam is dead'! A confused look came over Ariel's face and she said,' But I wouldn't say that because I wasn't there'. 'You weren't where Ariel?' 'There  when he died' If anybody can decipher that statement............answers please on a postcard! Oh the joys of motherhood. On the subject of Ariel, since finding out she was going to be doing an Arabic degree she has been deciding which Arabic speaking country she would like to visit as part of the degree. Having had Anastasia visit Russia for a year, to a town where they repeatedly attacked foreigners, I am obviously nervous about Ariel visiting volatile areas of the world. I did however teach English  a number of years ago to mostly Arabic speaking females and so I am aware of the different communities living in Cardiff. One of my best workers when I was working in one nursing home was a Somali women from Cardiff bay and she also worked in the Women's Centre in the Bay and I have been teasing Ariel that she doesn't need to go abroad to get experience of Arabic but can just go to the Women's Centre. She is not happy with this suggestion! However I did enlighten her this week that it was a joke.......... I couldn't imagine that these women who have come from places such as Iraq, Iran, Palestine etc. would be too comfortable with somebody working with them who was going to be joining the British Army, however good their intentions. I can understand and appreciate this. I watched Wife Swap on TV this week and it was a swap between a Muslim wife who had come from Pakistan approximately 20 years ago and a  a liberal wife who was either atheist or agnostic(sorry I can't remember which!). The Muslim wife seemed to think that she also was liberal(small l) but that really wasn't the case. I thought it was quite funny the way she talked about her girls, about 6 th  form age, I thought that she really does not have any idea of the lives that teenage girls live when they go to school. Belle and  SnoWhite  went to the same 6 th  form and in the school there were a lot of Muslim girls and a lot of  Snowhites  friends were Muslims. Control seemed to be a big part of the Muslim families life but the parents just did not seem to be aware that once those girls go to school then their life is hugely influenced by western culture no matter what they want. The Muslim wife was also under the impression that because the other families 16 year old daughter had a dirty untidy bedroom then that made the other mother a bad mother. That's it, I am officially a bad mother. I have promised my girls that I would never go on Wife Swap. During my nursing career I only came across 2 attempted suicide cases and both were Muslim girls, one was pregnant with her non-Muslim boyfriends baby and overdosed and died and the other threw herself off a bridge and she said she felt 'trapped'. Obviously this is purely anecdotal evidence and it is possible that suicide or attempted suicide  rates are  just the same in non-Muslims. After researching many religions, I have come to the conclusion that the teachings of Islam regarding the family are brilliant and really are the basis for a happy family life but as the Muslim family agreed on the wife Swap show, it isn't religion that causes problems but individuals.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/we-love-charlie-and-lola.html", "title": "\nWE LOVE CHARLIE AND LOLA\n"},

After 2 days Fiona's throat was hardly painful whilst my throat feels like it is lined with broken glass. It seems I can only eat soup and salad, even my beloved bread is off the menu. I have taken my morning medication and I am steadily drinking my way though a large mug of warm blackcurrant juice, not as effective as soup but I can't persuade myself to drink soup at 5am, it seems too weird. Fiona was discussing fame the other day, the pointlessness of famous children of famous parents. I really think that the sooner they find their own way in the world the better. Fiona didn't ' mention her but I instantly thought of Paris Hilton who has the capacity to do so much good but does so little. I am tired of hearing about who Paris had had a fight with or who she is now friends with, I stopped worrying about that kind of thing when my girls left school.Perhaps that is why the general public have little sympathy for Paris at the moment. And people who laud their good works for the public also p*ss me off, Sorry Madonna and Angelina but you come across as cold and publicity seeking. Well that was a sickness agitated rant ..............sorry guys! What about the Parable of the Widow's mite? I may not be a Christian but that is definitely a good story with a moral for this day and age. Anastasia arrived home yesterday with Dimitri, the first thing that Beauty said to Anastasia was HELLO ANASTASIA. Well we were all impressed but Anastasia was in raptures she was so pleased.Belle and Anastasia always worry that because they do not live at home that Beauty will not remeber them but sorry girls, no such luck. Beauty has a memory like an elephant and loves you to bits.The next thing that Beauty did was to take a box of Pringles to Anastasia and ask Anastasia to open them for her! You've just got to love the kid. Next week is the Whitsun holidays so if Beauty is ill with this sore throat then she will not miss any school, Beauty seems to have missed so much school in the last few years because of coughs and colds and her infected hands. Whenever I hear the word Whitsun ,I always think of the poem Whitsum Weddings by  Philip Larkin,  one of my favourite poems. The Whitsun Weddings   That Whitsun, I was late getting away: Not till about One-twenty on the sunlit Saturday Did my three-quarters-empty train pull out, All windows down, all cushions hot, all sense Of being in a hurry gone. We ran Behind the backs of houses, crossed a street Of blinding windscreens, smelt the fish-dock; thence The river's level drifting breadth began, Where sky and Lincolnshire and water meet. All afternoon, through the tall heat that slept For miles island, A slow and stopping curve southwards we kept. Wide farms went by, short-shadowed cattle, and Canals with floatings of industrial froth; A hothouse flashed uniquely: hedges dipped And rose: and now and then a smell of grass Displace the reek of buttoned carriage-cloth Until the next town, new and nondescript, Approached with acres of dismantled cars. At first, I didn't notice what a noise The weddings made Each station that we stopped at: sun destroys The interest of what's happening in the shade, And down the long cool platforms whoops and skirls I took for porters larking with the mails, And went on reading. Once we started, though, We passed them, grinning and pomaded, girls In parodies of fashion, heels and veils, All posed irresolutely, watching us go, As if out on the end of an event Waving goodbye To something that survived it. Struck, I leant More promptly out next time, more curiously, And saw it all again in different terms: The fathers with broad belts under their suits And seamy foreheads; mothers loud and fat; An uncle shouting smut; and then the perms, The nylon gloves and jewelry-substitutes, The lemons, mauves, and olive-ochers that Marked off the girls unreally from the rest. Yes, from cafes And banquet-halls up yards, and bunting-dressed Coach-party annexes, the wedding-days Were coming to an end. All down the line Fresh couples climbed abroad: the rest stood round; The last confetti and advice were thrown, And, as we moved, each face seemed to define Just what it saw departing: children frowned At something dull; fathers had never known Success so huge and wholly farcical; The women shared The secret like a happy funeral; While girls, gripping their handbags tighter, stared At a religious wounding. Free at last, And loaded with the sum of all they saw, We hurried towards London, shuffling gouts of steam. Now fields were building-plots. and poplars cast Long shadows over major roads, and for Some fifty minutes, that in time would seem Just long enough to settle hats and say I nearly died, A dozen marriages got under way. They watched the landscape, sitting side by side -An Odeon went past, a cooling tower, And someone running up to bowl -and none Thought of the others they would never meet Or how their lives would all contain this hour. I thought of London spread out in the sun, Its postal districts packed like squares of wheat: There we were aimed. And as we raced across Bright knots of rail Past standing Pullmans, walls of blackened moss Came close, and it was nearly done, this frail Traveling coincidence; and what it held Stood ready to be loosed with all the power That being changed can give. We slowed again, And as the tightened brakes took hold, there swelled A sense of falling, like an arrow-shower Sent out of sight, somewhere becoming rain. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Larkin"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/05/whitsun-weddings.html", "title": "\nWHITSUN WEDDINGS\n"},
{"date": " May 31, 2007", "body": "\nWould you ridicule a black person because of what they looked like? Would you make fun of an Asian person because of their intelligence level? Would you make jokes about somebody from the middle east because of the way they they spoke? Having been bullied and isolated all the way through my childhood because of the way that I looked I know that it would be totally unacceptable.  I wouldn't do it because it is just wrong. But there are 2 groups of people that it is OK to ridicule. To make fun of, tell jokes about and generally be unkind to and generally bully because it is bullying and it is prejudice. I think it is time for the bullying to stop and no matter how 'funny' you might think it is it isn't funny. The last bastions....................having red hair and also being a 'chav'. I give you time to laugh, calm down and listen to what I have to say. So what is a 'chav'? Well here is the  test  for you to find out. I have bought food in Iceland,used a pay-you-go phone, worn jewellery from Argos, eaten a pot noodle(really), bought flowers from a petrol station, used second class stamps, eaten own brand baked beans, called my sofa a settee, think Jordan is intelligent(what business acumen that woman has), relieved a hotel room of its freebies,called pudding sweet,called the loo a toilet, bought a garden ornament from B&Q(Beauty loves them, I have a Gnome in a Welsh Rugby shirt and a Snow White),I can name a character from footballers wives, I have eaten at a Little Chef,cut and used coupons from a magazine, call my evening meal Tea and my education was paid for by the tax payer which according to the quiz makes me 44% chav. And I am happy with that, I may be 44% chav now but when I was growing up I was too poor to be a chav, see even an underclass has an underclass. According to an online  dictionary a chav is  the lower class; un educated and ignorant people Oh well, that's my fate sealed. But what we chavs look like is surely most important. Sadly I have never owned Burberry,    anything Reebok or owned white trainers. But I do have a daughter who loves certain chav clothes, she also loves certain  emo  clothes as well so she calls herself a chavemo. Obviously there are are chavs who get ASBOs, and get drunk in the streets and steal and behave very badly but that isn't the issue. The issue is the wholesale lumping together of a certain group of people that  another group of people don't think are  as good as them and that is the whole point of the prejudice.Criticise the chavs who are badly behaved but Tony Blair's son was found drunk in the street on a couple of occasions, are the Blair's  chavs? I have had to contend with youngsters who fit the description of chavs, they damaged my car and they tried to break into my house and they wear Burberry. But 'bloody chav's' isn't the first thing that pops into my mind when they do the things they do. I have 4 girls with red hair and I also have red hair, red hair jokes are just nasty. I once heard Wales described as the 'red-haired step-child of the UK', the reference to Wales didn't upset me at all but the insinuation that being red-haired was bad upset me. Perhaps growing up poor with red hair makes me able to appreciate how wrong the ridiculing of people who are a different group is. It might be a funny joke but whatever class of person you are I'm sure you have feelings. Last night I read on the internet about ASDA having problems with a campaign they were trying to run. They want customers to return excess packaging to their stores , so ASDA can  return the packaging to manufacturers to show that customers are not happy with the environmental impact of all the excess packaging. However the punters didn't bring back enough packaging and the thread of the conversation  was there was not much interest from the ASDA punters because only CHAV's shop at ASDA so what can you expect! Another person wrote that they had the same kind of shopper in their country, they all shopped in WALMART and were merely 'lazy, bottom feeders'. What more can I say on wholesale prejudice? Signed The lazy, bottom feeder.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.i-am-bored.com/bored_link.cfm?link_id=7007", "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chav", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.geocities.com/ctskaboy/emotest.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/05/last-bastion-of-prejudice.html", "title": "\nTHE LAST BASTION OF PREJUDICE\n"},

Wedding number one was in church and was the wedding of a friend who I grew up with and she also worked as a youth worker with my older girls so they wanted to go. Beauty being Beauty, we couldn't go inside as Beauty loves to sing the Neighbours theme tune when she gets inside a church but I saw a lot and heard a lot through the glass doors. I managed to occupy Beauty by giving her a pot of  Pringles  which she now calls  Mingoes . When Beauty made too much noise we went through to the hall where the reception was to be held, without the threat of going into church Beauty was really well behaved and I helped put out the reception food. Also helping was the son of a friend, this young man had come to Anastasia's first birthday  party  and given her a birthday kiss.........and given her Measles(he happily reminded me!) When he started putting the  Pringles  on the table he walked straight up to Beauty and ask her if she wanted more  Pringles  for her box to which she replied, 'I AM HUNGRY', there was a lot of emphasis in her reply which was said in a YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL. Well I was amazed! Where did that come from? She says nothing for years and then these random ,perfectly formed sentences escape from her little world.Autism is such a strange thing. Wedding number 2 was in Caerphilly, I didn't go as I am an out-law in that family(ex-husband number 1) but Anastasia, Dimitri,  SnoWhite , Ariel and Fiona went. I stayed at wedding number one for as long as I could(or as long as Beauty would let me!), obviously taking a few photographs. My best friend from my mid-teens was there(her brother had played the music at 2 of my weddings and he  probably  played yesterday but I couldn't see), I sometimes wonder if the wedding is really for the bride and groom or for the friends and relatives to catch up. Catching up is good. When Beauty would suffer it no longer we were forced to leave, definitely not enough catching up time with Beauty around!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/05/catching-up-time.html", "title": "\nCATCHING UP TIME\n"},

This has so got so stop. In the house it is OK to go crazy, in the garden not such a good idea but now I am even checking the bananas before I buy them. Can you imagine an episode in  ASDA ? To awful to even think about. Yesterday I went to an organic shop that I have found, it is on Red Square in Canton/ Pontcanna , it is opposite the Learning Tree and across from Charlotte Churches mother's shop, it is called  Pulses.  Not a brilliant selection of fresh vegetables but a great supply of dry stuff and everything else. The girls love shopping in Red Square as they have some really cool gift shops. I really like the houses in that area as they are old, large terraced houses and would be perfect for us all but they come with a serious price tag that I could never afford. Oh well,I can but dream! Yesterday was seriously busy day as it was the first day in ages that it hasn't rained and I managed to wash all the throws on the chairs and sofas(Further discussed on   ME AND MY WORLD).  Beauty is not the cleanest of children hence the covers for the furniture, if she isn't smearing her clothes then it is the furniture, usually with chocolate and  yoghurt . Thankfully she is no longer eating mud, just flowers! We took her out today for a walk to the  Riverside market, Beauty loves things like that. I bought some organic potatoes and cauliflower but there really wasn't much of a selection on the vegetables. We also went over to Bessemer Road Car boot sale, Beauty really loves looking at everything. We bought quite a few pieces of vintage fabric things,not sure what I'll do with them yet but very cool. For Beauty the worst part of the car boot sale was the ice cream van leaving before she could get her ice cream, YES she was very upset. A tragedy of epic proportions..........until she got back to the car and started on the  Pringles !

{"date": " June 05, 2007", "body": "\nBeauty's sleeping habits seem to be all over the place at the moment and the only thing that seems to get her to go to sleep at the moment is if I lie down with her until she falls asleep. Late to bed and late to rise makes Beauty a grumpy girl and come to think of it it doesn't suit me that much either. I find difficulty being in Beauty's bed as my hips have completely gone  and are too painful  to lie on so the only option is to lie on my back which doesn't leave much room for the 2 of us. Beauty loves to give lots of hugs and kisses so that makes up for the discomfort, however she also likes me to make up Dora the Explorer stories for her and that can be very tiring on the brain and I almost fall asleep before Beauty. This is my new, wonderful vegetable peeler. How can I have lived 46 years and not seen one before. As a vegetarian it is a wonderful thing as food can be prepared in a fraction of the time. There is a major drawback though........ I have a genetic problem with my hands.In the normal course of events people do not notice that both of my little fingers are permanently bent, it isn't painful but it has caused difficulty in learning to type, play the piano and playing the flute and recorder. Due to my fingers being permanently bent they are getting in the way when I peel the vegetables and due to the peeler being so BRILLIANT, I now have a left hand covered in plasters because my fingers as well as the vegetables are getting peeled! The simple answer to the situation is , to peel vegetables my hand has to be completely wrapped in a tea towel to prevent further injury. Why is life never simple(apart from me of course!)? Due to the  late night I am now going to have to have a nap to catch up on energy. I read a book a few years ago about a nun whose Mother superior told her that the only people who sleep in the day are people who are trying to escape from something. Does knowing that make me feel guilty? Not a chance. The last job I had was in a Nursing Home working nights as the Nurse in Charge and I loved it as I got to sleep all day, I even used to sleep in the garden in the summer. I sort out the washing and dishes and put them on first thing in the morning and then have a nap for about an hour and it sorts me out for the rest of the day. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/simple-life.html", "title": "\nTHE SIMPLE LIFE\n"},
{"date": " June 07, 2007", "body": "\nSince the end of the Whitsun holidays it has been difficult to get Beauty back into a good sleep routine. Late to bed and late to rise is her new motto(typical teenager).She has been back to going to sleep at midnight but thankfully last night she went to sleep at 11pm so we are slowly getting there. However, it is still difficult to get her to co-operate with dressing and washing first thing, you would not believe how uncooperative such little toes can be when trying to put socks on. I am impressed however with her cooperation when it comes to toothbrushing, for a long time I literally had to hold her down to get the toothbrush in her mouth. We do still have the problem that she doesn't understand the concept rinsing and spitting the toothpaste out. The dentist has said that this is not a problem as long as we manage to brush the teeth and leave a layer of toothpaste on her teeth to protect her teeth then we are OK. When Beauty was tiny we went to the dentist and the dentist said that Beauty's enamel was quite thin but last time we saw the dentist he said that her teeth we really good so we must be doing something right. Beauty will not hold the toothbrush herself but she will let me do it when I tell her that Elmo brushes his teeth.I have even resorted to telling Beauty that Dora the Explorer always brushes her teeth. Beauty got bitten in school yesterday by one of the other children in her class and she has quite a nasty bite mark on her arm. It seems that the little boy involved has got the type of personality that he can turn at any time. I am not worried about it being just the once, incidents like this occasionally happen but if it happened again then I would not be able to allow Beauty to be in the same class as this child as I would not believe that she would be safe.The  Educational Tribunal when Beauty started school said that Beauty needed one-to-one but they would not order it as this would start a precedence(an illegal statement), therefore the LEA were ordered to put an extra teachers aid in the class because of Beauty but not labeled as a one to one helper- it is obvious that they were wrong as Beauty would not be vulnerable if she had a specific one-to-one.

Even though they go to school, to college and to university it is a very rare occurrence for my home to be children free.Obviously Anastasia is busy in her research institute in Austria, Belle is happily teaching in her school in Florida, I think SnoWhite is in University(who knows with that one!), Ariel and Fiona have gone to town shopping and Beauty is in school. And I am left home alone to do all the housework, again. Beauty has learnt a new word, KEYBOARD and she uses it with meaning, she uses it to signify that she wants to use the computer. I was talking to a mother of a normally developing child the other day and she was telling me how good her 6 year old child was on the computer and she was telling me all the things that her child could do. I was thrilled to realise that Beauty could do everything that this child could do and more. I am so glad that Beauty has so much that she is capable of doing because I know other children  with autism who have nothing, a friends child does not play with toys, watch TV or videos or play with the computer. It must be very difficult when the child is that locked in.   Free to roam     A report from the Children's Society warns that parents' fears about safety are stopping children from playing outdoors unsupervised.                                  \"You're not riding that bike outside.\"                              And it shows how today's parents are not giving their children the freedom to roam that they enjoyed in their own childhoods in the 1970s.    Why are we such paranoid parents? Why do I worry at the idea of my uber-competent 10-year-old daughter walking on her own to school - when I was making my own way to school at a younger age?    Maybe it's because we live in a society that is drip-fed insecurity.     From the first car alarm of the morning, to the last police siren at night, we know much too much about the threats around us.   If Beauty wasn't autistic would I let her play out in the streets  the same way I see other local children playing from the age of 3 or 4? Let me see ..............

Endemol  were in a Catch 22 position , if they left her in they would have been criticised and no matter how innocuous the situation was to let it go would have been wrong. My total belief is that Emily was being racist but was totally unaware of it. Charley said to Nicky that the way Emily said it was so natural that she felt that it was  something that Emily normally said and later Emily admitted to Big Brother that it was something that she and her friends usually said. What Emily was doing can only be described as the soft end of racism,if you can call any racism soft which I personally do not believe you can but it does exist. There are 2 possible situations that Emily and her friends are using the word Ni**er. Number 1  they are using it as every day speak , copying gangster language, and if there  are no black people in her group of friends then they are not causing immediate offense but they are promoting and making the use of racially offensive words acceptable. Number 2 there are black people in her group of friends who are accepting the language used but may not be happy with it but too afraid to say. I watched an episode of Life On Mars when Sam ran into his boss from the future in 1973 and Sam was shocked at the way his boss was behaving.His boss was making self-depreciating remarks about being black and making fun of himself.The other policemen did not see it as a problem and did not believe they were being racist when they were saying racist things.Sam's boss from the future admitted that he wasn't happy with the situation but admitted that he did it to be accepted and to make life easier. Endemol  were right to evict Emily if only as a statement that talking like this, even in a joking way is totally unacceptable. If my children had ever talked like this I would have  been very unhappy, I have never  talked in this way and I find it unacceptable for anyone else to. I remember as a child, local to where I lived the local children sang  the children's rhyme  Eeny  Meany   Miney  Mo, Catch a  Ni**er by his toe. I remember being  pre -school age and my father saying that this wasn't very nice and  to use the word Monkey instead of the other word.

I have a work list which I print off daily and everyone who is in the house is expected to help complete the work list, though they do not always cooperate as much as I would like. Well today I woke  SnoWhite  and Fiona(Ariel was already awake) up at 10:30am(yep 10:30am) and they were not impressed when I told them the house had to be cleaned by 12:30 md  because somebody was coming to fix the light in the (haunted) splash room. They thought that I was lying just to get them to clean the house, well the babies........... sorry that should read Fiona and Ariel-old habits you see, thought that I was lying!I think they were a little surprised when the person arrived to repair the light! It was a bit difficult to get Ariel off the computer and I had to resort to counting to 10 to get her to move(she is the 17 year old remember!). I did frighten Fiona though because as I was counting down I was mid plant watering and holding a full can of water, Fiona convinced Ariel to cooperate because she she was afraid that I might attempt to throw the water over her less than cooperative sibling and as she was between us she would get most soaked. As if I would do that? Beauty ate a plateful of homemade pizza, I was very impressed. Beauty is such a picky eater, we now have another thing to add to her 'WILL EAT' food list. Today I was thinking about autism, not really unusual as Beauty is profoundly autistic but sometimes I go for days without actually thing about autism. I think it is because Beauty is the youngest, she is 9 years younger than Fiona and we think of her as the baby of the family. I think because of this  we  accepted Beauty's autism very quickly, we just see her as she is and love her so much.

I am definitely going to have to sort out some new videos for her to watch, we have hundreds and we seem to be stuck on this one. I do like the Joseph video but I don't want to start feeling about Joseph the way that I feel about Barney. I remember as a child that children's TV was on for about half an hour or maybe even an hour in the morning and then from approximately 3:30pm in the afternoon until 6pm(I am talking about the early 60's!), too much TV may be a problem  but not having it when you need it is also a problem. Beauty is very good at regulating herself and watches TV, plays on the computer, plays with her books and toys and plays in the garden. It must be a nightmare years ago when children would constantly ask 'WHAT SHALL I DO NOW'? I remember asking it myself. I am so grateful that Beauty can do all the things that she does because I know children with autism who cannot spontaneously play with toys or books or watch TV and their lives must be so limited. I remember working at Ely hospital in the late 70's and the lives of people with learning disabilities was so much more limited then. We have definitely made advancements for the better. Yesterday evening(after watching Dr Who of course!) I took the girls to their father's house to drop off presents for father's day  and whilst they were inside I took Beauty to  get a McFlurry . I explained where we were going and what we were going to buy and she was so excited, bouncing and flapping and smiling and laughing that I am totally convinced that she knew where we were going. It was Runningman's birthday on Saturday, he was 60 and we bought him a Jig Saw, a Sonic Screw Driver(well a battery operated one-if only sonic screw drivers really existed) and a trowel set for the garden. Remember he has retired once already( from the health authority) and now is working AGAIN(he loves work!) he intends to retire at 65 from the bank though I am sure he will work until 70 if the bank will let him! Cleaning in the kitchen last night I realised that everything tells a story, even my dishes! Believe it or not. My reflecting started when I was drying and putting away this plastic plate after Beauty had used it and I realised that it is the one that Anastasia mentioned a little while ago, the girls ate all their meals off plastic plates when they were younger because I had only one set of dishes and I couldn't afford to replace them if they got broken. I remember her saying how she remembered eating off plastic plates at 15! This is a bowl from that BEST SET. This is a mixing bowl that the girls bought me as a present. They bought it because I said that it reminded me of the bowls that we used in cooking lessons in the grammar school in the early 70's. This mixing bowl I bought in the 80's, everything in my kitchen at the time was red(what was I thinking?), it is still used daily! This Portmeirion pot I bought when I was first married to husband number 2, he has been dead almost 10 years. A selection of mugs in my china cupboard, most came with Easter eggs inside.At Easter I used to buy the girls eggs and something they could keep, over the years I have bought T shirts, jewellery, soft toys  and mugs A dish from marriage number 3. Latest acquisition, a brilliant bowl for cooking as you have a handle to hold onto whilst you are cooking.Bought in Dunhelms , my most favourite shop at the moment. Beauty's Blue Cow plate.She loves  Blue Cow. Beauty's Tweenies plate. Beauty loves  Jake And of course an IKEA children's plate, we buy lots of thing in IKEA- the discount helps! I know what you are all thinking, first the basket collection, now the dishes..........what next? Did I ever tell you about the duvet cover collection? My airing cupboard is full of them, from Man United to Tweenies, from Dolphins to Noah's ark we have it, they mostly came as birthday or  Christmas presents.

I have a really bad memory but occasionally it seems to go in to overload and I can't stop being reminded of things. they say that all the senses can be responsible for prompting memories but I have to say that today's plethora of memories were all produced by plain old sight. Whilst washing and dressing Beauty this morning I brushed her hair and tied it into one long plait down her back. Her hair was a very short bob when she started school but now it is almost down to her butt. Whilst I was plaiting it I was reminded of a girl who sat across from me in the grammar school when I was 11 years old, this girl had the thickest,shiniest, blackest hair you could imagine and it was absolutely beautiful and I was envious of it. This girl was part of the ELITE(The Mean Girls) in my class but she wasn't mean at all, she was a lovely girl. The actual Mean Girls were MEAN all the time and made you feel like poo. Everybody used to wish that they could be friends with them but looking back I realise they had nothing that I would now want. The girl with the black hair and I were never personal friends but I always liked her and she was always friendly to me. She became a nurse and died of cervical cancer in her 30's and when I heard I was really saddened. I was deciding what to wear this morning and decided on knee length shorts, a shirt and my CROCS.

I did a pre-nursing course in the Rhondda Valley in Llwynypia and I remember in the winter term it rained a lot and on the days it rained we would never wear trousers, we always wore skirts as the trousers would have got soaked. 30 years......wow I feel old. So I chose the shorts today because it may be raining but it is still quite warm, when I got home I was very slightly wet but that was all. The thought of wet jeans-yuk! And for the final memory........I was putting on make-up ready to go out and I had a vivid memory of my mother in the1960's always putting on her red lip stick before she went out. In the 60's lip stick was the  single most important item of makeup, today for me I would say it was mascara(I have white eyelashes!) .  I have very pale skin and due to lack of smoking, drinking and lots of sun screen it seems to have faired quite well and I have had no real need to wear any make up daily apart from mascara. However in the last year I have found that by using a little  pressed powder my skin looks 200% better and I only use the transparent shade. I have  Rosacea  which seems to be the 'curse of the Celts',  It begins as erythema (flushing and redness) on the central face and across the cheeks, nose, or forehead Rosacea affects both sexes, but is almost three times more common in women, and has a peak age of onset between 30 and 60. Which basically means that I am getting old! It seems that certain antibiotics can help but if I can live without them I will. It's not too bad and a light dusting of make up seems to cover most of it. I had quite pink cheeks the day of my profile picture but at least they are not hideously red. Amazingly Beauty slept for 9 hours last night! when I finally persuaded her to get into bed at 11pm she fell asleep and was happily snoring in less that a minute and then she didn't want to get up this morning and I had to drag her out of bed at 8 am. Sounds like a typical child to me! Beauty loved the rain this morning and tried to catch the raindrops with her tongue and her fingers.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosacea"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/raindrops-on-roses-and-whiskers-on.html", "title": "\nRAINDROPS ON ROSES AND WHISKERS ON KITTENS\n"},

The rain is pouring down and making a LOT of noise on my kitchen sky lights, I am stocked up with food(party left overs) and I have Guinea pigs in the house.So the rain , the food and the animals BUT unlike Mrs Noah I still have to go out to take Beauty to school. My back is communicating with me, not talking but screaming! I spent a lot of time baking yesterday standing up and my back is in absolute agony. I have a wheelchair but that brings no relief as my damage is half way up my back and so sitting in a chair is as painful( or pain creating) as standing up. Usually I spend my day between lying down and feeding the washing machine and dishwasher, the more I stand the more my back seems to rub and become more inflamed and painful. I don't go out in the day if I can help it because of bad drivers(!) and the escalation in pain.The sun shone for a little while at the party but it is  Glastonbury  weekend so we have to expect some rain! Fiona and SnoWhite and I have decided that we will will go to Glastonbury one year but not until I have bought the camper van that I intend to buy. I have always wanted a  VW Bus  .I am way too old for camping with my back and Fiona and SnoWhite refuse to camp again after the wash-out that was the last church camp. We are having PROBLEMS with the guinea pigs.They may  have girls names but they are in fact two boys, allegedly! One appears to be mounting the other frequently, and according to a Google search this is actual not a se-ual( I am not being a prude,I am just wary of spam) thing but a male dominance thing, alpha male-let's decide who is boss kind of thing(but how they know this is a mystery to me-perhaps a guinea pig told his shrink one day). Due to the possibility of excess bullying the sites I visited suggested another cage for some time out,it's like have 2 more children in the house to referee-if Fiona and SnoWhite weren't bad enough. Beauty is as good as gold, she maybe autistic but she is a sweetheart compared to the guinea pigs and her ever fighting siblings! I think that it is time to rename the guinea pigs, I suggested Sammy and Dean(AKA The Winchester Brothers from  Supernatural  and Fiona and  SnoWhite like the idea of Chunk and Mouth from The  Goonies.

Last night I watched him in  Keith Allen Will Burn In Hell Keith Allen discovers an unnerving mixture of hatred, fanaticism and fun when he investigates one of the  USA's  most extreme fundamentalist churches               The members of  Westboro  Baptist Church in Kansas, which preaches that every word in the Bible is literally true, are some of America's most fanatical Christian fundamentalists. Bearing \u2018God Hates Fags\u2019 and \u2018God Hates America\u2019 placards, they cheerfully picket the funerals of US soldiers killed in Iraq, and delight in provoking outrage among both liberals and patriots.                Programme-makers in America and Britain have repeatedly tried to expose their beliefs as anti-Christian, but these attempts have failed. In Channel 4\u2019s investigation, Keith Allen takes a smarter, more streetwise approach. During three extraordinary days at  Westboro , Keith reveals more about the church than other television programmes have unearthed in three months.                In interviews that are hilarious, infuriating and compelling, he forensically exposes the curious mixture of hatred and jollity that underpins their faith. Using all his journalistic skills and instincts, he scavenges for information in local bars and discovers a secret about the church's chief spokesperson, Shirley Phelps-Roper. Shirley confesses her \u2018sin\u2019 on camera, making a memorable climax to a programme that exposes the hypocrisy of this bizarre, fundamentalist sect. He was equally as funny in  Little Lady Fauntleroy When I watched  Keith Allen Will Burn In Hell  I found it to be jaw  droppingly  funny. Many religious people  have impressed me. I have met many Muslims through teaching English,  SnoWhite  had a Jewish friend through school(who I am ashamed to say I once accidentally fed hot dogs to) I have met every other type of religious you can imagine and almost all have really impressed me.

If she were attacked a third time then she would be out of school until she was put in a new class. I was quite worried when I turned around and brought her home, I thought that she might cry and get upset but she was brilliant. I have been worried about her since she started school as everyone knows that statistically there are more boys diagnosed with autism than girls, I have been worried that she is always the only girl with groups of boys. The worry has been that because they are boys they  may be  mean and hurt her because I remember school and a lot of the boys in my school were unpleasant little creatures. I have to say though that my brother who is 18 months older than me also went to my school and was the nicest little boy you could imagine.

Beauty is an early riser and so I usually get to see the sun rise and I really mean SUN RISE. the day may be overcast and grey but every morning,just after dawn we seem to get a little sunshine which is meant to last us the whole day. Ariel phoned from Kalamaki to inform me that the temperature was 41 degrees there! Well I suppose there are some things to be glad about, I am a typical Celt with red hair and pale skin and I burn easily-for me 41 degrees would be a nightmare. I went to Turkey one year in May and we had temperature highs of 35 degrees and I found it difficult to cope, we had to carry bottles of water everywhere just to pour over our bodies to keep us cool. A few summers ago Ariel went to Geneva to stay with friends and do a French language course, it was the summer of the heatwave when thousands died across Europe. It was so hot in the apartment where Ariel was staying that she slept in the afternoons as the nights were so hot she could never manage to sleep then. The children of the Geneva friends had stayed with us for a month to do language courses in Wales and Ariel had returned to Switzerland with them but she wasn't old enough to travel back on her own so I had to go and get her. The temperature was in the 40's and I was so ill I really couldn't cope and it was only a day trip! We had a walk around Geneva and my hands were so swollen with the heat I kept having to stand at fountains and hold my hands in the water. I also visited Anastasia who was also staying in Geneva at the time with her 'in-laws-to-be' and when I got  to their house I was so ill that all I could do was lie down. The best part of the day was Dimitri picking me up and taking me back to the airport in the family Smart car, the air conditioning was fantastic. This journey made me decide to lose weight, I figured that if I weighed less I would have felt better.

The baby, who had apparently never been fed, was discovered by a farmer near a village some 150km south of Hyderabad. He said he only spotted her because her tiny hand was sticking out of the soil. Police say they have arrested the baby's grandfather, 52-year-old Abdul Rahman, after he confessed to trying to kill the newborn by burying her alive. \"I am yet to marry off four daughters and cannot take responsibility for a fifth one, even when she is only a granddaughter,\" Mr Rahman was quoted as telling police. SnoWhite has a friend whose mother and father managed to leave China when they realised  the mother was pregnant for the second time.  SnoWhite said how grateful she was that she was born into a country where there is no government legislation on how many children you are allowed to have. In China , some families are fined heavily if they have more than one child and their life is made very difficult, even to the point of sterilisation. SnoWhite feels very strongly about this as in our family she is daughter number 3.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/no-rainyet.html", "title": "\nNO RAIN.........YET!\n"},

I asked if she had fed them and she said NO because they had plenty of food in their cages(dry food), I had to explain that even a slice of cucumber would have shut them up.

Bear with a sore head comes to mind. And as we are on the subject of SnoWhite, she and I are going to fall out when it comes to tissues. Not only do I find used tissues everywhere(yuk) but they always seem to end up in the washing machine(bigger yuk). Yesterday I had to hot wash her attractive works trousers on a very hot wash as they stank of fries and Swedish meatballs, well working in a restaurant will do that to you. And when I took them out of the wash her navy blue trousers were covered in tissue!AGAIN. So they had to be eco-washed just to get rid of the tissue,not very eco-friendly. SnoWhite's idea of being eco-friendly and saving energy..........go to sleep and let everyone else clean up after you,well she isn't exerting any energy is she? She had a conversation with a punter in work yesterday on her philosophy on life. FOR COOKING-Open a packet of food from the fridge or freezer and put it on gas mark5 and leave it to cook until it is golden brown(for everything!) CLEANING THE HOUSE - pay a cleaner to do all the housework As for the cleaner she says  there is nothing wrong with cleaners as they need to work and earn as well. What can I say? How can you argue with a philosophy like that. This is a cartoon done of Snow White lounging at home done by a brilliant cartoonist  Bryan Ballinger  he discusses his inspiration I\u2019m not exactly sure what I was thinking here other than I was sort of wondering what it would be like if Snow White was lounging around at home. You know, watching TV, snacking on her new box of mail order apples, not being able to stop\u2026 Hey Bryan, you are fantastic, you have caught my SnoWhite exactly without meeting her!

The Coal House series will follow three families as they experience life in a 1927 south Wales mining town, with the men sent to work at a pit. More than 150 families applied and these have been whittled down to 15 for the selection day on Saturday. Series producer Rachel Morgan said they were hoping for \"a big social mix\". Ms Morgan said the programme will send the men and boys over 14 down the Big Pit in Blaenavon which is a working mine museum. It was made a World Heritage Site in  2000 in recognition of the role it played in the industrial revolution. There they will have to work on a simulated coalface during the day, while the women would be \"traditional housewives\" in the tiny cottages.

So Belle which of your sweet little sisters does that remind you of? How are the Kansas Crows? I hope you had a good time in Kansas. Yesterday I mistakenly thought the British summer had started,it was sunny all day and then late evening and through the night it started to rain. Even as a child I remember most summers having sunny days and rain showers at night but then perhaps that is just a south east Wales things. But the rain didn't stop , it continued all through the night and it is still raining and overcast so no sports day. Obviously Beauty does not anticipate in the same was as a normally developing child and she is not disappointed BUT I am.Sad Woman!

A 17.5% rise on fatty, sugary or salty food would cut heart and stroke deaths by 1.7%, the study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health said.    One of the researchers declared the time was right to debate a \"fat tax\".   HOW? How could 'FAT TAXES' save thousands? Supermarkets such as ASDA(WALMART) and TESCO bring punters into their stores by advertising their  LOSS LEADERS. For example, supermarkets have their VALUE RANGES where everything is cheaper to bring the punters into the store. But the price of the products is below the market value so even if you added extra taxes it wouldn't hurt the punters pockets and who is to say the addition would even be passed on to the punter! So what should the government do to deal with the situation? Insist that all produce is LOW FAT, LOW SUGAR and LOW SALT-make all food a HEALTHY OPTION.The only people to benefit from a fat tax would be the government and can you see those added taxes being passed onto the people in the form of health care to counter act their unhealthy lifestyle? PLEASE! Did you know that IKEA sell a Mexican Chili Wrap in their restaurant which has over 2,500 calories in it? Look what  NHS Direct  says How many calories do I need a day?                           The recommended daily calorie intake varies depending on how old you are. For the average adult this is about 2000 per day (women) and 2500 per day (men). These calories should be made up of foods from the main food groups.If you're trying to lose weight you could start by eating 500 less calories per day. This should help as long as your diet is well-balanced and you're getting lots of exercise.The recommended daily calorie intake is different for children, pregnant women and older people. See your GP for advice. Over 2,500 calories in a wrap should be made illegal. That is just criminal. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader", "http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=1126"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/anticipating-indian-summer.html", "title": "\nANTICIPATING AN INDIAN SUMMER\n"},

The  BBC  has apologised for creating the impression \u2013 in a promotional trailer shown at yesterday's BBC One autumn season launch \u2013 that the Queen stormed out of a photography session with Annie Leibovitz. The BBC and RDF Television, the producers of the BBC One series A Year With The Queen, would like to clarify that the clips shown in a promotional trailer on 11 July were not intended to provide a full picture of what actually happened or of what will be shown in the final programme.This was an important photo-shoot prior to the Queen's visit to the United States. In this trailer there is a sequence that implies that the Queen left a sitting prematurely. This was not the case and the actual sequence of events was mis-represented. The BBC would like to apologise to both the Queen and Annie Leibovitz for any upset this may have caused.         BBC Press Office I thought it was so funny. Here was the Queen having a strop like the rest of us AND then the BBC says Sorry She Was Mis-Represented. Why can't she be real?  Why can't she get stressy? Hands up- I admit it- I had a hissy fit yesterday. A hissy fit of all hissy fits and I am sure I scared the builder/repairman who ever he was-GOOD! I went to pick Beauty up from school and when I got back someone was parked on my hard standing which is part of my house. At first I thought -OK I WONT SAY ANYTHING and I didn't because there was enough room for me to park without blocking my other neighbour. However, the van owner who was parked outside of my house came out as as I was taking Beauty in AND he had a hissy fit because he couldn't open his rear doors but there was plenty of room for him to get out and park 1 second away in the communal parking opposite. Now his getting pissy at me set me off. I told him not to get upset with me as he shouldn't be there any way and anyway how was I meant to get my disabled daughter into the house. To which he produced a string of abuse and of course that was like a red rag to a bull and in a very unladylike way I said Don't talk to me like that you little Sh*t head He then flounced off like a 6 year old-he must have been about 20. I shouted at him Are you going to move it then? To which he replied NOW-IN A MINUTE! Anyone not living in Wales will probably need a translation of NOW-IN A MINUTE Some English speakers in Wales  use some very unusual phrases for instance BY YUR or B YUR (by here) or BY THERE or B THERE (by there) How can something be BY HERE or BY THERE, it is either here or there? My girls have a favourite WHOSE COAT IS THAT JACKET HANGING THERE ON THE FLOOR? (heard at a church dance) So NOW - IN A MINUTE doesn't mean NOW but IN A MINUTE- why?I don't know, I have asked why this is said but when I have  the person  I have asked looked at me as if I were speaking a foreign language! Anyway-all ended well as he moved his van NOW-IN 5 MINUTES! However, just to be sure I got SnoWhite to go out and take his registration number just in case he decided to get up close and personal with my car. Due to the rain there was no school sports yesterday but it wasn't Beauty that got upset but Fiona who wanted to watch and take photos, oh well perhaps the sun will shine again soon.Well it seems that Belle in Florida will be having nice weather as it is forecast to be 34 degrees today and for Anastasia in Vienna it is forecast to be 26 degrees but by Tuesday it is meant to be 39 degrees- at least some of the family are having nice weather!

The piggies survived. On Saturday night Fiona was holding one of the piggies whilst she was watching TV, suddenly Fiona squealed(yep she seems to squeal a lot) and dumped the piggy on the sofa and ran! Well Ariel thought the piggy had bitten her and I thought the worst that the piggy had died BUT NO the piggy had peed on her! Fiona wasn't happy when I laughed and she shouted YOU WAIT UNTIL ONE OF THEM PEES ON YOU. To which I replied AFTER 27 YEARS OF NURSING AND CHANGING NAPPIES A BIT OF PIGGY PEE OR POOP IS NOT GOING TO WORRY ME. which impressed her even less! Last night whilst watching TV Beauty went very quiet and so I got up to look for her, we have a barn door on our living room and  the door wouldn't open so I looked over the door and there she was on the floor unraveling a toilet roll. I shouted at her to stop it but before I could stop her she went from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds and unraveled the whole roll in front of me and then because she knew she was being naughty she sprinted as fast as her chubby legs would carry her. She is definitely cheekier than her sisters, they would never have done that!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/it-is-persisting-it-down.html", "title": "\nIT IS PERSISTING IT DOWN.\n"},

One of them read: \"My behaviour was everything but mature and responsible.\" It appears that cyber bullying is alive and kicking! I am not too keen on commenting on other peoples blogs because I have witnessed a lot of cyber bullying and I do not want to get involved. The worst cases that I have witnessed usually involve very educated people or very religious people and the purpose of their blogging appears to be a vehicle to show how clever they are or to compel you to believe what they believe. I once commented on a TV show and the person who the show was about wrote to me and said she was mis-represented on the show and I put what she said on my blog and said I was sorry about the way that the show portrayed her. I did comment on her behaviour which was portrayed as very childlike but I would never bully someone on-line as I was bullied a lot growing up(even if I hadn't been bullied,bullying is still wrong.) One blog I read which is written by a very intelligent person used an example to prove a point in an argument and I so wanted to say  But this example can just as easily be used to prove the other persons point of view  but I didn't because it would have left me open . If I were to have explained the situation to the individual I honestly believe they would have been shocked to see how the situation could have been perceived. The writer of the blog involved has a bee in their bonnet about a certain subject and regularly tries to prove their point of view is the RIGHT one but because the subject matter involved cannot be conclusively proved one way or the other, I as a not-so-clever person believe that we should accept the possibility of either conclusion for now. Remember what I wrote about the WWI and men who were  shot for cowardice but it is obvious that the men were obviously suffering from mental health problems? When the jury is out I think it is better to accept all possibilities because I am tired of hearing 10 or 20 years down the line  AH BUT WE WERE MAKING DECISIONS ON THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAD THEN. There were doctors in WWI who were convinced that the men who were being shot were suffering from mental health problems but because they couldn't convince the powers that be , an out-dated medical opinion was used to legitimise the killing of these men. The clever people out their could probably rip this argument to shreds but just because they are better than me at debating doesn't mean to say that they are right and I am wrong. Definitely too deep for a Tuesday morning! We have some sunshine at last, however  Beauty and I went puddle jumping yesterday on the way to the shop so whatever the weather she is having fun. Thankfully we have had no flooding here just the relentless rain. The prediction for Belle in Florida is 34 degrees with a little rain and Anastasia in Austria is 26 degrees with a little rain. I am sure that a little rain with them will be a nice respite. The piggy boys are such funny little things. They have a 2 tier hutch to give them extra space to run around but until recently only Mouth has been going upstairs. Now however  they are both going upstairs because I have put their food up on the top floor. Previously when Mouth went upstairs Chunk would start  wheeking constantly and not shut up until Mouth came down, Chunk maybe the smaller piggy but he definitely seems in charge-a bit like Beauty I guess! Mouth seems to HIDE a lot upstairs in the little cwtch area, I don't blame him-I guess he just wants a quiet life. At the moment the volume on the smaller computer is not working ( I think it is a speaker problem)but this does not seem to bother Beauty, when she plays games and watches videos she knows EVERY word and is constantly singing and chatting  along. I see  a career for her as a TV presenter, you know the type of sports or commentator on royal or big events who talks non-stop about anything and everything involved with what they are  watching. I have 6 weeks of this........ as my girls will confirm I prefer a quiet life and never watch daytime TV or listen to the radio or CDs( and dislike TV music video channels intensely). I feel for Beauty every school morning when I take her into the school hall and we are hit by a cacophony of noise-she sticks her fingers in her ears(do you think they would mind if I did too?). \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/6912409.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/sun-is-shining.html", "title": "\nTHE SUN IS SHINING\n"},

I now have swollen eyes, probably conjunctivitis, so not only do I feel like poop but I have piggy eyes. BUT the sunshine we are experiencing is set to last all week which also means that if I go out I will not look too stupid wearing sunglasses to cover the piggy eyes! Talking of all things piggy........ Ariel decided yesterday, by her own volition,to clean out the piggy boys! Well the piggy boys got to play in their run for a little while but I wonder if it was really worth all the whitterring.The main whitter was related to the fact that their pee was wet(!) and their poop smelt(!) but Ariel and Fiona did appear to be enjoying themselves playing on the floor with the guinea pigs like 6 and 7 year olds. Due to the very unseasonal rain(YES I know I live in Wales), Beauty spent much of last week in the house either watching videos or playing on the computer so I don't know how she will take to that foreign object in the sky, THE SUN. She may not be too impressed with having to go out to play when she has been allowed to play on the computer so much in the last week. Even when we do go out she is still not too eager to do anything more that be pushed in her wheelchair/buggy. Last time we went out we visited Barry and The Knap beach and the buggy was not an option but I did have Fiona and SnoWhite with me so if there had been any issues they would have been able to scoop Beauty up and deposit her back in the car. Beauty however was thrilled with the beach and loved every minute of it. The Knap is a pebble beach and she enjoyed scrabbling up and down through the stones whilst we collected drift wood. Beauty is not good with noise so the best time to take her to most places is early evening, it is quicker to get there because of less traffic, less people around(noise) and Fiona and SnoWhite are definitely out of bed!Remember, students get up in time to watch  Hollyoaks. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollyoaks"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/07/miss-piggy.html", "title": "\nMISS PIGGY\n"},

We didn't get the keys until mid-day and even then we couldn't move in until 4pm when the builders had finished. But they hadn't finished-they just went home! The kitchen is still unplumbed and no water but they moved in anyway. And the front of the cooker is attractively decorated with Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles. There was still a load to come out of SnoWhite's father's house but during the evening Fiona and Ariel decided they wanted to go to a church youth activity, so the final trip was abandoned. It is a lovely area and  I shall take some photos when the rains stop. The houses are late Victorian  3/4 storey properties and SnoWhite has the garden flat. They remind me of American brownstones with the steps at the front. The next door property is beautifully maintained and is owned by one family and the guy who lives there said Hi to us when he came home from work. I am in fact glad it is raining and the forecast says the rain will not stop until mid-day, I need a little recovery time before I go and finish SnoWhites moving. It wasn't such a fun day for Beauty as she had to come with me everywhere in the car but she had plenty to eat and drink which made her happy. Her day was made complete when she asked for an ICE U SQUEAMER and we stopped at MacDonald's and bought her a plain McFlurry. We did bump into Beauty's speech therapist in the evening and Beauty completely ignored her, what a nice child. I had just bought her a comic and so she was way too busy to be indulging in idle chit-chat! Beauty's speech has increased tremendously, she will repeat anything, sings constantly and her ability to request things is improving brilliantly. I can see her asking for pocket money soon and her own car! Her favourite response is OH NO when I tell her it is time for bed. Instead of saying YOGHURT she pronounces it YOU-GUT  and it sounds so sweet when she says it. With her sweet older sisters, especially Fiona who  has the ability to flip faster than a coin, I am very impressed that Beauty  has of yet not said any swear words.

Somehow I missed this one off special last year and when I watched it I wept. I cried more that when I watch Steel Magnolias. The episode was about the last few months of Nana's life and how they all coped with her death. There was one scene when Barbara was doing her mothers hair and toe nails and they played the song Que Sera which was my favourite song as a child(so that's where it came from!) and Barbara and her mum hugged and Barbara cried and so did I. That scene set me off.Nana told Barbara that last Christmas when she had the wish-bone she wished that she wouldn't have to go into a  nursing home and she was so happy because her wish had come true. Nana got to die with all her family around her and her end was everything any of us could ever want. Yep it is official. I am a sap! When I saw this episode I thought of my mother who had died at 69, way to early and I wished that she could have had such a long life, Nana was approximately 85 when she died and portrayed as having had a good life. AND it looked liked Cheryl from next door( the nurse in Doctor Who-the Family of Blood) might end up with Twiggy(Onslow from Keeping Up Appearances)- their love of food, especially pork pies, appeared to bring them together at Nana's wake.

My family seems to be an equal mix of Catholic and other Christian religions, with friends who are Muslim, Wiccan(do you say Wicca or Wiccan!) and other Earth related religions  so I am adequately aware of what is going on out there in certain religious communities but I wasn't really prepared for what I read about religion within the context of the Middle East.My mind is such that what is going on just does not make sense and  I cannot seem to  make sense of what people are doing. When I did go to church, the actual doctrine seemed to be in my brain but at the far reaches as I didn't want to have to confront it because it didn't make sense.So what did matter for me? A supreme being that loved us and cared about us-Living a good and productive life and helping others AND REALLY that was about it. My feelings haven't really changed since I have become a humanist. I do not believe in a supreme being  which is because I cannot prove this supernatural being exists (If I could prove then I would be different)BUT I do believe in living a good and productive life and helping others.Surely living a good and productive life and helping others should be the main focus of your life whatever religion you are?And I really do not mean this in  a Look at me, Look at me in a goody 2 shoes kind of way.

We may not have gone far from the house yesterday but we certainly had a busy day. The parks in Cardiff are a nightmare during the holidays so that is definitely not an activity to embark on lightly, I tend to go in the evenings when the pace is more sedate. Roath park seems to be filled with older people taking their constitutional walks in the morning, hordes of children in the afternoon and a meeting place for Asian families in the evening, the evening is definitely the more pleasant choice for Beauty who is not too keen on lots of noise. The week that we  helped SnoWhite to move we passed Victoria Park a lot which was totally overflowing with children playing in the paddling pool and teenage girls trying to get a tan. Way too many people for me let alone Beauty. Last night I watched the film  The Pumpkin Eater,  it is a 1964 B&W Brit Flick, I haven't watched an old film for quite a while and I was surprised that I hadn't watched it before, it was a really good film. My parents loved the cinema and films and at home we watched all the films on TV, I especially liked the  Hammer Horror films.  Anastasia is also a film fan but she is not as keen as I am on certain  action films as she has to look away at the violence. SnoWhite also likes films but is not too keen on anything involving spiders and bugs of any kind, she is especially not too keen on  The Mummy  films due to the bugs running around. She will watch the film however as she loves the prison warden played by  Omid Djalli, I agree with SnoWhite that he is one of the funniest men on screen.

I awoke to the near deafening sounds of a 2oth century fox intro courtesy of YouTube, in that nano-second between dreaming and waking I had incorporated the loud noise into my dream. Anyone who knows Beauty knows that she plays everything WAY too loud, we first suspected autism when Beauty failed her hearing tests. The hearing specialist wasn't sure if she failed due to a hearing problem or lack of co-operation.

We are sat side -by-side on the computers and Beauty is playing a game on Nick Jnr, if I could have played this game at 6 I would have been a child genius. It is a Diego(DORA the Explorer Diego) game and it is a cross between Tetris and good old fashioned pairs and she is stunning. We visited my niece's at the weekend as it was one of the girls birthday, she is 18 a day after Ariel so we bought her an iron and a kettle to take to university.She will be doing English and creative writing and if I my time again I think I would do that degree as not only is it interesting but useful. We also went to see my other niece's baby who is now 9 months and she is so bonny and sweet, you just want to keep cuddling her she is so lovely. Before Beauty started Nursery she was seen by a psychologist and her said that she was 9-12 months socially and emotionally and after seeing my niece's baby who is 9 months I can see that in lots of ways the baby is already more mature that Beauty. Beauty may be able to use the computer with understanding, count at least to 30 and sing hundreds of songs but she is still not aware in so many ways. She can tell me she is hungry, ask for a drink, say she doesn't want to go to bed(!) but all of her conversation is in set phrases and whilst they are said with total meaning her conversation is totally one dimensional. Educationally I think she is as bright as any 6 year old but socially she is well on the way to being like Forrest Gump. Don't get me wrong, we have come a long way from the baby who sat in her cot and rocked and totally lived in her own world and I am grateful for that. I read many blogs on the net  and so many of the children I read about have some level of autism BUT they are all so different. I am so grateful that Beauty is progressing everyday because I know 2 other children locally who are on the spectrum and are in their own worlds and not progressing and do not have the quality of life that Beauty has. How can the Tweenies be seen as a terrorist action? Well Fiona, like teenagers everywhere , spent much of the night watching music videos on TV on TMF and is passed out asleep om the sofa but Beauty does not have the same liking for music videos so now the TV is showing The Tweenies singing  Old MacDonald had a farm! Fiona is less than impressed and ie muttering though still more or less asleep. Beauty does however like the Lily Allen music video where Lily Allen is portrayed as a cartoon. What do you think of this advert, I think it is brilliant. I haven't ever really drunk alcohol in my life and it has to be at least 7>8 years since I last had even the smallest amount but I am of the opinion that even though the law in the UK says you can drink a certain amount of alcohol and still drive, I do not believe you should be able to drink any alcohol and drive. I know that if I drank some alcohol and drove within minutes of drinking then my driving would be affected. Last night we watched  Help I'm a Teen Mum  and one of the girls didn't want to put her baby to bed early because the baby would get up early and the teen mum felt she wanted to have a lie-in in the morning as she(the teen mum) was grumpy if she got up early and found it difficult to cope with early starts. I have a cure for that-for the last nearly 7 years Beauty has either spent the night awake or up at some unholy hour. To the teen mum I want to say- YOU WILL GET USED TO IT, the baby will make sure of that! Yesterday when taking Ariel to the barracks at just past 7am there were older people everywhere, after a lifetime of early starts they seem to find it difficult to break the habit of getting up early. However after almost 7 years of Beauty I dream of a lie-in-it would be nice.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.itv.com/TVGuide/default.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/08/all-things-bright-and-beautiful.html", "title": "\nALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL\n"},

{"date": " August 21, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday we had a new addition to the family.........his name is Thumper and he is a 2 year old lop-eared rabbit and he is the sweetest little thing.It is really strange but to look at he is the chubbiest thing you have ever seen but when you pick him up he is so bony, perhaps it is just that the guinea pigs have grown into such butterballs that I can feel the difference. Beauty was scheduled  to go out with her child minder but was less that impressed when she had to go out as she had  to leave Thumper behind. Thankfully the Dora and Elmo toys that Beauty has are not on any of the lists that Mattel have put out. Soft toys so far do not seem to be affected.             Toys recalled over safety fears                                                                                                                                                             The recall affects 83 different types of toy currently on sale in the US                             Toymaker Fisher Price is to recall almost one and a half million Chinese-made toys over fears that their paint contains too much lead.      An internal probe found the Chinese manufacturer had used a non-approved paint pigment, violating its safety standards, the company said.    The recall affects toys that have been on sale in the US and UK since May.     It is the latest in a series of safety scares involving goods - food, drugs and other products - made in China.      China has pledged to introduce tougher quality controls on products, but sought to stem international alarm over the latest incident by insisting that 99% of its exports are safe.

In future I shall have to consider what I buy Beauty very carefully. I am sitting here listening to the videos that Beauty is watching on YouTube and I think because I hear the videos so often I don't really take notice of them. At present she is singing along to a Mickey Mouse song in Italian, I have also heard her sing in Welsh and French, it is definitely true that small children are like sponges. Unfortunately  YouTube also seems to cater for teenage boy  toilet humour which thankfully Beauty doesn't understand but she also doesn't understand when I won't let her watch certain videos. At the moment she is fascinated with Super Mario homemade videos where 'naughty boys' insert rude words into the songs.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://service.mattel.com/us/recall/39054_IVR.asp?prod="], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/08/thumper.html", "title": "\nTHUMPER\n"},

After Beauty decided that she was going to be awake until 2am I thought we were both due a lie-in, but not so and it is no fault of Beauty. The persistent phone ringing woke us up and who wanted to talk to us? An automated ring service, somebody trying to sell me something! They drive me mad but thankfully I have figured out how to deal with the situation........... I tell them SHE'S OUT I LIVE IN A RENTED HOUSE(I DON'T BUT.....) to double glazing sales etc SHE'S ON HOLIDAY NO When we first moved into the house in 96 we were terrorised by a bank who phoned day and night looking for the previous user of our phone number, no matter what I said they wouldn't stop phoning so in the end I said the person was BACK PACKING IN THE HIMALAYAS and wouldn't be back for 6 month(I saw that done on a TV advert) and it worked! They either believed me or thought that I was so insane they never called again. When we are in DIY stores and  IKEA  and the double glazing sales staff at the door are so pleased that you speak to them they don't even care when you tell them you live in a rented house, they are just happy you are polite and recognise that they are not invisible(a bit like the  Big Issue  sales people when you smile and say NO THANK YOU). What is it with idents ? Here is an a Weetabix advert from the 90's , in the form of an ident. They now have NEW weetabix adverts in the form of idents and YES Beauty has noticed them. She has also noticed the adverts where pieces of watches  and clocks are falling from the sky to the Bambi song April Showers and she loves it. It may be a good advert but the average 6 year old isn't really in the market for a internet mobile phone! Beauty has started sitting at the computer on her haunches on her chair in the last few weeks. It is as if time has stood still as Belle used to sit the same way on her haunches over 20 years ago and of course with the red hair it is very much like looking at Belle when she was little. Beauty also loves to sing but so far she hasn't shown the same talent as Belle just the same enthusiasm. Belle used to sing constantly when she was little, she even sang or hummed when she was eating! Please Belle sing a song for us on Youtube, you can set it to private,Beauty would love anything Disney. Beauty is watching the Disney Channel on the computer and she is watching a Winnie The Pooh video. She is watching Eeyore and he is miserable because it is raining BUT she thinks it is hysterically funny and will not stop giggling, well I personally feel for Eeyore as it is raining here AGAIN.            \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ikea.com/", "http://www.bigissue.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/08/back-packing-in-himalayas.html", "title": "\nBACK PACKING IN THE HIMALAYAS\n"},

I am a bit nervous to see if it works as I have heard about people getting substitutions for what they order but if it saves traipsing around a supermarket it must be good. Any bits and pieces I need I will get from the local shop. I also ordered a new mattress, I have been meaning to order it for a while but I never got around to it, however after ordering the groceries I decided it was time to order the mattress too. I am still reeling at the shock of how much I spent, it will only take me 4 weeks to pay for it but it is more than I have ever spent on a bed AND a mattress! It is an orthopedic mattress and so if it helps me sleep it will be money well spent. I think the guinea pigs are hatching an escape plan. Their hutch door has a wire front and it secured on the inside by a wooden frame, a sandwich effect.Well for the last 2 days they have  been chewing their way through the  inside of the frame and no matter how many times I tell them off(yeh I know, like they understand) they will not stop.  It is so sweet(sad moo) to watch the piggy boys sleep, when they were new they were so nervous they never seemed to sleep or if they did I never saw them. Now I see them taking naps all the time which is good to see that they feel safe. Though yesterday when I was cleaning out the hutch Beauty tried to get in with them and I'm sure that can't be good for them as I have heard that guinea pigs have weak hearts and Beauty must appear like a giant to them, heck she scares me when I awake to see her stood over me by my bed at night! I have to admit that this YouTube video is weird but often I turn around to find one of the guinea pigs just staring at me and I think that I am so glad that guinea pigs are herbivores after watching it!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/08/i-did-it.html", "title": "\nI DID IT!\n"},

Their food dish is turned over and their hutch is trashed and their bottle kicked off the cage, they sure seem to be having fun whilst I sleep. I think I should have called them Tuck and Roll after those crazy blue bugs in  Bugs Life  as they certainly seem to slap each other around and bounce and jump all over the place like Tuck and Roll. On to the kitchen and I find that Fiona has spent the night baking cup cakes, I blame  Heroes  as the  cheerleader  and her mother were making cupcakes last night. I have spent all morning wiping up pink icing sugar. So they have been having fun all night whilst  I sleep when the 6 year old sleeps but you know something........I don't think I am missing out on anything. I'm definitely too old for that kind of nonsense. And Bunny Boy? Well he is as good as gold. No wild partying and his hutch was spick and span and all his mess is in one corner. He can't cope with the wooden floor so I put him on a washable Indian rug on the living room floor and a poop tray next to him and plenty of food and water and he has been happy all day and so well behaved..........so much better than a cat! Last night I slept for the first time on the new mattress and it was really good. Beauty has a bedroom downstairs with an adjoining room that I sleep in to keep an eye on her but last night I thought I would try out the new mattress so Beauty and I slept in my bed upstairs (the one with the brilliant mattress) and she was so thrilled because it was something new and I was thrilled because it was so comfortable. I definitely slept well because I had enough energy to clean the kitchen and the computer room, clean and feed the animals, do the washing and drying(the sun is shining at last-hurrah!) and tidy the garden. I wonder if I bought Fiona an expensive orthopedic mattress she might clean up after herself a bit more-well maybe not.I try not to mention cleaning anymore as she goes into ogre mode if I do  and I think I prefer her in Cameron Diaz mode.                 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/", "http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/", "http://www.cafepress.com/buy/save+the+cheerleader", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/08/am-i-party-pooper.html", "title": "\nAM I THE PARTY POOPER?\n"},

I am definitely going to have to start offsetting more than just my holidays. *Beauty went to visit friends for an hour(they couldn't cope with more!) in St Mellons which was a drive there and back twice. *Ariel returned from army cadet camp and so I had to pick her up from Maindy Barracks. *I had to pick Running Man up from the club *Drop SnoWhite's art work down to her flat AND *Last but not least, I took Ariel out to her friends 18th birthday in USK  AND  go back at 11:30pm complete with Beauty to pick her up. It is not so much a hardship for Beauty as she loves going out in the dark.                                          I have a serious question-What the heck is going on with the local wildlife? They have become positively suicidal in the last few days. As I have said before, I live right on the edge of the city and so we are surrounded by fields and woods which means wildlife! On Thursday I went to Aldi and came past the local doctors and as I did a squirrel ran out, I made an emergency stop and the squirrel just sat there staring at the me before running off. Then on Friday I made the same journey and a bloody squirrel ran out in almost exactly the same place, this time my tyre squealing emergency stop attracted the attention of many locals which made me feel a bit of a wally.  AND  last night I drove to Ariel's friends house through the lanes to USK and we passed a rabbit and a hedgehog who had not safely maneuvered the lanes. We also saw a hedgehog deciding whether or not to thrust itself headlong in front of my car as well as having to make an emergency stop for a squirrel and a bird in the USK lane version of Sleepy Hollow.I have been through those lanes many times in the last 10 years since Ariel has known her friend who lives in USK and those lanes never cease to scare the poop out of me. They really are like Sleepy Hollow and they are scariest in the snow and fog, the lanes are so narrow that Ariel's friend has been snowed in a few times. I don't know if they have had to use them but Ariel's friend's dad makes roads and has a few of his vehicles stored in a barn in the field next to the house so I suppose they could always use a digger to get out if they had too.    Ariel's friend's family are so sweet and the mum and dad are lovely, one day Ariel's friend's dad came home from work with a tiny Shetland pony that he bought for her..............in the back of his van. Her dad is a sweetheart. Beauty loves that little pony, she got so excited when she first met him.                  Back to crazy animals, anyone who knows where I live knows that the estate is full of crazy animals  and children waiting  for you to run them over. I literally emergency stopped with no room to spare(he was touching the bonnet of my car) when a child ran out.........his screaming mother ran past him a few seconds later.Dimitri has also had a child bounce off his car in the same place and I had  a cat run into my car! The cat literally ran into the side of the car, bounced off the side of the car and started bouncing up the street as if he were on a pogo stick. Perhaps there is something in the water locally that affects the animals and the children(and the adults!)! The funniest thing was the day of my husbands funeral, on the corner(where myself and Dimitri nearly hit a child) a couple were having a stand-up fight in the road and when the funeral cars came around the corner and it took a few seconds for them to realise we were waiting for them to stop their fight.The colour drained from the face of the woman as she could see us coming but the man who had his back to us took a few seconds to realise what was happening.It lightened the day immensely.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/08/memories_26.html", "title": "\nMEMORIES\n"},

The Sleep Council, which conducted the poll of 1,000 teenagers, says gadgets in bedrooms such as computers and TVs are fuelling poor quality \"junk sleep\".    Youngsters need to be taught that sleep is important for their health, it said. I couldn't agree more.......are you reading this Fiona, Ariel and SnoWhite? A little peace descends on the house for 3 weeks, now begins 3 weeks of spring cleaning or should I call it summer cleaning? I am going to sort my bedroom and my clothes, sort out my art studio and Fiona wants to move bedrooms so I will sort out the back bedroom for her. Yesterday I spring cleaned the lounge(that's right, on a bank holiday!) BUT I wasn't able to sort out the Rose Cupboard as the key has disappeared ANY IDEAS GIRLS? The Bunny Boys hutch is now complete and up in the front garden along with the piggy boys hutch, they seem very happy with the location.Bunny boy is very chilled and enjoying his spacious new home and the piggy boys are so nosy they are loving their spot so they can see everything that is happening through the lounge door. Those piggies may think they are a pair of bad ass boys but they are really a net curtain twitching pair of gossipy  men, like the men in Last of the Summer Wine. It's funny how women have the reputation as being gossips but the men I know are THE WORST! Talking of gossip, to cut a long story short, I used to go to church and  twice  reported nasty gossip that was being bandied about to the appropriate authorities and I was subsequently accused of spreading gossip by doing that-you can't win! SO my new policy is  SAY NOTHING because of what happened. However, my girls come home and tell me news they hear from church and I tell them UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE REPEAT WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD or they will probably get the blame for spreading gossip. Yesterday one of them came home with a really shocking story about someone I have known for over 30 years, a story that as far as I can see is so far mere speculation and I have told them NEVER NEVER EVER repeat it. I really would rather have not known, if it is true I will find out with the rest of the world through the newspapers etc , life can be a really horrible place sometimes. Gossip magazines sometimes come into the house through the girls BUT I would rather only hear the nice things.The fact that celebs have cellulite AND are still famous and happy is good too as that makes me feel good about myself but I am sick of hearing about the likes of Paris Hilton,Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Ritchie etc. If they do something worthwhile, all well and good but no more tales of their arrests or pictures of celebs flashing their bits  PLEEEEEEAAAAAASE!

But was it a blip or did it change Britain for ever?    On the morning Diana, Princess of Wales' death was reported, few could have guessed the extraordinary momentum that the mourning for her would generate. By the time of her funeral it had reached fever pitch with thousands lining the funeral route.    A sea of flowers was laid in front of Kensington Palace, stra ngers embraced, snaking queues formed in front of condolence books, businesses closed as a mark of respect. I remember  that Sunday morning when Anastasia came upstairs and told me that Diana was dead and being so shocked that I just couldn't believe it. I felt terrible sadness for her boys but the overwhelming feeling was of anger at Charles who had brought years of misery to Diana because he was such wimp. If he had loved Camilla all those years ago then why hadn't he just told his parents that he was going to marry her which he ended up doing anyway instead of skulking around having an affair with Camilla all those years and having Diana involved in his mess. WIKIPEDIA   says Before her wedding in 1973 Camilla had been the girlfriend of Prince Charles. However, she was not seen by the Royal Family to be suitable to have the Prince's children, so they were not permitted to marry. WHAT! I hope the Royal family have learnt from this situation.  Imagine the response from Prince Harry if he were told that he couldn't marry the person he loved! I am sure he would say that he was marrying for love and he would learn from his own mistakes. The question was Did Diana's Death Change Us? The other night I watched the end of a program about Great Britons and the conclusion was that Diana taught us  the uncomfortable truth that money and fame and privilege  doesn't necessarily bring  happiness with it. Her personal joys came from her family and the things she achieved through her work not the fairy tales that we all dream of as children. I think perhaps we all lost some of our innocence and perhaps that isn't always such a bad thing. Diana's life was a cruel reality eye opener and from watching it unfold we all learned to appreciate the precious things we each had in our lives- loved ones, friends and contentment with personal achievements.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6936612.stm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/diana.html", "title": "\nDIANA\n"},

Beauty also started back at school on Wednesday and she has slept really well since going back, we were having the 2 hour singing sessions when she went to bed but those miraculously stopped with the return of school. Beauty is such a happy little soul and really quite undemanding (compared to certain of her sisters!) that I forget about her joint problems because she doesn't communicate well. I have noticed recently that she is limping but I don't know if she is in pain or not and I can't take her to the local Doctor because he will say CONTACT THE CONSULTANT and the consultant is more difficult to get hold of. I think I will speak to the school nurse as that is where Beauty sees the Consultant. I went to my first Art class yesterday and although not terribly exciting we did learn what is expected of us with regards to our sketch books and we had our first assignments.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/getting-old.html", "title": "\nGETTING OLD!\n"},
{"date": " September 04, 2007", "body": "\nAfter finishing the change over of rooms for Fiona, I painted the floor in the empty bedroom.  An empty bedroom is a spooky thing!  I went to the bathroom at approximately 5 am and because a lot of the floor boards in the house seem to be connected through rooms, the floorboards in the empty room made a terrible noise. And talking of spooky! I lay down to go to sleep last night and I couldn't relax because there was something in my room making a noise...........I was convinced it was a rat or a mouse. I managed to find enough nerve to switch on the light and the noise turned out to be-duct tape! In the spare bedroom wardrobe I had stored the  pieces of Beauty's cot and I had strapped them together with duct tape to prevent loss. On moving them out to change over the bedroom , I separated the large pieces of wood from the smaller pieces and the quickest way to take the duct tape off was to pull and tear. Well I am sure there is a perfectly good  scientific explanation for it but it was really a strange phenomenon. The pulled and stretched duct tape was constantly moving as if it were being fluttered by a breeze(it wasn't),I couldn't get it to stop so I put it into the bathroom over night. I was so fascinated that I had to stand and watch it for a few minutes. Random moment............. the gerbil we used to have ended up in the bathroom on the shelf because he too wouldn't be quiet at night! Last night Beauty must have been exhausted because it took her approximately 5 minutes to go to sleep, the night before it took approximately 2 hours of singing Elephants on Parade(just those words-thank you Dumbo!) before she gave up and went to sleep. Yesterday I took Beauty and SnoWhite to IKEA Cardiff(I have no shame!) to buy a cheap, small desk to go into the spare bedroom. We decided to go to the restaurant for food before shopping as a treat for Beauty and she loved her fish and chips. IKEA  restaurant last night was like being in the middle of a Carry On film! Our food was produced on paper plates with plastic cutlery(the dishwasher was broken), the salad buffet consisted of just chick peas,kidney beans, beetroot and Lollo Rosso lettuce(WHY? don't know),the trays were dirty, no tomato sauce and the soft drinks machine was broken and leaking everywhere! BUT.......... we did enjoy our meal and we laughed the situation off whereas the family behind us bitched and bitched and bitched. Their family consisted of a mother, a father, an older daughter, a teenage boy and girl and a baby and if my girls ever made as much mess as that family did when going out for a meal they would have been in serious trouble. My girls would have been so thrilled and delighted to go out for a meal as a treat that they would have acted like angels. In IKEA SnoWhite accused me of having no shame because Beauty started singing along to a James Blunt song that was being played in the store, she only occasionally calls me Mama BUT she knows the words to a James Blunt song(she can also sing along to Daniel Bedingfield)! So-I like listening to James Blunt, I admit it , I am officially sad! I am currently playing Simon and Garfunkel in the car to get Beauty to learn to sing those songs.  One of the boys in Beauty's school is like  Beauty and has a huge memory for  remembering and singing songs but he sings  songs from the theatre and musicals as that is what his  Dad likes. I can imagine him singing songs like I'M JUST A GIRL WHO CAN'T SAY KNOW  or BLESS YOUR BEAUTIFUL HIDE. Next on my spring cleaning list is the bathroom and the airing cupboard, I shall do those today whilst the floor in the spare bedroom is drying. I am leaving the floorboards for another day to make sure they are well and truly dry. Then it will be my bedroom and finally the front bedroom to get the spring cleaning treatment. Whew! Today I will be starting my AS level Art, I feel quite excited as if I am 16 again! I wonder how long it will take for the excitement to wear off?  And tomorrow Beauty goes back to school- Beauty will love it and so will I. It will be nice to get her into a routine again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/carry-on-ikea.html", "title": "\nCARRY ON IKEA!\n"},
{"date": " September 09, 2007", "body": "\nWell yesterday was more like a day and a half than a day, I am absolutely Cream Crackered.We left the house at 9:30am to visit elderly friends in Caversham, Reading and with the traffic it took almost 3 hours to get there. It wasn't so bad when we got there as we went for lunch and relaxed for a couple of hours, Beauty ate a huge bowl of ice cream and spent the time drawing in my notebook. When we got back to their house we spent the rest of the time making tents with chairs and blankets! This was fine by me as I was able to close my eyes, lie down and pretend to be sleeping, now how difficult is that? On the way back we stopped at the large Sainsburys on the outskirts of Reading, this is where we were stopped on 9/11 when we saw the 2nd tower fall on the TVs in the TV showroom. Somehow I always seem to be driving up the M4 at this time of year. The journey back down the M4 was uneventful and  we were back home by 7pm. And the fun continued! We had been invited to a friends 25th wedding anniversary party, so after a quick change we were off in the car again. The party was held in the conservative club in Penarth and Beauty loved it. For the child who does the assembly hall in school with her fingers in her ears, Beauty couldn't sit close enough to the speakers. She also loved the flashing lights and the smoke machine, she would have been ecstatic if they had had a bubble machine. After a few hours we left so we could pick the old guy(Runningman) up, he goes to his club on Saturday to play Bingo. We couldn't have him going home on his own as he could do something silly like getting himself run over and break his neck.Oops, he has already done that one! On the way back I decided to check out Snowhite to see if she were OK and not in a ditch somewhere as I hadn't heard from her in a few days but there was no answer at her flat. As I pulled out of her road onto Newport road I noticed a girl in her 20's walking up beside the Infirmary wall, she looked to be  holding her back in pain and crying. I just couldn't leave her there without speaking to her so I parked the car in the lower part of Broadway behind the library and asked her if everything was OK. I didn't get much sense from her as she was crying a lot and she had been drinking but I asked her many times if anyone had hurt her but she said no. I told her that I would take her to the police station if she wanted to go, it was 10 seconds walk around the corner but she said no. I did however insist on giving her a lift home, she was planning on walking to Llanrumney which is quite a walk without being in the upset state that she was in. I dropped her off at her aunts house and she seemed a lot better, she couldn't thank me enough. All the time I was driving her she cried and talked a lot. I really felt that I had to give her a lift but in this day and age I was worried for myself as much as for her, she could have said or done anything but isn't it awful that we can feel fear of doing something we know is right. It was certainly and eventful end to an evening. And as for SnoWhite, well she was walking up Broadway at exactly the same time as us but because of picking up the young girl and going out onto Newport Road at the bottom of Broadway instead of the top, we just missed her. But I did phone her later to find out that she was OK and she was. Today will be a slow day, a recovery day, I am now sitting quietly at the computer until I have to pick Runningman up from running the Cardiff 10K..........it is Sunday, a day of rest and thousands of people are in Cardiff to run 10K, the thought of it is painful, let alone running it. When driving back from dropping Runningman off I passed the lake and the early morning joggers were out doing their circuits of the lake, all I could think when I saw them was ,' A lie in or a few circuits of the lake', let me see, like I need to think about it!The childminder will be here at 3pm and I can't wait, 3 solid hours of sleep.Forget eating or drinking or jogging(as if!) I will have passed out within seconds of Beauty  bouncing out of the door.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/day-of-rest.html", "title": "\nDAY OF REST\n"},

This morning I was putting food away in the fridge and saw what I thought were black bags at the back of the fridge, it turned out to be a squeezy bottle of Branston Pickle lying on its side! Black bags may be unusual in fridges in most houses but the other day I found a loaf of bread in the fridge and the cheese in the bread bin...like I said OLD AGE DOESN'T COME ALONE. SnoWhite accused me of being a nerdy older student........WHY? Because I showed her my art sketchbook and she said I was typical of the older student on her art course who does twice as much as everyone else and still worries that it isn't enough.Thanks SnoWhite! Yesterday in my art class we looked at the work of Georgia O'keefe and whilst SnoWhite has studied her work before I have heard her name but never heard anything about her or seen any of her work.Remember all the students in my class, apart from me are 16 and so you still have to be careful what you discuss as a lecturer and the lecturer asked ME what I saw in the work of Georgia O'Keefe. Well not wanting the other students to think I was strange I said I could see nothing but I am sorry but all the photographs that she showed us looked like female genitalia! I spoke to SnoWhite and she said that I was right, Geogia O'Keefe was well known for painting pictures of flowers that looked like female genitalia.Thank goodness for that, I thought it was something to do with being a nurse and studying biology was making me see things. They are however very good paintings.

Today I was putting out the washing in the back garden when I thought OH THE GARDEN COULD DO WITH A TIDY, I estimated it would take 10 minutes but it took over an hour as I decided to empty the planters of old plants and sweep the steps.Behind each planter I found a hoard of snails and spiders, the largest spider was about 2 inches across but thankfully that was it's whole size not just the body size.If it was large enough to have a body 2 inches across then Belle in Florida and Anastasia on Rhodes would have been able to have heard my screams without the aid of a phone or Skype. I am so tired of the way the media is reporting the Madeline McCann story, each time I pass a newspaper stand I have to look awake because I am heartily sick of the lurid headlines of the tabloid papers. I have taken to reading the online version of The Telegraph as it is reporting what is being said and quoting where the source of the information is coming from without making headline claims.  Madeleine McCann saga reflects our society By Boris Johnson Yesterday I read a comment by Boris Johnston on the Daily Telegraph website which reflected on how the nation has been considering The case of Madeline McCann, he said We want the story to end, of course. It has been the most wretched event of a wretched summer, and we want it to climax one way or another, even if the denouement exceeds even the ghastliest Channel Five real-life family murder drama. I do not want the parents of Madeline to have hurt her in any way, whether by accident or on purpose, I like many other people want the sorry saga to be over and Madeline to get the decent burial she deserves if she is found to be dead or brought home if she is alive. I like everyone else want the truth to come out whatever it may be. I remember one case of a mother who killed her daughter and her daughter's friend and I watched her crying on TV for her daughter's abductors to bring her back and all the time the bodies were in the attic of her flat. People do do terrible things and they do lie about them afterwards but only the McCanns know what really happened and I think at this point it is important for the police to be allowed to do their job to bring a conclusion to this situation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/09/13/do1301.xml"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/spiders.html", "title": "\nSPIDERS\n"},

Experts said the condition of the womb after the first pregnancy may be a factor.    The study of 14,000 families was presented at the BA Festival of Science.    The research, by David Lawson, of University College London, also showed children in larger families were likely to be shorter than average.      Researchers found that children with three siblings were 2.5cm or one inch shorter than the average height for their age.  Did anyone think to  tell Fiona at 6 feet 1 inches that one? Or Beauty who looks  set to  grow even taller than Fiona! I have always believed that you can make research prove whatever you want it to prove, perhaps that is the cynic in me. The Bible,  Romans   13:9        For this, Thou      shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt      not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment,      it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour      as thyself.   My neighbours certainly make it difficult for me to love them! We live opposite flats so we are going to have a lot more people than the average road but they seem to have got it down to a fine art at waking me up in the middle of the night. I seem to fall asleep quite nicely at about 11pm and then at approximately 1 am I am awakened quite regularly by the neighbours in the flats. Whether it is the same ones all the time I do not know but whoever it is  they seem to come back from drinking and on going into the flats proceed to wake up the whole road with their loud voices. The weekends are worse as you also get the people who have been in town on a night out coming home later, this morning I was awoken at about 10 to 6 by some late night(early morning!) revelers. I really have no objection to anyone going out and having a bit of fun but please do it quietly as the 10 to 6 revelers woke Beauty up and that was the end of any possibility of any weekend lie-in.   Now Beauty is happily SCREAMING along to  Simba's Pride. In Simba's Pride their is a part where Simba's daughter Kiara is surveying the savannah and  Timon and Pumbaa  show up and they end up scaring each other( a but like Drew Barrymore and ET in the film ET!). Well Beauty enjoys getting to the scream part, stopping the video and producing the screams herself. Well I have to admit that they are pretty  blood curdling  and realistic screams! Her screaming sessions have been known to last for over half an hour. Thankfully FOR ME she is watching the video in the dining room but it is not so good for the young couple next door as the dining room is next to their kitchen . I cannot even begin to imagine what they think must be going on! Who would have thought that as a mother I am trying to teach my daughter to spit? NICE! Beauty has never been keen on brushing her teeth but we manage it twice a day and she also brushes her teeth after lunch in school BUT she will not spit the toothpaste out! I have spoken to the dentist and he says that I shouldn't worry as the toothpaste on her teeth will actually help protect her teeth. She is however continuing to stress over the paste left in her mouth so now I have taken to brushing my teeth at the same time as her and spitting profusely to encourage her copying me. And this morning she spat for the first time into the sink, just the once but she well and truly spat. Success. I am thrilled because I have taught my child to spit! I am sure however that there will come to a point where I will regret teaching her this! A bit like regretting buying Fiona a WOODEN baseball bat! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6992852.stm", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120131/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/love-thy-neighbour.html", "title": "\nLOVE THY NEIGHBOUR\n"},

{"date": " September 19, 2007", "body": "\nLast night I slept straight through from 12 midnight to 7am and not a thing from the lad opposite(I promise not to mention him again after today). I have however a number of theories why I heard nothing 1. I slept with the window closed as the temperature fell considerably yesterday 2. I was so wiped out after driving so much yesterday that I wouldn't have heard Genghis Khan dancing up the street in his underwear,with his hordes, singing  THESE BOOTS WERE MADE FOR WALKING or even singing THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC! 3. The lad is only allowed out drinking on the weekends. 4. The lad is a reformed character after a beating with a rolling pin and sleeping on the sofa for 3 nights. The litmus test will be Friday when the weekend starts again! I had forgotten, even after only 3 weeks, just how much noise Ariel makes. All the way back from the airport Ariel and Fiona played SPOT THE YELLOW CAR(am I glad BT vans are no longer yellow), when they saw a YELLOW CAR they would scream(predictably!) YELLOW CAR and punch the other sibling. I was punched JUST once, on getting into the car I had accidentally  hit my arm on the door post of the car and it was really hurting and on seeing her first yellow car, Ariel proceeded to punch me in my bruised arm which not only hurt like a little Bit*h but almost propelled the car(remember I was driving) into the back of a Chrysler Voyager. I have to have a rant about drivers because yesterday I seemed to be surrounded by numptys on the motorway and it only served to confirm why I hate driving during the day. At one point a woman swerved into our lane at the last moment with no indicating and SHE was pi**ed that I beeped my horn at her. And why did I beep my horn? Because I nearly went up her butt, if she wants to commit suicide then all well and good but don't involve me. Drivers do the maddest things and what for? 2 extra seconds up the road in front of the other drivers. It is either a power thing or way too much caffeine. On Saturday nights I drop Runningman off at the local cons club so he can play his bingo and then pick him up at 10:40 pm and drop him off at his place so he doesn't have to catch the bus post drinking(he could end up in Pontypandy  after his Saturday night pints!) and whilst there are not many ordinary drivers around, mostly taxi's, the driving of the other cars can be very worrying. Do they not realise that driving at 20 miles per hour in a 30 area is going to get them pulled over by the police? They drive like they have been drinking and are driving slowly and precisely so they will not  get stopped. Driving slowly and precisely and at 20 miles per hour is a sure fire way of getting yourself noticed in Cardiff,the average driver in Cardiff is very good but they certainly do not drive like that. Did anybody read this? I am totally shocked, this is so wrong.

Kid Nation takes 40 children, some as young as eight, to an abandoned New Mexico desert town where they are left to fend for themselves for 40 days. The youngsters are meant to create a functioning society with a system of laws, commerce and even a class system. No outsiders were allowed on the set and children's rights groups have said it is tantamount to child exploitation. Critics see the show as a modern version of Lord of the Flies with a Wild West twist, while supporters say it is just a summer camp with cameras all around. Accidents The show has been surrounded by controversy and accusations it is using the children as entertainment fodder. Parents signed a 22-page contract, virtually absolving producers from any responsibility for the children's well-being. There have been reports of accidents and the children also put in 14-hour days in front of the cameras. You just cannot do this to children. By getting the parents to sign contracts does not stop the children suffering psychological damage and complaining of it in years to come. In this day and age of being more aware I have always felt that certain psychological experiments could no longer be done such as  BLUE EYES BROWN EYES  as it would be totally unethical but it seems I was wrong. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/sleep-of-just.html", "title": "\nSLEEP OF THE JUST!\n"},

The eco warriors challenge the attitudes of energy-guzzling families, and try to get them to change their lifestyles by showing them how to live greener lives. Our three presenters are Joanna Yarrow, a leading expert in green living; trained ecologist and anti-waste enforcer Dan Carraro; and eco-design consultant and ex-builder Andy Tugby. Joanna advises leading businesses on how to be green and is proof that you can live an eco-friendly life and be chic with it. In her North London home, she has four different composting systems, organic and recycled interior decorations and furnishings, wears hemp clothes and uses organic beauty products. Dan is a self-styled anarchist. He's no conventional protester, just someone who thinks looking after the environment is the obvious and morally just thing to do. Andy's passion is making buildings greener; to help us all reduce our carbon footprint - and our energy bills.

New-look Emu back on television                                                                                                                                                             The new-look Emu will be moved independently by puppeteers                             The latest incarnation of wayward puppet Emu is set to arrive on British television screens next month.     Toby Hull, son of Emu's late creator, Rod, will introduce a new-look version of the popular children's character to a new generation of viewers on CITV.    The 26-part live action comedy series, called Emu, is aimed at 6-11 year olds.    Emu became a fixture of both children's and adult television in the 1970s, achieving notoriety for attacking host Michael Parkinson on his chat show.      Mr Hull, a trained actor, has performed with Emu since his father's death in 1999. When I saw this I immediately thought OH MY _ _ _! I was never a fan of Emu but I feel compelled to have a look to see if son of EMU is as mad as the original EMU.I If the humour is as slapstick as the original then I am sure that Beauty will love it as she has definitely gained an appreciation for OTT humour recently.I have a feeling that she will grow up to appreciate humour such as Monty Python, the same as her mother. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/outrageous_wasters/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/return-of-emu.html", "title": "\nRETURN OF EMU\n"},

This morning she awoke at 7:30am and being me I really didn't want to get up so early on a Sunday morning so I told her I would only get up if she told me her name. Well after 10 minutes of being tormented by her I gave in (without her telling me her name) and as I was getting out of bed she said HELLO, I AM BEAUTY. Little mutt,but she did as I asked her, she told me her name JUST not first, which I suppose was my fault really as I didn't make myself totally clear on the WHEN.What a clever girl. Curiouser and curiouser! On Friday night I bought a pair of everyday walking type shoes  because my feet got slightly damp in the rain whilst out the other day whilst I was wearing my crocs. Fiona bought me a pair of crocs as a present last Christmas and I have worn them everyday since as they are so comfortable. Well I decided to buy some shoes so I could wear them with winter skirts and tights and not look a complete idiot. Well now I have bruised big toes! The shoes fit just fine BUT when I walk my toes touch the top of the inside of the shoes AND so now they are bruised and painful. What kind of idiot bruises their big toe nails? So now I am back to crocs until my feet are better. Give me your waifs and strays! Last night it was 2 westies! Whilst taking Runningman home from his Bingo I drove along Cyncoed Road and 2 of the sweetest little westies were running around in amongst the cars and nobody stopped to catch them so I stopped the car and called them. They came over straightaway, they were so sweet and affectionate, and I took them by the collars to the side of the road. As there was no address on their collars I knocked on the door of the nearest house but they weren't theirs but then the owner showed up. They had escaped from the owners garden so all was well that ended well.                 I was quite surprised that nobody else stopped to try and catch them. So Ariel is now in uni and settling in just fine. Here are the photos as promised and girls if you want to see all the exciting pictures of her wardrobe, desk etc (which Fiona took!) they are on photobucket.

On Saturday when I took Ariel to Exeter university I was introduced to the world of the current day manifestation of the Sloane but my appreciation of what this means seems to have progressed no further than the early 80's when Lady Diana Spencer was a Sloane. I remember Grace from Big Brother describing herself as a Sloane so my using the word Sloane is not a derogatory term but what they call themselves.They are the children of well off families who have gone to public schools and can usually be defined by the way that they dress and speak. The girls all seemed to be wearing pashminas, mini skirts,uggs and somehow seemed to generally look very similar,Fiona and Ariel did not look out of place. The girls all seemed very nice, they reminded me of some of Ariel's and Belle's friends from school. Today Fiona started at college and she had lectures in Maths,English  and Geography and she was able to sort out her bus ticket and ID. Brilliant. Fiona seemed to ejoy herself and on the way home she even managed to go shopping in town and buy herself some gloves and 2 pashminas. If I hadn't been there when Fiona was born I would be convinced that the fairies swapped her.I took her to town yesterday to buy a winter coat but after 2 hours we were unsuccessful but if I had taken any of her sisters to town and they knew that I was prepared to buy them a coat, then by hook or by crook they would have found a coat.However we did find a coat that she liked but not in the right colour, it was a classic Zara mac and she wanted a black one. The next nearest Zara is in Birmingham so that is a no go, so Anastasia has promised to buy one in Vienna and post it. Problem solved. Today my art class was cancelled because the teacher is ill, I was so disappointed. If it had been last Monday I would have been more than disappointed because it took me over an hour to get there withe the accident on the M4. The traffic was fine today and it only took me 15 minutes to get to Cross Keys.

Well a few minutes later I received a phone call  from  SnoWhite  saying she had passed a collapsed man on  Pentwyn  Drive but as she only saw him through the window of the bus she couldn't do anything, so she phoned me to do something! Well I found him and couldn't wake him up so I phoned an ambulance BUT then he did wake up and said he was walking home and he didn't want an ambulance even though he appeared to be in a lot of pain. I think he had either been attacked or hurt himself in some way but he wouldn't admit it.Well........after the ambulance was canceled and he stumbled up the road and fell again, I told him I was going to give him a lift home as he wasn't safe. I now that sounds really dangerous but there seemed more chance of him hurling in the car than hurting me! Anyway, I managed to get him to his house and he stumbled on his merry way. I KNOW that if I hadn't given him a lift, forget any possible injuries he might have had, he would have stayed passed out on the pavement and probably died of hypothermia over night. This happened locally a few years ago when a lad went out with him mates and he had lost his key, they left him in the garden asleep and he died of hypothermia during the night and that was in the summer.It is something to do with the way the body cools down after drinking alcohol. I am a proper old woman because now I am worried and am wondering if the lad from last night is OK but what more can you do? Fiona starts her Welsh A level course today.......up and out of bed by 7:30am is a minor miracle for Fiona,as a typical student(!) she usually gets up in time to worship the Holly Oak(sorry that is watch  Hollyoaks !). Beauty's speech is increasing daily and there are now many things she can say but none of them are really spontaneous speech. Yesterday she came to me saying CHOCOLATE, CHOCOLATE, CHOCOLATE so I took her to the shop which is all of 10 seconds walk from the house. Whilst we were walking back, Beauty clutching her chocolate buttons, she said to me,THAT'S REALLY GOOD, DELICIOUS and  TROUBLELICOUS ! She knows the meanings of words and phrases she has heard and can repeat and use them in the right situation but she can't construct her OWN sentences. Even now her ability to natter constantly can be tiring but when she begins to ASK QUESTIONS constantly I  shall look back with fondness to the glory days of just natter.I do not think that I will get away with GOOGLE IT with Beauty!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/09/troublelicous.html", "title": "\nTROUBLELICOUS!\n"},

So badly did relations deteriorate between the sisters of Santa Clara in Bari that the Mother Superior ended up in hospital with scratches to her face. Now the local archbishop has intervened and asked the Vatican for permission to close the convent. But Sister Liliana, the only nun still there, says she has no intention of leaving her home of the past 44 years. The Clarissa nuns are regarded as the most austere order of the Roman Catholic Church, devoted to a life of prayer, penance and quiet contemplation. But at the Santa Clara convent in Bari, the vow of silence was shattered by an unholy row. Sisters Annamaria and Gianbattista say they were driven to distraction by the nasty habits of their Mother Superior. They became so angry that during the summer, they turned on Sister Liliana scratching her face and throwing her to the ground. The two nuns have now moved into a nearby convent leaving Sister Liliana barricaded inside. What did the poor old woman do that was so bad? Smack her gums? Tap her foot(that really upsets Fiona)? Slurp her soup? The possibilities of her crimes are endless. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/10/good-news.html", "title": "\nGOOD NEWS!\n"},

The group invented a chemical weapon, nicknamed the \"gay bomb,\" that when dropped causes heterosexual men to become attracted to one another instead of aggressive. Meanwhile, the Ig Nobel prize for medicine went to Dan Meyer and Brian Witcombe for studying the side effects of sword swallowing. As for the research into the bomb that would cause heterosexual men to become attracted to one another instead of being aggressive, I really think it sounds a good idea. I have worked as a nurse for many years and so I have come into contact with many gay men(and women) because  the gay men that I have met seem attracted to working in the caring professions. I have also lived next door to gay men on three occasions and would choose to live next door to them rather than my fighting neighbours that I live next doo0r to now, ANYTIME. The men that I have known would just not be interested in fighting and that sounds like a good idea to me, if they were involved in politics then they would probably spend the entire defense budget on the NHS and Education.

This morning I dropped Beauty off at school and asked Fiona if she wanted a lift to college, she replied that she did and that she would be ready in 'A MINUTE'. Well in Fiona's 'MINUTE' I was able to sort out the piggies and the bunny, feed them and put them in their day hutches. I was also able to collect all the dishes, fill the dishwasher AND turn the dishwasher on. I was also able to sort out the dirty washing and put it in the machine and turn the washer on. I was also able to sort out the drying from yesterday and put it in the tumble dryer for 5 minutes to finish off. I was also able to sort out the cardboard for the recycling bin and put all the rubbish in a black bag to go out to the rubbish bin. AND I also managed to clean Beauty's shoes. Standing at the back door in only a top, jeans and a cardigan I asked Fiona if she were ready, she replied YES to which I commented that it was pouring down with rain, to which she replied that she had an umbrella! Brilliant logic........... dry BUT cold! I sometimes wonder how I managed with five children before Beauty came along. However, I have decided that parenting skills for 5 normally developing children is totally different for 1 learning disabled child. With the others I felt more like a sheep dog, constantly herding them in the direction they needed to go but with Beauty it is more a hands on approach. In the morning I get up and cook her food and pack her bag complete with nappies, change of clothes and food fo9r the day Prepare her clothes Get her a drink Run the bath Say GOOD MORNING( She then says GOODNIGHT and hides under the duvet!) and take her to the bath. A quick bath, dry and dress Breakfast AND then off to school. It sounds nothing really, so why then is it such an exhausting process? A problem with school. The teacher thought that they heard Beauty say the naughty word for a Negro person but I was able to reassure them that through her hearing and speech problems she  actually has difficulty pronouncing words and the word she was actually trying to say was NEIGHBOURS which she actually pronounces as NAY-GERS. We have heard her say NAY-GERS many times as The Neighbours theme song is one of her favourites!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/10/snap.html", "title": "\nSNAP!\n"},

The Toy Retailers Association has unveiled a list of 12 toys that it expects will dominate kids' Christmas lists this year.    Toymakers have largely played safe with old favourites and TV and movie tie-ins, but have given them a technological twist. The list includes a new version of perennial favourite Barbie that incorporates an MP3 player, a fluffy puppy that grows bigger the more it is petted by its owner, and Optimus Prime, the robot hero of this year's hit summer movie Transformers. Though I have been considering the IgglePiggle that is on the TOP 12 list, however, the fact that Beauty has hundreds(I kid you not!) of other soft toys, I am still not convinced. Sometimes we say the stupidest things without thinking. Last night SnoWhite and I were watching the film Baby Boom and SnoWhite had not seen the start of the film and so she asked where the baby had come from and I said HER COUSIN LEFT IT TO HER IN HER WILL! Well my only defense is that it made perfect sense to me when I said it! SUGGESTION OF THE DAY-Alistair Darling , deal with those slugs, ask Gordon Brown who his beautician is! Everyday this week when I have picked Beauty up from school she has said HELLO, perhaps the next step will be HELLO MAMA.

The case - in which two mothers have brought up the wrong baby girls for 10 months - has shocked the country. The director of Trebic Hospital gave details of the hospital's internal inquiry into the affair at a special televised news conference. He said two nurses in the maternity ward had been found responsible for the mix-up and had been dismissed. A further five employees - including doctors and health managers - had been reprimanded and moved to other wards. Nikola and Veronika were both born on 9 December 2006 in Trebic, 165km (100 miles) south of the Czech capital, Prague. The mix-up only came to light when a dark-haired, dark-eyed father - suspicious at his baby daughter's blonde hair and blue eyes - underwent a secret DNA test. The test proved he was not the girl's biological father, but a second test proved his partner was not the girl's biological mother either. Angry and confused, they approached the hospital, which then discovered the terrible mistake. The parents now face the agonising prospect of swapping their children. One mother is said to be suffering extreme emotional trauma . I really do not know how the mothers will cope.I know they are being told they will have to swap but how can you possibly be expected to give back a baby you have loved and cared for, for over 10 months. The situation is terrible. The noise level in the house has increased 200%! Ariel is home for the weekend(well allegedly), she came home yesterday evening so she could watch her young man play Aussie Rules football in Reading. She comes home to Wales for the weekend so she can go to Reading to watch football all day Saturday! Would you believe that her young man is doing A levels in Geology, Geography and Biology and will be going on to do an academic degree and yet he is such a good fine artist that he does portraits that are worth between \u00a350 and \u00a3350 each! And here am I doing Art A level and struggling to create a passable resemblance to people when I draw them. I am so envious of his talent. Everyone seems to be better than me at art, Fiona's work is stunning and I wish I was half as talented. A big thank you to the young shop assistant in The Range store on Newport Road for being so considerate when I knocked an ornament on the floor in the store.According to Fiona the ornament was particularly hideous but I still felt really guilty but the young man was really quite sweet. Well at least it wasn't 2 antique vases!

Conservators have now pledged to glue them back together, but how?     It sounds like something from a crime scene. Once the body was removed from the staircase, a fingertip search for evidence began.    The body in question was Nick Flynn, who had accidentally fallen into three of the Fitzwilliam museum's Qing dynasty vases, breaking one and crunching two into small pieces (Mr Flynn, himself, was unharmed).

She somehow managed to break the DVD drawer and in the end I bought a new player but left the  old one in place  as the  video still worked. Well last night at Ariel's party they decided to watch a DVD and decided to install the new player, however Beauty was not aware of this and only realised at the end of the DVD when the screen came up and it was pretty obvious  there was a recorded film in the player. Well so much for children with autism not liking change and crowds, Beauty pushed her way through the large crowd of 18 year olds(girls and guys)  and was up at the TV happily punching buttons in a flash, she can use that DVD/video player better than I can! She has spent the morning watching Bambi on video.........on rewind! Does anyone know why it is always rewind? As you all know I am a vegetarian, I have never really thought of it as a big deal, just something that gradually happened over the years.When I was younger I didn't eat a lot of anything and was a size 8(US 4) and that was thought of as skinny then, when the girls were young meat was mostly chicken and then I stopped eating meat and finally I stopped eating fish as well. I have never forced it on the girls and they are old enough to cook what they want if they don't like my vegetarian meals, though they do miss my corned beef hash pie. Well last night I cooked chicken pieces, chicken nuggets, scotch eggs and sausages and this morning I was awakened by Ariel shoving  a tub of dead pig(sausages) under my nose asking me if I wanted one. She was very apologetic when I reminded her I was vegetarian..........I wonder how long it will take them to remember? In a few days Ariel will be off to army cadet camp for 2 weeks and she will be back for a couple of days and then off to Florida for 3 weeks to visit Belle, Fiona will also be going to Florida.

{"date": " October 16, 2007", "body": "\nI read this article and wondered if it could work Speed limits in many towns and cities should be reduced to 20mph, say the government's road safety advisers. 20mph limit called for in towns                                                                                                                            The report argues for more to be done to improve road safety .Their report claims a default speed of 20mph in built-up areas will help halve the number of deaths on Britain's roads within the next few years. The study also called for greater enforcement of 20mph zones through a new generation of speed cameras. The devices measure a driver's speed over a certain distance and should be a priority for the Home Office, it says. The cameras are undergoing trials and still awaiting government approval for use in 20mph zones. Well, on the way to school this morning I couldn't have done 20 miles an hour even if I had wanted to because there was so much traffic but I did try driving at 20 miles per hour later on and it seemed so slow that it almost felt like I was kerb crawling. Around town I always drive within the speed limit and when I anticipate a problem, children, pedestrian's, parked cars etc I always slow down as I pass. I believe that there should be speed restrictions of 20 miles per hour around schools and possibly shops but after my attempt at driving at 20 miles per hour this morning I think a blanket speed limit of 20 miles per hour isn't necessarily the answer. Surely logic would say if you reduce the speed limit then traffic  will be on the roads longer and that could possibly be a hazard. No I'm not a traffic expert but surely more hazard awareness around danger spots would help relieve the possibility of accidents. Anyway, I do not have total confidence in these speed cameras, especially the one at the cathedral on Western Avenue. Traveling East, from stationary at the lights, the camera has flashed me at least 5 times(though I have never been issued a ticket) and the speed limit is 40 mph! I would love to see my car manage that speed in 3 seconds, the car is automatic not supersonic! How accurate are they really?

I shall go out in my slippers in the rain And pick the flowers in other people's gardens, And learn to spit.

When I was younger I watched the film Damien:Omen II (why I couldn't tell you) an all I remember from the film is the sheet of glass coming off the back of the lorry. Yuk! Because of this I told the girls to choose wisely what they saw as they would never forget the things that they had seen in films even if they had wanted to. Anyway, back to the point, last night I watched Heroes and I now have another memory that I would rather not have. Sylar, by telekinesis, levitates shards of broken glass and uses them  as a weapon and Peter Petrelli gets 'killed' by a piece being embedded into the back of his head. As a nurse, I am not an overly tender soul but sometimes I think that there are things we shouldn't have to see. Beauty is still off school with her nasty cough so I am being terrorised by Beauty's advert of choice! It is an advert for Wii which keeps popping up on the Disney Channel  and a family talk about how the Wii game has transformed their lives and how 7 year old MAX is the King of Wii. This advert has had only one effect on me......to limit my child's usage of the computer! I want to know 'MAX'S' address so I can send him a football.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/11/memories.html", "title": "\nMEMORIES\n"},

The other day the weather forecast said that it was to be 2 degrees but it ended up as 2 degrees below zero so YES SnoWhite, it is definitely winter. Yesterday I was reading through the other blogs that I read and I felt that my blog was very shallow in comparison. When I started to write my blog I decided to call it a Blog On The Spectrum because I wanted it to be about all of my family and for my family. To help keep in touch with my girls and talk about how autism influences our lives but still to talk about every day things, which doesn't always include autism. My blog is definitely not as profound as the other blogs that I read and that makes me feel quite guilty. I love to write about TV , the news(usually stories of injustice), disability and anything else that happens in my weird and crazy life BUT this doesn't make for a best read blog it seems.HOWEVER, I don't know how people keep up with their blogs when they become very well read because mine is even now quite tiring to do. One of my children commented about my 'eventful' past and suggested writing about that but I DON'T THINK SO. I love Andrew Collins and his book Where Did It All Go Right?- who needs another miserable childhood or miserable life book, I hate reading them so at the moment I do not have any intentions of adding another mis lit to the best seller list! Talking about the news, am I missing something here?      Bike sex man placed on probation       Bike sex case sparks legal debate And they put him on the Sex Offenders register, what a strange case. For pity sake it was drunken man in his own private space.  I have seen drunken students bare their butts and do much worse in the street(I live in a university city) . Having worked in hostels I personally feel that the Hostel warden and the cleaners need a good slap for invasion of privacy AND wasting the police time. Anybody who has worked in a hostel has almost definitely seen worse than that, reporting this kind of situation is not going to encourage trust. He is not a danger to others and especially not a danger to children so what he has done wrong I do not understand. I have heard many stories(none I can repeat because of privacy)of friends who have worked in casualty(ER) and the things they have had to remove from places..... in future will such people be prosecuted for causing offense to those doing the removing?

I am now aware of where snakes and lions and monkeys and big horn sheep like to live and what they like to do!I never cease to be amazed at the information that I learn from Beauty's websites, computers are amazing things. When I was Beauty's age my only source of information was of course the local library which was not that extensive in the late 60's.I was addicted to reading books about Tutankhamun and there was one  book  that I read from cover to cover many times. Who would have thought I would grow up to do a History degree? Another book I read as a child was AN HOUR IN THE MORNING,but it certainly did not have the same profound effect upon me!It was the story of a maid in Edwardian times and how an hour spent working in the morning seemed to achieve more than an hour spent working in the afternoon. When I get up I get Beauty ready for school and take her there and I also collect all the rubbish and sort it, collect the dishes and empty and fill the dishwasher and collect all the dirty clothes and sort out the washing and drying ,sort out the animals AND then the best part of the day....... I lie down to recover! Without that morning nap(well lie down really) I couldn't cope with the rest of the day.And then I get up and carry on! The funny thing is when you tell other people that you have a disability , many people think of you as being ill but  apart from when I get an infection like anyone else I do not  think of my self as ill, exhausted all the time but definitely not ill.

The ship's operator Gap Adventures said they were in \"good spirits\".    Some 23 Britons, 17 Dutch and 13 Americans were among those on board. What is it with me and cruises? Remember I also said that I wanted to go on a cruise on the Nile and the scary thing is that I would still go on both. There is also a cruise between St Petersburg  and Moscow that I would love to do, when I went to Russia we traveled on a train between the 2 cities so a cruise would be nice to see the country. I wonder if Qantas do cruises?( just joking). Also in the news ,  Ziggy complains that Chanelle' bitch slapped' him ! Well, when they were on Big Brother he messed with her head so much that if he had treated one of my girls like that I would have 'bitch slapped' him myself. Chanelle may have emotional problems but Ziggy is certainly no gentleman and definitely does not know how to treat women properly. WOW.....I really enjoyed being shallow. SnoWhite is 22 today and as a birthday present I bought her a very adult coat, it is a dark purple swing coat and it looks really good on her, my baby is all grown up! It must be OK because even Fiona has given it her seal of approval.Anyway, SnoWhite really needed a coat because her present coat looks very similar to the one that Betty wears in Ugly Betty(the pale blue coat). And I bought her a penguin for her penguin collection! Carrying on with the shallow theme.....Oh please! Wasn't it just a little bit predictable for Alan Dale(Bradford Meade) to die of a heart attack! Isn't that how he died in The OC and Neighbours? Personally for me he will always be Jim from Neighbours . And last night Rab ( Derek Riddell ) from The Book Group showed up as  Christina's  husband, I love them both as they are both such good actors.Though personally I don't trust him in Ugly Betty! I also bought myself a new coat, I think the last coat that I bought is about 4 years old and it has gone quite thin and as this winter is promising to be very cold a thicker coat was definitely needed. I have a very long Russian Army style coat but it isn't very fashionable at the moment but I couldn't get rid of it as it is still in very good condition even though it is 8 years old and Russian Army style coats seem to come back into fashion quite regularly. Beauty has a unique talent with the computer! When she watches short videos on children's channels she stops and starts them in the same way that a DJ does what he does to his records(scratching?) and whilst entertaining for  a few seconds, after a while it gets verrrrrrry irritating.Scratching any longer than a minute usually gets the comment........HE GETS IT( from   2 Pints of Lager  when Janet tells  baby Corinthian something in baby talk-repeatedly and Donna shouts at her!). I recently bought  a new record player which Beauty is banned from playing on, I can imagine her  sneaking out of bed at night and DJing  for a party for her and the guinea pigs!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7110550.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7110550.stm", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=492978&in_page_id=1773", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0725701/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0421332/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278251/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/11/scratching.html", "title": "\nSCRATCHING!\n"},

Again , the computer has gone into it's I WANT TO BE ALONE mode and I spent 15 minutes swapping keyboards and mice(Beauty is still breaking them faster than I can replace them).

We are also having ISSUES with Beauty. Not content with destroying computers(is that an Olympic sport?), she has also taken to destroying eggs.Her teacher thinks it is something to do with a shape sorter game that they have in school where eggs crack in half and there are smaller eggs inside, a bit Matrioska-ish. Fiona and Beauty have also taken to squabbling together like a pair of 4 year olds, for Beauty that is good news, that she is acting like a 4 year old but as for the 16 year old.....well I did expect her to act at least like a teenager! We also had a serious incident with Beauty and the rabbit! The other night I couldn't find her but eventually I did, she was in with the rabbit .....playing with the straw in his hutch! I was convinced I was going to find him dead BUT he and Beauty were fine. They were sat together  as happily as an old married couple. Looking back I shouldn't have been worried, If Beauty had tried to hurt  the rabbit he would definitely have bitten her  and she would have been out of there like a shot. If she had tried to get in with the piggy boys their hysterical squeaking would have been heard by Belle in Florida and Anastasia in Austria!

And they all seemed to be having good natured fun, it was really nice. 17 years ago when we moved into the area(and it was very much a student area even then), very few people would dress up and party.

It is pretty cold here at the moment, obviously not as cold as the parts of the USA and Canada that are experiencing pretty extreme weather but the wind is making it pretty nippy and whilst the temperature is hovering around freezing, the wind is making it feel a lot colder. In the winter I wear large square shaped scarves, folded into a triangle and worn a bit like an hijab with a fringe but instead of leaving the ends at the front I pass them round the back and tie them in a double knot. Hijab link This is how I look(well not quite as pretty but you know what I mean).

Well, both women stared at me all the time until they passed me and even when I went to cross the road and turned to check the traffic, one was still looking. I really wanted to ask them if there was a problem and I know I could have been over sensitive but it really felt an uncomfortable situation. I really do feel like I am from a different age, I wear a head scarf because I hate my head getting cold.The women I passed were wearing skinny jeans with pumps/ballet shoe type footwear with no socks, little thin bomber jackets with no hats, scarves or gloves and they looked really, really cold. I am sorry but when I get cold fashion has nothing to do with it. I am sure girls you will  be pleased to hear that unlike Harrison Ford in Witness I did not punch anybody!

He told the BBC's Have Your Say that he did not want to \"purge\" the UK of its Christian heritage.    The comments came after Tory MP Mark Pritchard accused \"politically correct\" people of undermining Christmas.    Professor Dawkins, author of the God Delusion, added that he liked \"singing Carols along with everybody else\". The article concludes with   He added: \"I fully recognise the full historical and cultural significance [of Christianity] in our country.     \"We should all be aware of that and celebrate that.\"    And the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Trevor Phillips, said schools were wrong if they thought celebrating Christmas excluded children who were not Christian.    He said: \"Christmas and the celebration of Christmas in this country, though it is a religious festival, is one in which people who are of no religion - or other religions - can share.\"        I also feel this way. Because I do not believe in God does not mean that I want to take religion away from people, I think that religion is a huge power for good. The religious festivals are also a large part of our cultural heritage and as such should be remembered and celebrated.I have read many instances in the UK of how Christmas and  other religious festivals are being marginalised so as not to cause offense to the peoples of other religions in the UK. I think this is totally wrong and we are meant to celebrate our diversity. When I went to Turkey, being awoken by a CALL TO PRAYER was what happened in that country and any suggestions of stopping it to prevent causing offense to non-Muslims would have made me angry.When I go to Spain I love to see all the shops with Nativity scenes in their windows, I was pleased to see quite a few shops with Nativity scenes in Cardiff's shopping centre when I visited last. At Beauty's Nativity play Whoops a Daisy Angel the audience consisted of many Muslim parents who all seemed to enjoy the play very much and if they had not wanted their child to participate then they had the chance to opt out. At the school play I talked to Beauty's best friends mother, they are African Muslims who have lived here for a number of years due to to the fact that there is war in their country and they cannot go back. Beauty's best friend is high functioning autism and so he is extremely bright and questioning and this year he asked if they would be decorating the house for Christmas. I explained to his Mum that in the UK we have celebrated at this time of year(any historian who wants to correct me-not a problem)back to pre-Christian times, the winter solstice and the fact that the longest day of the year is over and the days are getting shorter. I also suggested decorating the house for Eid-al-Adha-The festival of Sacrifice, the festival that marks the end of Hajj. She thought that this was a brilliant idea and she will be decorating her house with snow and other non-religious items.Beauty's friend thought this was great and when he asked his mum if they were going to decorate she said 'Of  course, Christmas is for everyone'. Again, as Richard Dawkins said He said:  \"Christmas and the celebration of Christmas in this country, though it is a religious festival, is one in which people who are of no religion - or other religions - can share.\"                                                      Christmas is a time to share and for families to be together, and I as a humanist will be celebrating it within the cultural traditions of my country or any other traditions that bring us all closer together. Oh as a by the way, Anastasia bought me a copy of The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins as a Christmas present one year and it was very good, Thank you Anastasia. Last night I had another of my crazy dreams! Due to the fact that I do not sleep very well, I do not get a lot of deep sleep so any dreams that I have i seem to remember quite vividly. I dreamed that Anastasia had been doing missionary work for the church she belongs to and had been gone for 18 months doing this work-not a chance!I do not think that I or Dimitri would be too pleased with that idea. Now if I had dreamed that she had done a VSO year abroad that would have been totally different. I have never been too enthusiastic about people who go away JUST to SPREAD THE GOSPEL but if they were to go to Africa to help build wells etc AND talk about their religion, that sounds good.I have also thought that Health Educating in needy areas sounded good or working in a homeless hostel in Cardiff but going  away just to preach doesn't do it for me. I have also found the thought of Enclosed Orders a bit worrying but if it floats your boat then who am I to criticise. However, the one most likely to get itchy feet is SnowWhite, she is presently considering working in Special Needs Summer Camps-who can tell where she will be next year? She has friends she went to school with who are currently living in Israel(one is doing is national service) so she could end up working on a Kibbutz!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/12/last-night-i-had-strangest-dream.html", "title": "\nLAST NIGHT I HAD THE STRANGEST DREAM.....\n"},

A choir from Ysgol Gymraeg Coed-y-Gof were among those stranded as the passengers were slowly taken off. One parent described it as a \"nightmare\".    Cardiff Council, which runs the city centre attraction, apologised. I LOVE GOK WAN! Gok Wan is one of the nicest guy's on TV. On his show How To Look Good Naked a girl who hated her butt was asked to look at the butts of 5 women and to guess where she thought in size  she would come in the line up. She put herself as a lot bigger than he actually was and so did I! I put myself at about half way and it turned out that I was a full 5 inches smaller on the butt than the smallest of the girls in the line-up. Now that is better than any Christmas present that money can buy!  Gok Wan My feet are so cold this winter that I have bought myself a pair of  UGG boots  to wear as slippers from where else but Peacocks,one of my favourite shops.And why do I like Peacocks? Because I can park right outside the shop. Not the branded Ugg boots(though I think they look so amazing-sad or what?)but the cheap synthetic version, I just couldn't wear dead sheep on my feet!I always wear shoes that are synthetic because of being a vegetarian but I do have a leather belt that I bought a while ago and I feel bad about having it in my wardrobe but what do you do with it? I keep it because(sorry if this sounds a bit naff)some animal died to make it and throwing it away seems worse than wearing it!Yes I hear you all saying WHAT A WALLY! Now what do you think of this amazing card? You so have to check out the  Santoro London  website. Beauty received this card from Anastasia's in-laws in Switzerland and it is so beautiful.The card is a tri-fold and The London Eye and the Helicopter blades rotate and the helicopter is suspended, I think it is stunning. Thank you so much. Beauty plays constantly with some boxes of blocks that came from Geneva, they are German made and they were Dimitri's when he was little(he is now 26) and  his little brother gave them  to Beauty when as a teenager his mum said he was too old for them.Beauty loves to stack them and line them up but Fiona has been known to build with them too(she once built a convent for a wind-up nun that belonged to SnoWhite!).                                                               \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7152647.stm", "http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/H/htlgn/gok.html", "http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://img.metro.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07/gokwan_175x125.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html%3Fin_article_id%3D58758%26in_page_id%3D11&h=125&w=175&sz=6&hl=en&start=25&um=1&tbnid=jdZeiiBCQHKybM:&tbnh=71&tbnw=100&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dgok%2Bwan%26start%3D20%26ndsp%3D20%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26sa%3DN", "http://www.peacocks.co.uk/Products/Womens_Catalogue/Best_Sellers/BLACK_FAUX_FUR_LINED_SHORT_BOOT_-74765070.html", "http://www.santorographics.com/shop/index.php?action=item&id=1544&prevaction=category&previd=6&prevstart=0"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/12/i-truly-love-gok-wan.html", "title": "\nI TRULY LOVE GOK WAN.\n"},

Pc Byron Emerson-Thomas had claimed he acted in self-defence in the row at a Cardiff police station with Pc Aled Bartlett, who needed eight stitches.    After the Newport Crown Court jury took less than 30 minutes to reach its verdict, the judge questioned why the Pc's case had ever come to court.    His barrister said the \"silly incident\" could have been handled better.      South Wales Police said it respected the court's decision and an internal investigation would take place.    The trial heard Pc Emerson-Thomas, 37, of Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan wanted first go in the patrol van because it had been fitted with a new radio.

She would wash and dry and iron and put away all her washing everyday, as well as clean her house from top to bottom daily.Whereas, I would iron only what really needed to be ironed and most things were stacked in tubs on the pantry shelves until I managed to take them upstairs. Even today my everyday clothes very rarely make it to the wardrobe upstairs and this morning Beauty and I were dressed completely with clothes that came out of the wash basket. I have definitely achieved a lot in the last 18 years  but it would definitely been a lot less if I spent MORE time on laundry.

I find that all I want to do is lie down, when I am standing or sitting and I turn my head I get very dizzy and nauseous. I am also experiencing Deja vu constantly  and no I am being totally serious! I find great difficulty in holding conversations because when I start to think about something my mind starts to remind me that I have already thought about that thing. It makes it really difficult to keep a conversation going as your train of thought is constantly being distracted.I checked it out on the internet and it seems that the whole Deja vu thing could be caused by the fact that recently I had a massive migraine  which is still lurking in the form of a constant dull headache. Wikipedia   offer a number of possible reasons and I think I go with their ideas of 'this may result from an overlap between the neurological systems responsible for  short-term memory  (events which are perceived as being in the present) and those responsible for  long-term memory  (events which are perceived as being in the past). In other words, the events would be stored into memory before the conscious part of the brain even receives the information and processes it.' 'with miscommunication of the two  cerebral hemispheres  and abnormally fast neuronal firing also given as explanations for the sensation.' As well I think the whole Deja vu thing is caused by the headache I had as it has happened in the past to me, post headache. Some have suggested that Deja vu is also possibly linked to reincarnation..... however my boring brain thinks NOT A CHANCE! But if we had lived before,who would you have liked to be? For me, possibly Florence Nightingale or St Bernadette or Princess Diana.....Yep, I am officially weird!

I went to visit a friend this afternoon and I have to say that the police are as crazy there as they are where I live! 6 cars and vans full of police showed up outside of her house,got out, looked around, chatted and then after approximately 25 minutes they just LEFT! Now what was that all about? They should have knocked on the door and asked if they could come in for a cup of tea. I was talking to an old friend of mine today and I was talking over many of the things that have happened to me in my life and I realised what  strong coping mechanisms I have. I have previously thought about doing a counseling course and then again this afternoon my other friend talked about doing the same course that I had thought about doing. I think  that perhaps I should give working in this area some consideration. A few weeks ago I surprised myself by crying over the death of my husband,it surprised me because it was a number of years ago now but I think that what upset me most was thinking about what he had lost, all those extra years living and being with his daughter. Until I had losses in my own life,child, husband, parents ,I don't think I realised how painful and different for everyone grief and loss is. Who would have thought that I could have got upset now after so long. But I think it was normal and right. My mother also lost her first child and I always had the suspicion that she never stopped grieving. When I was much younger, in my early 20's , I needed someone to talk to so badly I thought I would burst because there was no one there for me. All I needed was someone to listen,I didn't need advice or anything, I can really see how counseling  is helpful. Definitely something to think about. Positive news on the fibromyalgia front.

{"date": " August 10, 2008", "body": "\nYesterday I felt grumpy and grotty and just plain 'fished' off and I just couldn't figure out why. Being a nurse,everything had to be analyzed,so I decided int the end that I was just feeling a little depressed.It could have been depression associated to the fibromyalgia and the arthritis pain BUT NO. I woke up this morning with a slight sore throat. A mild infection, nothing interesting after all. However,I hated having the feelings that I was having so I decided to do something about it! Believing I was just feeling a little depressed and I know I swore I would NEVER,EVER, do it again.....I painted my living room! I thought,if I do this then I will feel like I had achieved something and it would make me feel better.And it did! And the rather large bowl of strawberry ice cream also helped! It may sound like a huge undertaking to paint a lounge but it is was not a very large job really. When we moved into the house the lounge was twice the size but when Beauty started to grow and we knew she had problems, I had the 2 rooms separated by wooden doors so she could be better contained in one room. So one wall has double wooden doors, another has a front garden door , another has the entrance to the room door and finally one full wall,so not that much of an undertaking really! Anyway, I managed to watch NCSI at the same time so it was quite a productive evening really. Oh and I forgot to mention, when we moved in the lounge was covered in the most hideous wall  paper and so we removed it to find that the walls were not too fantastic so I painted it with artex paint and no matter how many people hate the stuff,it can be a godsend as it is really easy to maintain when you are doing the work on your own. I think that I should start an Artex Appreciation society on facebook! Just kidding! So this morning I cleaned the room and put everything back and now I have a spring cleaned room. I was intending to paint my porch but I couldn't watch TV at the same time! Next on my TO-DO-LIST then. An old picture of the walls in my lounge(and beautiful SnoWhite of course). I think the walls look fine. And the moral of the story.....painting a wall and eating ice cream could be more beneficial than therapy!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SJ6V86UypsI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/_8HSam41N3Y/s1600-h/04.06.07+019.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/08/now-that-was-impressive.html", "title": "\nNOW THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE!\n"},

He gave Beauty anti-sickness medication and a prescription for other drugs and we paid \u00a340 for a 25 minute visit and I was very impressed.If only we could pay for that kind of service at home when a child is sick. Rotana Suites Poor sick baby. However, do not worry about buying medications,everything is readily available. Each item that we required cost approximately 50p and I also managed to buy Ariel some multi-vits and iron for 50p which at home costs me approximately \u00a36.00 for a months supply.

{"date": " November 30, 2008", "body": "\n THE LAST LEAF CATHAYS CEMETERY IN WINTER BUT BEAUTY IS STILL ASLEEP! It is still her fault though that I am awake, my neck is really aching still from dragging her through ASDA. Beauty is getting to be quite a big girl. Pain is such a strange thing, I have been bleating on for weeks about my neck hurting from over doing it from carrying  bags that were too heavy but that pain has totally gone overnight to be replaced by a different type of neck pain. However, the Pollyanna in me says that I should be glad because it is a different type of pain and nowhere near as bad as the 'carrying bags' pain. One of the sad realities of being a humanist is that I can no longer look forward to a 'next-life' where I will have a perfect body and be pain free, emotionally I can see how religion can be a comfort in many ways. Perhaps I am not really a humanist after all because if  I could prove that GOD and JESUS were real I would be back there in a heartbeat. I think I am really stuck in the middle as an Agnostic rather than a Theist or an Atheist. My comfort is that I live my life as best that I can and as I have said before,using Aslan talking to the Telmarine soldier in THE FINAL BATTLE as an example, (in my words of course) you lived a good life and lived it as if you were worshiping me, surely that should be enough. Now that is definitely way too deep for a Sunday morning! I am definitely not eating enough chocolate. CATHAYS CEMETERY IN WINTER I am so glad that I am not a rugby supporter as I could not cope with the stress! Wales survived a brutal Australian fightback in the final minutes to claim their third success over a Tri-Nations opposition since rugby turned professional in 1995. I slept through the match but awoke to watch the last 5 minutes and almost had a heart attack from stress as the gap from Wales' lead was narrowed and narrowed. Beauty went out with the child minder yesterday and I enjoyed 3 Beauty free hours and it was wonderful Roy wood said he wished it could be Christmas everyday but make it 'child minder day' every day and I would be a very happy bunny.That is why I love Beauty going to school and the wonderful thing is that she loves it too! I love this little cutie to bits but she is so exhausting. Don't you just love this story? Imagine the conversation with Beauty and Pirate Patch?       'Mummy, can I phone the pirates?'                                                                                              One of the biggest frustrations facing journalists is being unable to get through to people on the phone. But as Mary Harper discovered, contacting the Somali pirates on the Sirius Star turned out to be child's play.                                 The pirates on the Sirius Star put the phone down on the BBC                            It was a cold, dark, wet and miserable Sunday afternoon. I was in my car, driving my 12-year-old daughter and her friend back from a birthday party. I was tired and fed up from being in the car.  \"Mummy, mummy,\" trilled a voice from the back. \"I want to phone the pirates.\"  My daughter had heard me repeatedly trying to get through to the Somali pirates on board the Sirius Star.  They usually picked up the phone but put it down again when I said I was from the BBC. My obsession with getting through to them had reached the point that I had even saved their number on my mobile phone.  \"Mummy, mummy, please can I phone the pirates for you?\"  \"No.\"  \"Pleeeeez.\"  By this time, with rain battering my windscreen and cars jamming the road, I was at the end of my tether.  \"OK\", I said, tossing the phone into the back of the car.  \"They are under P for pirates.\"  Giggling with pirates   \"Hello. Please can I talk to the pirates,\" said my daughter in her obviously childish voice.  I could hear someone replying and a bizarre conversation ensued which eventually ended when my daughter collapsed in giggles.

Dialogue had been established.  The next day, I went to the crowded office in Bush House in London where the BBC Somali Service is based. I told them the story.  \"Let's try now,\" said producer Said Musa, who, dare I say it, looks a bit like a pirate himself. He has a wild look about him with flashing eyes and a swashbuckling saunter.  He dialled the number. A pirate answered. \"I'm sorry,\" he barked in Somali, \"the boss pirate is sleeping. He was very busy last night keeping watch for possible attackers, night time, you know, is the busiest time for us.

When a person has a light cold or heavy cold then they know what that is  and then there is Flu. With Flu you cannot lift your head off the bed without your brain seemingly bouncing around inside your skull and causing so much pain that lifting your head is something you avoid doing at all costs. And then there is MANFLU..... so much worse than a heavy cold but different to Flu as the whole 'HEAD' thing doesn't happen(sorry I can't be more technical ). I have 'MANFLU' and I feel very poorly. I believe that using the word Flu in the description of the illness is what causes the problems. There may not be a lot of you out there who read this blog but there is enough of you to think seriously about a new name for this illness which even I as a wo man  believes in. Pianoman is slightly better but he remains in hospital with pneumonia and is still in bed which is very unusual for Pianoman, he must be very poorly for him not to be wandering. Social Services have suggested that whilst Pianoman is in hospital then his mum should be in residential care and I totally agree as she thought I was Pianoman's cousin the day before yesterday and told me all about everything 'Allyson' had been doing for her. SnoWhite made Pianoman's mums lunch yesterday as I stayed home with Beauty who is still ill with something viral, she is getting better but last night she had an episode of night terrors. I am taking her to the school concert today but she might just end up watching. Due to the whole Viral  MANFLU  infection that I have, my neck is screaming in pain.Belle would be encouraging me to go to the doctors for stronger pain killers if she were here, she is like a conscience sitting on your shoulder encouraging you to do the right thing. And she is home in Florida and I miss her and I miss Beau and Woody even though they didn't visit. I am a silly moo! The next visit is from Anastasia and Dimitri next week.

They also left lots of rubbish on the floor for me to clean up! I have been very naughty and un-green today! Today I bought an old fashioned light bulb for my living room.

I could buy another tree for school. Perhaps I will have less headaches with better lighting. My healthy eating continues and I am continuing to lose weight. Today however I just had to have a chocolate fix and my desire was for none other than a Star Bar and it was beautiful.I very rarely eat sweets of any kind and I just had no appetite for breakfast in any shape or form so at 11am I had a Star Bar and not only did it fill me up as much as a meal but it satisfied my craving for sweets and at 260 calories I feel that I am still on track.

I have also bought her a new lampshade , rug ,mirror, Princess wall stickers etc ,etc , etc. The theme is surprisingly PINK! I have kept the theme broad as Beauty loves the Princesses, Barbie(yuk!) and anything else with a hint of pink! Beauty is back in her original bedroom and it will contain her desk and all her clothes whilst the main bedroom will contain her toys and a double bed and will be the visitors bedroom because we seem to get plenty of those.I shall post pictures when the work is complete.

Yesterday I had porridge for breakfast and then my 2 meals were Healthy Option ready meals(Yes, I will make an effort to cook my own) with lots of vegetables. I have also dumped Pepsi Max which is my most favourite drink in all the world and I am drinking No Added Sugar Blackcurrant and Apple Squash.

The survey of 2,060 people showed 55% believe in heaven, while 53% believe in life after death and 70% believe in the human soul.         The study was carried out between October and November last year for the public theology think tank Theos.         It also suggested that nearly four in 10 people, 39%, believe in ghosts and 27% believe in reincarnation.          A further 22% believe in astrology or horoscopes and 15% believe in fortune telling or Tarot.         The think tank said the findings were \"especially striking\" when compared to the 1950s.         Then only 10% of the public told Gallup that they believed in ghosts and just 2% thought they had seen one.             More sceptical            In 1951, only 7% of people said they believed in predicting the future by cards and 6% by stars.         But the latest research showed an increase in scepticism about certain aspects of the supernatural, the organisation said.         In a 1998 Mori poll, 18% of the public said they believed in fortune telling or tarot, and 38% in astrology. A further 40% said they believed in ghosts, and 15% said that they had personal experience of ghosts.         Theos director Paul Woolley said: \"The enlightenment optimism in the ability of science and reason to explain everything ended decades ago.         \"The extent of belief will probably surprise people, but the finding is consistent with other research we have undertaken.         \"The results indicate that people have a very diverse and unorthodox set of beliefs. Our research may point to a slight increase in scepticism about aspects of the supernatural over the last 10 years.\" MY THOUGHTS AS I WROTE THEM ON MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT *I would like to believe in heaven BUT I don't. *I would like to believe in life after death BUT I think more than probably isn't. *I believe there is something SOUL LIKE within us BUT whether it goes on or not..... *I think there is such a thing as 'Ghosts' but whether what we see are actually the spirits of dead people BUT I have had 2 experiences that might have been 'Ghosts'. *I totally HATE the idea of reincarnation,think of the awful situations you could return to!Enough to give you nightmares! *I do not believe in astrology BUT I think there is something in TAROT but I think this is probably something to do with the 'living human mind' and it's unknown capabilities rather than those that have died. What do you believe in ? If you believe in God and have a strong religious belief then I am very envious of you. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I so wish that I could go back to the days of innocence and total belief.............I blame the history degree! It opened my inquiring mind. I call myself a  Humanist but I wonder if that really is the best description because I believe in the possibility of the supernatural. I think Beauty is the lucky one as she has doesn't need to think about such things. QUESTION Should I have Beauty christened? If there is no point and there isn't a God then surely it doesn't matter to a child that doesn't understand but it would keep 'The Family' happy! Deep thoughts for so early in the morning. I am awake but Beauty is asleep, I find this is the best time to write my blog. In fact, if Beauty is awake there is no other time. Due to computer problems,Beauty has been driving me insane for the last few days. If she is not searching the house for the computer then she is terrorising the video player or trying to hand feed the rabbits!

And you know the phrase I'M GOING TO KNOCK YOUR LIGHTS OUT? Well she literally just did that, she punched the light shade in the lounge and knocked all the lights in the house out.Thankfully they had only tripped! So now she has gone to bed. Today Beauty and I went shopping and contrary to popular belief.......I HATE SHOPPING! First let me make this clear, I go shopping about twice a year to town and that is twice too much!I have to really want something to go to town for it. I prefer to shop in small local shops or places where it is easy to park. But that being said I hate shopping at ASDA Pontprennau which is not only local but easy to park in. And why don't I like it there? Well the list is endless but here is to mention a few. -Supply and demand is a non-existent concept to ASDA, they can run out of staple food products for days! -Clothes may come into the shop in say 2 of each size and when they are sold they get no more stock. -One disabled shopping trolley was broken for 6 months and I reported it broken 3 times. -The car park is full of pot-holes and that is without mentioning customer service! BUT THEY DO SELL LOTS OF EGGS! I go to SHAWS the drapers in Llanrumney for bedding and linens and wool because it is easy to park and close to home,about 5 minutes drive. I buy pig and rabbit food at the ironmongers at Rhydypennau because it is close to home and easy to park and just further up is the fruit and vegetable shop. But I am going to try the farm shop in the Lisvane lanes this week to see what it is like, we tried the one near Marshfield but it was rubbish. Art supplies in The Range on Newport Road and also at WHAT! again because of parking. Blooms the nursery......I could go on but I am sure I am boring you! I may come across as a precious ECO Princess but I promise my choices are purely because I hate large shops. But one large shop I do like is the pumping station at the bottom of Penarth Road which is full of small antique shops and give me a car boot sale where I can look for books and linens and paintings and I am totally happy. Beauty loves the boot sales too as she gets to buy  new  toys!!!!! But today our shopping was confined to nails from Wilkinson's on Colchester Avenue, canvas artboard fromDunhelms on Newport road and fabric and bags and lunch with Sali at IKEA. Oh and last thing we went to B&Q for cup hooks. And that's without me getting started on the joys of internet shopping! Beauty was especially affectionate today and inisted we dance around B&Q, I think she was trying to teach me to Salsa!She held me very close indeed!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sh2iAJqHp-I/AAAAAAAABmc/ryQwgEec9CM/s1600-h/eggs.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sh2xDiEOMVI/AAAAAAAABmk/PcBah0Zys6c/s1600-h/ikea.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/05/shoppingwhats-to-like.html", "title": "\nSHOPPING.....WHAT'S TO LIKE?\n"},

Some older Catholics had \"entrenched attitudes\", while most congregations were more \"liberal-minded\", he added.         Mr Blair, who converted to Catholicism after resigning as UK prime minister in 2007, told the gay magazine Attitude that views had to keep \"evolving\".         But he added that Pope Benedict XVI also stood for \"many fantastic things\".  I really do believe that a persons sexuality has nothing to do with anyone else and also believe that judging somebody because they are homosexual is especially wrong. `Judge not, that ye be not judged` Matthew 7:1 If Christians believe in the Bible then they should adhere to what is being said here and leave other people alone.It is not our business. If there is a God and he wants to judge somebody then that is his/her business not ours. Sadly I do not believe in God but I want to clarify here that I wish with all my heart he/she were true but this doesn`t mean that makes me a bad person and I live a bad life. The life that I lead,trying to be a good, happy person, is not lived that way because I want to please God but because that is just the way I want to live my life. Let`s put my slip into talking about religion down to Easter! Considering that it is the Easter School Holidays the weather yesterday was not too bad with the rain holding off until night time.

{"date": " August 07, 2010", "body": "\n                                       Being the old fashioned,traditional busy body that I am, one of things that I noticed in the USA when we visited last summer was the use of tumble dryers. Whilst I have one, I try never to use mine but the family we stayed with seemed to use theirs constantly and it seemed to be that it was not because they were lazy in any way, it just seemed that this was the cultural norm. There are a number of reasons why I do not use my dryer and the main reason has to be because it is GREEN. However, scratch the surface and I would be the first to admit that I do it because I am MEAN rather than GREEN! Hey, I would rather waste my money on what I want to waste my money on that line the pockets of power companies with their fat bonuses and profits. Living in green and beautiful Wales does not make eco living that easy because one of the main reasons that Wales is so green is because of the RAIN. BUT since making a decision to be more eco-friendly with regards to my laundry, I have more than halved my electricity usage which means more money for me and less for the electricity company. Wherever possible, I put my laundry outside on the washing line to dry and even in winter, if it isn't raining then the washing goes on the line I found that being a visitor in another persons house very difficult because I did not want to use the tumble dryer because I knew how much money it was costing and they thought it was strange that I did not want to use the tumble dryer. I also wanted to do everything myself , washing, cleaning and cooking so I would not be an added burden and to show my gratitude at their hospitality. I also try not to use the tumble dryer because over time it damages clothes. This is the lint taken from the lint trap in my tumble dryer. When I used to dry daily, this was the amount that I would take from the lint trap daily. This amount is from weeks of 5 minute dryings. Now that cannot be good for your clothes. Not using a tumble dryer is something that takes organisation and once you get into the routine of it then it isno more hard work than using a tumble dryer except you save money on electricity and your clothes last longer! If it is not raining then the clothes go on the washing line in the back garden but if it rains then they go on the dryer in the shower room. It was difficult to photograph this room but beyond the dryer where the toilet and shower is it is quite spacious. I usuall finish off the clothes on the iron cycle in the tumble dryer for 5 minutes and then most things do not need ironing.....which of course I love! But then of course there is over the door drying. This is usually reserved for throws. All my sofas etc are covered in throws because Beauty is a mucky pup and these have to be washed weekly.....even in winter. Hence the need for doors! They also take 5 minutes in the dryer but usually these have dried overnight so very little time needed there. I also hang dry things from doors(who doesn't?) SOAKING! I ALWAYS seem to have something soaking of Beauty's in the kitchen Laundry is my LIFE!  I am a proper  MRS RUGGLES! Talking of mucky pups(we were I promise!), APRONS or a pinny as we call them. A 'must have' Beauty otherwise I just would not get the washing clean and it also saves so much washing. Routine has definitely been the answer when it comes to laundry in my house. I have a designated ironing corner and thankfully I have enough room to keep the ironing board up all the time so it is always ready to use. And close by is the ironing basket which is affectionately called the Magic Porridge Pot because it is ALWAYS full. I don't think people realise how much physical work it takes to keep one 9 year old clean and tidy! Then next to the ironing is a wardrobe. YES, I have a wardrobe downstairs and it is a life saver. With the spinal arthritis that I have it has become increasingly painful to be going up and downstairs so the majority of Beauty and my clothes I keep upstairs but our everyday clothes I keep in a wardrobe in the back kitchen and it is wonderful to be able to iron our clothes and put them straight away.It is also wonderful when you have such a messy child to be able to have instant access to clean clothes. That's right, as you can see from the picture ,I have a wardrobe next to my freezer in the kitchen!!!!!! However,some things have to be put away upsairs and this is where it is stored until I go upstairs next. On a table in the hall.                                 I know that a lot of people who read this will think OH IT IS QUICKER IN THE TUMBLE DRYER but I can honestly say from experience that it really isn't and I certainly find that this method produces a lot less ironing. Having Beauty, who has a sincere desire to be dirty all the time, the biggest problem I find with laundry is the constant nature of it. I wonder how my ancestors would have coped with Beauty. On a bad day , the washing machine is going constantly and I only use a short eco-wash! I would like to write more BUT the 9 year old is out of bed and insisting on checking out The Sesame Street site on the computer! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TF5JL9QzgMI/AAAAAAAABys/gzTqkR2EyeA/s1600/washer+woman.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz6XR9lAII/AAAAAAAAByM/_-cBUS9KZTg/s1600/laundry.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz3hxDcuRI/AAAAAAAABx8/R7lGvQwtSHw/s1600/019.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TF0AfF3KPkI/AAAAAAAAByc/3H4C4yxIyIQ/s1600/002.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TF0CMhKchpI/AAAAAAAAByk/Q1aQv-5_xmw/s1600/007.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TF0AfF3KPkI/AAAAAAAAByc/3H4C4yxIyIQ/s1600/002.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz1QK8sntI/AAAAAAAABw8/_p50ktVjHlA/s1600/009.JPG", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_from_One_End_Street", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz2tgcWPdI/AAAAAAAABxk/4Ds5fZ2XfJw/s1600/015.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz2tPO4HeI/AAAAAAAABxc/Xusnn2TAfNg/s1600/014.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz2s5GyahI/AAAAAAAABxU/4Xr2Qc_YMN8/s1600/013.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz1Qg-0txI/AAAAAAAABxE/sqrM8zl_CdU/s1600/010.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz1Q_kU7yI/AAAAAAAABxM/Zlif1XGNPUI/s1600/012.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz2uJwZw6I/AAAAAAAABxs/VzEzn_DvhTU/s1600/016.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz2ubQNd6I/AAAAAAAABx0/oud-dBFhAgo/s1600/018.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TFz2tPO4HeI/AAAAAAAABxc/Xusnn2TAfNg/s1600/014.JPG"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/08/on-being-martha.html", "title": "\nON BEING MARTHA.\n"},

{"date": " July 25, 2010", "body": "\nHere is my little destroying angel, after this evenings reign of destruction and just before bed. I am awake and cannot sleep but so far I am not too concerned as I feel like I slept for three quarters of yesterday and I actually feel so much better for it. Beauty is asleep and even though I am awake,it is not nearly as bad as HAVING to be awake. Here is a picture of Beauty which looks as if she is ready and waiting in the starting blocks, ready for the starter`s gun to be shot so that she can burst forth into more trouble and fun. Which usually means fun for her and trouble for me! As I couldn`t sleep`, I decided to read one of my Creative Writing Text books and one assignment that I found was to write your own version of a famous story.It is hardly on the level of Ten Things I Hate About You but as The Three Bears is one of Beauty`s Favourites, I thought that I would have a go at re-writing that. Each time that I tell Beauty the story it changes slightly and she seems to like that so here goes. Goldilocks And The Three Bears. Once upon a time there were 3 bears who lived in a nice house in a nice town and baby bear went to a nice school. Daddy bear worked for the civil service and used his flexi-time so that Mummy bear could stay in bed in the morning whilst Daddy bear took Baby bear to school because if Daddy bear left it to Mummy bear then Baby bear would get to school without having had breakfast and Mummy bear would still be in her PJ`s. One Saturday morning, at about 11am when Mummy bear was making the porridge for breakfast( she hadn`t long got up), Daddy bear suggested that they go for a walk whilst the porridge cooled down. Daddy`s real motive however was not for the porridge to cool down but he hoped that if they went for a walk then there was always the possibility that the house might get broken in to and the porridge stolen as Mummy was not very good at making porridge! It usually ended up black and crunchy and smelling like toffee which Baby bear didn`t mind so much as he quite liked toffee but Daddy was different. He went to church every Sunday and really believed that one day his prayers would be answered with regards to the porridge which was that someone would steal it or a house fairy would get lost and end up in their house and throw it in the bin! So off they went for a walk, well they got as far as the car and Daddy bear said \u201c LETS GO FOR A DRIVE INSTEAD\u201d. So they all piled in the car and that is what hey did. And whilst they were out, guess who should come along but\u2026..The Postman! And then came the Gas man and finally just when the poor house thought it was going to get a moments peace, who should come along but Goldilocks. Though why a child under the age of 10 was out wandering on her own has always been a concern to me\u2026..did her parents know where she was or did they even care! Mmmm\u2026..worrying! Anyway, back to the story. Goldilocks knocked on the door but there was no answer and so she knocked again but there was still no answer and the third time when there was no answer she thought TO HECK WITH THIS and tried the door handle and lo and behold it was open and in she went. I am sorry but I think that this is a case for Supernanny, this child is wandering here there and everywhere and going in other peoples houses as she pleases. I think Goldilocks mummy needs a good slap. On entering the house , Goldilocks found herself in the kitchen and there on the table she found 3 bowls of porridge. And she sat down and started to eat them! Lets see, wandering trespassing and now stealing by consumption! Though I am sure Goldilocks didn`t see it that way. First she tried Daddy bears porridge but that had too many black bits in it and Mummy bears bowl didn`t have much in it at all as she was on a diet but Baby bears porridge was perfect so Goldilocks ate it all up. Feeling tired, Goldilocks decided to sit down but she thought Daddy bears chair smelt like and old dog or bear so she thought NOT A CHANCE! Then Mummy bears was not much better as it was a Kartell Louis Ghost Chair and Goldilocks thought that it looked too uncomfortable to sit on so she tried Baby bears chair which was a small wooden rocking chair which turned out to be very comfortable. So she rocked and rocked and she rocked until she broke it and thinking Ooops! She went up stairs without a second thought. So now we have wandering, trespass, stealing by consumption and finally vandalism! So totally unaware of having done anything wrong(sounds like a bit of a sociopath to me) Goldilocks went upstairs and thought A LITTLE REST WOULD BE GOOD. So first of all she went to try Daddy bears bed but again it smelt of wet dog or old bear so she thought NO! And Mummy bears bed was a water bed and again Goldilocks thought NO, I GET SEA SICK! So she took one look at Baby bears bed and thought PERFECT(nothing exciting, just a nice ordinary divan!). Jumped on and fell asleep immediately. And whilst she was asleep who should come back but The Three Bears, Grumpy Daddy bear(they had stopped at the shop for some milk and run into Brian from work who had proceed to tell him , quoting evidence, WHY milk was not good for him!), Pj wearing Mummy Bear and very hungry Baby bear. On seeing the door open ,Daddy thought OH YES, MY PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED AND THE PORRIDGE HAS BEEN STOLEN but was very disappointed to see that his porridge was untouched and so was Mummy bears porridge BUT Baby bears porridge was all gone and Baby bear was very sad and not a little hungry! And then Baby bear noticed his chair was broken and started to cry but daddy bear couldn`t understand why someone had not sat in his chair especially as it smelt so nice. And as for Mummy bear, she was just grateful that someone had not sat in her a Kartell Louis Ghost Chair and went straight away to get the polish and duster to make sure it was still clean and sparkling! So Daddy Bear suggested that they go and check out the rest of the house which they did. And yet again Daddy bear was surprised that nobody had tried sleeping in his sweetly smelling bed and Mummy bear was relieved that nobody had tried her water bed \u2026..CHEEK IF THEY HAD she thought! But Baby bear who was still crying said \u201cSOMEONES BEEN SLEEPING IN MY BED AND THEY ARE STILL THERE\u201c! And they all looked to Baby bears bed and there was Goldilocks, fast asleep. But Baby bear was not too pleased and stomped to the bed and gave Goldilocks a shove and woke her up. Goldilocks sat up in shock and Baby bear struck a pose and shouted \u201dI KNOW KUNG FU\u201c! To which Goldilocks replied \u201cYOU HAVE SO GOT TO BE A FEW FRIES SHORT OF A HAPPY MEAL\u201d as she picked up Baby bear and deposited on top of the wardrobe as she jumped out of the window and ran all the way home! AND THE MORAL OF THE STORY should be to respect the privacy and property of others but if you are a petty thief then just take what you can carry and leave because if you stay and sleep you will get caught. And remember Goldilocks and The Three Bears is a fairy story because if you mess with the bears stuff and eat their food and sleep in their bed THEY WILL EAT YOU. Goldilocks was LUCKY!

I was meant to got to University with regards to my dissertation yesterday evening but puking over a tutor is  NEVER  a good idea! However, what I did manage to do was take Fiona to University and install her in her new halls of residence  T\u0177 Pont Haearn . Fiona is about to start a degree in Fashion at The  Atrium  in Cardiff. It was oddly moving in a way that it hadn't been with any of her sisters when I took Fiona to University. When I took Anastasia I was very pregnant with Beauty and that had been quite emotional but in a different way.Anastasia had worked the summer as an au pair in Cornwall and the first empty nesting pains had happened then, so by the time she went to the  University of Bath   she was really looking forward to it. Definitely no leaving home for the first time tears! Belle was confident and bubbly about her going to uni and HEY......it was in   Swansea ! Well known territory. Snowhite was and is a  Boomerang child   and will never be too far from home for too long.As she did a foundation year in Art at   UWIC  she did not leave home and then in her first year she went into a privately rented house. Totally different ball game. And when Snowhite started her second degree!!!!!!!.......well she knew the  University of Newport  quite well because she had studied in the library whist doing her A levels when I had done my Masters degree. Ariel, well what can I say? Ariel had spent lots of time away from home due to school trips, Army Cadet trips and Language School in Geneva one summer and she went into fully-catered Holland Hall at   Exeter University   so it felt like one more adventure and she was thrilled to be there. But Fiona, whilst she would not think it was any different , for me it is Fiona was my baby for 9 years until Beauty was born after I married again.She will always be her Dad's baby of course!!!! Fiona at 19 seems oddly grown up compared to the other girls I saw moving in and at 19 she is 'oddly' more mature than her sister Ariel! Ariel admits this herself. I write snatches of thought, sometimes poetry, all the time, in little notebooks scattered around my life. I wrote this whilst Fiona was moving her things into her university residence. My baby leaves home not for foreign climes another chapter closes we have done this five times. And as for Beauty.... who knows what course her life will take! Perhaps that is why it feels so different! Here I am with Beauty who is profoundly autistic and I have no way of knowing what the future will bring for her. Beauty received a provisional diagnosis at an exceptionally early age, she was 9 months old and she received a full diagnosis from Professor Fraser when she was approximately 22 months. And the worst bit for me was the fact that I didn't even notice that she had a problem of any kind. She was referred to the consultant by a doctor who had noticed problems when she failed her hearing tests a number of times. My beautiful, lovely girl had problems and I had not noticed a thing. She was 9 months old and I was a nurse and the mother of 5 normally developing girls and had not noticed a thing. A few of days ago it all came to a head when I took Beauty to run in the Cardiff 2K.Many people, adults and children were staring at her because she was different and it really upset me. I wrote this the following day. Winter came early that year No autumn winds  Blew the last  Smells of summer Across lawns dancing  With golden lights on Gluttering leaves. And no Indian summer Sun shone it's last Rays of sunshine On little children Playing in the dried Grass of the last  Lawn cuts of summer. But only cold winds blew And rains fell, And bleakness  Was all around And it encompassed me. AJWH The last 9 years have been a journey of discovery for me. A spiritual journey to find my own answers and my own way. I am a more spiritual person than I was when I joined the church 34 years ago yet I still do not have the answers. Though I would confess to my life experiences having made me a deeper, more spiritual person(not religious though!!!) . But hey...who isn't going to become more inwardly reflective when you lose a baby and then you are widowed and lose both your parents within 18 months. I would love to believe in a God and a next life and being with my family in an eternal heaven but my mind says  NO  and will just not let me believe it. So my only other option is to be true to myself and live a life the best I can and hope that if there turns out to be a God then he will be a kind God who will say to me that even though I did not live a life worshipping him,I still lived a good life. And for that I will be blessed. In the book   The Last Battle by C S Lewis   , Lewis writes at the end of the story 'Aslan appears, and as they watch at the stable door, all of the people and animals, including those who had previously died, gather outside the barn and are judged by Aslan. Those who have been loyal to Aslan or the morality upheld by Narnians join Aslan in Aslan's Country.' And there is a Calormen soldier who is also blessed but he does not understand why Aslan blesses him because as he declares he has worshipped Tash all his days. However, Aslan explains that whilst he served another , he led a good life and it was as if he served him and so he would be blessed. So that is my hope,if there is a God  then he will be equally as kind . \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%B7_Pont_Haearn", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TJGWYnUN93I/AAAAAAAABz8/s58Tw0YLdeQ/s1600/anna+uni.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TJGi5f5Pg5I/AAAAAAAAB0E/2LjTGJN5liM/s1600/uni+glam.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TJGWYnUN93I/AAAAAAAABz8/s58Tw0YLdeQ/s1600/anna+uni.jpg", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium,_Cardiff", "http://http//www.bath.ac.uk/", "http://http//www.swan.ac.uk/", "http://boomerang%20kids/", "http://http//www3.uwic.ac.uk/English/Pages/home2.aspx", "http://http//www.newport.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx", "http://http//www.exeter.ac.uk/", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Battle"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/09/another-chapter-closes.html", "title": "\nANOTHER CHAPTER CLOSES.\n"},

{"date": " December 28, 2010", "body": "\n Don't get me wrong when I say I am using VERY STRONG painkillers, I feel a lot better that I have in ages. The painkillers are really helping with the pain and the side effect is that I am not feeling so down because the pain is better regulated. I was given enough to take three lots a day(enough to be seeing and kissing Pixies!) but after the first day, I am finding that two lots a day controls the pain and I don't feel the desire to be going dancing and singing naked in the street! Three lots a day was definitely too much. And I am not taking the Diazepam!!! I managed to take Sali and Anna shopping in town on Boxing day and whilst I could feel the pressure in my back increasing there was no increase in pain. However, the painkillers do wear off in the night and I do feel as if I have been kicked in the back by a donkey and walking first thing is not an option! I visited the doctor on the Wednesday before Christmas and she was able to tell me the results of the MRI as her computer is linked to the hospital computer. I have 9 inches of damage/severe arthritis and 3 Torn Spinal Discs......so not much really! As you can see, my sense of humour is still intact even if my back isn't! So no more 10k runs in the foreseeable future! But for Christmas I had a new laptop so I do not have to sit at the computer table but can lie down in bed and rest my back AND still go on the computer and right my blog. We had a lovely Christmas though. Whilst my back was in a lot less pain, Snowhite and Fiona still cooked the Christmas lunch. Snowhite doing Christmas baking :D The Chocolate Christmas Puddings that Fiona made :D The only thing not as I would have made it was the broccoli which was a little(a lot!) al dente but then I do prefer it cooked to mush.Yes I can hear you all saying YUK! Beauty decided to have a long lie in and so none of us got up until gone 10am and then lunch was not until 3pm but we had a very restful but enjoyable day. Opening my Christmas Stocking x Something I read on Paulo Coelho's Facebook page today If I had my life to live over, I would try to make more mistakes. I would relax. I know of very few things that I would take seriously. I would go more places. I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers. I would eat more ice cream and less bran. I would have more actual troubles and fewer imaginary troubles. You see, I have been one of those fellows who live prudently and sanely, hour after hour, day after day. Oh, I have had my moments. But if I had it to do over again, I would have more of them \u2013 a lot more. I never go anywhere without a thermometer, a gargle, a raincoat and a parachute. If I had it to do over, I would travel lighter. If I had my life to live over, I would pay less attention to people telling us we must learn Latin or History; otherwise we will be disgraced and ruined and flunked and failed. I would seek out more teachers who inspire relaxation and fun. If I had my life to live over, I would start barefooted a little earlier in the spring and stay that way a little later in the fall. I would shoot more paper wads at my teachers. I would keep later hours. I\u2019d have more sweethearts. I would go to more circuses. I would be carefree as long as I could, or at least until I got some care- instead of having my cares in advance. I doubt, however, that I\u2019ll do much damage with my creed. The opposition is too strong. There are too many serious people trying to get everybody else to be too darned serious. (there are several versions of this text circulating in Internet.

{"date": " June 01, 2011", "body": "\n I once taught manual handling to carers in a nursing home and one of the carers said,'no matter what you teach us,I will do what I like when I am on my own'. How do you deal with that kind of mentality ? 1 June 2011 A pattern of abuse at a residential hospital uncovered by BBC Panorama has been condemned as \"shocking\" by the government. It comes after Bristol police arrested and later bailed four people over the treatment of patients with learning difficulties at Winterbourne View. Care Services Minister Paul Burstow said he was determined to strengthen safeguards for vulnerable adults. NHS South West said it had been \"appalled\" by the issues raised. The hospital's owners, Castlebeck, have apologised and suspended 13 employees. There can be no place for such inhumanity in care services. \u201d Paul Burstow Care services minister During five weeks spent filming undercover, Panorama's reporter captured footage of some of the hospital's most vulnerable patients being repeatedly pinned down, slapped, dragged into showers while fully clothed, taunted and teased. Mr Burstow said: \"The abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View uncovered by Panorama is shocking. There can be no place for such inhumanity in care services. \"There have been failures of inspection and adult protection which have exposed people to appalling abuse. \"I am determined to strengthen the system of safeguarding to protect vulnerable adults from abuse.\" Avon and Somerset police confirmed three men - aged 42, 30 and 25 - and a 24-year-old woman were arrested as part of their investigation into the hospital. Mr Burstow said he had already ordered \"a thorough examination of the roles of both\" government regulato, the Care Quality Commission, and the local authorities. Secret filming caught patients being dragged and slapped by support workers NHS South West said it was \"appalled\" by the issues raised surrounding the care home. In a statement, it said: \"We always expect safe, high-quality care from providers of services and the abuse of vulnerable patients is totally unacceptable.\" Warnings ignored The programme decided to film secretly after being approached by a former senior nurse at the hospital who was deeply concerned about the behaviour of some of the support workers there \"I have seen a lot over 35 years but this I have never seen anything like this. It is the worst I have seen,\" former nurse Terry Bryan told the programme. Mr Bryan reported his concerns to both management at Winterbourne View and to the CQC, but his complaint was not taken up. In a statement, the CQC said that, following an internal review, it recognised that \"there were indications of problems at this hospital which should have led to us taking action sooner\". The CQC says it was alerted to the allegations on 12 May 2011 by Panorama reporter Paul Kenyon and carried out unannounced inspections on 17, 18 and 24 May. Joe Casey said filming the abuse was the hardest thing he'd done There is currently a team from the local mental health primary care trust at Winterbourne View and the CQC is in touch with them and going in regularly for informal visits. It said that, in response to the Panorama film, it had carried out three unannounced inspection visits of the hospital and taken steps to ensure it will not admit any new patients. It had also written to Mr Burstow proposing the launch of a programme of risk-based and random unannounced inspections of a sample of the 150 hospitals providing care for people with learning disabilities, a move which the minister backed. Patients moved Castlebeck has launched an internal investigation into their whistle-blower procedures and are reviewing the records of all 580 patients in 56 facilities. Winterbourne View can accommodate 24 patients and is taxpayer-funded, charging the state an average of \u00a33,500 per patient per week. NHS South West said: \"Following initial checks, and a subsequent inspection by the CQC it has been agreed that patients should move to alternative facilities at the earliest opportunity.\" It said: \"Primary care trusts in the South West which commissioned placements at the unit have carried out an urgent review of the processes used to commission and review privately provided services. The outcome will be fed into the wider multi-agency safeguarding review.\" From the BBC website.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2011/06/panorama-bbc-undercover-care-3152011.html", "title": "\nPanorama BBC Undercover Care (31/5/2011) Part 1\n"},
{"date": " June 19, 2011", "body": "\nAnd that secret is.......I iron my Tea Towels! When I have had visitors, some have noticed that I iron my Tea Towels and they then proceed to fall about laughing. They have told me that is the last thing they iron BUT if there was only one thing that I iron it would be my Tea Towels. I am not OCD, my children can confirm that but I do believe in avoiding unnecessary infection. I also am not the kind of mother who believes in keeping their children all safely wrapped up and not allowed to get wet and dirty. Beauty is a champion puddle-jumper and will pick the most disgusting things up of the floor and put them in their mouth :) I once worked at a traveller/gypsy clinic and in the depths of winter,when there was frost on the ground, I saw children running around without shoes and socks and they seemed pretty healthy children. I use a dishwasher because it uses less water and hotter water than hand washing and I quite regularly bleach, soak and boil and iron my tea towels. Beauty and I had MRSA when she was approximately 10 days old and I think this is probably one of the main reasons I make an effort with food and dishes cleanliness. Also, Beauty's autism makes her totally unaware of the need for personal hygiene (she is yuk!!!!!) and I use many cloths a day to wipe her hands and face and the table too. Most cloths are usually only used once. I Googled ironing Tea Towels and the results seemed to be a half way split between those who DO & those who DON'T . The following is one of the many who feel the same way as I do. The following is from somebody who works inn the catering industry and I have to admit that most are not as fastidious as her. I worked as a waitress part-time for over 22 years and most restaurant kitchens are not a pretty sight! From Yahoo answers Best Answer - Chosen by Asker Firstly buy good quality tea towels - old fashioned white glass cloths are the best as they can with stand all washing, even bleach if needed. Colourful pretty ones are not great as dyes can run in hot washes. Secondly the way you handle your tea towels has to be to ensure that you are keeping any bacterial growth to a safe level. This is why you hang up them to dry after using them as damp conditions are ideal breeding grounds for bacteria. If you wash by hand then you do need to use a fresh one at least every day. I use a dishwasher and use one a week! but rarely dry anything with it so it never gets damp and will pickup very little bacteria. If changing everyday I would still hang the tea towel to dry at the end of the day, but in the morning put out a clean one putting the previous days \"down for washing\" then do a hot (at least 60'C) wash once a week. If you buy the white \"stockinette\" dish clothes then do the same with these - a fresh one every day. So hot wash (on their own and certainly never with any clothing), and make sure you dry them quickly removing them from the machine as soon after washing as you can.  Once dry IRON them even if this is the only thing you ever iron do it as it sterilises the cloths . Hot wash + Iron = Safe Bacterial levels When washing use Biological POWDER. The biological action breaks down proteins such as will be picked up from food and powder (with the exception of powder to wash colours) contains a bleaching agent which you don't get with liquids - compare Persil Biological Powder with Persil Biological Liquid next time you are in the supermarket! Follow this and you will have beautiful spotless tea towels but more importantly safe!! If you go through a lot of tea towels and dishcloths then you can do what I do at work. All cloths are never carried from one day to the next - fresh for each day. At the end of the day I soak the cloths (and oven cloths/gloves) in a solution of biological soap powder and COLD water in a STAINLESS STEEL pot (don't use aluminium as the detergent will break this down and the cloths don't come out to clean, enamel pans will work but the enamel eventually corrodes). I leave these soaking all night and then in the morning put the pot on a very low heat and leave it to gradually come up to boil temperature but don't actually let it boil (if you do you end up burning the dirty water which goes a horrible smelly brown that stains the cloths!), giving it an occasional stir I leave them on the low heat for 4-5hours. I then put the pot in the sink and run the cold water through it agitating with my hand. Then give them a final rinse under the hot tap, hand ring and hang up to dry. I then refill the pan with soap powder and cold water and then just add that days dirty cloths one at a time making sure by end of the day all cloths have been put in to soak.

{"date": " June 01, 2011", "body": "\nHow can an autistic 18 year old stand trial in a court of law. Anyone else think  that this young man has been let down and failed by a society that was meant to care for him? And do they really think that 2 years in prison is a fair or sensible action to take ? \"Latson to serve two years instead of 10-plus STAFFORD \u2014 An autistic teenager from Stafford whose case drew national attention was sentenced to two years in prison Tuesday instead of the 10-and-a-half the jury recommended. Reginald \u201cNeli\u201d Latson had eight-and-a-half years of his time suspended in Stafford County Circuit Court, leaving him with two, according to Judge Charles Sharp, who said that the time he already has served \u2014 about a year \u2014 will count toward his sentence. Latson mostly kept his head down low while seated and when responding to Judge Sharp he was barely audible in the full but small courtroom. The 19-year-old was convicted by a jury in March and ordered to serve 10-and-a-half years in prison for an altercation that took place against a school resource officer in May of last year. At the time, he had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Several people were called to testify Tuesday including Latson\u2019s former middle school wrestling coach David Emison; and Vicki McCarthy, a licensed therapist who works in Fredericksburg \u2014 she met Latson when he was in middle school. The prosecution team, led by Stafford prosecutor Jim Peterson, played a 911 tape from an incident in the spring of 2008 when Latson\u2019s mother Lisa Alexander called the police and wanted her son removed from her home due to his being violent. She told police her son was cursing at them all day, behaving violently and \u201cneeds to get out of the house.\u201d The prosecution also noted in court that Latson has hit other children and exposed himself to them. McCarthy, when called to testify, described Latson as very shy. She said she met him just after he had been diagnosed with an autism disorder. He had earlier been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, she said. \u201cI think he needs a lot more support than the prison system can offer him,\u201d said McCarthy. \u2026 \u201cI was horrified at what happened to Deputy Calverley. \u2026Our community lost on both ends. I would like to see [Latson] get the help he needs.\u201d On May 24 last year, Latson scuffled with Calverley after the school resource officer approached him, police said. That day, a call came in to the Stafford County Sheriff\u2019s Office from an adult at Park Ridge Elementary School at about 8:30 a.m. The caller reported a \u201csuspicious\u201d man sitting in a grassy area near Porter Library. Some confusion about whether there was a gun or not came about, but the man in question did not have a gun, police determined. Meanwhile, local schools were put on lockdown. The school resource officer reportedly administered pepper spray, but Latson gained control and sprayed Calverley in return. Calverley suffered a head laceration, cuts, abrasions and a broken ankle. Latson was later convicted of assault on a law enforcement officer and wounding in the commission of a felony, according to court records. He was also convicted of disarming a police officer and obstruction of justice. McCarthy described some of Latson\u2019s idiosyncrasies such as carrying a key around his neck, carrying three playing cards, often wearing a hoodie, repeating television and movie lines out of nowhere and carrying string that he runs through his fingers. She said he had an aversion to strong odors. Emison, when testifying, spoke about Latson\u2019s earlier athletic talent. The coach said he didn\u2019t have problems with Latson on the team. The defense, led by William Reichhardt, asked Emison, \u201cKnowing what you know today [about Latson] would you still want him on your wrestling team?\u201d Emison, who coached Latson at A.G.

And the youngest Beauty, if she ever develops to the stage of doing a degree it will DEFINITELY be something to do with computers and Disney :) And if you were to ask me for advice as what degree is best for your child to do,I would have to say as far as the parent is concerned..........Language based subjects ALL THE WAY ! It took 1 car load to move Anastasia,Belle and Ariel from their university halls of residence whilst Snowhite and FIona, my art based students ,the amount of stuff they own seems never ending!(Though I have to say that Snowhite has downsized hugely). I just helped Fiona move from halls of residence to a student house and it took me 4 car loads! One of Fiona's sisters was heard to comment, 'Next time Fiona moves,she is renting a van AND I'll pay for it'. So my advice is,if your child has leanings towards being the next Picasso, make sure you teach them to drive as early as possible so when they go to university they can move themselves! \n Oh and don't forget, when they finish the university year and they have moved ALL their stuff, you will still be requested to help with the piles of washing they\u00a0 have accumulated through the year NO MATTER WHAT SUBJECT THEY STUDIED :) \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YrPyGQB1rLw/ThW24wcAUnI/AAAAAAAACDo/QPl-pWVGqxA/s1600/005.JPG"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-degree-subject-is-best-for-your.html", "title": "\nWHAT DEGREE SUBJECT IS BEST FOR YOUR CHILD :)\n"},

Nor did his mother, Marianne Bailey, for whom thousands of disrupted nights unsurprisingly resulted in chronic exhaustion.\n\n\"He'd wake throughout the night, so we could be up from two or three times up to 12 times,\" explains Bailey. \"I'm a light sleeper so I'd hear him and would be the one who got up. Jacob would be rocking, moaning and knocking his head on the bed. I tried asking the health visitor when he was two or three, and tried various things, even leaving him for two or three hours, but nothing worked. He'd only stop when I'd go in.\"\n\nThe reason for the sleeplessness is that Jacob is severely autistic. It has become increasingly apparent that one of the problems suffered by children with autistic spectrum disorders is a lack of ability to sleep.\n\n\nJacob needed his mother to be close by to calm him down after waking in the night, and so Bailey ended up having to share a bed with her son throughout his childhood.\n\nBy the time he was 12, though, this was starting to feel inappropriate, she explains. It was at this point that his special school, Inscape House in south Manchester, part of the Together Trust, was able to suggest a way forward.\n\nHaving heard about work done by an organisation called Sleep Scotland in teaching children sleep techniques, five years ago a group of specialist teachers from Inscape House decided to train as sleep counsellors.\n\nThe disturbed sleep patterns experienced by autistic children had become increasingly apparent to teachers working in the school, says Christine Hoyle. Their shattered and drained families were desperate for help, but often thought that disrupted sleep was just part and parcel of their child's diagnosis. This, she says, need not be the case.\n\nThe hope was that intensive support could be offered in methods of helping children get to sleep, and then stay asleep, that was tailored to their individual needs.\n\n\"Because of the nature of autism, children might have erratic and prolonged settling down routines such having to go up and down stairs a certain number of times, or they might have to repeatedly check on their family. They may wake frequently or they might be very sensitive to light and sound,\" Hoyle explains. \"Every child's situation will be different.\"\n\nClearly it's no fun for anyone to be constantly tired, but the long-term effects are much more destructive than simply feeling a bit weary.\n\nParents of autistic children find, says Hoyle, that being deprived of sleep over long periods greatly affects their ability to cope with the other challenging behaviours they are presented with. They also state that lack of sleep is one of their worst causes of stress.\n\nFrom the child's point of view, sleep is crucial for learning and development. \"It's when we're asleep that learning is consolidated, so it is vital that children learn to sleep well,\" Hoyle explains. \"If they experience sleeplessness over a prolonged period, it's going to impact on their ability to learn.\"\n\nSteve Tyler, principal of Inscape House, notes that some traits that make life particularly difficult for autistic children can be exacerbated when they are not properly rested. \"There's irritability: people with autism \u2013 particularly our young people with severe needs \u2013 find interaction difficult anyway,\" he says. Sleep deprivation makes interpreting the nuances of social relationships even harder for them, and frustration can ensue.\n\nThe Sleep Clinic piloted by Inscape House five years ago now works closely with parents of children at the school \u2013 and increasingly at other special schools and mainstream schools in the north-west. If a child is referred, counsellors will interview their parents to gain a detailed understanding of the sleep and bedtime patterns that have emerged over the years, and then guide them to make small, gradual adjustments over many weeks and months.\n\nRecalling the start of the sleep programme that was instigated for Jacob, Bailey says:  \" One thing we did was to get rid of the double bed so that Mummy couldn't get in.\" \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 She still had to be in her son's room, and initially sat with him on the single bed until he went to sleep. She then moved to an armchair by the bed, then moved the armchair across the room, then shifted it to outside his door. Moving the chair around a corner so it was out of sight was a big step; it was then placed at the top of the stairs, and finally, she was able to go downstairs, though had to stay within calling distance. \n \n\nThis process took many months, not just a few nights. And Jacob would still wake up moaning, at which point his mum had to begin the process of sitting with him all over again. A second idea was to give Jacob cues about his bedtime routine that he could refer back to. Because he can't read, a picture story illustrating the routine of what happened at bedtime was stuck on his bedroom wall.\n\n\"It's a story with very simple words,\" says Bailey. \"Now Jacob is older, he will go to sleep on his own; he will pull his duvet up \u2026 I'd say it almost as a mantra, and he'd eventually say it with me.\"\n\n Sticking to a firm routine is the key, says Hoyle,  once the family and sleep counsellor have worked out a plan that takes account of the child's particular sleep problems. But parents are likely to need patience, persistence and enormous commitment in order to see results.\n\nIt took about a year for the various techniques used to take effect, says Bailey.  Jacob still wakes most nights, but is now able to settle if he can hear her calling to him to go to sleep.\n\n \"I have had odd nights where he has slept through, and that's fantastic,\" says Bailey. \"It's not a complete cure, at least it's not been for us, but it's an improvement. And I am a bit less tired, because to have a night's sleep is lovely.\"\n\n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2012/05/it-seems-i-am-not-alone-autism-and-lack.html", "title": "\nIT SEEMS I AM NOT ALONE Autism and Lack of Sleep\n"},

{"date": " June 20, 2011", "body": "\n 'You pay peanuts, you get monkeys' as the saying goes. I know people who are working in care homes and the wage is usually basic rate, not enough to feed a family on and because of this the turnover in care staff is high and quality of care cannot be maintained in some care homes. If the staff were better paid, taught and regulated then perhaps there may be an improvement in the provision of care. But these are private businesses looking to make a profit so the moment the staff find a better paid job they move on. I watched the film and from the first few seconds of filming I could pick out those who were not suitable to work in that environment. So it is not just the carers who should be found guilty of abuse but the people who employed them.  The whole of the Castlebeck company needs to be investigated. 20 June 2011 Winterbourne View Panorama 'abuse' hospital to close Castlebeck will close Winterbourne View on Friday 24 June Related Stories Parents 'feel sick' over 'abuse' 'Abuse' film nurses are suspended Care home serious review date set A residential hospital for vulnerable adults near Bristol where alleged abuse was secretly filmed by the BBC Panorama programme is to close on Friday. Castlebeck, which runs Winterbourne View, said the hospital would close on 24 June when the last patients would be transferred to alternative services. Patients at the unit were filmed by an undercover reporter posing as a care worker The footage showed residents being pinned down, slapped and taunted. A spokesman for Castlebeck said the company had been working closely with families and carers, the NHS and social services \"to ensure patients are safely transferred with minimum disruption to their lives\". After the programme was broadcast Castlebeck apologised and launched an internal investigation. A number of people have been questioned by police and released on bail following the programme and the government said it would carry out its own review of what happened. A serious case review into the alleged abuse at the residential hospital has been set for July. 'Future untenable' Jack Lopresti, the local Conservative MP, said he had met Lee Reed, the chief executive of Castlebeck, earlier in the day. Mr Lopresti said: \"Mr Reed gave me his assurances that the closure of the hospital will be conducted in as sensitive a way as possible. \"I stand by my call for the hospital's closure and I am pleased that Castlebeck have come to the same conclusion. \"Given the horrific events which have taken place at Winterbourne View I believe its future running is untenable.\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vCG8EuHHRts/Tf-UQI9Wp4I/AAAAAAAACCk/gJ2ZSMR8CsQ/s1600/winterbourne%2Bview.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2011/06/about-bloody-time.html", "title": "\nABOUT BLOODY TIME!\n"},

She loves to repeat everything she hears, usually as she hears it so I try never to swear in front of her! She also loves to impersonate people that she sees on TV or in cartoons or in films. She is word perfect\u00a0at repeating Disney films. This morning as Missy and I were eating\u00a0our breakfast I was also taking my daily medication. I was eating toast and so I took out my medication and placed it on the same plate as my toast. I always like to take my medication whilst I am eating and drinking so that it goes down more easily and does not upset my stomach. However, this morning , the moment I put the medication into my mouth I could tell that something was wrong. I could feel something on my tongue extra to the medication. So being a true lady and nurse of course ,\u00a0I spat out everything in my mouth onto my plate. I was really pleased to find that the extra piece of whatever in my mouth was actually a part of the crust of the toast that I was eating. Phew! However ,\u00a0my relief was short lived. There is no guile with Missy, her brain is very straightforward. It was as if I could see the cogs in her brain turning over and what she had just witnessed with me spitting out my medication onto the plate was being stored for future reference and use. I could just imagine it, the next time we were out in a cafe or restaurant and she was eating something she was not quite sure of it would certainly happen. The contents of her mouth would be unceremoniously spat out all over her plate and all over\u00a0the table and in public view for everyone to see. And I would have to lie and say to all the people who were there\u00a0watching looking very appalled , and say, 'it\u00a0must've been something she saw in school' !!!!! A bit of \u00a0rationalisation here because I'm sure she must have witnessed it in school before but I'm not likely to be saying in public that\u00a0she saw me spitting out my food all over the table and she is\u00a0just copying so\u00a0she's not really bad mannered.

{"date": " May 19, 2011", "body": "\nTonight Beauty and I baked. We made these beautiful cupcakes and almost all of the mixing was done by Beauty. And even if I say so myself, I think they look fantastic :) But ........when you eat one you will find that not everything is as it seems . When making them I used very low fat margarine and ordinary sugar. I used these because that was all we had in the house and I didn't want to go out as my back was hurting and I thought,'what the heck, they should be ok'. And when you eat them they taste delicious but because of the margarine being so low fat and the ordinary sugar not being as fine as caster sugar, it tastes crunchy and chewy. Under ordinary circumstances I would have just kept them and eaten them but these were cakes that Beauty made and she knew that we were taking them to school and  BEAUTY   had made them. She had made them knowing that they were for a Social Studies Project about weddings and she made them especially for her teachers and friends. So as well as Beauty, the cupcakes will also be going to school tomorrow :) Whilst whisking the cakes, Beauty insisted on covering her ears because she doesn't like the whisking noise. She also doesn't like the noise of the assembly in school in the mornings as the loud noise upsets her. She also dislikes the sound of hand dryers in toilets because the noise scares her and when she hears a baby cry she thinks a baby needs its nappy changed and she wants me to do it. This kind of behaviour makes it very obvious that Beauty is different and has some kind of problem. But being different doesn't mean she doesn't have the right to be who she is and accepted for that. On many, many occasions I have been out with Beauty and I cannot get over the amount of people who just stand and stare at Beauty as if she is a freak. All age groups. When I find adults doing it I will stop and stare at the adult and wait for them to realise that I am looking at them and they become embarrassed an turn away. But some do not and my next action is to ask them,' Can I help you, is something wrong'. as of yet I have not had one person reply to my question, they almost always walk away embarrassed. I am easier on children,when they are staring I usually say ,' Hello, how are you ?' and they also will almost always walk away without saying anything. However, what I have noticed is that the staring is done by more people who appear to be of a lower social class. People I would believe to be of a higher social class, adults and children have not stared at Beauty in this kind of way or not that I have noticed. But there is also the question, is it class that defines the behaviour or their intelligence. I am sure that there are many working class people who would never stare and would never dream of doing something so bad mannered. And there are probably people in higher social classes who have very bad manners and would also stare, it is just I have not come across them yet. I was brought up in a council house which means I was brought up in a lower social class home but I taught my children not to stare as it would be hurtful to the person they were staring at. That brings up another question.....Is the bad behaviour learned ? In many cases I think it is. Before Beauty went to school I was asked to look at main stream schools which I did. One nursery teacher in charge of a nursery unit ( a qualified teacher) said that she did not think it was a good idea for Beauty to go to her nursery unit as she thought Beauty would upset the children and the children would not understand. She also said the parents also might not be happy having Beauty there. Well what can you say to that kind of prejudice ? How will children ever learn to accept people who are different and learn to live with them and accept them if ignorant adults are not a good example ? Beauty is a lovely young girl, on the inside and outside. Just because Beauty stims a lot, because she is so happy she laughs and chats to herself a lot,just because she is behaves differently to other people doesn't give others the right to judge her. I have been reading a blog recently where a father who has 3 children who are autistic writes about his and their lives. He was told by one reader that his children did not have the right to live and he should not have had more children when he found out the first was autistic but at least when they found out the second was also autistic they should have stopped having children. This person felt very strongly about the situation and saw the children as being a drain on society. Whilst others were not as forceful in their beliefs, they did make it known without being as aggressive that they had similar feelings. I was personally shocked that people should feel the need to say things like this. I have a question. People look at Beauty and see her as disabled. As not normal. As different. As quoted in the case above, people with disabilities should not exist. But who is to say she is different? Who is to say she is not normal? I read the book  The Chrysalids  by John Wyndham when I was about 10 and have never forgotten it 'The Chrysalids is set in the future - many years after a nuclear war has devastated much of the world. Waknuk, in Labrador, has survived, but it has been reduced to a primitive agricultural society struggling to return to the level of civilization that the \u201cOld People\u201d had enjoyed. Radiation from the war has left much of the land useless and is still causing mutations in plants, animals, and humans. The people in Waknuk, however, are unaware of the true cause of the deviations. Instead, they believe these deviations are a punishment sent from God. As a result, they follow a strict religious code that demands that a plant or animal born with any type of imperfection be destroyed. Human deviations are exiled to the Fringes, a lawless region to the south of Waknuk. Beyond the Fringes lie the Badlands (where all of nature is distorted) and then the Blacklands where nothing grows at all .  ' In our society, although no one will admit it, most of us discriminate against people who are different to us. In the science fiction novel The Chrysalidsby John Wyndham, people who are do not match the leaders\u2019 idea of the \u2018true image\u2019 of god are either killed or banished to the Fringes. The novel follows David Strorm, a member of a group of people with hidden telepathic powers, as he realizes he is different and is eventually found out and chased out of their town. Through Wyndham\u2019s use of narrative techniques the reader has been positioned to see him saying that our society is not too dissimilar to that of David\u2019s. As a society we treat people that are different, either physically or mentally, differently to how we treat people we call \u2018normal\u2019.

How did the person who wrote the book saying what was normal know what was normal. Everybody is different. I honestly believe there is a spectrum for all things and people should not be judged for where they come on that spectrum. I believe we just are. And we should all be respected for being who we are.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gADfCA7zM7s/TdWJcp28wGI/AAAAAAAACBg/VONnMDKqGZY/s1600/015.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bzpnPXHc-hg/TdWJIYcz_hI/AAAAAAAACBY/4fZ2mXPKWfM/s1600/004.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XhfGB101ZPY/TdWI4HLdocI/AAAAAAAACBQ/tVZ550goG9w/s1600/003.JPG", "http://http//www.wikisummaries.org/The_Chrysalids"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2011/05/do-not-judge-book-by-its-cover.html", "title": "\nDO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER .\n"},

WHY ? I think it is mostly to do with the attitude of Cardiff City Council. As I have mentioned before, even though I went to a state primary school, I feel that it had quite progressive ideas even though it was the 1960s. Yes girls, that was when life was still in black and white :) I had a subject called Environmental Studies where we learned about the world and how we were destroying the world and what we had to do to save it . \r \r \r   \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r The first real example I have in my own life of feeling we were destroying the world was 1979 - The Winter of Discontent. I remember being shocked at the build up of rubbish in Claude Road and thinking that even when itwas all moved and back to normal, we would still be producing that amount of rubbish . And here we are in 2011 and SnoWhite lives on that road and because most of the houses have been converted to flats and bedsits the rubbish fills the front gardens constantly. Then when I had children.......reduce, reuse , recycle became a normal way of life . And then in the middle 80s recycling household rubbish began. And I have tried to recycle everything . But now I feel at times WHY DO I BOTHER! This week all the residents where I live received a letter telling us that because we hadn't been recycling correctly our collections were to be monitored for a month to check that we were putting the right things in the right bins on the right days. Were also told how much we would be fined if we didn't do these things properly. And the best bit......they got the collection date wrong on the letters they had sent out so they had to post it again with the correct date! Billiant ! So we as residents are told off for not recycling properly but who gets to tell the council off for c*cking up their letter and having to do it twice.Doubling the cost and doubling the amount that needs to be recycled. BUTit seems that buy checking our bins it means that they will literally be going through them to check that we have put the right things in the right bags. Well my thought on that are BE MY GUEST. If they want to go through the nappies and piggie poo and rabbit poo then they can knock themselves out. The smell surely will! Even though the councils rubbish collection department has peed me off I think I more to blame for my feelings than the council. My last years New Years Resolution was not to weight myself in 2010 because I was getting obssessed with weighing myself. So I didn't apart from when I was weighed for my MRI.

Even after adjusting for factors like physical and mental infirmity, men and women who shopped daily lived longer than those who shunned retail therapy, say scientists. Shopping may provide companionship, exercise and an opportunity to maintain a healthy diet, they report in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health. A leading UK expert said the findings \"made sense\" since shopping involves physical activity, social interaction and keeping mentally active. In the study, published online in the academic journal, researchers led by Dr Yu-Hung Chang of the Institute of Population Health Sciences, Taiwan, studied nearly 2,000 men and women aged 65 and over who lived in their own homes. They found those who shopped regularly lived longer than those who shopped just once a week or less, even after adjusting for factors such as physical limitations and cognitive decline. The data Taiwanese researchers studied 1,850 people aged 65 plus All were living independently at home During a survey in 1999-2000 they were asked how often they went shopping The team tracked how long they lived by linking individuals to national death registries between 1999 and 2008 Those who shopped daily were 27% less likely to die than those who shopped infrequently, with the biggest effect seen in men They acknowledge that shopping could be a marker for those in good health to begin with, but suggest shopping itself may improve health. \"Shopping is often for pleasure with the potential to increase psychological wellbeing,\" they conclude. \"Compared to other types of leisure-time physical activity, like formal exercise, which usually requires motivation and sometimes professional instruction, shopping activity is easier to undertake and maintain.\" David Oliver, visiting professor of medicine for older people at City University, London, said the findings \"made sense\" He told the BBC: \"What the Taiwanese researchers have shown is that continuing to shop is independently predictive of better well-being and longer life. \"Shopping is going to involve physical activity, social interaction with other shoppers and because it's quite a complex task it's going to keep you mentally active. \"It makes sense that it would be a predictor of better physical and psychological well-being.\" \r \r \r \r Mmmmmm......perhaps I did make a mistake on the NO NEW CLOTHES RESOLUTION :)  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vQ5T9qIZDLQ/TZ8NCQFWT7I/AAAAAAAAB_A/67fwqyPbTuc/s1600/worldnews.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zEB66HIZghU/TZ8HrBlTG9I/AAAAAAAAB-o/Tj0s1Cfzik0/s1600/worldnews.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-naP_Yvik3BA/TZ8Mht9PRNI/AAAAAAAAB-4/HySUKiuxJEg/s1600/1979.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C_XF42FouwA/TZ8E7WjhhWI/AAAAAAAAB-g/eAhcvJm8ee0/s1600/laura%2Bashley%2Bdress.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2011/04/25-year-itch.html", "title": "\nTHE 25 YEAR ITCH!\n"},

All rights reserved I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like this...... When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's all very exciting. After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The stewardess comes in and says, \"Welcome to Holland.\" \"Holland?!?\" you say. \"What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.\" But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland and there you must stay. The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's just a different place. So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met. It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills....and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts. But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say \"Yes, that's where I was supposed to go. That's what I had planned.\" And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss. But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things ... about Holland. Holland to me is the most beautiful country in the world. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FkvVTBKXM2w/TVtKBe94u-I/AAAAAAAAB7g/ZH-PiHWwtSQ/s1600/039.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s4WvFPw21uI/TVtLc0WwWpI/AAAAAAAAB7o/k2V0rfWrQZE/s1600/douglas-adams-quote-calvin-hobbes-looking-at-stars.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2011/02/i-had-choice.html", "title": "\nI HAD A CHOICE .........\n"},

{"date": " October 13, 2010", "body": "\nHaving a child who is profoundly autistic can be exhausting at the best of times but when you the carer are also unwell it can become a nightmare. Beauty is a very demanding child and when she wants something or wants to do something, she cannot understand WHY you say no. How to convince a child that she cannot have six packets of GREEN CRISPS or why she cannot have half a dozen bars of DAIRY MILK CHOCOLATE. And then the only answer is to hide them and to re-hide them because she will find them.......over and over! I have found over the last year as my health has got worse is that the best way for me to deal with the situation is to deal with her the way that I did when she was a new baby. And that is......when she sleeps, I sleep. Having Fibromyalgia,Spinal Arthritis,R Arthritis, under active thyroid, anaemia or whatever the heck else is meant to be wrong with my body,means that I am tired ALL the time and so the only way to cope with Beauty is to sleep when she is asleep or sleep when she is in school. At the moment I can barely write this and keep my eyes open and as soon as I have finished I shall be going back to sleep. Most days I manage to cope but the days when she is awake from 2 or 3 am and does not go back to sleep then I feel as if I am dying. I feel like a Zombie. But on a NORMAL day I like to get out of bed at least an hour before Beauty so the meds have a chance to kick in. When I get her out of bed she goes straight in the bath and most days I attempt to clean the bath room whilst she is lying in the tub but usually all that I manage is to sit on the toilet with my head resting on my arms on the sink. However, today I did manage a not bad clean of the bathroom. I think Kim and Aggie would find it acceptable(but it is really tough if they don't!). And I dress her and then she comes down and eats breakfast and then onto the computer until it is time for school. Whilst this is happening I TIDY through and put the dishes and laundry on to wash before I dress myself for the school run. This sounds so efficient but it just isn't! It is all so exhausting and I get so little done! I am always tidying but never cleaning because I just have no energy but that is all sorted now thank goodness. On Friday a cleaner comes for 2 hours from an agency to do the cleaning I never manage.I am so thrilled that at last I have a cleaner. And then I spend the day recovering by sleeping so I have the energy for Beauty when she gets home from school. Evening is when I seem to have most energy and get most tidying done and then when Beauty sleeps again...I also sleep! If only I didn't have to sleep so much and had some more energy.

{"date": " September 27, 2010", "body": "\n YOU CAN'T TELL A WELSH MAN ANYTHING.......is something my father told my mother BEFORE they got married and she still married him and stayed with him! All I can say is there is no accounting for love. However, I have another truism.......YOU CANNOT MAKE A CHILD WHO IS PROFOUNDLY AUTISTIC DO SOMETHING THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO. OR CAN YOU? I first read about this research when I was doing my masters in Autism and there is a lot that I agree with. From The Times September 12, 2007 Testosterone finding backs the \u2018extreme male brain\u2019 autism theory Mark Henderson, Science Editor   The theory that autism is caused by an extreme version of the \u201cmale brain\u201d has won strong support from new research showing that male hormones in the womb are linked to social and emotional skills in childhood. Scientists at the University of Cambridge found that both boys and girls who are exposed to high levels of testosterone before they are born are more likely than usual to develop traits typical of autism, such as a preference for solitary activities and strong numerical and pattern-recognition skills. The study included only children who are not autistic, but it gives some of the firmest biological evidence yet that the social impairments that characterise the condition may be affected by prenatal hormone exposure. This in turn backs the theory that autistic people are best understood as having extreme versions of a brain type that is common in the population at large, particularly among men. The idea advanced by Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, who leads the Cambridge team, is that human brains are predominantly attuned either to empathising with others, or to understanding how systems work. Women are more likely to be in the first group and men in the second, while autistic people are extreme  systemisers  whose social problems emerge from a fundamental difficulty with empathy. The model fits with the observation that autism is four times more common among boys. One possible explanation is that male hormones in the womb could promote  systemising  at the expense of empathy. Very high exposures may thus trigger autism. Professor Baron-Cohen\u2019s study, conducted with his graduate student, Bonnie  Auyeung , looked at prenatal testosterone levels in 235 foetuses whose mothers had had amniocentesis. When the children were born, they were followed up to assess their psychological development. The latest data, from questionnaires given to mothers when the children were eight, were presented yesterday at the British Association Festival of Science in York. While all the children were developmentally normal, boys and girls who had higher levels of foetal testosterone were significantly more likely to have a large number of autistic traits such as preferring playing alone to joining in at birthday parties, and being good at remembering numerical patterns, such as car  numberplates . About 20 per cent of the variation between children\u2019s autistic traits appeared to match foetal testosterone levels, with the remainder likely to be caused by genetic and environmental factors. Previous research with the same group of children has shown that at 12 months, children with high foetal testosterone make less eye contact with their parents and look at others\u2019 faces less frequently. At 18 months, they have a smaller vocabulary than children exposed to lower concentrations of the male hormone. Professor Baron-Cohen said that the results did not prove that the link between male hormones and autistic traits was causal: both could be the result of something else. He also said that his team had not yet examined autistic children, only autistic traits in the normal population. Even so, he said, the work added strong biological evidence to his extreme male brain theory. \u201cThe hypothesis was based on observed sex differences,\u201d he said. \u201cSimply put, girls tend to show better empathy, and boys tend to have a stronger interest in systems. Children with autism seem to have an exaggerated version of typical male preferences. They have a strong interest in systems, and difficulty empathising. \u201cWe are now moving from a psychological level down to a biological level. It is an exciting development.\u201d Professor Baron-Cohen has won funding from the Medical Research Council to conduct a study using two large databases in Denmark, an archive of 90,000 amniocentesis samples, and a national register of people with psychological or developmental disorders. He said: \u201cWe are going to look at who has a diagnosis of autism and then pick out their amniocentesis sample and look at testosterone.\u201d Professor Baron-Cohen said it was unlikely that it would be possible to prevent autism by controlling foetal testosterone, not least because doing so might adversely affect other aspects of foetal development. I believe that Beauty is  TYPICALLY  autistic in lots of ways but I would also like to say that she has an amazing sense of humour, fantastic imagination and loves to hug and kiss which are not meant to be typical traits of autism (well, as every other article on autism seems to want to reassure me of)!. It is a bit like saying though that all little girls love ponies and all little boys love football! Do they? Well I have 6 girls and only Belle was PONY obsessed but Beauty is DOG obsessed and parents of small boys will have to let me know if they are football obsessed! However , next door to me lives a young family with 2 small boys and they are regularly coming into my garden to fetch their ball though I think it is the Dad who is the most obsessed.....he has a Cardiff City scarf in the back window of his car! If what Professor Baron -Cohen (and yes I think they might be related) has to say is true then I think it goes a long way in explaining the behaviour modification that works best with Beauty. Hands up how many women have heard of or employed the following Behaviour Modification Theory. Men can be guided into doing what ever you want them to do as long as they are guided in the right way.In subtle ways, plant a seed of an idea that allows a man to believe that an idea is all his own and there is no stopping him but tell him he has to do something and he will dig his heels in like a mule and totally refuse to comply. I am being totally serious here and I want you to know that I am not \" BlokeBashing \". Whilst females need to be wooed in different but still subtle ways, men are less complex creatures and you take care of their creature comforts and and they will be happy to go along with most things. Random thought I know but it must be easier to get a man to go shopping now that so many men have i phones and droids and other fancy phones.......they can surf in comfort in the best and the worst of the shops. Yesterday I went to  Asda  and there were so many trailing men on their phones!!!! Beauty is therefore very \"male brained\"from what Professor Baron-Cohen has explained. If she does not want to do something then she will not but let her think it is her own idea and there is no stopping her. Beauty has a  Selective Eating Disorder  which seems to happen a lot  with  children who have an  ASD . Selecti ve  Eating Disorder ( SED ) (also known as picky or fussy eating, or  perseverative  feeding disorder) is an eating disorder that prevents the consumption of certain foods. It is often viewed as a phase of childhood that is generally overcome with age. Children may not grow out of being a picky eater, however, and may continue to be afflicted with  SED  throughout their adult lives. The British Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry states that: Selective eating is the little studied phenomenon of eating a highly limited range of foods, associated with an unwillingness to try new foods. Common in toddlers, it can persist into middle childhood and adolescence in a small number of children, most commonly boys. When this happens social avoidance, anxiety and conflict can result. And my way of dealing with the situation is to make Beauty think that any additions to her eating  repertoire  are purely her own choice. If I were to put something new on Beauty's plate at meal times then she is very unlikely to even to try it. However, if I sit next to her whilst she is eating with my own food she is more likely to see it on my plate and want to try it. From this technique , Beauty has learned to eat fish, chicken, Yorkshire Puddings,ham, fromage   frais ,pizza and so much more. I have seen a number of programs on TV about selective eating but the children I have seen them working with are normally developing and what works with them would not work with Beauty. Plus the ultimate treatment for normally developing children with this problem is to only allow them to eat the  offered  food and eventually they will eat it.But with a child on the autistic spectrum this will not normally work and will possibly result in starvation as they will just refuse to eat. And that is just cruelty. As Beauty's teachers in school have commented \" SHE WORKS TO HER OWN AGENDA\" and if you push her and she does not want to do something then she has been known to  become  like a crazed, flailing animal and that can be  physically  painful.....for others! But being as stubborn as a mule also works! We have  guinea  pigs and a rabbit and so I prepare them raw vegetables and when Beauty was small she went to take some of the vegetables to eat and I shouted NO because they were a bit grubby but she tried to eat them anyway and has ever since. She eats raw cabbage,  broccoli  , carrots and lettuce and I am convinced she eats them because she thinks she is doing something naughty. She also eats daisies!!!!(which her idiot sisters have been known to feed her because they think it is funny!) Beauty also has sleep disturbances and sometimes she can be awake from 2am and not go back to sleep but she can also veer towards the other end of the spectrum. At times she is like a teenager and nothing seems to make her want to get out of bed in the morning. However, there is something that she loves and that is bath time and I only have to put my head around the bedroom door and call  BATHTIME  and she is up and out of bed and undressing herself to get in the bath. Forcing Beauty never seems to work. I also find that arguing with her never works. When she sees her school dress after bathing she frequently starts shouting NO SCHOOL and I totally ignore it, if I didn't she would just repeat NO SCHOOL no matter what I replied. I help her to dress and sit her at the breakfast table for he breakfast and carry on as nothing has happened.If Beauty had been a normally developing child her favourite phrase would have been BUT WHY . The girls will vouch for this because when they are on the phone they complain of Beauty's noise and they say they cannot concentrate and I say WHAT NOISE? Many males can be like this. How many males out there think that they have \"won an argument\" but yet the woman went on to do what she felt was right anyway? I am in no way saying that men and children on the autistic spectrum are stupid.....far from it. It is because of their high level of intelligence that such subtlety has to be used. The point I am making is that dealing with men and children on the autistic spectrum , there needs to be a similar approach and  Professor  Baron-Cohen's research has a lot of truth in it. However, to prove that this is just the opinion of a mother of a child with autism(who most of the time suffers from sleep deprivation due to her child's inability to sleep properly!!!!) I also think that children and dogs need to be brought up in a similar way. I have watched  Dog Borstal  ( and Mic is brilliant)and strength ,love ,organisation and reward are the best ways for dogs and children. Though I am not sure Beauty would go for the doggy treats.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TKBjKlOwK8I/AAAAAAAAB4M/Aba_87dagh4/s1600/06-03-10+006.jpg", "http://http//www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article2434432.ece", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_eating_disorder", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TKBiV9Wb23I/AAAAAAAAB4E/vLOCkl49BH4/s1600/daisy.jpg", "http://http//www.micmartin.co.uk/index2.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/09/you-cant-tell-welsh-man-anything.html", "title": "\nYOU CAN'T TELL A WELSH MAN ANYTHING....\n"},

{"date": " September 26, 2010", "body": "\nJust a little note for Sunday. I have a STAT COUNTER here on my blog and you can see it down on the right hand side of the front page. It is something I look at every few days or so and I find the information really interesting. I have never had over 200 hits in a day and that is not a problem as this blog was never meant to be more than a journal for me and my girls and friends. However, the one thing that fascinates me is WHO ARE THE OTHERS that visit my site regularly? Most people I can guess because of their locations but others just have me wondering constantly. Who in Israel reads my every new entry? The girls have a cousin there but I can't see him being interested. And who in the Yorkshire Dales likes to read of my mundane life.(I know it is not you David as you show up closer to your home) And London and Texas and Germany! And they are not just random readers. They read all the time and they go straight to my site and are not directed through one of the Autism sites. Truly we are a Global village and I love it. For a woman who did not leave the UK for the first time until she was 38,I love this ability to communicate EVERYWHERE. My Blog makes me think about my favourite book  THE  CHRYSALIDS . I know I have  whittered  on about it before but for those who have not heard me expound on how brilliant it is before,here is a brief synopsis. It is set in a post  apocalyptical  future, after a nuclear war. The society is basically set in the middle ages in lots of ways. One of the main themes is that the society is religious and some are more fundamental than others. There are laws which state what mankind can and cannot look like ...i.e how many hands, length of bones, number of fingers etc...... and deviants are sent to live in the badlands as they are a sin against God.But NORMALITY is difficult to achieve  due to the radiation that still lingers from the war. However, a group of  telepaths  have evolved and whilst the powers that be think they exist , they are not sure and are pursuing them. But the main character who is a  telepath  talks of those other  telepaths  he can talk to in his head and understand and others who are either further away and cannot be heard or those who do not fully understand their capabilities and are not able to be any more telepathic than a few ghost whispers that they might transmit in times of distress. And how does the idiot woman see this in relation to her blog I am sure you are asking? It is all about communication. Whilst computers were invented before John Wyndham wrote his book The  Chrysalids , could he have ever imagined the capabilities that actually come from them and their ability to communicate with others in the far reaches of the world? I don't know but when ever I go online I feel there are different ways that I communicate to others that resemble  Wyndhams   telepaths . I talk and see directly through  SKYPE  and at other times I INSTANT MESSAGE and at other times I just EMAIL. Some people I speak to in REAL LIFE and are current friends and family, whilst others I have only met on ONLINE and will probably never meet face-to-face. It is all about levels of communication. In the book, one of the characters says that to be married to someone who was not telepathic would not be something he could contemplate as they would not be able to fully communicate their feelings for each other and I know what he means. I would not want to go back to a time when I could not communicate as freely around the world as I do now.Yes I am a Luddite in many ways but only because I am crap at making technology work but the thought of NOT being able to communicate with my family and friends whenever I need to is just a scary thought. Whilst I love to write letters and do, to have to go back to relying on that for communication would be impossible for my mind to comprehend or want to accept. Honestly, who has not felt some anxiety when their Internet connection went down? C S Lewis wrote WE READ TO KNOW WE ARE NOT ALONE. I think it is a way of describing our need to reach out and feel that someone is there, even if we do not see SOMEONE,to know we are not alone. Therefore to paraphrase Ephesians 2:19 BE YE NO MORE STRANGERS. If you like to read my blog then stop and say HELLO ,I would love to hear from you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chrysalids"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/09/just-say-hi.html", "title": "\nJUST SAY HI\n"},
{"date": " September 14, 2010", "body": "\n \r Growing up in the 60's it would be fair to say that that being hungry quite frequently was a significant part of the memories that I have.\r I loved food but I never was able to get quite enough of it and until I was 25 I looked as if I was anorexic.\r My bones literally stuck out and the bones of my spine were very pronounced. But boy did I eat from the time that I was living on my own but it was mostly my beloved friends.....CARBS!\r I remember a professional explaining to me the theory of famine and feast that occurred in families with limited income(and I know she could be reading this and I want to thank her for enlightening me).\r Before I go on however, I would say that the situation has changed somewhat due to the availability of cheaper foods.\r But what I was told was that small children have little choice and grow up eating what they are given and that can be very small amounts so they are constantly hungry.\r However, the situation changes as they grow older and became more vocal and have a voice of their own.Then they demand food and they go from undernourished children to over-fed teens and obese adults.\r I know that I definitely went through that and my body still has not come to terms with finding a healthy, stable weight.\r \r Last night I watched a report on  Humanae Vitae \r \r Humanae Vitae (Latin \"Of Human Life\") is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI and promulgated on July 25, 1968. Subtitled \"On the Regulation of Birth\", it re-affirms the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church regarding abortion, contraception, and other issues pertaining to human life. \r Mainly because of its prohibition of all forms of artificial contraception, the encyclical has been controversial. \r \r \r that was presented by activist  Peter Tatchell \r and it discussed as part of the presentation the situation of Catholic families in the Philippines and it case studied a woman called Vilma who had 9 living children(2 had died)and she was pregnant again and they lived in poverty and squalor.\r The church and local Bishops and priests had told them they were not allowed to limit their families through artificial means because it would be a sin to do so.\r They lived in abject poverty in a slum area and they earned their living by scavenging through the local dump for plastic and they earned barely enough money for the family to survive. Their diet appeared to be mostly rice.\r Even though there was rice coming into the family the mother stated that there were often times when there was not enough for her to eat .\r This is one thing I remember about my own mother, there were times when she did not eat and I dedicate my writing today to her.\r Going back to Peter Tatchel's presentation however, I want my family who are equally split between the membership in the Catholic Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints that my words here are purely personal and NOT a reflection upon you as individuals.\r I totally , 100% believe that a religious doctrine(or dogma) that condemns the use of condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and prevent pregnancy is wrong. Even though the following statement will make me sound like a hypocrite, I also believe that abortion should be freely available and the woman be allowed control over her own body and make her own choices.\r It is not for me to make or influence her choices.\r I have personally given birth 7 times and would NEVER have considered an abortion and even if I had been told of Beauty's condition prior to birth, I still would not have considered an abortion.\r Beauty is my happiest ,most care free child and so far she has had a wonderfully loving life.\r But these are my choices, I would never impose them on anyone else.\r From the time my girls were able to understand, I have told them that if they got pregnant, no matter how young they were or whatever the situation, to tell me and I would be happy and totally support them with their choice.\r Obviously they knew my own choice would be to keep the child, they still knew that I would support what they chose.\r I do not believe that we should blindly accept that is right for children to be born into squalor and poverty and to die in pain and suffering.\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Now I am sure that the official organisation that is the Catholic church would say that my beliefs are wrong and are a sin but I do not understand how they can be.\r They are truly what I believe and I cannot make myself believe any other way but yet GOD created me this way so surely what I believe must be right and true, logically it cannot be any other way.\r I also believe that when a human is born their sexuality is who they are, they do not decide to become gay and so they are not 'sinners'.\r I personally cannot believe that the situation in developing countries , where religion makes choices for the people that poverty, hunger, pain, inequality and suffering is right.\r My mind will not let me think any other way.\r Therefore, if there is a God and there is a heaven, then all I will be able to say if there is a judgement day\r \r I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT \r \r To carry on , no longer on global inequalities but on a more personal level,Beauty has a  Selective Eating Disorder .\r \r Selective Eating Disorder (SED) (also known as picky or fussy eating, or perseverative feeding disorder) is an eating disorder that prevents the consumption of certain foods. It is often viewed as a phase of childhood that is generally overcome with age. Children may not grow out of being a picky eater, however, and may continue to be afflicted with SED throughout their adult lives\r SED is common in young people with autistic spectrum disorders  \r \r Beauty has made her own choices as far as food is concerned and has only a limited range of what she will eat and most of them are a GOLDEN COLOUR which seems to define what she will or will not eat. \r She is a tall girl but she is regularly seen and weighed by a consultant who says her height and weight are within normal limits but I do still worry especially due to her  hypermobilty  and the hypermobility and  arthritis  that I have.I also worry because I am large person and am predisposed to putting on weight which is obviously not good for someone with the health problems that I have.Because of this,I am constantly worried about what she eats and the exercise that she gets.In one way her hyperactivity is a good thing because I think it gets rid of a lot of excess calories during the day and helps to keep her fit!I am therefore very interested in any programs I can watch on TV about children and healthy eating and last night and I watched Jamie Oliver's new program . \r \r ABC Television Network - \"Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution\"\r Jamie Oliver is here to start a revolution. The impassioned chef, TV personality and best-selling author is determined to take on the high statistics of obesity, heart disease and diabetes in this country, where our nation's children are the first generation not expected to live as long as their parents. Jamie is inviting viewers to take a stand and change the way America eats, in our home kitchens, schools and workplaces, with the thought-provoking new series, \"Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution,\"  \r \r \r \r \r \r \r And from the outset I was embarrassed and I could understand why the locals were asking \r WHY ARE YOU HERE?   \r \r \r I have to admit though that I would have been tempted to tell him to bog off and put his own house in order(the UK)if I had been one of the cooks.\r Jamies first issue was with the children eating pizza for breakfast.\r Now I personally think that Jamie got too hung up on the fact that he had never seen pizza for breakfast.Whenever I have seen  Gillian McKeith's  program I have always felt that her biggest problem was failing to engage the children. Don't give them slop for breakfast....give them what they like.\r Pizza can be good, it just needs to be produced as a healthy option.\r Less fat,less preservatives and generally less of all the other rubbish it can contain but  YES  it can be good.I feel he should have focussed on what the children wanted.\r My purpose here in discussing Jamie's program is that I feel you cannot judge a whole community,town, city, country from one point of view .I believe that the problems with healthy eating are different for everyone and I believe that real change can only come from central government initiatives.\r Standards should be set and maintained regarding food to ensure that only good, safe, healthy food is entering the market and healthy eating taught from an early age for everyone and more exercise promoted.No this is not a magic wand solution, it never can be as we as humans should have our own free agency to decide about our own lives. And from this......what am I saying? Well there appears to be a lot of different things discussed here but I feel they are all saying and I want to reiterate what they are saying and that is ENDOW US WITH DIGNITY IT IS OUR RIGHT \r \r \r \r \r \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanae_Vitae", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TI82c2AVwvI/AAAAAAAABzs/e6TYRnjAbgs/s1600/peter+tatchell.jpg", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tatchell", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TI869fAH7cI/AAAAAAAABz0/_qLtkDUGiAI/s1600/slums.bmp", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_eating_disorder", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermobility", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TI81aRmCXhI/AAAAAAAABzk/NXlE-N7SUVg/s1600/jamie_oliver_.jpg", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_McKeith"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/09/food-glorious-food.html", "title": "\nFOOD GLORIOUS FOOD!\n"},

McCaffery's oft-quoted definition of pain as \"whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever and wherever the person say it does\" has become the prevailing conceptualisation of pain for clinicians over the past few decades.\r I love this quote!\r Easy to remember and it can ALWAYS be used in any nursing essay.\r I used it in 3 different essays in my nursing final exams.\r YET.....if this is the case , why do I and others like me, who are in severe pain, feel as if we are not believed when we say we are in pain?\r My opinion is because of the type of funding of the health care that is provided in the UK.\r Other countries think that we have Free Health Care for all but that is not true.\r When you work , you make contributions that pay for your health care and those who are unable to work have their health care paid for by the state.\r Before Beauty was born, the condition of my spine deteriorated rapidly and I was unable to work.\r Remember, I had worked as a nurse for the NHS and paid my health care contributions.\r So I was entitled to Health Care even though I couldn`t work.\r But it is also obvious that there is only a certain amount of money in the Health Care pot and in some circumstances(well most really), the patients suffering most, get treated first and I can see and appreciate this.\r Yet, I have spent the last 3 days in bed in agony and today I received a letter from the NHS saying that I had been referred but I was on a waiting list and the patients with the most problems would be seen first.\r OK but I am in agony now and I have `severe `(now how many NHS doctors do you know that commit to using the word severe,it must be bad!) arthritis in my spine and disc damage.\r So if I could afford to pay, I would be seen now but because I can`t afford it, I must wait.\r Plus, before I had the x rays done,I felt as if even with my GP, my level of pain wasn`t appreciated because it couldn`t be seen.\r Yet the GP sees an x ray of crunchy,crumbly bones and they can appreciate that the situation is`severe`.\r I personally feel sorry for the GP`s.\r They have a patient in a lot of pain, they can say THIS IS THE PROBLEM, refer them and know that it is still going to be quite a while before the patient is seen by a consultant.\r \r So,McCaffery's oft-quoted definition of pain as \"whatever the experiencing person says it is, \"\r \"don\u2019t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world\u201d.  \r \r \r \r \r \u2018Ah, Mrs Plankhurst, come in and tell me, did the yoga I recommended help to ease your back pain?\u2019 \r \r \r \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/TDvVeluqpUI/AAAAAAAABvc/4qx0lzHcF2g/s1600/109.JPG", "http://http//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/8516450.stm", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margo_McCaffery", "http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.spectator.co.uk/article_images/articledir_56/28410/1_fullsize.png&imgrefurl=http://www.spectator.co.uk/wit-and-wisdom/cartoons/%3FcartoonIssueDate%3D10%2BMarch%2B2007&usg=__L4SkCfHwyNdRQDdI8_7d79kI1sg=&h=263&w=400&sz=104&hl=en&start=11&sig2=skEawt2P4-BPYKnIPUF_XA&um=1&itbs=1&tbnid=0R_2AlXtNNtHKM:&tbnh=82&tbnw=124&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dback%2Bpain%2Bcartoon%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26rls%3Dcom.microsoft:en-gb:IE-SearchBox%26rlz%3D1I7ACEW_enGB376GB376%26tbs%3Disch:1&ei=ZuE7TKLYAY-gOJixpIoK", "http://http//www.losethebackpain.com/conditions/arthritisofthespine.html"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/07/3.html", "title": "\n\"DON`T AMOUNT TO A HILL OF BEANS IN THIS CRAZY WORLD\"\n"},

{"date": " April 28, 2010", "body": "\n I always seem to have at least one book I am in the process of reading(maybe two!) and at least half a dozen books ready to be read.But last year I bought a typical feel-good,romance novel in a charity shop and read it in an evening.On the last page of the book I realised I had read the book before but totally forgotten the story. My reaction was WHAT A WASTE OF AN EVENING! The phrase what a waste of an evening reminds me of the time I decided that I HAD to read a Salman Rushdie book. I bought the book  Midnight's Children  I actually managed to read it completely but it was labrious, difficult to follow and BORING!It is obvious that I must be a philistine for not appreciating the quality of his work but I just could not make myself like the book.So,since last years re-reading,I have decided that I must widen my field of reading and try and read some of the classic which I don't seem to have read many of. I recently read my first Dickens book last week,Oliver Twist and was shocked to find that half the book is missing from the film and in the film the storyline is changed.   Well DUH! It's like saying I read it in Closer or Hello so something must be true. I really felt that I had been cheated. However, I really did enjoy the book,especially the quality and style of writing. Last night I finished reading  Wuthering Heights  which is also a book that a lot of films seem to leave half the story out of the production.Again I enjoyed the language and style of the writing BUT as for the characters Heathcliff and Cathy........well I found them to be annoying,selfish brats and thought the two of them could have done with a good hard slap.The redeeming quality of the book is that the subsequent generations of the two families, when Heathcliff dies, genuinely seem to have the promise of a happy future.And even though Heathliff was not a nice character, I personally have to vote for Joseph, the religious zealot as the nastiest character in the book! And finally my present read........ The Hunchback of Notre-Dame by Victor Hugo I shall let you know my conclusions! As academic as these tomes might seem , I have to admit to reading some very LIGHT literature every day. Niamh's bed time story! She insists on at least one every day and last nights was The Princess and The Pea. Lucky me! I have to admit that when I  read the stories I am a bit like Pheobies's mother in Friends. If I don't like part of the story then I change it. Hey, how's Niamh ever going to know? Hey, the blackbird can peck off everybodies nose,Niamh will find that funny but with the Gingerbread house there was no way I was going to tell her a story about getting into a cooker! When Niamh was younger I once caught her trying to climb into the tumble dryer........now that was bad enough!

Nothing exciting except that my elbows and shoulders are hurting and I have given in and taken pain killers which will rid me of the pain BUT keep me awake for hours. Oh well........you can't have everything. Today has to have been the worst day as far as weather this winter. Rain and mist and more rain and mist and so BLOODY COLD. But it was Niamh's Nativity play and it was a Magical Mystery Tour ,very hippy and psychedelic and each class found a different way to get to the birth of Jesus. Niamh's class surfed there and she was dressed as a surfer in an Hawaiian shirt and board shorts. Niamh is a little sweetheart. As I said before, I have been unwell recently and so I spend a lot of my time sleeping or lying down.  Which can have a positive spin. I don't go out spending money or using petrol and when I am lying down I do not have the heating on, No Impact Man  would be impressed if he knew! Plus I have been hand sewing some Christmas gifts when I have been sitting resting. See, even when poorly I am not a total waste of space. Plus I have bought Christmas presents on line which has saved my energy as well as being good for the environment. Impressive huh? My ability to put a positive spin on being a couch potato! Perhaps I could use all the money I am saving to hire a cleaner! Fantastic idea.     \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SyhHLo9xp9I/AAAAAAAABts/AbrworqCJCE/s1600-h/5nov09+028.jpg", "http://http://noimpactman.typepad.com/blog/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/12/sleep-where-art-thou.html", "title": "\nSLEEP, WHERE ART THOU?\n"},
{"date": " September 27, 2009", "body": "\n Do you remember this recent story? British law forces Canadian bride to leave Welsh husband By Damian  Inwood  , Vancouver Province September 11, 2009 VANCOUVER \u2014 Heartbroken Rochelle Wallis is recovering at her home in  Revelstoke , B.C., after being \u201cripped away\u201d from her husband in the United kingdom. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible feeling being without my husband,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cI spent nearly the last two years waking up every morning and going to sleep with him next to me, and it really set in when I woke up this morning and he  wasn \u2019t there.\u201d Wallis, 19, was forced to say goodbye to her husband Adam, 28, at  Heathrow  Airport Tuesday, all because of a law intended to protect vulnerable young women from forced marriages. At the time of reading this I remember thinking how silly the law was not to make exceptions and I still feel the same way. I also understand the reasoning behind the law which was put into place to protect young girls from forced marriages. Forced marriage plea to schools By Dominic  Casciani   BBC News Forced marriage: Helpline calls up on last year New guidance is being published urging schools to identify signs of forced marriages ahead of the holidays. The guidance comes as an official report raises questions about how some schools and councils have failed to act on suspicions or evidence of abuse. The report calls on schools to play a greater preventative role, saying some are clearly reluctant to get involved. The government's Forced Marriage Unit ( FMU ) says it has received 770 calls for help this year - up 16% on 2008. Experts say the coming month will be critical because there is growing evidence that abusive families use the school summer holidays to coerce daughters and sons to marry abroad. The new guidance published by the  FMU  urges teachers to be aware of signs of a possible forced marriage because school or college is often the only place where the potential victim can speak freely.  And my point in mentioning this is? Whilst reading about a number of cases regarding child marriages, I was surprised(no shocked) to find that whilst the minimum age in the UK is 16........no ifs, no buts......16 is the lowest age at which you can marry (check it out  here  but there are plenty of other sites to verify this), that is not the case in the USA. And when I Googled a bit more I found many reports of children as young as 13 being allowed to marry. And I am sorry,when I read this I just laughed and laughed because I thought it was a JOKE but the more I read the more I realised it wasn't. Well it is a joke but it isn't meant to be. For example (yes I do realise this is not a new case) FALLS CITY, Neb., Aug. 29  - On Sunday evening, Matthew  Koso  tipped three ounces of formula into his 5-day-old daughter's mouth, then hoisted her atop his shoulder in hope of a burp. On Tuesday morning, he is scheduled to be arraigned on charges for which the newborn is the state's prime piece of evidence. Chris  Cummins  for the New York Times Matthew  Koso , 22; his wife Crystal, 14; and their daughter, Samara. Mr.  Koso  faces an arraignment Tuesday on a charge of statutory rape. Mr.  Koso  is 22. The baby's mother, Crystal, is 14. He is charged with statutory rape, even though they were wed with their parents' blessing in May, crossing into Kansas because their own state prohibits marriages of people under 17. The Nebraska attorney general accuses Mr.  Koso  of being a pedophile; they say it is true love. \"We don't want grown men having sex with young girls,\" said Jon  Bruning , the attorney general. \"We make a lot of choices for our children: we don't allow them to vote; we don't allow them to drink; we don't allow them to drive cars; we don't allow them to serve in wars at age 13, whether they want to or not; and we don't allow them to have sex with grown men.\" But Mr.  Koso's  mother, Peggy, said she and her husband of 25 years were proud that their son did not disappear like so many deadbeat dads.  Whilst I agree with Mr  Koso's  mother that her son is doing the right thing and his dedication to his child and the child's mother cannot be faulted, it is the Law that I have the issue with that ALLOWS a child under the age of 16 to be married whatever the circumstances. I have 6 girls and they know exactly how I feel about getting married young, what's the point of having experience and not being able to tell your children about it? I was married at 19(which doesn't seem too young) and I feel that I was too young. My girls were too young at 16 and they were definitely too young at 13. Here is something to think about................think of the boys you went out with when you were 13 and 16........imagine if you had married them. What did they turn out like? Were you ready? Where they ready? Are you scared at what your life could have been like? However, I have met 2 families where the mothers were 14 and 16 when they married and they both seem to have had a very happy family life, so it can work but that wasn't today,it was in the 1950's.  Thankfully  not everybody feels the same ways about child brides in the USA and work has been done to stop these marriages. Although the practice is most common in the developing world,  child marriage still exists in industrialized countries,  where it is intimately linked with poverty. In the United States, teens can get married as young as 14 with parental consent in some states. After a highly publicized case in Kansas last year in which a pregnant 14-year-old married her 22-year-old boyfriend, the state raised the minimum marrying age to 15 with a judge's approval. The man, Matthew  Koso , pleaded guilty to first-degree sexual assault and was sentenced in February to 18 to 30 months in prison. According to a 2002 study by the Washington-based Center for Law and Social Policy, around 1 percent of U.S. teens between 15 and 17 have been married. However, the 2000 U.S. census found that teen marriage rates increased by nearly 50 percent during the 90s. Researchers have speculated on a number of reasons for this escalation, including the impact of abstinence-until-marriage programs, welfare policies that promote marriage and the influx of immigrants from societies where early marriage is common. A 2004 report by Save the Children found that over one-fifth of 20-year-old women in the United States gave birth while still teens, the highest adolescent birth rate among industrialized countries. U.S. teens living in rural communities with high poverty rates and below-average education levels are most likely to become young mothers. By writing this I am not trying to claim the UK is perfect and other countries are not.  We have our own fair share of problems to deal with what I am saying is that no matter what under 16 year  olds  look like or behave like, they are still physically,emotionally and  developmentally  children and should be treated  and respected as such.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr9OB7S2tqI/AAAAAAAABsU/S6IxOiYnr6o/s1600-h/13+year+old.jpg", "http://http//www.canada.com/news/British+forces+Canadian+bride+leave+Welsh+husband/1981358/story.html", "http://http//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8129466.stm", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriageable_age", "http://http//www.nytimes.com/2005/08/30/national/30baby.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sr9OB7S2tqI/AAAAAAAABsU/S6IxOiYnr6o/s1600-h/13+year+old.jpg", "http://http//www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/2831/context/archive"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/09/child-brides.html", "title": "\nCHILD BRIDES\n"},

A winter's day In a deep and dark December; I am alone, Gazing from my window to the streets below On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow. I am a rock, I am an island. I've built walls, A fortress deep and mighty, That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain. I am a rock, I am an island. Don't talk of love, But I've heard the words before; It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died. If I never loved I never would have cried. I am a rock, I am an island. I have my books And my poetry to protect me; I am shielded in my armor, Hiding in my room, safe within my womb. I touch no one and no one touches me. I am a rock, I am an island. And a rock feels no pain; And an island never cries. I think the S&G song better reflects how I feel at the moment. I have been away for sometime and I have been thinking all the time that I will write again when I feel better but that never seems to happen so here I am anyway. So what have I missed? Today I read about Rick Rolling, it seems my children have heard of it but that one completely passed me by! I seem to spend to much time asleep to notice much! Due to me not being well and not really doing much, I have been watching lots of videos and DVDs and the my fave one at the moment has to be Love Actually. And the character I see  my self most like in the film......Billy Mack's sad and lonely and fat manager! But hey, he may be alone but he is always smiling.

The sweetest little 8 year old on the planet is asleep but I am awake with my numb arms thing! The following is listed as a possible cause for problems in FMS Central dopamine dysfunction (hypodopaminergia ) The 'dopamine hypothesis of fibromyalgia\u2019 proposes that the central abnormality responsible for symptoms associated with fibromyalgia is a disruption of normal dopamine-related neurotransmission. Dopamine is a catecholamine neurotransmitter with roles in pain perception and natural analgesia. There is also strong evidence for a role of dopamine in restless leg syndrome,which is a condition found frequently in patients with fibromyalgia.Some fibromyalgia patients responded in controlled trials to pramipexole, a dopamine agonist that selectively stimulates dopamine D2/D3 receptors and is used to treat both Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. And I know that my body definitely has a problem with pain perception.  I have had 2 Natural Pain Free Births and many people do not believe it is possible but I can promise you it is. With SnoWhite the birth lasted 2 hours from start to finish(well they all did apart from Beauty!) and the labour and birth were pain free.I could feel and see the contractions happening and I obviously knew when the delivery happened but there was no pain. And the same with Beauty! Ariel and Fiona were totally the opposite so with Beauty I had arranged to have an Epidural but the nurse kept coming and asking HOW WAS THE PAIN before the Epidural was put in and all I could say was I DON'T KNOW. So yes, I personally feel that pain perception is a significant problem with FMS. My arms feel as if I they have been injected by a dentist! They feel numb in the way your face feels when you leave the dentist after LOTS of treatment. So whilst pain is not really the issue at the moment (as the donkey appears to have quit chewing on my arm !), the numbness and pins and needles is.  It is pity I do not know how to isolate what gives me pain free births as I would bottle it and sell it and make a fortune if I did! I am glad we have the facilities that we have today to be able to be aware of our health issues and so be able to deal with them. I have health issues but I would never say I was ill and even though somedays I may take care of my life from the confines of my sofa or my bed, I know after some R&R time, I am up and about again. I am truly glad that we have progressed so far. Recently I fead about a child of a famous person(memory completely gone here....sorry!) who talked about their parents severe depression and said IF ZOLOFT HAD BEEN AVAILABLE IN THEIR TIME THEN I AM CONVINCED THEIR LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DIFFERENT! My only real issue with the health problems I have........total lack of energy! I have a very long list of things I need to do. One day maybe a housekeeper.......!!!!!!

Here I have written a poem to try and explain what it feels like to feel sad for no reason. I AM SAD The sun shines And the sky is oh so blue The air is warm And birds sing No worries No cares Those who love me Close by Yet still For no reason That I Can fathom Or understand I am sad.  Before my children start phoning home to see if I am OK the answer is I AM FINE, in fact as Myra in the film Truly,Madly,Deeply said I AM VERY FINE,I just don't feel as bright as yesterday. An example of my strange sense of humour! Today I was looking for the tablecloth that I had used on the lunch table yesterday but I couldn't find it. And for a moment.......a brief nano second......I thought perhaps one of the girls has picked it up and put it away! Then I realised what I had thought and couldn't stop laughing! My children would step over Jimmy Hoffa's body and show no interest as long as it didn't get in their way of food and bed! Further proof that whilst I may not be feeling 100%, my sense of humour is still intact!This morning I went to the front door to get the post and whilst there I noticed the baseball bat which is allegedly there for protection from home invasion! It is the bat that Fiona had as a birthday present and within 5 minutes of having it she took it to Ariel's head......NICE CHILD! Anyway to get back to the point. We live on a pedestrianised estate so the roads are at the back of the houses and only people you do not know come to the front door so the front door is barely used. Here is the base ball bat.  And the front door! It made me laugh when I realised that it would need to be a very clever HOME INVADER to get past all this stuff and you couldn't swing a cat in this area let alone a baseball bat! Why I should not leave the house with money in my purse and sales on in the shops!  I bought all of these in BHS in the sale. A pie dish......I can never have too many pie dishes! There is almost always one of my pie dishes at one of my friends houses. A cruet set.....believe it or not I do not have one as I only add salt to chips but we do have guests who use salt so I saw this pretty set and it was ALMOST shouting BUY ME,BUY ME! Almost, I am not totally mad! And finally a sugar holder. I also rarely use sugar on cereals or in drinks but again,we have visitors who do and this one was so pretty and I didn't have one,so.....I HAD TO(HAD TO!)BUY IT! And how do I justify buying my new pretty things! Well,I don't drink alcohol,I don't smoke,I don't go out partying,I don't buy expensive clothes(apart from underwear I haven't bought any clothes for about a month. I like to party by having lunches or tea parties so I will be able to use my pretty new things then!

I read this recently and I copied it and put it on my mirror so I would constantly see it and reflect upon it. The Dalai Lama's Recommendations for You I N S T R U C T I O N S F O R L I F E 1. Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk. 2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson. 3. Follow the three Rs: Respect for self Respect for others and Responsibility for all your actions. 4. Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck. 5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly. 6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship. 7. When you realise you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it. 8. Spend some time alone every day. 9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values. 10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer. 11. Live a good, honourable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time. 12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life. 13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation. Don't bring up the past. 14. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve immortality. 15. Be gentle with the earth. 16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been before. 17. Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other. 18. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it. 19. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon 1. Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk. Mmmmm! Perhaps I am getting cynical with old age but I personally wonder if any love , no matter how great, is worth the effort Of course I am not taking about the unconditional love we have for our family, especially our children.  However, guess how old I was when I wrote this in one of my journals? Deep is the stream Where flows a love That time will stop And lie down for. 19......No, just kidding. The answer is 49. So do we ever lose that desire? Probably not, we just store it away and let it collect dust because it is easier. I think that the problem is that we find it easier to do nothing and let life pass us by. And it is easier not to get your heart broken So if great love requires great risk then so do great achievements. But because we think of 'great achievements' as being something that is so unobtainable and  'surely must take a lot of effort'  we fail to do anything at all.   I truly believe my greatest achievements in life have nothing to do with any qualifications I may have acquired or any professional distinction I may have achieved.I believe my achievements lie in the ordinary but even the ordinary is not easy but takes super human effort at times.   In the book the Bell family by  Noel Streatfeild , Ginnie the daughter of a vicar in the East End of London comes to realise that life is not about performing heroic deeds but about the small achievements that we make daily. Personally, when I think about great love and great achievements I think of the following poem Ithaka by Constantine P. Cavafy As you set out for Ithaka hope your road is a long one, full of adventure, full of discovery. Laistrygonians, Cyclops, angry Poseidon-don't be afraid of them: you'll never find things like that on your way as long as you keep your thoughts raised high, as long as a rare excitement stirs your spirit and your body. Laistrygonians, Cyclops, wild Poseidon-you won't encounter them unless you bring them along inside your soul, unless your soul sets them up in front of you. Hope your road is a long one. May there be many summer mornings when, with what pleasure, what joy, you enter harbors you're seeing for the first time; may you stop at Phoenician trading stations to buy fine things, mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony, sensual perfume of every kind- as many sensual perfumes as you can; and may you visit many Egyptian cities to learn and go on learning from their scholars. Keep Ithaka always in your mind. Arriving there is what you're destined for. But don't hurry the journey at all. Better if it lasts for years, so you're old by the time you reach the island, wealthy with all you've gained on the way, not expecting Ithaka to make you rich. Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey. Without her you wouldn't have set out. She has nothing left to give you now. And if you find her poor, Ithaka won't have fooled you. Wise as you will have become, so full of experience, you'll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean  The destination of the journey is Ithaka. Ithaka is the island off the western coast of Greece to which Odysseus returned after the Trojan war. Odysseus\u2019s journey was a long and difficult one. It was ten years before he was able to rejoin his wife Penelope in Ithaka. However, Ithaka in this poem can also be understood as the destination of any journey, and it can be further understood metaphorically as a journey through life.  Is there no greater love than this or no greater achievements? I think perhaps there is. The mother who leaves the house at 5am to do a second cleaning job just to pay for food everyday before her fulltime job. The carerer/nurse who washes patients day in day out and changes their soiled bed linen.   The man who cleans the streets.   The teacher who spends hours teaching children to read and write.   The day in day out essential jobs that others don't always give true recognition to.

{"date": " September 23, 2009", "body": "\n Yesterday we went to IKEA and of course Beauty had her favourite meal of fish, chips and peas and TOMATO SAUCE! Whilst SnoWhite had her favourite meal of peas and chips(don't ask)! After our meal we went to Hobby Craft(may I add, nowhere near as good as Michael's) to buy some knitting needles which I managed with moments to spare as the shop was about to close. And then we drove home ........in the dark and in the rain! I have no problem driving in the dark but it was the combination of the rain and the dark that made mee realise that YES AUTUMN has truly arrived! And I especially know this because.......? The arthritis in my back kicked in with a vengenance yesterday morning and yes I do blame the weather! AND NOW FOR THE SCIENTIFIC BIT! Ask the Experts  - October 31, 2005 Does damp or wet weather really make arthritis pain worse? If so, how? Donald A. Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, explains. People with arthritis often believe that changes in the weather cause flare-ups of their disease. Decades of medical research, however, have failed to establish an objective relationship between arthritis severity and weather patterns. Moreover, detailed interviews with specific patients have yielded mostly anecdotes, and those who move to drier climates do not report major relief. The specific idea of dampness affecting arthritis symptoms seems an unlikely mechanism for a number of reasons. The skin surrounding joints is rather impervious to water and most people stay dry indoors during rain anyway. In addition, arthritis patients do not experience dramatic changes in their symptoms when immersed in water (such as during baths or swimming). Wet weather may also be associated with other climatic conditions, such as decreases in barometric pressures. But even this connection seems implausible, given that much greater pressure swings are tolerated easily during plane travel or mountain driving in a car. Another weather component is humidity, which might enter the body through the respiratory tract. But this seems an unlikely contributor because hospitalized patients are often given humidified air to breathe and this has little apparent effect on arthritis conditions. Furthermore, a long shower does not usually induce arthritis pain. None of the past studies investigating this link is flawless; hence, the possibility remains that a small association does exist between changes in the weather and flares in arthritis pain. Small associations would not explain the strength and popularity of the belief, however, considering that people do not reliably detect small correlations. In fact, studies from psychology suggest that people often see patterns even where none exist. A prime example is the capacity to visualize outlines of animals in overhead clouds. An even more compelling example is people's belief in streak basketball shooting even when scoring patterns follow a random sequence. The episodic nature of both arthritis pain and the weather can further encourage spurious beliefs because multiple components and time lags are possible with each element. By random chance, some days of dramatic weather will be followed by pain. Moreover, a single big coincidence is unforgettable. Over the years people may pay more attention to confirming evidence, neglect contrary evidence, and misinterpret ambiguous evidence thereby entrenching the belief. In contrast, a scientific approach would require a more rigorous search and recording of contrary information. Another axiom of science is dispassionate observation. Achieving this standard in clinical medicine often requires blinding, so that neither clinicians nor patients know what exposure is active. Failures of blinding allow conscious or subconscious factors to distort reporting. With the weather, of course, it's hard to be blind. Extinguishing the belief in a link between weather patterns and arthritis flare-ups requires a randomized trial, yet such a study is unlikely to be feasible anytime soon. Moreover, the failure to find a difference in such a trial might not be fully convincing because those who still believe in the correlation might claim that the participants were insufficient in number or unrepresentative of their experience. Ultimately, peoples' belief about wet weather and arthritis may reveal more about the workings of the mind than the body. Indeed, the innate tendency to identify patterns and discount randomness has evolutionary benefits because predictability can often be turned to advantage, whereas randomness is hard to exploit.   So this researcher seems to think NO , it can not be proven but what about the following Instead of  \"damp\" weather, there seems to be a correlation with arthritis flares and barometric pressure. In a Harvard Health Publication from 2007, it sited tests done on human and rats in controlled enviroments...the findings: arthritic rats appeared to suffer more pain with lowering of the barometric pressure; middle-aged and older people with osteoarthritis noted little or no effect of weather on their joint symptoms; and, among people with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis who believed strongly that there was a connection between weather and arthritis analysis of symptoms and weather changes demonstrated little or no effect. There are more than 100 types of arthritis -- it is possible that different types of arthritis will respond differently to changes in barometric pressure. Even though the results were inconclusive, in my personal case, there is a correlation between low barometric pressure and arthritis pain. I'm polyarthritic and the pain increases significantly just before a drop in pressure, and recedes once the pressure stabilizes. Since the studies focused on only two different types of arthritis,(rheumatoid and osteo) perhaps different types of arthritis are more sensitive to changes in pressure. So......the boring bit out of the way! The arthritis in the damage in my back is agony and NO(to the 1st researcher), your evidence may not prove my pain but PAIN IS DEFINITELY WHAT THE PATIENT SAYS IT IS!   I definitely feel a strong desire to holiday in Spain for the winter!  I love Fuerteventura .   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SrmxjXxaYsI/AAAAAAAABqc/dPePWAdjkfQ/s1600-h/tomatoketchup.jpg", "http://http//www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-damp-or-wet-weather", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SrmwxtNyVAI/AAAAAAAABqU/XJdo37Ey26o/s1600-h/FuerteventuraCanaryIslands.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-blame-bloody-rain.html", "title": "\nI BLAME THE BLOODY RAIN!\n"},

Lots of love to Belle and Beau. Love Mum x A SUGGESTION FOR A PIE YOU COULD MAKE ARIEL. CORNED BEEF HASH PIE Making the Shortcrust Pastry Ingredients        125g/4oz plain flour pinch of salt 55g/2oz butter, cubed 30-45ml/2-3 tbsp cold water                     Method      1. Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and add the cubes of butter. 2. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until you have a mixture that resembles coarse breadcrumbs with no large lumps of butter remaining. Try to work quickly so that it does not become greasy. 3. Using a knife, stir in just enough of the cold water to bind the dough together. 4. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and chill for 10-15 minutes before using. 5. Alternatively using a food processor, put the flour, butter and salt in the food processor and pulse until the fat is rubbed into the flour. 6. With the motor running, gradually add the water through the funnel until the dough comes together. Only add enough water to bind it and then stop. 7. Wrap the dough in clingfilm as before and chill for 10-15 minutes before using. Making the Mashed Potato. Cooking and preparation 15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking Ingredients 500g/1lb 2oz potatoes, such as Maris Piper 50g/1\u00beoz butter Milk salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste Method 1. Peel the potatoes and chop them in half. 2. Place the potatoes in a large pan of water over a high heat. Add a pinch of salt and bring to the boil. 3. Boil the potatoes gently until tender. When you can break the potatoes with a fork or cut them easily with a knife, they're done. Drain them in a colander. 4. Leave the potatoes in the colander until the steam has evaporated (about 3-4 minutes). If the potatoes are still wet when you start to mash, you will end up with watery mash. 5. Place the potatoes in a large bowl and mash them with a potato masher. The harder you work them, the lighter and fluffier they'll become. Don't use anything electrical. Electric whisks or food processors will ruin the texture. If you get tired, stop for a minute, shake your arms and then get back to it. 6. Once you're sure there are no more lumps in the potatoes, add the butter. 7. Mash the butter into the potato. Once it has melted into the mash, add some milk . Mash again and check the consistency, adding more milk if necessary. Taste and add a bit of salt and freshly ground black pepper, to your liking. Step by Step Step 1 Peel the potatoes and chop them in half. Step 2 Place the potatoes in a large pan of water over a high heat. Add a pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Boil the potatoes gently until tender. Step 3 Test them with a knife or fork. When you can break them easily with a knife, they're done. Step 4 Leave the potatoes in the colander until the steam has evaporated (about 3-4 minutes). If the potatoes are still wet when you start to mash, you'll end up with watery mash.

Step 6 Once you're sure there are no more lumps in the potatoes, add the butter.  Mash the butter into the potato. Step 7 Once the butter has melted into the mash, add some milk. Step 8 Mash again and check the consistency, adding more milk if necessary. Taste and add a bit of salt and freshly ground black pepper, to your liking. Open a tin of corned beef and cut into small pieces and mash into the potato. Roll out  half to line the dish and half to put on top. Pierce the pastry with a fork. Put in a pre-heated oven on gas mark 4 and cook until golden brown.

I also had the most hideous migraine on Sunday and I felt that a drive in the car might help. I felt that the cool air might help, forget the cool air - the smell of conditioner was so overwhelming that after less than 5 minutes in the car my head was well and truly relieved.Thankfully I had a bowl in the car! A good mother should always be prepared for every eventuality. Beauty has a found a page on the internet that lists all the Disney films ever made and each listing has a short clip attached to it. One of the films is quite recent and is about some puppies ( and I don't know what it is called) but the music with it is WE ARE FAMILY and Beauty has learned to sing WE ARE FAMILY,I'VE GOT ALL MY SISTERS WITH ME. I can't wait to video her singing it. This one is for Anastasia,Belle,SnoWhite,Ariel,Fiona and Beauty. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/04/yes-you-can-have-too-much-of-good-thing.html", "title": "\nYES YOU CAN HAVE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING!\n"},

{"date": " October 27, 2007", "body": "\nI know I have talked about watching Wife Swap before and I am sure many of you do not find it interesting but I have to mention yesterdays episode as I found it quite shocking. If you take part in wife swap and the new wife works for 16 hours a day cleaning,washing and cooking in your house , do you then become abusive and then start screaming and shouting and swearing at them when it isn't up to your standard?The OCD nature of someone who does housework for 16 hours a day is not really the issue but the behaviour of the person who expects another to do all that for you. If I had someone else in my house and  the work they did ,did not meet my 'exacting' standards then I would then finish the work off myself, without screaming and swearing and being abusive. Perhaps he was just doing it for the cameras! Actually, the thing I found most shocking was the wife of the screaming, swearing, abusive taxi driver Colin, I was shocked by Andrea's appearance  the moment I saw her. My mother was 69 when she died of cancer and my mother's skin was ravaged, probably from smoking, and Andrea's skin looked exactly the same. I just wanted to drag Andrea off to see a consultant and tell her to stop smoking.At most Andrea could only have been in her late 40's. There was also something else which I found very strange about the program.The other wife Karen and her husband shared a house with the wife's mother and step father  and Andrea the taxi driver's wife felt that this situation was very wrong and she even said it was 'DISGUSTING' that they lived together like that! And she was just so ANGRY when she said it, she was very vicious and spiteful, it was just odd behaviour. Where did that come from? I have a friend called Mary who lives on Gozo and I have known her since she was 13, she is an only child and has lived in the same house since she was born. She lives with her parents and her husband and her teenage son and daughter and they all live together in the family home. I have always been impressed with what Mary and her family have and if that kind of situation can work then I think it is brilliant. What is 'DISGUSTING' about that ? I'm still confused about why she should feel that way. We live in a strange world. It is only 10am and Beauty is pinging off the ceiling, I can see us  having a very busy day. She is flitting constantly from one activity to another, at present she is watching CBEEBIES on TV, she is watching Nina and the Neurones! I have uploaded a party video onto photobucket of Beauty blowing out the candles on her birthday cake, as there were other people at the party I have not put it onto blogger as they might not like that.If you can't remember the password girls then let me know. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/10/15-minutes-of-fame.html", "title": "\n15 MINUTES OF FAME\n"},
{"date": " November 05, 2007", "body": "\nTonight is Bonfire Night.....OFFICIALLY! But the fireworks have been going off every night across Cardiff since Halloween and I am sure they will continue for another week to come. As well as the fireworks we have to contend with the bonfires, the local children have been building and lighting bonfires for the last week and I am sure they will be building them for another week until their pyrotechnic desires are satiated for another year. I think this year has been more difficult than usual because the 5th November falls on a Monday, which means that many official firework displays have been on Saturday and Sunday but there will still be some official displays tonight and of course locals setting off their own fireworks and building their own bonfires. The air quality was awful last night and I suppose we can expect more of the same tonight. Tonight we will be taking Beauty for a walk down Cardiff Bay  as we will have a brilliant view of all the fireworks being set off all over Cardiff. I think that fireworks are very unsafe and there was even an accident at a display over the weekend so we will not be attending any displays but watching from a very safe distance. That will teach me never to take a nap! After picking Fiona up from college I decided to make Beauty lie down and take a nap and Fiona went with her and I fell asleep on the sofa. I awoke in the pitch black to what I thought sounded like bombs falling! It was half past five and the fireworks had started. I shot of the sofa and all I could think of was THE PIGS and BUNNY BOY, they were still outside and the piggies were running around their hutch going crazy! Thankfully they are now in and all is well, all I have to deal with now is marauding children trying to burn the contents of my garden!

Fiona has inherited her father's old Prinzflex 500 35mm camera( circa 1972/.74), as she is doing Art and wants to do a fashion degree and is very interested in photography, we decided she should start practicing on her father's  old camera. She is absolutely thrilled and  I have managed to get an instruction book off the internet.  When I was with her father  I was the only one who ever  used the camera so I am sure it  will be easy enough to show Fiona how to  use it. We have to look for a lens cap and a flash for it but it seems that EBAY has lots of things for sale for the Prinzflex. Of course Fiona would still like a new digital 35mm camera! Ariel had a laptop when she went to university as I didn't want her using the library late at night on the campus when she needed to write essays so the next thing on my list of things to buy is a new digital camera for Fiona as she wants to start a photography course next September. School started back yesterday but Beauty is still at home as she has a really productive cough and whilst some parents in Beauty's school send their children in with bad colds ,I(and the school) think it is better that a cough like Beauty has is better at home because it really is quite nasty.And I don't want the teachers and the other children getting the cough as it really isn't pleasant. So Beauty spent yesterday and today  playing with her wooden blocks(thank you M.), watching videos and playing educational games on Cbeebies. Beauty does love school but she doesn't miss it too much when she is not there as she has lots of toys and games to occupy her at home.She has also being paying a lot more attention to the piggies and the rabbit recently but I still have to watch her carefully when she is with them as she still doesn't realise that she can hurt them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/11/today-we-have-veryvery-she-is-smiling.html", "title": "\nDEFINITELY NOT WIND\n"},

{"date": " June 13, 2007", "body": "\nWhen I started training as a nurse in 1980 we were treated more as employees than students and were paid a salary rather than a bursary. In my early 30's I stared a degree in History and Welsh and because I had 5 small children I still did not feel like a student but now in my 40's I feel as if I live in a student household(constant arguing over housework). I LOVE the typical student breakfast of cold Pizza, in fact I love to eat cold pizza rather than hot pizza (left overs from last nights homemade, organic evening  meal). I think that having a 16 year old, a 17 year old and a 21 year old helps me to have a young outlook on life. But having a 6  year old as well makes me feel as if I am running a children's home. I also feel at times like a referee with the constant arguing(usually politics-Fiona and  SnoWhite ). Last night I had another of my infamous dreams, not sleeping properly makes me dream more. Last night I dreamt that I was a contestant on Big Brother with Anastasia,  SnoWhite , J ensen   Ackles (Dean-Supernatural) and  Jared  Padalecki (Sam-Supernatural). The five of us were in the final and Sam and Anastasia were evicted first, then myself and the final 2 were Dean and  SnoWhite . Unfortunately I awoke before I found out the winner! I didn't think it at the time but looking back  SnoWhite  must have been really upset that she was left with Dean as she REALLY likes Sam! I have got to the stage where I am only watching Big Brother on Fridays and reading the email updates, it is so boring this year. Anthea Perfect House Wife  is back but Ugly Betty has finished. I also watch Dr Who and Medium, sometimes I watch Cold Case and sometimes I watch Bones and of course 2 pints of lager is on constant repeat. With the way I talk about TV you would think that I watched it constantly but some days I watch none and most days I watch an hour or less. So that means 7 or less TV watching hours a week-that's not bad. I also never watch TV in the day-usually not before 9pm but I will make the exception for Anthea Perfect Housewife as it is on at 8pm and I do like the show a lot. I seem to have lost total interest in SOAPS, I know hardly anyone on  Eastenders , Corrie I have lost interest in and I also have no idea what is going on in  Emmerdale  though I do think it is the funniest of the 3 and it has  Marlon( Mark  Charnock ) who I think is the best soap actor. Last night Beauty would not go to bed and played the part of a typical 6 year old perfectly. First she kept saying KEYBOARD but when I wouldn't let her on the computer and kept putting her back to bed she started to say CRISPS. When I wouldn't give her any crisps  she started to say DRINK but because she had just had one I wouldn't give her one of those either. She settled for me singing her Christmas carols! She loves to listen to Mickey Mouse singing Christmas Carols so she knows all the words to the carols. Her favourite is Joy To The World. Beauty may be autistic but she didn't do anything last night that her sisters haven't done before her-cheeky little moo.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Ackles", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Padalecki", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/perfect_housewife/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Dingle"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/i-love-cold-pizza.html", "title": "\nI LOVE COLD PIZZA\n"},

This morning whilst looking through Beauty's basket of clean clothes for something for her to wear I suddenly feel that I am no longer looking for something for Beauty to wear but for SnoWhite to wear, something for a toddler SnoWhite to wear! She hasn't been a toddler for 18 years and boy was it a weird sensation. Not a time travel moment, or a flashback moment, nothing changed around me and nothing looked different moment, just I need to get more sleep moment! DAVID BOREANEZ Last night on TV I watched 2 episodes of  Bones,  the first time I have watched this show. I have previously read a book from the series and was looking forward to seeing the show but now I am not so sure about it. Having read all the  Kathy Reich  books which this series is based on, and they are really well written and interesting books, I have to say that the series is rubbish in comparison to the books.Sorry! However,  David Boreanaz  makes it highly watchable and the forensic aspect and investigatory work is also interesting but  Emily Deshanel  is badly cast(Wow! didn't that sound polite). I think my issue is probably based on the fact that I read all the books first. Will I watch it again? If it isn't on the same time as Supernatural, then probably. A few moments ago I heard Beauty say,'footballs' but it sounded too far away to be coming from the computer and I was right. No longer at the computer I found her raiding the fridge again but this time she was lining tomatoes up on the kitchen table and calling them ,'footballs'. I told her they were tomatoes and she said ,'Tomatoes, these are tomatoes'. In the last 2 days Beauty's language skills seem to have made another giant leap, she is now naming everything she sees and recognises. 'This is a dog' or 'This is a fish' or 'This is a pencil', her ability to speak is getting really good just no real conversational skills apart from , ' No, don't and stop it'' but then they are really just commands rather than part of a conversation. I have found that with Beauty you can try and teach her anything but she will only do it when she wants to , when she is good and ready. School has noticed this too! Prior to her doing something for herself I think her brain says , ' Don't bother, it will happen anyway' but when she realises herself that things will happen quicker if she does it herself then she does it herself. Beauty has been totally resistant to  PECS  at home , in school they have limited success, because she communicates what she wants without it. I believe that Beauty has learned best by doing everything at her own pace and she has made huge advancements. Don't get me wrong, Beauty goes to a brilliant autism specific unit in a special needs school, and she has the best of teaching and all the best therapies but the school will admit that she is a stubborn little moo(thank you girls, I hear you all saying ' like her mother!') and they will admit that they have to follow her lead. I believe that she takes in everything and uses what she learns when she is good and ready. It is difficult to know for sure but I really feel that Beauty has already taught herself to read, I think a lot of this is to do with the educational way comics are produced today and the way stories have words highlighted when they are spoken on the computer. The school uses a combination of therapies including  ABA-  Applied Behaviour Analysis,however  only a limited amount of ABA is used . I actively researched ABA and went to conferences and I really thought it was a  fantastic program BUT not for Beauty. I bought the manual and I do implement aspects of what I have learned but it wasn't for us as a whole time program . We have come a long way from the little girl who used to sit in her cot rocking and banging her head and doing nothing else, I remember thinking,'Is this it?'. Our present goals are * Toilet training- which is going really well * Learning Personal Dressing Skills-which is also going well and * Walking  Further-Beauty has  Loose Joint Syndrome She was very late walking and now can't walk far and has a wheel chair called Peggy, because she can't communicate well we still do not know if she is in pain when she walks. CHILDREN'S WHEELCHAIR And as for personality..............you couldn't ask for a sweeter more delightful child. In that way she is very much like Belle as a baby, Belle woke up with a smile on her face and went to sleep with a smile on her face. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://images.askmen.com/galleries/men/david-boreanaz/pictures/david-boreanaz-picture-1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.askmen.com/women/galleries/men/david-boreanaz/picture-1.html&amp;h=490&w=376&sz=32&hl=en&start=20&um=1&amp;tbnid=t5CRTCPI1tnQzM:&tbnh=130&tbnw=100&prev=/images%3Fq%3Ddavid%2Bboreanaz%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3D0Ov%26sa%3DN", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460627/", "http://www.kathyreichs.com/welcome.htm", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004770/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221043/", "http://www.pecs.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Behavior_Analysis", "http://www.cchs.net/health/health-info/docs/1700/1722.asp?index=3971", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://estore.websitepros.com/stores/DollsLikeMe/catalog/wheelchair.jpg&imgrefurl=http://estore.websitepros.com/DollsLikeMe/-strse-52/Wheelchair/Detail.bok&h=239&w=200&sz=20&hl=en&start=49&um=1&tbnid=Uk2Z75Zx2_2FLM:&tbnh=109&tbnw=91&prev=/images%3Fq%3DCHILDREN%2527S%2BWHEELCHAIR%26start%3D40%26ndsp%3D20%26svnum%3D10%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/weird-moments.html", "title": "\nWEIRD MOMENTS\n"},

In the film is a famous line spoken by  Dougray Scott  who plays Ian in  Desperate Housewives Greyo: Dylan Thomas called Swansea \"an ugly, lovely town\". Terry:  I'd call it... a Pretty Shitty City.   Greyo: Dylan Thomas didn't do as much f-----g cocaine as you, did he? So for us as a family the film has always been Pretty Shitty City! Anastasia's,Belle's,SnoWhites, Ariel's and Fiona's  father was born and brought up in Swansea and so they have visited the city many times and recognise lots of the places in the film. Belle also went to University in Swansea. According to an article on the BBC website Festival reunites cult film cast Ten years after its release,  the cast of cult film Twin Town are holding a reunion at a new literary festival. Rhys Ifans and his brother Llyr will be among those on stage this weekend in Laugharne for a reading of the script. Director Kevin Allen said for many involved it would be the first time they had seen each other since the film's 1997 premiere in Swansea. It was his first film as a director and he describes the experience as the best time he has had on a film set. Sometimes referred to as the Welsh Trainspotting, Twin Town followed the story of two brothers and their antics in an ever-escalating cycle of violence and revenge against the local \"Tafia\" boss Bryn Cartwright. Set in Swansea, it featured a cast of up-and-coming names such as Ifans and Dougray Scott, both now established Hollywood stars, and experienced Welsh character actors including Huw Ceredig and Brian Hibbard. \"Most of the cast - pretty much all apart from Dougray - are coming to Laugharne,\" said Allen, who now lives in Ireland but was brought up in Swansea. \"Filming seems like yesterday but I've spent five-and-a-half years in LA and had four kids since. \"A lot of us have not seen each other since the premiere - I have seen Rhys a bit in LA but I'm looking forward to catching up with a lot of the others. \"I've not had a time like that since - making a film in my home town with half my family in the cast.\" It also included his brother Keith, who most recently played the Sheriff of Nottingham in the BBC One series of Robin Hood. \"I saw the film just before Christmas at an Irish film festival - I think it was the first time for at least five years and I really enjoyed it,\" added Allen. \"I was not looking at it critically thinking why did I do this or that - I was genuinely laughing.                                  Rhys Ifans went on to star in films such Notting Hill with Julia Roberts                              \"I think what comes through is the energy we put into making it.\"    Although it took just over \u00a3700,000 at the UK box-office it found a much larger audience on video and DVD.    Allen said he was slightly surprised about the following it has developed - particularly outside of Wales - as he describes much of the humour as \"uniquely Welsh\".    He added: \"Huw Ceredig told me he was in a pub not that long ago and he could hear his own voice and it was two guys who had sampled some of his dialogue from the film onto their mobile phones.    \"I bump into people all over the world who know it - there was a Geordie roofer working in Hollywood with a Mexican gang and they were quoting lines.\" The cast re-union will be held on Sunday as one of the closing events of the Laugharne Weekend. It is the inaugural literary festival in the town and has attracted authors as diverse as New Order's Peter Hook and Welsh rugby legend JPR Williams. \"It's a great idea for festival - we are trying to put something similar together in Ireland - it'll be a good weekend,\" added Allen. Wow! Can it really be 10 years since this brilliant film was made? If you had asked me I would have said 5 years  at the most. And I also didn't realise that It also included his brother Keith, who most recently played the Sheriff of Nottingham in the BBC One series of Robin Hood. Keith Allen is also a firm favourite in our family. We thought he was absolutely brilliant in  Little Lady Fauntleroy which is a documentary Keith Allen spends some quality time with former child prodigy James Harries and his family. At first sight, they may seem to be a houseful of geniuses, but although every single member has a PhD in Metaphysics, we soon discover that some were purchased from a fake university in the USA, while the others were awarded to them by themselves. As the documentary proceeds, it eerily becomes apparent that this is a family that believes its own mythology. They regard themselves as morally, intellectually, and financially superior to the rest of society, even though the clan (housed in a mock mock-Tudor cottage in the middle of a Cardiff council estate) includes a convicted arsonist, an astral projectionist, a former Bunny Girl, a part-time private detective and a sex-change daughter (James is now Lauren), all of whom seem to live their lives in a parallel universe.    Written by   Sue Davies It has to be seen to be believed! Keith Allen is at his funniest when he totally loses it and tells the family EXACTLY what he thinks of them. Classic TV! Keith Allen for me is definitely one of the most entertaining actors/performers on TV. NEWS FOR THE FAMILY Did you read this one?

Beauty had another episode of the  night terrors  last night. According to  Wikipedia  Though there are a multitude of triggers, emotional stress during the previous day and a high fever are thought to precipitate most episodes. Beauty has had some kind of infection within the last few days so perhaps that is why there is a return of the night terrors Treating night terrors episodes. The consensus for treating night terror episodes is three-pronged: gentleness, disposal of anything nearby that might hurt the subject, and avoiding loud voices or movements that might frighten the subject further. It is also critical to remember that the person experiencing the terror is unaware that they are experiencing one. As a result, they may become even more agitated if told that \"it was just a dream,\" as they are quite convinced that the experience is real. The quickest remedy is simply to calm the person by telling the person that you are there for them or simply say, \"I'm here\" or \"I love you\". Telling the victim \"It's OK\" or \"nothing's there\" may agitate the sleeper further because feelings they are feeling are very real to them and obviously not \"OK\". However, simply knowing the person's source of \"calm\" helps immensely. If he/she has a favorite companion dog or cat, telling them that the cat or dog is warm in bed, safe and asleep, and that they need to sleep as well could also be a good trigger. Calm the person and convince them to \"go back to sleep\" In some cases, they may be calmed by the mere presence of a familiar person. Night terrors are transitory so medical help is often unnecessary, but options may range from treatment of sleep apnea to prescription of benzodiazepines and psychotherapy. A successfully used method for treating night terrors is to have the sufferer sit down and engage them in something light-hearted and harmless, such as television or easy conversation. This helps to distract the sufferer from their perceived experience, and let them regain normal consciousness . More calming, positive reinforcement can then be administered. Turning on lights and appliances like the TV or radio can also help transition the individual into normalcy, as a lit room with noise is more normal (while awake) than a dark, quiet room. I  have found the best way to help Beauty when a night terror episode happens is to get her back into bed and to lie down next to her and hold her hand. I stroke her hair and chat to her and put my arm around her and usually in less than half an hour Beauty is fast asleep again. If she has any memories of the night terrors I really have no way of knowing. WEATHER REPORT FROM HOME I hope the weather is nice with you girls. Beautifully sunny here and the temperature is supposed to rise to 16  degrees celsius  but I have just put the washing on the line  and it may be sunny but still quite bitingly cold. Let's hope the wind calms down so Beauty can play outside in the sunshine. When I cleaned the garden last week I threw all the old sand away so if I buy some new sand today then Beauty can play in the sandpit or we can take her to the park in her little red wagon. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120394/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0779084/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410975/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0858755/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0779084/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0858755/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814192/", "http://www.imdb.com/SearchPlotWriters?Sue%20Davies", "http://www.imdb.com/SearchPlotWriters?Sue%20Davies", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_terror", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_terror", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_terror"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/walk-in-park.html", "title": "\nA WALK IN THE PARK\n"},
{"date": " April 07, 2007", "body": "\nTo celebrate Spring and Easter, my girls filled my planters with fresh compost yesterday ready for the new plants and seeds. Ariel helped Beauty to do a planter all on her own, Beauty really enjoys tasks like these. Beauty loves to come and help when I am cooking, she loves to stir the pot on the cooker. In school they have a cooking lesson every week so she gets lots of experience in the kitchen. Beauty's hand appears to be less painful for her and her ability to spit medicine increases daily, if Beauty ever wanted to enter a   Beauty Pageant  then her medicine spitting talent would go down a storm. Beauty really had a poor night's sleep last night, at first I thought it was a return of the night terrors but it didn't really fit the usual pattern. Every few minutes for what felt the whole night, Beauty was moaning and groaning and finally got up at five am! She is now as happy  and bouncing around like a little bunny, watching The Hoobs. She hasn't watched The Hoobs for months and she greeted them when they came on TV like old friends. Ariel and I discussed photograph copyright yesterday as she felt I might not understand it! If I have ever breached copyright in the past when making my photo shop scrapbook pages or on my blog then I apologise. In future I will know what to do. Talking of pictures , I have previously said that my favourite painting in the Museum of Wales Cardiff is  Running Away With the Hairdresser  by Kevin  Sinnott . At present my favourite artist is  Angel Turner Dyke,  I talked about her work on my blog last October and I still think her work is brilliant.  Moon over Bourbon is my favourite painting of hers. I would love to use a similar colour scheme to paint scenes in Cardiff(though I am nowhere near as talented as she is). I am looking forward to some serious art work when my studio is finished.I am half way through sorting out my spare bedroom as an art studio, when it is finished it will also have a bed in it for visitors. Contrary to popular belief(my children!) I do not enjoy clutter and I love giving unwanted items to a charity shop. Runningman also enjoys disappearing on the weekends to car boot sales and getting rid of all my unwanted items.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/art/online/?action=show_works&item=707&type=artist", "http://www.neworleans-paintings.com/artistbio.html", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/04/celebrating-spring.html", "title": "\nCELEBRATING SPRING\n"},

{"date": " December 25, 2006", "body": "\nWE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR I never cease to be amazed at the vagaries of a child with autism. Beauty did not get up  until  9:30am,  SnoWhite , Ariel and Fiona were itching to wake her up. Finally up and dressed and wearing a Belle ball gown we managed to get Beauty to sit on the settee, half awake. First the girls opened their stockings...........mistake number one! The child who would previously not eat chocolate spent the entire morning trying to eat the chocolate OFF the Quality Street that she found in her stocking. Then we lost her to the computer to the  Cbeebies  site. After Christmas lunch I made the second mistake of the day. The first present that I gave her happened to be a bag of toy soldiers. For a family who is organic, vegetarian,  eco -friendly, tree-hugging and anti-war the toy soldiers do not fit in but I shall explain. She had a pack of soldiers given to her when she was going through her Toy Story phase, the video was on night and day. Well, in Toy Story the soldiers get stood on by the mother and that it so true, in our house they are always getting stood on and broken so I thought I would get a new pack for Christmas. The first soldiers were WWII American  GI's  but the new bag are medieval archers.  Beauty opened the bag of soldiers and began playing with them in the seat of the truck that  Pianoman  gave her for Christmas, and she also strapped  SnotBear  that Ariel gave her for Christmas in the seat of the truck and that was it for the rest of the day. Oh and the bear that Ariel gave to Beauty is called  SnotBear  because the first thing  that Beauty did with the bear was to use it as a tissue! I love children so much. By this time she has spent  2 hours playing with her new soldiers, she can be heard saying, 'I'm going to tell you a story''Once upon a time there was a wicked witch'. SnoWhite (21), Ariel(17) and Fiona(15) were like a bunch of 5 year  olds .We open our presents one at a time  going around the room and they actually said that they like it when the adult presents run out because they can open their presents more quickly! Nice children. My present from  Pianoman  was the hit of the day. My hands and elbows are not working well at the moment(arthritis) so I open the present with scissors, well when they saw what my presents was it was a case of 'ooh,ooh,ooh' and they dragged the present out of my hands and opened it for me. It was on my wish list............ a  DCR -DVD 105E  HANDYCAM ,  all I have to do now is figure out how it works! SnoWhite  had a sewing machine, a popcorn maker and a jewelry box plus loads more! Ariel had a stepper machine, an  uzi (toy I promise) and a  CHUV  (yes  chuv )passport holder plus loads more! For Fiona it was a Hello Kitty and  Pucca  'fest'. DVDs and a bike and loads more. For Beauty(as far as we know so far!) she has had a tea set, toy soldiers, Hello Kitty sweat shirt, Rudolph video , wagon and the pj's she is wearing in the photo from her sister Belle. Wagon I had  crocs  off Fiona, a  camcorder  off  Pianoman , a DVD off  Runningman , a  David  Cassidy  CD  off Beauty(oh yes), a cuckoo clock off Anastasia, Cinderella oven gloves and tea towel off Belle, a cake stand off  SnoWhite  and off Ariel  some  LUSH  stuff AND A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE CHRISTMAS LUNCH Lunch was as interesting as ever with Fiona and Ariel having chicken,  Runningman  had chicken , lamb and turkey,  Pianoman  had duck(which rhymes with yuk) whilst  SnoWhite  and I had the vegetarian option. Oh yes, and Beauty had fish! And lots and lots of  vegetables , my favourite.......yum,yum,yum! Food, glorious food! Princess for the day 'I would rather be on the computer!' 'Do my ears look big in these?' SO WHY DO I CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS? I do not believe in God BUT I want to. I celebrate Christmas because Fiona and Ariel still go to church so I do it for them. I celebrate Christmas  because Beauty must make her own choice on religion when she is older. I also celebrate the Winter Solstice as a re-affirmation of life. I celebrate the winter holiday as a celebration of family. And because of 'my lost saints' 'my childhood's faith' For what Christmas did mean to me and I wish  still did. XLIII. \"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...\" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of everyday's Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love thee with a passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints, --- I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life! --- and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.ciao.co.uk/Sony_Handycam_DCR_DVD105E__6473025", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.crocs.com/home.jsp", "http://www.ciao.co.uk/Sony_Handycam_DCR_DVD105E__6473025", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search/ref=pd_lpo_ix_dp_go_us_uk_en?keywords=david%20cassidy%20cd&tag=lpo%5Fixdpgousuken-21&index=blended", "http://www.lush.co.uk/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/we-wish-you-merry-christmas-and-happy.html", "title": ""},

{"date": " July 27, 2006", "body": "\n This morning I awoke to find a 5 foot blow up alligator staring at me from across the room, whilst most people would sit up in bed in shock and wonder what alternate universe they had entered, I merely closed my eyes and rolled over knowing that the information regarding the origin of the alligator would eventually come to me. And it did, and as you would expect in a house with 3 children on the autistic spectrum it made perfect sense. Fiona had entered the room (uninvited and without knocking) at 1.30am and when asked,' what the h_ll was she doing' she matter of factly told me that she thought that,'Beauty would like to see the alligator first thing in the morning'. My reaction was OK, in this house it is easier to go with the flow. Opinion has it that most people exist somewhere along the spectrum as far as autism is concerned and I can see that in people that I meet everyday and I think that is not a bad thing. Beauty's behaviours though are obvious and I sometimes feel that because of this she is easier to deal with than Fiona and SnoWhite whose behaviour at times just needs a good slap around the back of the head! Don't worry, even if I did slap Fiona or SnoWhite around the back of the head it wouldn't be child abuse beca use Fiona is bigger than me and she would punch me right back and as for SnoWhite, I think she would have such a psychotic episode and it would take me at least 3 weeks to waken from my coma(and of course at 20 she is no longer a child so it would be assault not child abuse!!!!) I also think that unreality is not confined to my home, at half past midnight I heard lots of voices going past my front window and so I looked out and was shocked to see approximately 25 boys from about the age of 7 through to teenagers happily walking along. The majority were without their t shirts. Why? I don't know, perhaps just because they could, IT'S A MYSTERY! Odd behaviour is not confined however to SnoWhite , Fiona and Beauty, the others have had their moments, for instance Ariel drop kicking the baby Jesus across the stage at a church nativity play and Anastasia and Belle eating their way through a pot of Tums. I have a whole host of other stories but I shall keep them to sell to the highest bidder when they are famous.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/alligator.jpg", "http://www.homegrocer.com/images/products/tums%20asst%2096.gif"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/07/when-unreality-is-norm.html", "title": "\nWHEN UNREALITY IS THE NORM\n"},

If I am to be the mother of the bride it will not be in a sack! Something more like this. Remember how Tom Cruise 'lost' his contract with his film company? Well now he has said sorry to Brooke Shields because of the things he said about her when she admitted to taking anti-depressants when she had post-natal depression.

I also remember the total belief I held as a child that Jesus was born that night all those years ago and I would love more than anything to return to that child like belief.Presents were never really that significant as I was growing up but the spiritual aspect of Christmas for me was definitely the most important thing. \"Favourite Christmas memory...\" As a child, going with my mother to the local woods to find a small log to make a Yule Log. \"Favourite Christmas song/carol...\" Now this is not so easy to answer. My favourite carol is IN THE BLEAK MID WINTER-I find it hauntingly beautiful but I also like the children's Christmas song LITTLE JESUS SWEETLY SLEEP. My favourite Christmas song is FAIRY TALE OF NEW YORK closely followed by the David Essex rendition of WINTER'S TALE. \"Favourite Christmas movie...\" I love the film Scrooged as it is so funny. \"Favourite Christmas character...\" Sadly, due to financial implications, as a child I never believed in Santa but I really loved the Christmas story and I think I liked the donkey best. As an adult, I do love the European Christmas traditions . In Austria where Anastasia lives, December 6th is the day Saint Nicholas, the giver     of gifts, makes his rounds accompanied by his     devilish assistant, Knecht Rupnecht, he can occasionally be seen roaming the streets     giving sweets and apples to good children while his companion playfully beckons     \"little sinners\" to feel the string of his golden rod. Spooky or what! \"Favourite Christmas ornament/object...\" Christmas baubles. I buy the girls a Christmas tree ornament every Christmas, so with 6 girls we have LOTS of tree ornaments.This years theme is stars. \"Plans for this Christmas...\" To do as little as possible. I love giving presents and I love to see people open them so I am looking forward to that. I also like to decorate the family graves, whilst South America may decorate theirs on The Day of the Dead,here the graves look very festive at Christmas.I once saw a man pouring a can of beer into a grave! \"Is Christmas your favourite holiday?\" Most definitely. I like the general overall atmosphere that lasts from November through to New Years Day. I would hate the thought of it being 'Christmas every day' but it would be so nice for some of that feeling to last all year.

Much of the discussion here is about SnoWhite`s imminent trip to Syria and Fiona`s trip to Vienna and especially what should SnoWhite take with her.And my answer is do not take too many clothes as it is certainly not a fashion show and nobody will notice(not even the smell) if you wear the same thing for your entire trip.Damascus is a very full and bustling and noisey and dusty place and is very ripe with lots of cooking and hot smells. Remember SnoWhite, no International Incidents! Last night was a baking night! I made Shepherds pie, I made one for Pianoman and his mother and two individual ones for IT man and a vegetarian option for SnoWhite and myself and the vegetarian one is almost all gone already. SnoWhite was hungry! This week I intend to make some Simnel cake with Beauty as I have always wanted to make some but have never got round to making one. As the weather seems to be set for rain,rain and more rain I think perhaps I had better hunt down some Easter recipes to keep Beauty occupied and off the video and the computer. Any baking suggestions girls? I have thought about cookies and nests but there must be more to Easter baking than that. Yesterday SnoWhite and I went to Bessemer Road Car Boot sale and we had quite an enjoyable time.We were looking for presents for Fiona for her birthday in May but I also bought some handknitted toys and a painting for my living room. We witness some quite funny haggling over prices IT IS 50P I`LL GIVE YOU 30P IT IS 50P I`LL GIVE YOU 30P I SAID 50P at this point we had walked on and could no longer hear the conversation! And another one for what looked like a nice pair of flip flops THEY ARE 50P 20p NO THEY ARE 50P 20P IF YOU DON`T WANT THEM AT 50P THEN LEAVE THEM at which point the stall holder took the flip flops off the woman and put them back on the stall then the Indian punters husband picked the flip flops up and said HOW MUCH and the stall holder said \u00a31 I love the stall holder! I would feel demeaned to haggle over a pair of 2nd hand flip flops. Though if my children were hungry and I was poor(again!) I would have no problem haggling over food for them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdmaI9_RvEI/AAAAAAAABiQ/OQpokD3i9aA/s1600-h/047.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdmaJPy54DI/AAAAAAAABiY/5fpovO_gXNA/s1600-h/053.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdmaJvf-7GI/AAAAAAAABio/SuWYwtWpBvs/s1600-h/054.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdmaJQBLQoI/AAAAAAAABig/ccG1Ahovqok/s1600-h/051.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdmctxInj8I/AAAAAAAABi4/1EICfuDy7oc/s1600-h/013.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SdmctsmbEBI/AAAAAAAABiw/fjKa9cMfZXs/s1600-h/019.JPG"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/04/baby-crying.html", "title": "\nBABY CRYING!\n"},

I know it is a strange thing to say but I couldn't cope with the earnestness of being young again, only the young have the energy for that! Fiona watched Big Brother last night and it was the first time I had watched it this season and I was so shocked at the bullying behaviour. I KNOW my girls would NEVER behave like that.

FROM WIKIPEDIA Cyberchondria  is a colloquial term for hypochondria in individuals who have researched medical conditions on the  Internet . The media and the Internet often contribute to hypochondria, as articles, TV shows and advertisements regarding serious illnesses such as  cancer  and  multiple sclerosis  (some of the common diseases hypochondriacs think they have) often portray these diseases as being random, obscure and somewhat inevitable. Inaccurate portrayal of risk and the identification of non-specific symptoms as signs of serious illness contribute to exacerbating the hypochondriac\u2019s fear that they actually have that illness. I personally think this is not true. I have learned so much from the internet which has helped with Beauty and as for me, I Google the symptoms and when I get the answers I think BRILLIANT I do not have to go to the Doctor.

When we saw her she had just been fed and she was sleeping and looked so lovely. Dotty is a bonny little thing. On the way back we stopped by my brothers house and then decided to come back along Holton Road inBarry and we had to stop quickly to avoid a fox in the middle of the road. It was quite fascinating to watch the fox wander in and out of the gardens and not much different to the locals dogs I suppose as the fox was in the bin bags!It felt like quite an honour really to be able to see such a wild creature so close up. We live quite close to a small woods and Fiona said she had seen a fox from her bedroom window outside the shop opposite. Neighbours have said they have heard the foxes in the school playground at night, the playground is just behind our house and next to the woods. It takes me approximately 10>15 minutes to drive into the centre of town, a capital city yet we live less than 5 minutes walk from the countryside. The position of where we live is not too bad and with the regeneration work the view of where we live is also improv ing. Beauty is still asleep and how do I know?

Contrary to popular belief, I do not watch a lot of TV and I think it was the watching of the film Patriot Games AFTER reading the novel that put me off watching further dramatisations. The film Patriot Games was good but it just wasn't the book and About A Boy (although no great literary work!) really disappointed me. To me the book About A Boy centred a lot around the death of Kurt Coban and where was that in the film? However,there are exceptions -  Northanger Abbey  and  Tess.

However, after surfing the web, I have read that it is possible. I have all the symptoms except I can still walk around  so it can't be that bad.I had the jab because Beauty has been sick since September with different viruses, she now has a runny nose type cold-well that's something to look forward to as we still have the remains of the last virus that she gave us-an upper respiratory infection that we all still have.Luckily Beauty is rarely very ill will her infections and will take herself to bed if she really feels poorly. She can't be too bad as she broke another 6 eggs last night!~I am going to buy a tub to hide them in so she can not find them so easily in the fridge-or a fridge lock! I am not sure how you spell the word but there is a  word that I have only heard used in Wales- WILMENTING- it means to be into everything and it aptly describes Beauty's behaviour of late. She is into absolutely everything all the time. She cannot be left for a second. Eggs are definitely her favourite but yesterday she also destroyed a box of SMARTIES Christmas tree decorations. She didn't want to eat them, she just broke the chocolate and broke it into small pieces.AND the pieces were strewn everywhere. She also loves to scatter the hay everywhere, empty the salt, line up videos and count vegetables(I FOUND A POTATO WITH PINS STUCK IN IT!). She is also constantly turning up the thermostat in the fridge, the piggy boys were not impressed with carrots for supper on Saturday because she had frozen the cucumber. On to other more important things-TV! Letitia Dean is out of  Strictly Come Dancing  and Nicky is out of  X Factor, I really liked Letita Deans dancing and I thought she was good enough to win and whilst Same Difference are a highly entertaining duet-for a stage show or Disney , Nicki deserved to still be in as she is a very talented singer.

I also feel that Charlie Brooks(Janine from Eastenders) was brilliant as the mother , Robin told her she needed to improve her parenting skills -well she was prepared to cut her children's arms off to make them look like convincing beggars!

I have a monetary limit on what I spend on the girls(allegedly) and it usually works quite well.However a nursing sister that I worked with a few years ago would spend \u00a31000 on each of her 2 children every Christmas and I remember thinking at the time that  \u00a31000 each was a  criminal amount to be spending.With the money I spend on  my girls, presents for friends and relatives and  food for the holiday period, the total I spend does not come to \u00a31000.

The little boy was in the middle of a conversation and I heard him say, 'you know, the girl with the brown face on her' and the mother immediately looked embarrassed and start shouting that he shouldn't be saying that. No explanation just a lot of shouting. I did feel sorry for the little boy because he had meant no offense at all and the mother could easily have said something like' Oh that's not nice, the little girl might be upset by what you said'. I actually thought his personal observation was fine and showed no  meanness  but  it was just a description. I sometimes think we are too PC and cause more problems by pushing PC views onto little children. I personally feel that racism is very wrong and taught my children this from a very young age . Belle and Anastasia both had best friends when they were little who were the children of African Americans serving at  Greenham  Common airbase in the 80's and I know for sure that  Snowhite  was totally unaware that her friends skin colour was different to her own or a problem. I remember being shocked in the early 80's that  people started to use the  term BLACK (to describe skin colour)in the UK , I was shocked because I didn't want these people to be upset by the reference. How times change! As I have said before, I remember how as a nation we were shocked by John McEnroe's  Mother.............. in the 1970's and now look at us(or listen to us)!  I show my age when I use the terms plonker and wally, I know I use them because I don't want to hurt peoples feelings when I insult their bad driving-silly moo. When I went into the chemist my desire to shout HE GETS it(from Two Pints of Lager) almost seriously got me into trouble. A grandmother with her daughter and grandson were waiting for a prescription and were looking at the things in the shop. The grandson was about 18 months and toddling around looking at things, well every time the grandson went near something(not touching) the grand mother would yell NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO .........................DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T . I felt a huge desire to yell at the grand mother NO what? and Don't what repeatedly. She repeated her NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO .........................DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T  so much that on leaving the chemist my nerves were so frayed that I felt in desperate need of drugs. I don't take Beauty to the chemist any more as on the last 2 occasions that we visited together she fell asleep on the floor in the shop by the till and getting her back to the car was a mammoth task. I am also not too keen on her being there when punters have their daily dose of methadone as a number of them have been a little worse for wear from their other drug of choice-alcohol. As a nurse who trained initially as a mental health nurse I am all for treatments like methadone, I just think that giving it out so visibly in a chemist is an issue not just for me but for the punters. A little bit of discretion would go a long way in this kind of situation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.html", "title": "\nNO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!\n"},
{"date": " June 27, 2007", "body": "\nI love the little piggies but they are still such timid creatures. Their new hutch is in the back of the kitchen opposite the computers and so they have company a lot of the day but every time some one moves they move faster than Linford Christie and are back in their cwtch.I feel a bit like Dolly Parton in the film Nine to Five, I do the best I can with the piggies-I feed them, clean then, water them, give them treats, cuddle them and put them out in the run to play and still they go into panic mode when I move the slightest. I just don't understand why they don't seem to like me-oh well perhaps time will make them less shy and nervous. No piggies to be seen,still hiding. Lilly Rose eating hers and Betty Sue's treat. Last night when the piggies were in the run in the lounge playing whilst I watched TV Beauty came in and started to play with the piggies. I was so impressed! Since the piggies came home she has not really paid them much attention but she came in, sat beside the piggies and put her hands into the run and the piggies came up and softly rubbed against her fingers. It was as if the piggies realised that Beauty was really just a little one like them really. We had a similar situation when Beauty was still small. When Fiona and Ariel came up to her and held her or played with her she reacted differently to when SnoWhite, Belle and  Anastasia came up to her,even though Ariel and Fiona were the size of adults it was if she sensed they weren't really and she seemed to instantly trust her older sisters more. What do you think of the cup cakes that Fiona made? I took some to school for Beauty's teachers. Did any body see the US version of  Wife Swap  that was on TV last night? The first couple were white and lived in upstate New York and in their manual stated they used the F word and the N word a lot! How someone could admit to using the N word on national TV is beyond understanding. The mother stayed in bed until mid-day and then went to work as a phone operator in a taxi company and at midnight went to the casinos and got home to bed at about 6am. She spent very little time with her children and her husband did all the house work(and she was not exactly slim-this is significant!) and there was no discipline at all in the house. The second family were black and the father is an ex-marine. The mother kept the house spotless and also did child minding whilst the sons did lots of sports and helped with the house work. The father also white glove checked the boys room for dust and the mother often phoned the boys to find out where they were but she did admit at the start that this was obsessive. But all in all they were a nice family. Well I 'm sorry but at the table at the end of the swap the first thing the upstate New York wife did was to ridicule the other wife and call her fat(pot-kettle-black).........the other wife then called the New York wife white trash and tried to slap the other wife. If it had been me I would have given the upstate New York wife a  Glaswegian handshake(or Kiss)  and I would have been so fast across the table( bad back or not), nobody would have been able to stop me. I don't know about any one else but if I had 2 teenage boys who were black, and these seemed especially well behaved and nice boys ,I would worry about them all the time. We have had a number of cases in  the UK where really nice boys ,well behaved and NEVER in trouble have been killed by other youths. It is almost as if because they are good they are picked on. I once worked with another nurse whose daughter and grandson came to visit them from London, the son wanted to buy his grandmother a present and so asked his mum for some money and ran to the shops to buy some. On the way back , he was running so as not to miss the train, he was stopped by police,who assumed because he was running with the chocolates and he was black that he must have stolen the chocolates. The police said they had heard about  children stealing in the area and the lad fitted the description-what that he was black? I have heard that excuse before, we were stopped by police once going to the train station to catch the first train to London for a job interview. The person giving me a lift was driving a typical lad though he was in his 40's and definitely not a lad and the police were very obviously embarrassed when they realsised their mistake. Their excuse ' Oh the car matched a description we had'- I felt like asking'What description, the one of a white car with four wheels? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/W/wife_swap_usa/index.html", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=glaswegian+kiss"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/cup-cakes.html", "title": "\nCUP CAKES\n"},

Now that is definite improvement.

Low-carb diet 'cancer risk' claim                                                                                                                                                             Low carbohydrate dieters can eat larger amounts of meat                             Low-carbohydrate diets may increase the risk of people suffering bowel cancer, scientists have claimed.     Researchers from Aberdeen's Rowett Research Institute believe there is a link between eating less carbohydrate and reducing cancer-fighting bacteria.    The Rowett study saw 19 overweight men given three diets containing different levels of carbohydrate.    Low-carbohydrate diets, such as Atkins, have their critics, however supporters say studies have shown effectiveness.

The acid, called butyrate, is produced by bacteria and helps kill off cancerous cells.    The researchers said they found low-carbohydrate regimes could cause a four-fold reduction in the cancer-fighting bacteria.   BUT A high carb diet puts me at risk of the following A high-carbohydrate diet increases the risk of heart disease.  *  THE STUDY AND RESULTS    Harvard University researchers surveyed 75,521 women between the ages of 38 to 63 participating in a larger Nurses' Health Study. The women did not have any history of diabetes or heart disease. Using dietary information the women provided, the researchers calculated a value they called the glycemic load for each woman, based on the carbohydrate content of the foods consumed and calculations of how that food would increase blood sugar. The calculations also controlled for the amount of fat the women ate. Ten years later, 761 women had developed heart disease, 208 of whom had died from the disease.

Why do teenagers pick their noses? Why does toast usually fall buttered side down? Frivolous questions perhaps, but to Marc Abrahams, this is serious work. Abrahams is the founder of the Ig Nobel Prizes. Like the Nobel prizes, which laud the world's brightest minds for writing top-notch literature or making the world a better place through scientific achievement, the Ig Nobels are awarded once a year. Since 1991, Abrahams has been handing out prizes to people whose achievements \"cannot or should not be reproduced\". One of the first winners was the former US vice-president Dan Quayle, who took the education award for \"demonstrating, better than anyone else, the need for science education\". Among the gaffes that won Quayle his Ig were: \"It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it.\" Now Abrahams has compiled a book,  The Ig Nobel Prizes: The Annals of Improbable Research , which offers insight into some of the most bizarre research ever presented with a straight face. Among the classic research recalled is a scientific paper penned by three Scottish doctors entitled \"The Collapse of Toilets in Glasgow\". After three patients in six months showed up in their emergency room with injuries sustained while sitting on lavatories, the intrepid doctors decided to investigate. \"Excessive age of the toilets was implicated as a causative factor. As many toilets get older episodes of collapse may become more common, resulting in further injuries,\" the doctors wrote in their groundbreaking 1993 paper. \"An obvious way of using a toilet without fear of collapse is . . . not to sit down, but to adopt a hovering stance,\" the paper offered by way of a solution. For Abrahams, the key to winning an Ig is to have produced something where \"the only reaction that is at all reasonable is that it makes you laugh and you think about it afterwards.\" And there was me looking forward to eating copious amounts of bread again. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://integral-options.blogspot.com/2007/06/speedlinking-61907.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwfpopbGok4", "http://www.lowcarb.ca/articles/article152.html", "http://www.newstarget.com/001673.html", "http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/325/7364/566", "http://www.smh.com.au/1013381511140.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/19/1063625216093.html?from=storyrhs", "http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/19/1063625216093.html?from=storyrhs"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/let-them-eat-cakeand-lots-of-bread.html", "title": "\nLET THEM EAT CAKE(AND LOTS OF BREAD!)\n"},

The Healthcare Commission is to go into 120 NHS trusts unannounced in the next year to check cleanliness standards and infection control procedures. The watchdog has new powers under the Health Act 2006 to order trusts to improve their standards. It comes as the NHS struggles to meet  the government's target of halving MRSA \"superbug rates\" between 2004 and 2008.

{"date": " June 04, 2007", "body": "\nHas our mental health deteriorated with this Brave New world that we live in or do we feel more comfortable showing our feelings?                                                                                                                                                                   A rising number of workers are said to be suffering stress                             Mental illness is now the second largest reason for UK workers taking time off, a report suggests.       A study by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found an increasing amount of sickness leave is due to depression or stress.    Analysis of the records of 30,000 people found only muscle-related problems such as bad backs were cited as a greater cause of absenteeism.    Staff with depression were said to take an average 30 days off annually.      Those with stress were reported to be away for 21 days.    The CPID found public sector workers were more likely to take time off work because of mental illness and overall the problem was more prevalent among older staff. Are we sicker than we used to be? Or do we feel more  comfortable discussing our feelings? Or does Employment legislation make it easier for staff to take time off whenever they want to? For example,many people believe there is an autism epidemic. Wikipedia  reports The reported  incidence of autism  varies considerably between countries. Increases in reported incidence of autism in some countries have been attributed to a variety of causes including  environmental factors  and higher reporting of cases due to an increased medical and societal interest in autism. Is this true?Maybe. Many  people believe  that Heavy metal poisoning has a lot to do with the increase in symptoms of autism though  others do not share this opinion. Are we just more aware of what is going on in the world due to the internet and the global village that we live in? Do people who who take time off with Mental Illness' really have these illness' or does employment legislation make it easy for these individuals to take time off whenever they feel like it? I personally am glad that people who really do have these illnesses have the opportunity to take time off work when they need to, as a Mental Health trained nurse I have always felt that more awareness was important. I have always tried to pass on to my children that Mental health, good or bad is something that all individuals experience in their life and so it is OK to feel sad one day, sadder the next and better the following day. I feel that Mental Health like Autism is a spectrum except that we as individuals move along the spectrum more rapidly than with Autism. Having friends who have worked as civil servants however I have heard of situations where employment legislation is seriously exploited to suit the needs of the individual but of course who is to say that the day an individual 'throws a sickie' that emotionally they didn't really need that time off. Remember PAIN IS WHAT THE PATIENT SAYS IT IS or so I was taught during nurses training and something I agree with. The report goes on to say   \"This research shows how important it is for managers and HR practitioners to be aware of the signs of mental ill health so that they can take action early and provide support before the individual's condition deteriorates to the point they go off on long-term sick leave,\" said Ben Willmott, CIPD employee relations adviser.    He called on the government to provide tax incentives to encourage more firms to offer occupational health services.   and as I read this I thought OH REALLY! Ariel has broken a toe and a finger in the last year, the toe in an accident at home and the finger in Army Cadet related incident(remember she is going to join the army as an officer after her Arabic and Middle Eastern studies degree)..........well her World Wide  family friendly employer who she works part time for just  a few hours a week has given her an official warning for taking  time off due to her injuries. The HR employee who gave her the warning also told her when Ariel said that due to her injuries she wasn't able to work that she should not engage in dangerous activities outside of work that may affect(I am never sure if I should write affect or effect-sorry) her ability to work. Ariel didn't tell me at the time that the interview was going to happen, remember she is only 17 and still a child and was interviewed without my knowledge, I was livid that she was spoken to this way. No matter how much HR in the civil service would LOVE to say something like that they have enough intelligence to know that it would get their asses sued if they did. The moral of the story........ just because your employer uses renewable forests to make their furniture and makes really good meatballs doesn't necessarily make them good people. Thoughts on  BIG BROTHER It was a choice last night between Big Brother and  Supernatura l, Fiona wanted Big Brother and I wanted Supernatural( who wouldn't want to just sit and watch Jensen Ackles?)and I won but Fiona got to flick during the adverts so we were able to see some of both shows. Please Charley stop being so argumentative as it certainly is not making you very popular, Carol made a good point over the food debacle though. Charley was called to eat   3 times and by the time that she got there(much later) the food was all gone and so she called ALL the others 'greedy f--kers', (what a nice girl) for eating her food. Carol tried to explain the situation but Charley wouldn't listen and said that people who had nothing to do with the situation shouldn't get involved but Charley involved everyone by calling them all greedy. Carol told Charley that the fridge was full of food and that she should be grateful as they were better off than some people which of course did not impress Charley. I felt really sorry for the twins as they seemed to sit there in shock at what was going on. Having 6 girls I can tell you that these girls are not your average 18 year olds and they seem more like 15 or 16 year olds, from what I can see they seem to be very sweet, pleasant girls and I wonder how they are going to cope with  the house as the individual house mates get to know each other better and more arguments occur. Remember Glyn last year? He too was a very young 18 year old. He didn't cope very well with the arguments. I still cannot comprehend why Lesley at 60 chose to go into the house, she doesn't seem to be coping very well. When I saw he arrive I immediately thought '3 days and she will be gone', well she is still there but she doesn't seem very happy. Carol is 53 and I can see how she would see it as a life experience and enjoy it, I love Carol........I think she is a star. It has been a while since I have written this much on TV shows but I have to mention the 2 part Dr Who that finished showing this weekend THE FAMILY OF BLOOD. I thought it was brilliant.  Doctor Who  was hiding out in 1913 from The Family who needed a time lord to help them live forever(well I think that was the premise). We saw the Doctor fall in love and also a possible future of him with a family and growing old and dying.We also saw the boys at the school where he was hiding and we saw the boys  in WW1, and we saw the boys grow old and issues such as loss of innocence and futility of war were also explored and it brought tears to my eyes. It was very well done. I found it as emotive as the final episode of Black Adder where they are in the trenches and they all go over the top of the trench. Definitely one of the best episodes so far. It has arrived...........the Whitsun holiday is finally over and Beauty is back to school today. It may have only been a week but it felt like a lot longer.And also my computer class resumes today, a little bit of normality for approximately 6 weeks until they break up for the summer holidays.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6717573.stm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_%28incidence%29", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor", "http://www.geocities.com/autism_mercury/faq.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/back-to-school.html", "title": "\nBACK TO SCHOOL\n"},

I think I should buy one just to keep in the car. And from PianoMan she had a  Silver Cross pram Beauty is still not brilliant at pretend play and so we thought that a pram might help, a very STRONG but DURABLE pram due to Beauty's ability to destroy anything.Also due to the fact that I have 3 daughters in their 20's, it will also be something my grandchildren can use!That is one of the problems with my house, it just isn't big enough because my girls will not let me throw anything away as they love ALL of Beauty's things so much that they want them for their own children.

{"date": " May 13, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday evening we were walking around  IKEA  , we were there to buy a desk using Fiona's birthday money.Going through the section that sells pictures frames and prints we passed 2 young men looking at frames and it was pretty obvious from the way that they were talking and behaving that they were gay. I personally have no issue with a persons sexual persuasion, as I have said before, I believe that what you are is what you are and it is not my job to judge anybody. I have heard people say that they do not like to think about homosexuals having sex as they think it is disgusting, I personally have no desire to think about anyone having sex, straight, gay or any shade of whatever. As we passed the 2 young men I heard 2 men in front making gay jokes and generally being unkind about the young men that had passed, I am not sure if the 2 young men heard them but the behaviour was still unacceptable. I made the mistake of telling  SnoWhite  what I had heard, she flew through the store like an  Exocet  missile on a mission and I was a bit unnerved that she might say something but luckily she had lost some steam by the time we reached the checkouts. However, by chance we ended up in the checkouts right behind them,luckily I was able to control her..........mostly! She contented herself with discussing their female companions(who were sitting waiting at a distance) and how she felt that they had fallen from the ugly tree and hit every branch going down! All that I can say is that time had not been kind to these ladies and thankfully I was able to keep   SnoWhites  decibel levels down enough to save us from a retaliatory strike.  SnoWhite  has a literal mind,if you are mean to someone then karma will bite you in the butt and as everyone knows  SnoWhite  loves her Karma perfume. Having grown up as the victim of much bullying I feel strongly about bullying and I am glad that these ladies did not hear what was being said about them but what the 2 men said was wrong and I am a strong believer in karma or whatever others may call it and I believe that it will 'bite their butts' one day. For now though I shall have to content myself with putting a leash and muzzle on  SnoWhite , an autistic mind can be a very complicated(or simple in  SnoWhites  case)thing! Today found us in another potentially volatile situation! A christening. A sort-of-relative but also the mother was the sister of  SnoWhite's  friend from work. The-sort- of-relative was the mother's boyfriend but they are no longer together so it is a bit of a difficult situation, we were in a way the 'out-laws' not the 'in-laws' but  SnoWhite  being the sister's friend made it cool. What can I say in case one of them reads this blog? The christening was enlivened by Beauty trying to play the piano, singing the Neighbours theme tune, Beauty trying to take her dress off and Beauty repeatedly singing the  ASDA ( Walmart ) radio jingle and constantly saying the end, in the car and in the buggy to make us leave. The party was in The Eastern Leisure Centre and it was really good as they had the Bouncy castle and soft play out. The baby is a little  sweety .........what more can I say?

{"date": " May 01, 2007", "body": "\nDoes anyone believe that the NHS has been a success? Recognise NHS success, says Blair Tony Blair has admitted his NHS reforms have been \"really tough\" for staff but said waiting list cuts, new hospitals and more staff were a sign of success. He said he did not think there would be a reversal of the \"essential course\" of more choice for patients and greater competition between health providers. And he said he expected NHS staff to make a \"more rational assessment at the conclusion\" of the reform process. Both the Lib Dems and the Tories say the 10 years have been wasted. He was addressing a medical audience two days after  junior doctors called for Health Secretary  Patricia Hewitt to resign. On Saturday, the British Medical Association's junior doctors conference called the online Medical Training Application Service for doctors' jobs \"shambolic\". If waiting lists have been cut and new hospitals built then I believe it has been because money has been taken from other places to pay for it. Peter has been robbed to pay Paul.       Nurses ready for action over pay                          By Nick Triggle                                                                                                             BBC News, health reporter Nurse leaders have threatened to take industrial action unless ministers make a U-turn on their \"miserly\" pay offer. The government has offered nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland a 1.5% pay rise this month with another 1% to come in November. But nurses at the Royal College of Nursing annual conference said the government should agree a full 2.5% immediately - as in Scotland.  Would Mr Blair be happy to live on this salary? Would he feel respected and appreciated if this is the salary he was offered after all his hard work? The Nurses are not the only ones complaining.       Strike threat over NHS pay talks Porters, cleaners and other ancillary health workers are threatening strike action after talks with employers ended without agreement. Their unions are unhappy with the government's decision to stagger a 2.5% pay rise, which they say reduces the value of the award to 1.9%. The offer to about 300,000 non-clinical staff is the same as that made to nurses. Unison has warned it will ballot members unless the offer is improved. Mike Jackson of Unison said the \"impasse means that we have moved a step closer to staff taking industrial action. \"This is always a last resort but with living costs soaring annually to almost 5% it is hugely unrealistic to expect our hard-working health members to survive over the next year with effectively just a 1.9% pay increase.\" And back to bugs!       Hospital bugs Deadly hospital bugs have hogged the headlines in recent years. There are many different types of infections patients can pick up in hospital, but the two that have received the most coverage are MRSA and Clostridium difficile.                       C. difficile is a bacterium found in the gut of up to 3% of healthy adults and 66% of infants, although it rarely causes problems.However, certain antibiotics can disturb the normal balance, allowing the bug to thrive and causing severe diarrhoea and in some cases severe inflammation of the bowel which can be life threatening. Over 65s are most at risk.MRSA infections occur where there is opportunity for MRSA to get into the body, such as at surgical wounds or where a catheter or needle is inserted.It is no more dangerous than many other infections, but because it has developed resistance to methicillin and other antibiotics, it is much more difficult to treat. Combating MRSA and C. difficile.There has been a big push on ward cleaning and personal hygiene to combat MRSA.Tactics include providing disinfectant hand-rubs and encouraging more vigilance among patients and visitors.For C. difficile, the tactics are slightly different. Rigorous cleaning has an effect on the bug, but unlike MRSA, it is not resistant to antibiotics and can be treated relatively easily if identified quickly and the patient is not too weak. MRSA rates hit a high in 2003-4 when there were 7,684. Since then they have been steadily falling, but not quickly enough to meet the target of halving the rate by 2008 to bring it under 4,000. C. difficile has only come to national attention more recently. The rate of infection is still rising - up 8% in the last year to over 50,000.But experts point out the rate of increase is slowing, which may signify the corner is starting to be turned.The National Audit Office estimates that hospital-acquired infections are costing the NHS about \u00a31bn a year.C. difficile is mentioned on more death certificates than MRSA.According to the Office for National Statistics, C. difficile was linked to 3,800 deaths in 2004-5 and MRSA, 1,629 deaths.But that has to be seen in the context that C. difficile is nearly 10 times more common than MRSA. The National Audit Office  estimates that Super Bugs are costing the NHS about \u00a31bn a year  (and many lives) and it has been said    '  a big push on ward cleaning and personal hygiene'  is happening, then why doesn't the Government spent \u00a31bn on more cleaners, nursing staff and education to combat the situation. Surely that would work? Prevention is better than cure. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6605865.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6605865.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6560477.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6601823.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6601823.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6595257.stm", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6595257.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/05/is-nhs-failing.html", "title": "\nIS THE NHS FAILING?\n"},

{"date": " March 30, 2007", "body": "\n After getting up so early not even the appeal of the computer could keep Beauty awake Sleeping Beauty Beauty's bad hand, she loves to chew here hands! She really loves the plaster. The other night night I went to a Tesco superstore late in the evening to buy things for school for the next day and I felt that I had walked into a nurses convention. I was surrounded by nurses who must have just finished their shift and were shopping on their way home.............whilst wearing their uniforms! I walked past 2 student nurses looking at clothes who were holding the clothes against their uniforms whilst looking in the mirror. I am glad that I did not confront them in the store as I probably would have been thrown out. Having had MRSA which the Doctor told me afterwards he didn't think would heal and a friend  who died of MRSA, I feel very strongly about this subject. I would however like to admit that ONCE I did go home in uniform(but I went straight home and did not go shopping) and felt so guilty that I never did it again, Remember I was trained in a time that you couldn't go  out wearing your uniform without your hat ! I still have my original cape! We were also told that we were not allowed to smoke whilst in uniform. Well that one certainly no longer applies! I read this this morning,        NHS staff 'would not be patients Nearly two thirds of health staff would not be happy to be a patient in their own NHS trust, a survey shows. The Healthcare Commission poll of more than 128,000 workers also found just 45% felt patients were a top priority. And the watchdog urged the NHS to \"redouble efforts\" to cut violence against staff with one in three reporting attacks in the last year. Patient groups said views on patient care were \"deeply worrying\" and caused by the financial pressures in the NHS. I have worked on many wards and in many hospitals due to having done agency nursing and I have found that over 95% of nurses I have met are really good, hard working people. BUT sometimes I have gone to wards and found individual nurses who didn't get off their butts the whole time I was there. I am sure that this is the same wherever you work, whatever the occupation. The other nurses seem to run around like headless chickens , unable to do everything because of limited staff numbers. From what I have seen, low standards usually arise from low staffing levels. The overworked staff are just not able to do everything that is asked of them. Would I be happy to be a patient in the NHS? The only way you would get me in to a ward is if I were unconscious and it was an emergency situation. The children at Beauty's school made a Jesus' tomb to have in the school assembly. I also read this       Storm in US over chocolate Jesus A New York gallery has angered a US Catholic group with its decision to exhibit a milk chocolate sculpture of Jesus Christ. The six-foot (1.8m) sculpture, entitled \"My Sweet Lord\", depicts Jesus Christ naked on the cross. Catholic League head Bill Donohue called it \"one of the worst assaults on Christian sensibilities ever\". The sculpture, by artist Cosimo Cavallaro, will be displayed from Monday at Manhattan's Lab Gallery. The Catholic League, which describes itself as the nation's largest Catholic civil rights organisation,also criticised the timing of the exhibition. \"The fact that they chose Holy Week shows this is calculated, and the timing is deliberate,\" Mr Donohue said.  Whatever the purpose the artist had for creating the structure, I actually think that the creation of the statue has quite a symbolic message. As with Christmas, Easter has become more and more commercialised and many see it as merely a time to exchange chocolate eggs. Whatever your religion, this time of year -SPRING-is seen as a time of rebirth and new beginnings and whilst chocolate is wonderful  at anytime of the year, a time to take stock and re-evaluate is good. OK ...........Hippie message over! My children think I was born too late and should have been born earlier as they feel that I am a tree-hugging, flowers in my hair wearing, non-meat eating , wicker- weaving Hippie. Oh well, variety is the spice of life. The Easter biscuits Beauty made in school.

And that was the sanest part of the dream.If I were to relate anymore of my dreams then you would be convinced that I should be certified. Probably a sign that I watch too much TV! And  when I saw the film I didn't even watch it out of choice as I saw it in an hotel where I was working in the late 90's.Whilst I was doing nurses training I worked part-time as a waitress for an agency and one of the jobs that I did was working in probably one of the largest hotels in Wales. I was serving at a wedding and we had to keep returning to the staff room between courses and playing on repeat in the staff room was the film  Starship  Troopers. The TV was linked to the guest viewing system and all we could manage to get out of the TV all day was the film  Starship  trooper, the lads were thrilled and  enthralled! My opinion of the film.............a war film, anytime, any place, anywhere! WITH TOO MUCH BLOOD! Beauty went out for the afternoon with her child minder whilst I had a little R&R(rest and respite), Beauty had a wonderful time. They visited the beach at Barry Island and Beauty enjoyed it even though it was a very blustery day and quite cold. I think I need to search out my  duffle  coat so I can take Beauty for more walks in her little red wagon, when you go from car to shop you tend only to wear a little jacket. It was very sunny yesterday but still quite cold. Late yesterday afternoon we went to  Porthkerry  Churchyard where my parents are buried, I took  SnoWhite , Fiona and Ariel and we took some ornaments for my mother's birthday.  Porthkerry  Church is situated on a little green with 2 houses and a farmhouse  hugging the edge of the green. Next to the churchyard is an old school house and Fiona said that she would hate to have a house that overlooked a churchyard but I told her that she had more to worry about in the living than the dead. I blame  Buffy , she grew up watching it with her older sisters. I am getting worrying thoughts! Passing through the garden this morning to get to the car to take Beauty to school  I suddenly thought, 'I need to sort out my garden'. I must be feeling better, I am constantly having spring cleaning and  de -cluttering thoughts! My garden is so small it would only take a couple of hours to clean it! Last week when I went to 'WHAT' a bargain shop, I managed to buy some garden windmills in the shape of flamingos, I don't care how stupid people think garden ornaments are, Beauty loves them. It is not as if my garden is  Highgrove  or Hampton Court. It will be nice for Beauty to be able to play out in the garden again. The local council are doing grant work in my house and are coming around with the builders this afternoon to check the building work that has been done. I have had work done on my house because of Health and Safety issues due to Beauty being a lot of an escapologist. Our front garden that was pretty much unusable has been safety floored and a very high wooden fence put up BUT.......... the fence has been put on the wrong way round! The support slats have been put on the inside and Beauty can use them as steps to escape! Also........ we had doors put in between my bedroom and her bedroom so a window could be put in so she could have the independence of sleeping alone but still be seen. And the work is done so badly that they will probably have to be taken out and done again and the fence will also have to be done again. Never mind, I am sure the work will be finished by the summer.............but which summer I cannot tell you!

{"date": " March 20, 2007", "body": "\nIf Pink is the New Blog and Size Zero is the New Thin(not!) then for Beauty 5am is the new Wake-Up time! Many autistic children seem to suffer from irregular sleep patterns, difficulty getting to sleep, difficulty staying asleep etc. Our problem was 12 midnight or later bedtimes, wakeful nights and early rising. BUT........in the last few months Beauty has managed to go to bed at 9pm and stay there, not wake so often at night and stay in bed until 7-8am. However, that seems to have changed recently and we are back to early wake-up calls. I am hoping that this is a result of her being ill so much this winter and now that she seems to be getting better then the sleep schedule may sort itself out. If not, then Sporticus gets it because at 5am when your body is awake but not your mind, Sporticus (ex-aerobics world champion)jumping around in what seems to be your kitchen(even if it is on the computer) is not my idea of a leisurely wake-up call!    Family's concerns over 'abuse'    Suffering a severe form of autism means the welfare of James, 39, is always a concern for his family.They say his condition makes him particularly suggestible and easy prey for others.But the normal worries of his sister Linda were heightened a year and a half ago when she began to suspect somebody was stealing from James, who was living in sheltered accommodation with no support from staff overnight.He told his sister another resident was taking items from his bedroom and entering without his permission and had taken money from his trousers while he was still wearing them.His family believe an estimated \u00a32,000 was stolen over time but worse was to come.Linda was shocked when James's behaviour in the shower one day seemed to indicate he had suffered sexual abuse and even rape. On the 2nd November 1982 Channel 4 started and I watched the film Walter starring Ian McKellen and I was really shocked at the treatment that Walter, a learning disabled man received when his mother died and he went to live in a hospital for people with learning disabilities. I can look back and honestly say that I did not believe that this film or the possibility of disability had anything to do with my life. I had a 7 month old baby, Anastasia, who I believed was perfect and would not have any problems. Beauty was 9 months old when we first suspected autism so that blows my past youthful confidence out of the water! And I had thought that things had changed. However , the above news report has frightened me, and as an older parent of a child with a learning disability it does not fill me with confidence in the system to care for my child.    \"He started crying and I'd never seen him crying. He said this other person keeps hurting me,\" she told BBC File On 4.    \"It was very distressing.\"    Another sister witnessed the same behaviour and the family's fears increased when his daily care worker said that James told her another resident had been in the shower with him.    The care worker told the family and her bosses about the concerns.    His family are still seething at the \"professionals meeting\" called by Halton Borough Council which they say was riddled with inaccuracies.    \"We thought it was disgusting, they didn't even get his name correct...it said their was no evidence of a change in his relationships but staff remarked how unresponsive he was and had not been out of his room for days,\" said Linda.    An independent council report said the notes of the meeting were very poor.It criticised the fact that neither the police nor several health professionals were present at what should have been a multi-agency meeting.    The care worker who knew him best was not invited to attend.The council director of social services told the family that after a police investigation the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found there was insufficient evidence to take the case further.    Yet when contacted the CPS said no such case had been referred to it.    The independent report \"largely upheld\" the family's complaints but Linda said the council's response has been inadequate.    \"There was no personal apology to James and no recognition of the hurt caused by failing to take proper steps to protect him,\" she said.    Halton Council said it is working with its legal advisers and the family to \"resolve this matter as soon as possible.\"    The council added: \"At this stage it would be inappropriate to comment any further.\"    Hear the full story on Radio 4: File on 4 Tuesday, 20 March, 2007 at 2000 GMT. How do I prepare for my child's future? HALTON COUNCIL LIED TO THIS FAMILY. When Social Care (and special needs education) appears to be finance led what hope is there for our children................who in many ways will always be children! Thankfully Anastasia has always said that she would care for Beauty when the time came but it still worries me that Anastasia was also an adult when Beauty was born and so who will care for Beauty in that possible future? It is way too early for such negative thoughts so I shall revert to type and discuss something less critical and more mind numbing .............my TV viewing from last night(remember DOES TELEVISION CAUSE AUTISM?) I think I should change my name from Mother Of Many to Mother Of Not So Many after watching Ten Kids and Counting that was on TV last night at 9pm. OnThrong-UK TV's Watching Community someone comments    While I am an avid supporter of diversity, and all these family have a right to have as many children as they like, so long as they are supporting them and not relying on the state for their sole income (sorry to the family from Kent but I really do not believe that the nation should pay for your choices, you have the children and you support them), I am shocked to think that the Wilson family go through 500 bags of crisps a week. I really hope this is a typo as this would equate to 33 bags per person (13 kids plus 2 parents) per week. This is horrific and inexcusable regardless of how many children you have. Well for once I am not really sure what to say, for my girls that must be a bit of a surprise! I was on my own when Fiona was about 1 years old and from them until now I have managed to gain a degree in Welsh& History, become a Registered General Nurse, gained a certificate in teaching English as a Foreign Language and trained as a teacher/lecturer. I have also learned some Spanish, British Sign Language, gained an A grade in Art GCSE(probably the achievement I am proudest of), learned to drive and taken desktop publishing, photo shop and website design classes and currently studying for a Masters degree in Special Needs Education. And work full-time as a nurse. The reason I am telling you this is not to boast(well maybe a little- hey I am normal!) but to show that whilst having children and being part of a family is a wonderful thing, there is more to life. Some of the mothers on their show expressed how that they liked the feeling of being needed by the younger ones and they lost that feeling when the children went to school and started to grow up and so went on to have more babies. The Catholic family, parents Greg and Aggie , felt it was important to show that just because you come from a large family doesn't mean you have to lose out on anything and I think that they portrayed that very well. Apart from the Kelly the 25 year old who has 6 children with her partner and he has 7 children from his previous marriage, the mothers all seemed to be in my age group. It would be nice to see the women exploring ways to expand their lives as they all seem to have come to a natural turning point in their lives. I hope that now as all these mothers have older children who should be helping(not that I'm an expert on that!) , these women can enjoy their children and their personal lives more. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hi Belle, did you get Beau's card and present?

I think I must be showing my age because  after weeks of shopping for Christmas the last thing  I want to do is see the inside of another shop.I need bread and milk but the local garage sells that. I had stopped exercising because I have been unwell but I started again today and it was good to get a bit of an endorphin rush. I still feel tired all the time but at least exercising should give me a bit of a psychological high. And whilst exercising I can watch Beauty on the computer, multi-tasking or what? She has been easier to get off the computer today which is a good thing, usually end of computer time results in a paddy. We managed to open some more presents today, a wooden truck from SnoWhite, and a pink pony and a giraffe from me.BUT she has spent most of the day playing with her wagon and soldiers. I see a pattern forming! I am not a New Years Resolution type as  I seem to be making goals all the time but I have  had some thoughts about resolutions this year. I would like to read the Bible all the way through. Start digital scrap booking. Clean my house..............more! Lose weight(now that's a new one...............NOT) Teach Beauty to read. Get the fairies to swap my children for ones that help around the house. Move to a bigger house(I know I can't afford that one but I can always hope). Learn to love somebody other than George Clooney Oh well, we shall see! The following information  comes from questioning my children............... Questions- Do I look my age?              - Do I look young for my age?              - Do I look my age but good?              - Do I look old for my age? The consensus of opinion was that I looked young for my age. I love my girls. They also felt that it was down to not drinking alcohol, not smoking, not wearing loads of make-up and not eating lots of meat. Not that I ever had the money for any of those things anyway. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/wishing-you-beautiful-boxing-day-it-has.html", "title": "\nBOXING DAY WISHES\n"},

And the answer is ................BRIDGET JONES knickers, after years of wearing tiny bikini knickers I picked up a pack of BRIDGET JONES knickers in  Walmart  in New Orleans and they are pure joy. They give my  figure shape and definition(probably because I have lost weight as well!) so now I have some weight on me but I look more like the big girls on the DOVE advert rather than a mother who has given birth to 7 and has a 'mother's apron'.

{"date": " December 19, 2006", "body": "\nSHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED IS AWAKE....................AT 4:15AM! Beauty is happily watching ICE AGE, on rewind! She reminds me of the last gerbil,  who spent the night awake and made so much noise that he and his cage was relegated to the bathroom window ledge. BE WARNED CHILD! Just kidding. Me looking my age and way too fragile at 'stupid o'clock'. I dream of going away to a spa for the weekend and just spend the time relaxing and doing NOTHING. And will that happen? I don't think so, my trip to New Orleans left me with a lot of white hair(I kid you not!) . Thankfully my colouring makes me look  blond . I have 5 other children and it was like having 2 sets of twins at certain times and it was NEVER as tiring as this. I think this is karma catching up with me. AND what did I do that was so wrong? Well I spent  25 years plus going to a church( I mean the individual church that I attended, not the larger church organisation that it belonged to) that encouraged the importance of personal salvation and didn't really see itself as part of the world at large. Only in the last few years have they got involved in charity work of any kind(encouraged by the larger church). When I questioned this I was told by a leader that members had enough problems in their own lives to deal with and did not have enough time to help everyone else out there. My intent now is not to gain any spiritual salvation but I find that I am always doing something to help others, mostly in a very small way. I feel it is  ok  to talk about things like this as I do not think it is anything really special and it should be part of every ones life. I do not believe there is any such thing as real altruism, where you do something with no hope of reward. As I was growing up I really believed that the only people who could be truly altruistic were religious people but even they do what they do for the hope of a reward in the next life. Hey if that floats your boat, fine at least you are doing something. I know a nun called Sister John and she is brilliant, the most ordinary person I know, not in any way a religious pain in the butt she is also probably the best person I know , really genuine. If I could be like anyone I would like to be like her, surprising with my views on the Catholic Church. Probably because I see her as a good person unconfined by religion.  Runningman  was brought up in a convent and Sister John used to play football with the kids, whilst doing so she hurt her knee, if she hadn't hurt her knee I could still see her kicking a ball around in her 60's. She espouses the principles of what I feel are important in life caring, loving, helping , sharing and living a balanced life. In a consumerist world I have very little but in comparison to the Third World I am wealthy. AND I  see the lack of others and I feel guilty or sorry for these people and want to do what I can  even though it is very little, helping makes me feel better and them,  so I am not truly altruistic either. Incentive is not such a bad thing. Diverging slightly, I remember reading once  (some one's individual opinion) that God created sexual desire because if he hadn't  nobody would procreate as sex was such a ridiculous thing. See , 'God'  has a sense of humour. I don't want anyone who reads this to get the wrong idea about me  and church, I went 'religiously' from the time I was 14 until approximately 2001 and it was my whole life BUT I went WANTING to believe, not because I did believe. However, it changed my life for the better and that can't be bad. One of my main issues at the moment is  the church I attended   is putting all it's members at risk, and that is because it refuses to implement and pay for police checks on all it's members. Any adult who is alone with a child for any period of time puts them self at risk from malicious accusation, my suggestion is to all members of the church is do not be alone in any situation with children as an accusation however untrue will ruin your life, I say this as a trained teacher and from what I have seen in the teaching profession . I know 2 children who were sexually abused by an adult male member of the church who already had a police record but the church did not police check him, he is now in prison. I believe that all members over the age of 18 should have regular police checks, other churches in the UK do it . I know that a lot of churches believe THEY ARE THE ONE TRUE CHURCH  and they believe they are special but hiding your head in the sand and believing because you are THE ONE TRUE CHURCH God will not protect you is not enough. The Children's Act is there for a reason so why does the law allow churches to ignore it? I have read a case where a male teacher was accused by 2 girls of sexually abusing them, he was unable to work for a year and at the time of his trial the judge said that the 2 girls had lied completely and the male teacher was found not guilty. BUT what about the year he was under suspicion, the affect on himself and his parents and family. What would Social Services have done if he had children ? Could they have taken his children away? He will always have a record that will show up with the police. DON 'T WORK WITH CHILDREN WITHOUT A POLICE CHECK. Last year there was a case in North Wales of a qualified nurse in a Nursing home who was accused of ill treating patients by nursing  auxiliaries  she worked with , the nurse was found not guilty. I have met a very small minority of nursing auxiliaries who have been in jobs in nursing homes and they have a very cushy number that they resent anybody intruding upon. I loved working nights and many of these nursing auxiliaries  I worked with did nothing all night, they would rather change urine soaked beds at 6am than check the patients regularly through the night. So how do they get rid of somebody who rocks their boat ? Accuse the nurse of ill-treating patients, the case may not take long to come to a court of law but the  RCN  can take years before they hear the case and the nurse is able to work again, and all that time their reputation is tarnished. Document everything is the answer, if you have problems with other members of staff ........document it, you have your own career to think of. I feel that the church that I attended and the people I knew in it  made me a better person and for that I will always be grateful and I love all those people I grew up with, they are my extended family. As members of my extended family I only want to protect them. However, remember I only heard it on the grapevine, the church has seen the importance of police checks and all those who work with children are to be police checked in the near future. Let us hope that this is true so children and the adults can be protected and kept safe. THE MOODY BLUES SINGING  A WINTER'S TALE. I found this whilst checking  out You Tube. This is one of my favourite songs, I am ashamed to say that I have a cupboard full of Moody Blues albums and I have never listened to them. The albums belonged to husband number 2, the one who was a chemist(metals etc) but thought he had the knowledge of a pharmacist(medications). He went drinking with his mates, whilst on prescription medications,anaphylaxis happened and the inevitable-death by suffocation. Stupid boy-what a waste. The answer.........don't drink, alcohol only messes you up.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photobucket.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Ik-elE6oU"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/greetings-from-planet-beauty.html", "title": "\nGREETINGS FROM THE PLANET BEAUTY\n"},
{"date": " December 17, 2007", "body": "\nI have heard it said a number of times that 'the bullied become bullies' but I do not believe that this has to happen Looking back over my life I can remember a number of incidents which I was involved in which were probably bullying.When I was about 6 I 'accidentally' bumped into a girl in the playground,' on another occasion I made a comment about a boys weight(I think I was about 8), on another occasion something happened which was a misunderstanding and the other person got upset and I think that I was more upset than they were and finally I made fun of a girl in school when I was about 14 but it was only the once. I am so getting old because I can clearly remember the incidents in my life that might be considered as bullying but I cannot remember sometimes that happened a week ago! In primary school, secondary school, nursing and even church I was bullied. In school I was bullied so badly that life did not seem worth living and I even left my initial nurses training because I was bullied by a fellow student.In the secondary school I was bullied by 2 girls who were huge, they were so big they made Pat Butcher look positively waif like. Looking back with the experience of adulthood I would deal with the situation differently but looking back, when I was 14 the threats of violence from 2 amazonian type  girls was very frightening.. Now I can hear the cogs in your brains whirring and thinking NOW WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? Well I'm back again to Cyber Bullying. What is wrong with people? Are their meds not working? Did they just get out of bed on the wrong side? Or are they just plain mean? Stereotypically we think of bullies as thick and ignorant people but on the Internet the biggest bullies seem to be quite intelligent people. I have just witnessed some cyber bullying, I will not name the person as it will only give them the attention they obviously crave but anyone who usually reads my blog will not find it difficult to find out what I am talking about. Life is way to short to get your jollies by being mean to other people.

{"date": " January 08, 2007", "body": "\nWhilst in university I studied some(not a lot) psychology and was very interested in the  Milgram  experiment which was a series of famous scientific studies of social psychology, intended to measure the willingness of a participant to obey an authority who instructs the participant to do something that may conflict with the participant's personal conscience. The experiment was first described in 1963 by Stanley  Milgram , a psychologist at Yale University, and later discussed in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View. The experiments began in July 1961, three months after the start of the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem.  Milgram  devised the experiment to answer the question \"Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders? Could we call them all accomplices?\" I also remember learning about the The  Stanford prison experiment  , it was a landmark psychological study of the human response to captivity, in particular, to the real world circumstances of prison life, and the effects of imposed social roles on behavior. It was conducted in 1971 by a team of researchers led by Philip  Zimbardo  of Stanford University. Volunteers played the roles of guards and prisoners and lived in a mock prison built in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. However, the experiment quickly got out of hand and was ended early. And then there  was the  BLUE EYES/BROWN EYES  experiment In the wake of the  assassination of  Martin Luther King  Jnr   Elliot developed a simple exercise that explored the nature of  racism  and  prejudice Elliott's method for exploring racism in the context of an all-white classroom consisted of dividing her students into two groups on the basis of eye color, blue or brown (those with other eye colors were assigned to the group that most closely matched their own.)On the first day, Elliott told her students that possessing blue eyes indicated superiority in intelligence and conferred extra classroom privileges while having brown eyes indicated inferiority. Quickly, the students of the \"superior\" color began to oppress those of the \"inferior\" color, while those of the \"inferior\" color exhibited negative feelings of self-loathing and fear.The next day, Elliott reversed the exercise, telling the students that her statements the previous day were untrue, and that the reverse situation now prevailed. The same children who had been oppressed the day before quickly took on the oppressing role, and vice  versa  . As a school teacher in  Riceville , Iowa she tried to explain the meaning of King's death to her all white students.  Riceville  was and is today a predominantly white,  Christian town with a population of 1,000 people. Elliott devised the exercise -this is not an experiment, she emphasizes- in which one day the brown eyed children are on top and the next day the blue eyed. \"I chose a physical characteristic over which they had no control and attributed negative elements to this characteristic.\" Elliott chose eye color because she was under the impression that during the  second world war  eye color was one of the ways for the  Nazis to determine if someone was sent to the  gas chamber or not. I  am the first to admit that I am not the brightest bunny and my memory is not brilliant but I feel that I was able to read the data presented in the above experiments and understand the basic concepts and results. I feel that the evidence showed how weak and fragile mankind is and easily susceptible to the influence of society and peer pressure. I know all these things and yes I do realise that evidence can be manipulated and how the ethics of experiments have to be taken into consideration so the validity of any experiments can be questioned but it brought me to a frightening  awareness of how I as an individual could so easily be influenced. I would love to think I wouldn't! I love watching reality TV shows and yes they do make me laugh but I never cease to be shocked at the way people behave. OF COURSE in my ivory tower I always think,' oooooooh  I would never do that!' Pleeeeeese , I would probably be a right cow I am very ashamed to say. I quite frequently watch reality shows and watch from behind my fingers, cringing, thinking ' oh please say I wouldn't have done that'. However, let me make this point clear,  I am not talking about the Jade  BB's  KEBAB type moments, that would be a definite NO-NO. I am talking more about the reality moments where the contestants fail to put brain into gear before speaking moments. Save me from my gob! Yes I have the ability to think quickly in conversations and say funny things but afterwards I think things like ,'Oh I hope I didn't say something to upset them'. I was appalled to watch  Ken Russell  on celeb BB talking to Jade  Goodie , his behaviour was just unacceptable. He ridiculed Jade and was insulting because he didn't believe she was in the same class as him.When Jade told Ken\"You've got no respect and consideration for these people,\" yelled a fuming Jade', after Ken ate food even though he was told not to by the other house mates. \"They aren't people, they're Servants,\" \"Servants!\"  \"Trash! Slaves!\" \"That's just nasty, they helped you put your socks on,\" responded Jade. The sad thing was that Ken really seemed to mean what he said. Jade was right , the house mates had been good to Ken and he showed no respect for them. Ken was so pompous and pretentious, his behaviour was summed up when he said in response, 'AM I  BOVERED ?' Obviously not! AND TO THE MAIN REASON WHY I HAVE HAD A BAD DAY! As the character Jamie in Truly, Madly, Deeply said, 'I blame the government!' When Beauty went to school I was not happy with the inadequate  educational provision contained in Beauty's statement of Special  Educational Needs. So I had to go to a Special Needs Tribunal and beg, yes beg and grovel for what I knew was my child's needs and right to have. The local education authority did not believe that Beauty needed  a one-to-one helper in a special needs school but she did because she wasn't safe to be without one. She would drop and refuse to move, climb , eat small objects and engage in a million and 1 other dangerous pass times. Whilst looking after Beauty the staff would not be caring for the other children who would  then be put at risk. Those in charge of the tribunal when making the decision told me that Beauty had to have the extra helper in the class but THEY DID NOT WANT TO START A PRECEDENCE BY GIVING HER ONE TO ONE, I believe that this was an illegal thing for them to say because other cases are not meant to influence their decision. I also had to get them to state in WORDS visible from space that Beauty also needed all her therapies because if they didn't say it then the school would not get the money for it. Notice that I did not say SHE WOULD NOT GET THE THERAPIES  because no matter what, she would get the therapies , care and education she deserved because the head teacher, teachers, teacher's aides and therapists who(IF THERE IS A GOD AND IN THIS MATTER I PRAY THERE IS) will be seated on the right hand side of God for doing everything for Beauty and giving her all the therapies regardless of receiving money for it(but when they spend time with Beauty they are not with every other just as deserving child). So the answer is money, YES MONEY, everyone knows this , accepts this and deals with it apart fro the government, the LABOUR GOVERNMENT headed by TONY BLAIR and the local education authorities around the country. I believe that the educational officers who attended my daughters tribunal are people without a soul, without shame, without common decency, I believe that they were just downright mean. They made me feel that we had no right to ask for anything. Yes it is true that THOSE WHO SHOUT LOUDEST GET THE MOST and that stinks. In one interview I was told that there was only a certain sized, 'pot of money' and if I had that money then somebody else wouldn't. NICE PEOPLE! I told one education officer that if it was their child then they would get everything, she told me that she was shocked that I should suggest such a thing and I told her that I didn't care how shocked she was and not matter how much she denied it it was still true. Hence, I am not popular with the local education authority and 'DO I CARE?' HELL NO! SO WHY AM I SO UNHAPPY TODAY? Yep you've guessed! Former Education Secretary Ruth Kelly has defended her decision to send her son, who has \"substantial learning difficulties\", to a private school. I believe it is every parents right to do the best for their child. I am not upset with Ruth Kelly,  I am upset with a government. '' Ms Kelly said it was not uncommon for pupils with substantial learning difficulties to spend some time outside the state sector to help them progress. Sometimes this is paid for by the local authority. In my case, I have not and will not seek the help of the local authority in meeting these costs,\" THE  LEA WILL PAY IF THEY AGREE THAT THE PROVISION IS THE  RIGHT ONE AND YOU HAVE BEGGED AND GROVELLED ENOUGH AT A TRIBUNAL. Although she did not say where her son had attended school, Tower Hamlets Council issued a statement about its special needs provision. It reads: \"We are confident that our schools are well resourced and provide high quality education for all learners, including those with special needs.\" \" Ms Kelly said  Acting on professional advice - which the local authority accepts - I am placing my son in a school that will be able to meet his particular needs .\" OK SO THEY 'ACCEPT 'WHAT YOU HAVE DONE MS KELLY BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THEY DO NOT AGREE WITH YOU. THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR PROVISION IS GOOD ENOUGH. SO THE EDUCATION AUTHORITY THINK THAT THEIR PROVISION IS GOOD ENOUGH BUT THE FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY DOES NOT. But Labour MP Barry  Sheerman , chairman of the Commons education select committee, said: \"The state system at its best should be able to provide for every kind of special education need - but at the moment in some parts of the country that's not true.\" OH REALLY! SO WOULD MY CHILD RECEIVE A BETTER EDUCATION IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL? IF THIS WERE THE BEST OPTION WOULD I GET GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR IT? LET ME SEE! WOULD I HAVE TO BEG AND GROVEL FOR IT? DO I HAVE TO STAND ON TOP OF A TALL BUILDING AND SCREAM, 'LOOK AT ME, I AM ORDINARY, MY CHILD IS AUTISTIC, MY CHILD HAS SPECIAL NEEDS, MY CHILD IS THE LOVELIEST , SWEETEST 6 YEAR OLD IN ALL THE WORLD AND I WANT THE BEST FOR HER' DO YOU THINK ANYONE WILL LISTEN? WHAT DO OTHERS THINK? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott", "http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/news/newsstory.jsp?id=1101&housemateId=4", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6240165.stm", "http://photobucket.com/", "http://newsforums.bbc.co.uk/nol/thread.jspa?threadID=5184&&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;edition=1&ttl=20070109003651", "http://newsforums.bbc.co.uk/nol/thread.jspa?threadID=5184&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;&edition=1&ttl=20070109003651", "http://newsforums.bbc.co.uk/nol/thread.jspa?threadID=5184&amp;&edition=1&ttl=20070109003651"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/01/whilst-in-university-i-studied-somenot.html", "title": "\nActs 9:5-6 - \"it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks\"\n"},
{"date": " April 05, 2007", "body": "\nHaving read Patricia Hewitts  plans  for giving more women the option of having a home birth I would like to say that having given birth 7 times and seeing all the possible problems that could happen and from the problems that I encountered, there is not a chance in hell that I would ever have a home birth. If a problem did happen by the time you were transferred to hospital , you  or your child or both of you could be dead. The midwives may have been busy each time I gave birth but the care that they gave was second to none. SnoWhite who insists that she is never going to have children said IF SHE DID HAVE A CHILD (figure that one out!) it would definitely  be a hospital birth, with access to everything(especially an epidural) in an emergency. The NHS Blog Doctor says               A \u201cright\u201d to a home delivery is as safe and as sensible as giving parents the \u201cright\u201d to insist that their children have their tonsils out at home on the kitchen table. That is the natural way to do it. That is what doctors used to do a hundred years ago, so why not now? The independent madwives are ecstatic. There is not a single insurance company in the country that is prepared to cover independent madwives to do home deliveries. So what do the madwives do? They work without insurance.    Private midwives have been working without indemnity insurance since 2002, when the last company willing to provide cover pulled out.

It includes the crocheted blanket that I made called,'Little Boy Blue'. Fiona didn't want her face in the photograph so I obliged. I love teenagers! When she is a rich and famous designer and she has her photograph splashed over every celebrity magazine I shall remind her of this photograph. Sorry the photos of the kitchen took so long. As explained , I had to move the furniture  out of the room by the kitcken door as the builders are coming in september to put in a door between the backroom and the middle room. Less room of course but it is ok. Sorting out what is left in the room is a long and arduous task. Beauty of course is now fascinated with sitting at the kitchen table, just like a little puppy! I shall now have to find a new place to put my over large station clock that used to be on the wall where the shelves now are. No problem.

I was playing CBEEBIES on the computer with Beauty, whilst she was eating fromage frais, I turned around for a second and she was covered from head to toe in fromage frais! Whilst trying to clean her up she wouldn't stop wriggling so I said, MOVE AND YOU'LL REGRET IT-and she said REGRET IT. Oh I can see it now, Beauty telling a teacher off by telling them they will regret it if they move! I am so glad that I can control(mostly) swearing in front of Beauty, however SOMETIMES stupid drivers really push me to the limit. Last night I explained to Beauty that Anastasia and Dimitri were coming to visit her for a few days and I am sorry Anastasia but it was Dimitri's name that she said very clearly, I couldn't convince her to say your name but she was very focused at that time on a bag of chocolate gold coins that she  had just found in the fridge. Beauty is like me it seems , not really interested in real gold-that must be why I have huge amounts of silver jewelry(I keep PAST TIMES in business!). AND to those of you out there who are still asking what to buy me for Christmas, look no further, Fiona just received a Cath Kidston catalogue in the post and anything from there would make my life complete. However, the radio and phone are silly money and anyone who bought those would get a slap! The flowered tins are just fine. Talking about Christmas presents..............Pianoman is buying this truck for Beauty It comes complete with straps! Is it cute or what? Perfect for the park. And for once Runningman has spoken on the subject of Christmas presen ts and said he would like a tool box (though I think a foot wide paintbrush would be more useful!).................and last night at ASDA he bought Fiona a chocolate bar!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't think that has happened since Fiona was in primary school. We have pictures of Fiona when she was small dancing around the living room in this house dressed as a fairy, she was so tiny and sweet, it is hard to believe that Fiona was only 5 when we moved to this house, it is also hard to remember when she wasn't 6 foot-she takes after me and I take after my DAD who was a tall guy. I read about a research project being done in Plymouth and it is meant to show that children get their height from their dads and their weight from their mums, well as far as my girls are concerned that is not true. I get my height and build and head shape from my dad and I have passed on the height to Fiona and the head shape to Ariel. As my brother once said, as far as hats are concerned the label says ONE SIZE  FITS ALL apart from his and the same goes for myself and Ariel, we have the large head circumference passed on to us by my dad. And that is one painful thing to give birth to I can promise you, I am so glad that Ariel took approximately 2 hours from start to finish to be born as ay longer would have been too much. And any predisposition to weight in my girls seems to have come through their dad's family, their grandmother on their dad's side has a  classical British pear shaped figure and I have the figure of a man with no hips and no butt.

HEALTHY EATING UPDATE As I said in an earlier blog, today I wanted to be able to say I had lost a whole stone and reach the magic BMI number of 25. Well I have and more! However, yesterday was a bit of a TWINKLE DAY. Remember the tv series Dinner Ladies? Remember series 2 where Twinkle gets all skinny and goes to a slimming club? Well in one episode she is p*ssed off because another group member has lost more weight than usual because she found a 2 day old kebab in her bag AND ate it! With the resutling bad stomach she lost most lbs that week. Well yesterday I had my own TWINKLE episode, I ate a weight watchers frozen meal of the vegtable chilli variety.Phew, I am still paying for that one! My children can still not tell that I have lost weight but my Doctor who doesn't see me that often noticed when I went for a re-assessment of the medication for my arthritis. So..................What am I? I am 12st 2lbs and a BMI of 24.3 and yet I still have a roll of fat around my stomach! AND weight watchers say that I can still lose up to 2 stone more. But my clothes all fit better. Medical theory has it that a person who has arthritis feels better when they lose weight but that does not seem to be the case for me. My hips seem to be more painful when I lie down, could be the reduction in padding.

{"date": " August 23, 2006", "body": "\n MORAL OF THIS STORY- ALWAYS EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED. I know I am getting old-keeping up with Beauty proves it. At 5am(which is not a bad time), Beauty came slamming(no not slammin') out of her bedroom. 5am wake-up calls are not usually that bad but 0-60mph in 2 seconds can really be a shock to the system. So with Beauty in tow I go to the kitchen to get her another Tippee as her night time drink has already been drunk. Whilst making the drink Beauty is going quietly nuts beside me and being an adult I assume that I know the reason why. I assume the 'going nuts' behaviour is because she wants the drink NOW! Oh the arrogance of being an adult who who thinks they now best. On passing the Tippee it instantly becomes a missile that just misses my head, my Le creu set pans and my sink which scratches if you so much as look at it. Legend has it that before you die your life flashes before your eyes well I saw perfectly in a' blink of a Hooby eye' the Tippee connecting with whatever and the lid exploding off-soaking me and the kitchen floor. As I have said before many times, I am not psychic and can not see through my ass(though it is big enough!) and the Tippee came to land upright on a T towel on the draining board!Whew! Q-So why 0-60 in 2 seconds? A-Because one of the tapes on her nappy had come undone and she wanted it done backup. WELL..........she only had to tell me! or better still Beauty is not stupid, she could have done it up herself or even better-forget nappies altogether and just use the toilet! MORAL OF THE STORY Aways expect the unexpected and never assume ANYTHING with an Autistic 5 year old. This reminds me of a book I once read. The Nun's Story which was made into a film starring Audrey Hepburn. I bought the book years ago in a charity shop and I have read it a number of times. The young nun who is recently qualified as a nurse goes to work in a mental health institution in Belgium. The institution is run by the sisters of her order and they have to work day and night shifts so they do not always follow the daytime routine of the convent as they have to sleep after a night shift. The other nuns say that you can tell the ones who are nurses as their eyes are always darting around, a habit from taking care of unpredictable patients. One night the young nurse goes on duty and looks through the glass d oor of the ward to see a fellow nurse 'asleep' at the nurses station. Not wanting to get the nun into trouble she rattles the door and makes a noise before entering but the nun does not wake up as she is dead with a knife in her back. The other nun had probably fallen asleep for a few seconds and forgotten her Guide promise about being prepared(or is that Scouts?) As a nurse, working nights, I was never able to sit unless my back was to a wall. Nothing ever happened but that book had scared me into a state of preparedness, thankfully my book was like Holby City and Casualty, never like that in real life. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/galleries/audrey/images/bfi-00m-wqo.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/08/tales-of-unexpected.html", "title": "\nTALES OF THE UNEXPECTED!\n"},
{"date": " August 11, 2006", "body": "\nHEALTHY EATING UPDATE DAY 1 healthy eating going fine-bread and fruit for breakfast, 2 weight watchers meals with loads of boiled and stir fry vegtables, lots of water and 2 weight watchers yoghurts. Oh and an options drink at approximately 11am. Every time I thought about snacking I thought ,'Am I hungry?' and I realised that I never was. At the end of the day, even though I wasn't hungry, I was thinking about all the wonderful things that I would eat. I could have happily eaten a three course meal and managed it easily but I know I wasn't hungry. I must have a stomach stretched to the size of a football! I do not eat because I am bored and I do not comfort eat, I eat because I love food. This morning my stomach feels so much smaller(probably initial water loss) and my weighing scales still seem to be working properly and have recorded a loss (yes I know it is that water). However, I will not be buying the weight watchers meals again as they had way too many spices in them for me, I shall make my own pasta sauce meals and only add herbs. Any further healthy eating updates will be relegated to the bottom of the page as it is not really a very exciting subject but I promise I will make a big thing of it when I become a size 12! I watched a program on tv last night called Far Beauty contest and all the contestents were size 16*, it was a brilliant programme. Until I was 25 I was a size 8 and after Beauty I was a size 22, after going to weight watchers I got down to a 14-16 and now I want to be a size 12. I really understood how all these girls were feeling. When you are fat people ignore you because they think you are stupid to let yourself get so fat. Lots of people would love to be able to say,' I have health problems that make me fat', well newsflash my Dercums makes it impossible for me to lose all of my fat as the fat is encapsulated and so they are benign tumours. And does the fact that I know I have an illness that stops me losing all my excess weight make it any better? Heck no....in fact it makes it worse as I feel that I have to work twice as hard as everyone else. I also want to live a long and healthy life  so I can be there for all my children....hence the healthy eating. The program Fat Beauty contest encouraged the women to be happy with their body and I think that is very important, yes we are fat people and one day we may lose weight but we need to be happy  now, happiness isn't just for people who are a size 6. Charlotte Coyle the organiser of Beauty Reborn, the pageant for larger women Why have I never looked like this?

The funny thing is BBC2 doesn't really have adverts and they are just a collection of introductory shorts that lead into the programs. These shorts are basically 2's bouncing around to really bland music! AND they are driving me insane! She also loves  Lady Heartily  who does amazing videos combining songs with animated films on  YouTube  but can I get her to watch those at the moment? Not a chance. At the moment her favourite one is a group of 2's doing English country dancing but of course Beauty does her  pogoing  to it. What more can I say? Beauty's hands are getting a lot better and soon they will be healed up and she also seems to have stopped chewing them which of course is good news. Beauty also loves to sing and she seems to pick up songs really quickly, especially songs that I play in the car. So I have decided to play certain songs in the car that I would like her learn. Her sisters have decided that the first songs to be learned are Simon and  Garfunkle , Dolly  Parton  and Karen Carpenter................family favourites. Simon and  Garfunkle  for Anastasia, Dolly  Parton  for  SnoWhite  and of course Karen Carpenter for Belle who has been a Karen Carpenter fan since she was about 8(and of course Belle also has a beautiful voice like Karen Carpenter).Belle also loves the name Karen and at one point wanted to be called Karen, the qualities of a true fan.

First major Christmas shopping expedition last night to Matalan and the Range, this year I have decided to make my Christmas baskets individual and with a theme and last night I was able to buy quite a lot. However, I still feel as if I am only in the foothills of Everest as far as my Christmas shopping is concerned.I want the baskets to be individual and show we thought about the person we are giving them to and no there will be no khaki in Ariel's gifts this year, promise! Anastasia and Dimitri will be here at the weekend and they are so looking forward to visiting my niece Edeline and her baby Dotty(when she shows, get a move on baby!). My girls love the name Dot-Dotty, they think it is so cute and they all want it for their babies(sorry girls!). Anastasia is looking forward to Sunday lunch with Yorkshire pudding(though Dimitri doesn't like Yorkshire pudding,foolish lad), a Full British Breakfast and shopping in Primark. Cuisine fit for a king. I shall also have to introduce them to 'WHAT' the new shop on Newport Road, like Hypervalue but tons better. I forgot to tell you Anastasia, you know the house 2 doors down from Pavvas  on HollyBush Road that they did a huge amount of work on? Well it's up for sale already. I am surprised as they are a large Asian family and I thought they would be there a while, it didn't strike me as an investment property. The 'study' house on Cyncoed Road seems to be finished and the extension is massive, the extension is as big as Pavvas' house. As well the conversion of the water tower  next to the new Synagogue seems to be almost finished and the new sheltered housing on Cyncoed Road  is coming along really fast and it looks really well done, it really fits in well though I still haven't forgiven SCOPE for closing the sheltered housing and selling the land. I know it has been Autumn and you expect to see leaves on the ground but this year there seems to be huge amounts everywhere, I also haven't seen a street cleaner on our estate in a long time and I wonder if Cardiff Council is trying to save money by not sending out the street cleaners. I think that would not be a wise decision, remember the switch off of the lights on the Bay Link Road? Russel Goodway, then head of the council thought that he was saving money by keeping the lights turned off.......until somebody died! I know piles of leaves doesn't sound that bad but think blocked drains and slippy pavements, think of the people who could fall and break bones! How to deal with the problem? Remember I said that Unemployment Benefits should be for a set period only, and should include seasrch for work time and voluntry work? Cleaning leaves sounds good to me. School leaving age may be raised England's education secretary is said to be exploring ways to raise the school leaving age to 18.Alan Johnson told political journalists that \"staying on\" rates must improve. There's nothing wrong with the idea of making children stay on in some form of education until they are 18 but   I have also heard in the media about Alan Johnson not wanting them stuck in dead end jobs but what is a dead end job? Can everyone be a brain surgeon? People need to be made to feel proud of working what ever they do. I have worked as a cleaner, as a carer, as a shop assistant, as a waitress and  my  view is that all work is important and valid and that is what needs to be promoted.  Anyway who does Alan Johnson want to do the 'dead end' jobs?  Someone has to do the work. Can you think of anything more stupid than being incapacitated because of a pain in the elbow? When I have neck pain that sounds normal, back pain sounds normal but elbow pain that it stops you doing anything sounds stupid. But my elbow is just as bad as my neck was last week and no I'm not just being a wimp, remember 'pain is what the patient says it is'-well it's bl**dy' awful. LIFE SURELY CAN BE A LEMON AT TIMES!

Ariel is begging for attention, she says she's ill but then aren't we all? Beauty is a bit better today so the decibel level coming from her is increasing. Ariel wants everyone to know she has head pains as well! ~She wants everyone to know she is a sick bunny. And her final statement is GO AWAY. My blog is still deleting pictures so I am now uploading via  Photobucketlet's see if that solves the problem. Thanks to Fiona who made Lucky Stars on  Photoshop The situation in Ipswich seems to be getting worse and worse each day, one of the girls who was murdered was three months pregnant. I watched a news report on BBC1 and I was pleased that at no time were the girls who died referred to as prostitutes, they called them workers in the sex industry. The report went on to describe the lives of these girls and it put a personal face on who they were and they were each portrayed as loving, kind, sweet girls and I feel terrible sorrow for their families. These  girls were similar in ages to my daughters and it is such a great shame that the lives of these girls fell apart in such away that they felt that they had no option but to turn to earning a living in such away. Prostitution is seen as a terrible thing but whereas the the girls(or men) are labelled as 'prostitutes' which is a horrible word ,where is the horrible word to describe the punters? Surely what the punters are doing is far worse than the prostitutes but there seems to be far less criticism of the punters! I do not believe there will ever be a time when women will be treated fairly. For those of you who believe in a God please pray for these girls and the unborn child that was murdered and the families left behind. The killer has to be found quickly so the killer cannot kill again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/12/photobucket-video-and-image-hosting.html", "title": "\nDON'T WORRY.........I THINK I UNDERSTAND\n"},
{"date": " October 28, 2006", "body": "\n TRUTH? YOU DECIDE! Long before  Blunkett's Glorious Fall  I did not like him, this was when it would have been seen as sacrilege to have a go at a blind guy . I read an article about how he had said in an interview that he wore his wedding ring after his divorce so that women didn't come on to him and I thought at the time ,'you arrogant little man'(actually I thought a lot worse but this is a family show remember!). What?....from what has happened over the past few years I'd say that the wedding ring was all for show. I loved this 'Urban Legend' story on the BBC website- it is one of those stories that makes me laugh and makes my day. What a nit wit! According to the BBC this is the type of threat that was passed on to Blunkett who dutifully was worried enough to pass it on the Tony Blair. \"My friend's Aunt Sally was in a queue and this Middle Eastern-looking bloke in front of her dropped his wallet. When she gave it back to him, he told her to avoid central London on Saturday because something big might happen. Tell as many people as you can.\" The 11 was Armistice Day and so he told Tony Blair about his worries and the 'obvious' threat to security but they decided that all that could be done had been done and Mr Blunkett was relieved when the day passed peacefully. What a wally! Can the press stop releasing this kind of story please, it makes me like Blunkett because he comes across as such a wally and we can't have that. Urban legend as the article goes on to show is not new, I remember as a child hearing the one about the young couple in the car that breaks down and the man goes to get petrol and the women waits. She hears a noise on the roof of the car and it turns out to be the head of her boyfriend, her boyfriend had been attacked and his head cut off by an escaped 'nutter'(I am repeating the story, I know he was a person with mental health problems) from (sorry but it was in the story) Hensol Castle. In the middle 80's an American officers wife from Greenham Common told me that the women in the petrol station who was told to get out of her car by the forecourt attendant to pay because there was some knife wielding maniac hiding in the back of her car was her aunt and the story was true and not a legend. I am going through another generation of teenagers and again having to explain that the story of people being 'stuck' with a needle carrying AIDS in nightclubs is not true but an Urban Legend. We have also had a variation on the 'Aunt Sally' story and it is so hard to convince teenagers that they are just a story. At that age they are just coming to the realisation that the world can be a mad place and an Urban Legend story doesn't help AND because I am old person I couldn't possibly KNOW it was only an Urban Legend.  Hey I'm not too old to be TERRIFIED by a teenager saying CANDY MAN 5 times in a BHS lift , teenage girls can be pretty cruel! Names not included to protect the guilty but I know who you are and revenge is best served up cold! I feel that I have a little grey sprite from the Sprite advert on my right shoulder, the terrible ripping pain in my neck seems to be being held at bay BUT it also feels that there is something heavy on my shoulder just waiting to grab and twist and rip and bring back the pain. So I am walking as if I have a hunched back and it is not the most attractive of looks. THAT IS IT...........I FINALLY LOST IT! At 7am Runningman started his painting, at 12md I couldn't take it anymore so Beauty and I went out. We went to Mothercare to look at cookers but they didn't have any but Beauty spent 15 minutes looking at the toys and she had a very enjoyable time. Then we went to Cafe Junior in Cathays and Beauty played there for an hour , she liked the wooden Noah's ark with the wooden animals and people but she wasn't too keen on sharing! Now that is a good idea for a Christmas present, doesn't IKEA sell a wooden set? The place was filled with the yummy-mummy set and some of the children were thoroughly obnoxious but we will be going back as Beauty had so much fun. Then we went to Fairoak Park( the bowling green park between Penylan Park and Roath Park) we walked all the way around with out the pixie buggy(fantastic news), Beauty threw lots of leaves into the stream from the bridge . I took loads of photographs and will post them when blogger stops messing with me. Then we came home to find a mountain of mess, WHY I don't know because nothing needed to be put into the kitchen as the middle room is empty. So I lost it and told him to go home , he had done about a metre square of painting between 7am and 2:30pm and completely covered the floor tiles with paint, something I told him NOT TO DO. He said it didn't matter as it would only take 5 minutes to clean , he has been in there an hour cleaning! I moved everything into the middle room and moved the furniture in the dining room to make things easier to paint.Enough is enough, Fiona and I are going to finish the room. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6090918.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/10/urban-legend.html", "title": "\nURBAN LEGEND!\n"},

Lots of exciting things to do today-like clean the house, do the washing oh the list is endless. I saw the final episodes of  Lost -will something please happen? It is irritating me now- \"24\" irritated me as that was so strung out and in the end I just couldn't be bothered. I'm looking forward to watching Kim and Aggie and Anthea this week-sad life huh? As the weather has changed I am now bathing Beauty at night and just washing her in the morning, Beauty's hair dries quite quickly but it is now too cold for her to go out in the mornings with wet hair. As I have said before apart from  Kim and Aggie  and  Anthea  I only watch tv after 9pm so I take Beauty up for her bath between 7:30 and 8pm and Beauty stays in the bath between half an hour and an hour. I sit on the toilet and I read, it is great. Beauty loves playing with thw water and I love to read.At the moment I am reading  Michael Connelly's The Poet,  when I have finished I shall post it to you Anastasia and whenever you come home if you can bring them back I shall post them to Belle. I will also send books to you Belle as I am going through books very quickly. Beauty's bed time bath also seems to be working a treat as Beauty is sleeping a lot better, she was a bit grumbly last night but she slept most of the night.Hurrah! When I took Beauty to school today one of the teachers said 'Bore Da' to another child and Beauty said'Bore Da' too. Beauty also likes to repeat whole sentences from DVDs and the other night she and I were repeating sentences together and I added ' I love you' and she repeated it to me. I was thrilled so I hugged her and kissed her and said 'I love you too' and she was thrilled that she had done something that made me really pleased with her. So you don't feel left out Anastasia, Belle, SnoWhite, Ariel and Fiona- I love you too and send you big hugs and kisses(Yes Dean I know, you want me to kill you now!)

{"date": " June 24, 2007", "body": "\nWell last night was not much fun! To talk in local speak,' Beauty wasn avin any ov i'. Beauty went to bed, went to sleep, woke up, got up and the routine started all over again. I am now thoroughly exhausted even after a few hours sleep,I shall start cooking for this party when the morning medication and bread starts to kick in and my joints start to work.I was reading the following article this morning. How to be ex-Prime Minister             Blair could make a lot of money as an ex-PM                            By Michael Cockerell Political documentary maker When Tony Blair leaves Number 10 on Wednesday he will be much better off than Winston Churchill was when he became an ex-prime minister in 1945 - after winning the war and losing the general election. \"My grandfather was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war,\" says the great man's grandson - also called Winston Churchill. Churchill was forced to put his home, Chartwell in Kent, on the market. \"Lord Camrose, the then proprietor of the Daily Telegraph was outraged,\" says young Winston. \"And he corralled 10 wealthy well-wishers and they each ponied up the princely sum of \u00a35,000. \"So for \u00a355,000 - which was a lot of money in those days - they bought Chartwell on the understanding that my grandparents would live there until the end of their days and then it would be presented to the nation.\" The biggest question of all is how to fill the suddenly empty days. The former Tory cabinet minister, Ken Clarke, who as an MP since 1970 has watched five prime ministers come and go says: \"Like a departing captain of industry, Tony will want the next big job in the career. \"In his case I think it will be trying to govern the world and advise all the other political leaders how to run things. And he'll find that difficult, because you are very ex as an ex-prime minister.\"                         Blair's meeting with the Pope on Saturday is one key to what he plans to do. According to one of Blair's closest advisers: \"Tony is obsessed with the idea of becoming a roving envoy who would seek to reconcile the Abrahamic religions of Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\" Blair sought Papal endorsement for his plans to set up an inter-faith foundation - headed by himself. It may take you a very long time to adjust fully to no longer being the most powerful person in the land. For the one thing all members of the ex-prime ministers' club have in common is that they have lost the most exciting job that they will ever have. Ken Clarke sums it up: \"I think almost all of them, if you said that, by some amazing miracle, you could go back tomorrow and you could be prime minister again and take on all that hassle, and all that strain, and all that criticism, and all those crises, they'd all have jumped at it and gone straight back straight away.\" I could NEVER be famous or prime minister, it was bad enough talking on camera for the Wales 60 initiative. Even the party this afternoon has me worried! I admire people who can do this kind of thing. And Ken Clarke made the point that if they were offered the chance to do it again they would. I couldn't do it once , let alone twice. I admire the movers and shakers of the world who can stand up and be counted but I am afraid that any thing that I do will have to be in private. When I was a Christian I held the same view Matthew 7:16 -By their fruits ye shall know them. I was always one of these people who felt actions were more important. I really find missionary work, evangelism(especially TV ) and public displays of religion as unacceptable. It must be the Britishness in me coming out-well my mother was English. However, I do need to clarify missionary work. I am quite happy for religious people to go into inner cities and help in needy situations, to go to places and build wells, teach hygiene and healthy eating and provide medical services . All these things are worthy but not if these people constantly attach religion to what they are doing. Remember -By their fruits ye shall know them. So could I party like Tony Blair? The thought fills me with horror. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6233470.stm"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2007/06/party-like-its-your-birthday.html", "title": "\nPARTY LIKE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.\n"},
{"date": " October 21, 2006", "body": "\n YOU LIVE IN A ZOO, YOU LOOK LIKE A MONKEY AND SMELL LIKE ONE TOO! (Madagascar) - It is Beauty's Birthday today and she is six and she really is a little sweetheart. She seems to have grown over night. For her birthday she had lots of presents-a shark called Lenny which she called, 'fish' when she opened it(Jack Black's character in Shark Tale) from SnoWhite. An octopus from Fiona called Ziggy Which Beauty called, 'Spider'(after Ziggy Marley) and a nightie with Belle, Beauty and Cinderella on it, a guitar from Ariel which Beauty loved, Buzz Lightyear and Woody from PianoMan and some money, and Anastasia and Belle phoned with lots of love and kisses. Money from the family in Reading, money from John and Esme in Heritage Park and from me a Halloween T shirt and a camel called Corky who is from IKEA and is very odd looking and Beauty called a 'duck'-well I can see that! We are going to get her a cooker from Toys r us but due to the regeneration work in town Toys r us has been pulled down and will not re-open in the bay until next week so I will buy her a cooker when it re-opens. I find shopping in the bay a lot easy as I can park more easily, they are also building a new Argos on Newport Road near Dunhelms which is almost opposite Quik Fit. Talking about Quik Fit on Friday night my 2 outside tires were flat and Quik Fit callout came on Saturday morning, after he finished the work he informed me that my spare was flat(even though Quik Fit had 'fixed' it before, they missed a nail) and the rear tire had been put on wrongly( what that means I do not know!). So yes 'you can't fix quicker that a quiz Fit fitter' but are they safe? We picked Ariel up from work and on the way back we bought fish and chips etc for tea (Beauty's best tea), Beauty had her own fish and chips............She loved it. Beauty was fascinated with the Diwali shrine, next to the Diwali shrine we put photo's of Nan ( who Beauty calls,'Nan'). A picture of Anastasia and and a picture of Belle and Beau so everyone could be at the party. Whilst Beauty ate her cake she insisted that her' fa mily in the photo frames' sit with her on the table. She is a star! Beauty's cake was decorated with Belle, Cinderella and Beauty and she insisted on having the candles lit and blown out twice and then she had to blow out the Diwali candles AND THEN she singed her fringe on the candles! Thankfully it doesn't notice and she doesn't have any burns! Her best toy was the guitar from Ariel, it has lots of pre-recorded rifts(is that tight?). That reminds me, I have to get Fiona a Guitar teacher. When sh e was eating her cake at the table asked Beauty if he cake was good and she replied, 'delicious' and 'lovely' I was stunned. She also was able to tell me three quarters of her alphabet and she could say the rest when prompted. Beauty's best birthday so far, she was aware and appreciated everything. Beauty went to bed at 9:30pm playing with Woody and Buzz. My camera is still  lost  so SnoWhite and Ariel took photo's with their camera's so I will put hem on the blog ASAP.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/madagascar.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/shark.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/BUZZ.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/ZIGGY.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/kamel.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/WOODY.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/starguitar.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2654/2858/1600/alphabet.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2006/10/happy-birthday-to-you.html", "title": "\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.....\n"},

I washed and dressed her this morning but then she disappeared, after a frantic search I found her back asleep in bed! With all that time on my hands I managed to keep myself awake by washing dishes, clothes, scrubbing the kitchen table and  sorting out the rubbish and recycling. Plus I also had a phone call from Ariel who was at her fathers house, please could I bring down her Greece T Shirt as she was being picked up for her holiday by her friend at 4am and she had left it at my house. So at 1:30am we were out driving in the car, most children would fall asleep in the car but not Beauty, in fact she became very excited to be out driving at night. Talking of Ariel going on holiday, what is it with her and her friends and major terrorist incidents?. On 7/7, the London bombings, she and her friends were on their way to London for a day shopping. They were stopped at Reading and I had to go and pick them up in the car. Now her and her fiends are going on holiday to Greece today, out of Cardiff(Rhoose) airport after a weekend of major incidents on the streets of London and at Glasgow airport.I grew up in Rhoose and I know the airport quite well and if any one had decided to attack the front of the building it wouldn't have been difficult to access as you can drive right up to the front doors. Thankfully due to the heightened alert the security at Rhoose are now preventing access to the main frontage. From what I have read it seem that they are directing people into the airport through the back entrance off the by-pass and straight to the car parks.I hope she enjoys her holiday but I shall be relieved next Monday when she gets home and is safe and sound in her own bed. I am going to attempt a short recovery nap before I take the piggies to the vet at mid-day.

Ronan Keating, who left the Irish boy band to pursue a solo career, will join the group for the series of concerts. \"We've been talking about getting back together for some time now. I can't wait to be back on the road and all the guys feel the same.\" Keating said.    The 10-date tour is due to start on 30 May at London's O2 arena, and will end in Glasgow on 23 June. Boyzone are SnoWhite's first love. We will never hear the last of it. Well I suppose it could be worse, she could have been a crack head but instead I have a child obsessed with Irish boy bands.....sounds like a good deal to me! We have had Take That reform for Anastasia, Boyzone for SnoWhite and now all is left is PJ and Duncan for Belle(believe it or not I have seen PJ and Duncan 3 times in concert!). They were surprisingly very entertaining.                                    Yesterday I had to buy new keyboards for the computers as both had pretty much died, death by yoghurt-well fromage frais to be exact.Beauty has been known to eat at the computer(well frequently actually) and so no matter how hard we try the keyboards were filthy.I decided to trash the keyboards after sending an email to Belle in which her name was spelled wrong due to sticky keys causing a typo. The keyboards was also stringing all the words as the shift key was the stickiest of all keys. Now we will have perfect emails and no risk of salmonella. It shows how easily pleased I am.....whilst searching for something else I just discovered  how to create a \u20ac sign  and I was so thrilled. Imagine what I would be like if I discovered time travel or the answer to world peace. Look what else I found girls! How to accent your sister's name. accent site \u00f4  alt + 0244( using right hand number pad) \u00d4 alt + 0212(using right hand number pad) On Tuesday evening I went to Beauty's parent teacher meeting and it was all very positive. The biggest problem with Beauty is her lack of compliance, basically because she doesn't really understand that she needs to do something rather than her being naughty. All her goals I know she has already achieved but it is a matter of her doing them ,on demand, in school. Her speech is coming along so well, apart from the one naughty word that she came out with(which could have just sounded like a naughty word as her speech is still unclear at times) , she is doing brilliantly. Sometimes I have to stop and think about what she means when she says something as one set phrase could mean a few different things in Beauty's head. For instance, when I picked Beauty up from school on Tuesday she said WELL DONE, which roughly seemed to translate at the time as THANK YOU FOR COMING TO GET ME, I WANT TO GO HOME NOW.

{"date": " November 21, 2007", "body": "\nI CAN DO PROFOUND! I watched this documentary on Sunday night and have not been able to sleep since because I was so traumatised by what I saw. Bulgaria's Abandoned Children The Campaign for BULGARIA'S ABANDONED CHILDREN aims to challenge the standards of social care in Bulgaria and promote the practice of community based care for all disabled children and adults.                                         We began our campaign following the broadcasting of Kate Blewett\u2019s harrowing film 'Bulgaria's Abandoned Children' that exposed the appalling neglect of 75 unwanted and disabled children in the state-run Mogilino Institute. Members of the public, outraged at the children\u2019s suffering contacted Kate and together they have begun the campaign to challenge this neglect and rebuild the children's lives.           We have joined forces with an established charity, The Bulgaria Project, who have many years experience of working in orphanages and institutes across Bulgaria . Together we are campaigning to bring help into the Mogilino Institute to improve the children's immediate situation as well as ensure that they have long term care in a therapeutic environment that recognises their right to be protected, educated and respected. I am ashamed to say that it is not the first time that I have read about what is going on in Bulgaria and a few years ago I wrote to the government in Bulgaria and explained how I felt about the situation. However, I  also write letters for Amnesty International and have done so for the last 16 years and I am ashamed to say that after a while you read about so much suffering and pain that in the end you push it to the back of your mind to protect yourself. I was so upset by the treatment of the children in the Mogilino Institute that was shown in the documentary. I found the treatment of the deaf and blind children especially disturbing and upsetting because they received food(if you can call it that) and were washed daily and pottied and that was it. Then they sat in a little room , on little seats, doing nothing but rocking all day. None of the children were educated in anyway as the powers that be had labeled them ineducable. I was especially upset by the plight of Vasky,                        the poor little soul is blind and sits in a buggy all day. The documentary makers noticed that Vasky had a broken leg but the nurse was not interested and blamed some 'condition' for brittle bones. I wanted to scoop Vasky up and bring her home and care for her. Vasky was bedridden by the end of the documentary. I also found the adult institutions that were shown at the end of the program appalling and was deeply saddened by the man in his 30's talking about all he wanted was a Mummy. This is the  President of Bulgaria  Sergey Dmitrievich Stanishev  ( Bulgarian : \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0432, born  May 5 ,  1966 ),  Bulgarian  politician, is  Prime Minister of Bulgaria  and Chairman of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP). Stanishev, the second-youngest chairman of the BSP, is an unconventional politician. Although not married, he has been living for a long time with prominent journalist Elena Yoncheva. In 2002 he amazed party members when he came to a gathering at Buzludzha on a motorcycle with a rock-style jacket that had a label on the back saying: \"If you are reading this, Elena must have fallen off on the way.\" Stanishev is an active Internet user. He joined the Internet Society - Bulgaria [1] on April 22, 2001, and immediately following his election as leader of the Socialist Party in 2001, he had an ICQ-chat with hundreds of users. This is a quote from  Wikipedia I cannot believe that this man, who seems firmly seated in the 21st century could allow institutions like Mogilino to  exist. What would happen if he and his girlfriend had a child and the child was deaf or blind or had learning difficulties? Would that child end up in an institution? What would happen if their child were born 'perfect' and after an infection or accident developed problems? How many of us had any idea of our child's problems at birth? I cannot believe that he can know what these institutions are like, nobody as intelligent and well educated could know and allow them to continue.

I was very impressed. I read this on the news today and I had to look up the word  CANYONING all I could think was WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT ? I am a very unadventurous soul.

It is understood the man was canyoning with a group of 12 people. Forty members of Brecon Mountain Rescue Teams and a helicopter crew from RAF Chivenor in north Devon were called at around 1700 GMT on Saturday. The man was winched 230 ft (70m) into the helicopter and flown to the Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. The members of the Brecon, central Brecon and western Brecon mountain rescue teams were called to an area of the Neath valley, between the village of Pont Nedd Vaughan and the Ystradfellte waterfalls, at around 1600 GMT on Saturday.  Talking about trying to get yourself almost killed......it seems that Ariel has spent the weekend on Salisbury Plain doing some kind of  training.

Fiona could not believe that I had taken her to a country where there were so many  mosquitoes  and where the pipe system was half the size of the one at home which meant butt paper did not go down the toilet AFTER use but in a bin at the side of the toilet. Both however became  irrelevant  when the earthquake hit! The earthquake hit at 4:35am on the morning of Fiona's birthday, whilst it only lasted 5 to 10 seconds and I would say it was barely a 5, it turned Fiona into a 16 year old who moved very quickly. She ran from her bedroom to mine in a  nano  second! The day before she was a 15 year old who didn't like to exert to much energy but over night turned into a 16 year old who knew the importance of speed. I didn't hear of any damage on the island and almost all the buildings are only 1 or 2 stories and new builds all meet the regulations for buildings in quake areas. It seems that earthquakes on the island are an everyday experience and to be ignored...........well I'm not Greek and  it scared me! We could see the flight path of the aeroplanes from our room which thrilled Beauty and she got very excited when they took off. One day she heard an  aeroplane  taking off and she ran to the  balcony  shouting,'I think it's an  aeroplane ', I was thrilled at the improvement in her language skills. Beauty loved the holiday, usually we go to The Canaries in January or February so swimming is limited but here Beauty loved swimming in the sea and the swimming pool and she really tried hard to swim properly.

I blame Snowhite and Fiona equally, everything Snowhite says or does winds Fiona up and so Fiona then tries very hard to wind SnoWhite up and  it works every time. On Sunday evening they both went too far, Fiona wound SnoWhite up to breaking point so she slapped Fiona and then all hell broke loose. SnoWhite ran because Fiona was intent on killing her and yes she  physically could so I grabbed Fiona by the arm to stop her killing SnoWhite BUT Fiona kept trying to get SnoWhite and she dragged so hard that something snapped in my neck.

The same as everyone else, I do not agree with war but I certainly believe that we need to support the army when they are doing their job and less than \u00a32.50 an hour is certainly not supporting them.

I felt so much better  that last night I made a French Onion Soup from scratch and it was really good and as far as Weight Watchers is concerned it was Zero points.

Beauty wasn't able to walk until she was over 2 years old due to a hyper-mobility problem and even when she did learn to walk she didn't walk very far. Beauty's little legs are like saplings in the wind and when she stands you can see her ankles wobbling but they are getting better and she is a very determined young lady. Due to the fact that she cannot communicate properly , as yet we still do not know if she suffers pain in her joints. Beauty saw the physiotherapist this week, the same therapist who saw her when she was 2 and she can see the huge improvements that Beauty has made.The therapist is concerned that Beauty may have the same problems with her joints that I have , so if Beauty starts to limp again then I am to take her straight back to them to check her out.It is good to know that they are keeping an eye on the situation. They also suggested buying Beauty some boots with more support in the ankle, hence the new Dr Martens. Beauty loves them ( and so does Fiona!) and she is very happy to wear them which is good news. However, Beauty has never been very well co-ordinated and to get your toes stamped on by her size 2 Docs is not a joke! I am counting down the days until we go on holiday, no cooking and no housework. We are going on an all inclusive holiday so I looking forward to Beauty being able to try out lots of different foods.The day before yesterday in school she had some curry sauce and bread and butter! Well who would have thought it. Her teachers thought my reaction to this  news was very funny-I just cannot imagine her eating  curry sauce! Did anyone read this report?

A survey of 933 schools for school computing firm RM found only 1% of respondents were encrypting the data.    RM blamed a lack of clear guidance, but the government said it published advice for schools on the issue.

So I showered him in the upstairs bathroom,with 'Bunny Bubble Bath'(not Hugo Boss shower gel!) . The rabbit was so not happy and to show his disgust he jumped out of the bath and refused to get back in but not before he had been washed enough to look like a drowned rat. So he wouldn't catch a cold,Fiona even dried him with a hairdryer.  His hair looked so fluffed up he looked twice as fat and as if he had put his paw in an electricity socket!

Whilst her speech is progressing very well, so are her social skills and she is really becoming part of the group.

I also mentioned the crazy school transport drivers to the head teacher as their driving antics are getting scarier and scarier, I used to park in the school grounds like all the other parents but now I park out side and walk in as it is getting way too dangerous. Even that is worrying at time as everybody parks on the pavement so I have to negotiate the the road with drivers doing U-Turns, reversing  and speeding. Pushing a wheelchair with crazy drivers hurtling past you can be quite unnerving. Even with everything the school transport drivers do they are no way as crazy as the local religious school that I have to pass to get to Beauty's school. I have even seen parents kicking their children out of the cars whilst the cars are still moving and no I am not making that up. The parents and the children seem to be running everywhere and seem to have no road awareness. It is also not wise to confront them about their behaviour as the parents can become very aggressive . The parents just don't seem to understand that if they are late for work then that is all it is, they are late for work but if a child were run over and killed then being late for work would seem totally irrelevant.

Shops who make a big deal about not giving away carrier bags(I use the bio-degradable carrier bags as nappy bags) but sell millions of bin bags etc in their store which are just as bad as the non-biodegradable carriers they have stopped giving away and the billions of miles of non-bio - degradable plastic that covers their produce! More important things than my recycling rant..... UPDATE ON CHINA Human Rights for China - the Olympics countdown \"... by allowing Beijing to host the Games you will help the development of human  rights\"  Liu Jingmin, Olympic Games Bid Committee - April 2001   \"We are convinced that the Olympic Games will improve human rights in China\"    Jacques Rogge, President of the IOC - April 2002       As the Olympic torch approaches China for its momentous entry into the Olympic  stadium, the stage is overshadowed by China's deteriorating human rights situation.  This deterioration is happening not just despite the Olympics, but because of  the Olympics.   Time is running out before the start of the Olympic Games. The Chinese authorities  are not keeping their promises to improve human rights before the Olympics start.   Amnesty International is mobilising globally to press for substantial reforms  in four key areas:   The death penalty  Punitive detention without trial and the prevention of torture  Human rights defenders  Unwarranted censorship of the internet   It is China's choice to improve its human rights record. But the responsibility  is shared by the Olympic movement and governments around the world. When August  2008 arrives, Amnesty wants the Chinese people to be proud in every respect of  what their country has to offer the world.   China's human rights record     Critics of the government sent to labour camps, widespread torture and trade  unions banned - just some of the issues affecting China in the run up to the Games.   Find out more about China's human rights record   Tension in Tibet   Chinese police are sweeping through the homes of Tibetan capital Lhasa residents  in search of people involved in recent protests in the city.

Final Potter film 'split in half'                                                                                                                               The Potter films have made around \u00a32.2bn at the box office                           The seventh and final Harry Potter novel will be adapted for the big screen in two parts, reports suggest.  Producer David Heyman told the Los Angeles Times it had been impossible to cram Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows' 608 pages into a single movie But for parents of Potter fans..... Funny story- Anastasia was watching TV in Austria the other week when suddenly she started shouting to her boyfriend IT'S MY SISTERS! FIONA & ARIEL Thinking they were on the phone , Dimitri wondered what all the fuss was about. HOWEVER, it was the program about the  Entertainer Shop  that they had  recorded  quite a number of years ago now, being shown on Austrian TV!It was about the Christian guy who owned the Entertainer shop who wouldn't sell Harry Potter things because of the magic element and because he found the content 'unchristian' but sold Lord of the Rings things in his shop plus magic wands etc. He also sold WWE which many could say encourages violence, however, having been to a number of wrestling shows recently I would describe the show more like musical theatre! And don't get me started on BRATZ.....that is just wrong! And then there was the time we went to Scotland to do a  Press Pack  for Newsround, so here is Ariel's 15 minutes of fame. Was that really 6 years ago? Ariel doesn't look much older at all. She must take after SnoWhite who doesn't seem to  have aged much in the last 10 years, SnoWhite has a passport photo which was taken 7 years ago and she looks exactly the same now. I was looking at a photo taken of me the other day that was taken when I was 37, 10 years ago, and in the photo I only looked about 25. I think that it might be genetic thing, something to do with red hair and pale skin. Joyous  sleep last night, Beauty slept through from 10pm until 8am.However, when that happens she usually makes up for it with a couple of interrupted nights sleep. Fiona and SnoWhite want to get Beauty some posters for the bedroom wall, they are especially keen on getting some High School musical posters!

As Pianoman is in hospital with pneumonia I am visiting his mother daily to check on her and give her lunch AND feed Simba.Well for days she has been wittering on about her prescription which I requested Monday but as it takes 2 days to be done I couldn't get it until yesterday.Well to cut a long story short(I promise you do not want to hear it!) after she had me running around everywhere, she ALREADY had it, she had got the neighbour to get it BUT couldn't remember. She is driving me potty. I personally think she is perfectly lucid and it is a master stroke at revenge, if this theory is true she makes Jane Fonda in Monster-in-Law look like a pussy cat! Talking of pussy cats. After trying but failing to pick up the prescription I drove back to Pianoman's mother's house around the back of Splott Road Library and came across a kitten that had been knocked over and killed still in the road. Bastards. They could have at least picked up the little thing and done something with it. I went to the PDSA on Bute Street for advice on what to do with the kitten and they were prepared to take him and deal with it so I left it there. I was as weepy as if the kitten had been one of Simbas. Some people can be heartless bastards. Imagine if the children had come home from school and seen it, the kitten was a bit of a mess and if I had seen that as a child I would have been devastated. I am so exhausted from visiting Pianomand and his mother daily that I am knackered.....there is no other word for it,I haven't watched TV in 2 weeks and that is unusual for me. However, last night the girls were watching a program about obese teenagers finding love at a 'Fat Camp' and I did catch a glimpse and all I could think was how low will these TV shows stoop to make a reality TV show and increase ratings? It made me think 'Am I really missing anything by not watching TV?'.

{"date": " September 07, 2009", "body": "\nYes I am home and very glad to be here. BUT I know that I shall want to be travelling again very soon(Benidorm(save me)The Canaries,Oberammagau,The Nile),I am always the same. I once read about Brits who emigrated to Austrailia but after a few years decided they missed the UK too much and then came back here BUT then after a few more years they started to miss Austrailia again and went back to Austrailia and the cycle began all over again! Hey that is me......I need to travel. BUT I need to come home too. I love my home and my own bed. I have so much news and so much to say that I keep jotting things down in my notebook so I don't forget. So here I am now. It is just past 6 am and it is the first day back of school for Beauty of the Autumn term and she is still asleep and will hopefully stay in her bed until at least 7am so I can write this entry and get on with things around the house. I may be writing but whilst I collect my ideas I am also cleaning and tidying and doing the dishes and washing and getting Beauty's uniform ready. Nothing too exciting or hard really,a little bit of multi-tasking never hurt anyone! I know it has been said that men cannot multi-task as well as women but then perhaps that is not always such a bad thing.........look at Hitler with his Operation Barbarossa,if he had settled for one attack at a time into Russia during WWII instead of a three pronged attack, then we might be speaking German now. Of course, not that there is any problem with speaking German Dimitri but they were not nice Germans,you have to admit that. Actually that is very high on my to do list......LEARN GERMAN. I want to be able to understand my grand-children!!!!!! First thing on my TO-DO list for today is phone for a Doctors Appointment. I know it is an FMS thing but my right elbow feels as if it is dropping off with pain and I am unable to sleep it is so bad. As I have said previously,if only elbows could be optional! It used to be my right hip I would have happily given back but that is no longer constantly painful, only when lying on it. As you all know  and I Beauty spent the summer in the USA and whilst we are thrilled to be home we are missing it very much, our family and friends but believe it or not, as yet we are not missing the weather.You can definitely have too much of a good thing. But I know come November I will be missing the sun and even Benidorm and the marathon will look appealing. At the moment though , my neck and back are still recovering from the burning they recieved in Florida.Thankfully the pain has stopped but the itching and flaking drive me crazy(well crazier)at times! So before I finish as it is getting close to 7am and time for the little darling to wake up for her bath and breakfast, something about my trip to the USA.......what can I say? The lack of poncy people impressed me most. A few days ago I took Beauty to Hay on Wye and on the way we stopped at Llanthony Abbey for lunch and whilst we were there another couple were taking their approximately 9 and 11 year old around the Abbey.Well the 2 boys were arrogant,obnoxious,pompous little gits and the parents weren't far behind, they were constantly talking so eveybody could hear and they were showing off. I am sure there are badly behaved children and adults everywhere but the one thing I noticed about the places that we visited in the US were the lack of poncy, snobby people and I liked that.

{"date": " May 29, 2009", "body": "\nIn the last few weeks Beauty has gone through another developmental leap as far as language and understanding and speech is concerned. This was confirmed yesterday when Beauty got upset with SnoWhite  for not letting her do something and Beauty turned around and gave SnoWhite one almighty punch. Beauty turned around and slugged her! It was quite a shock but not such a surprise that SnoWhite  immediately PUNCHED(well a forceful push really) her back! Sisters being sisters they all fight sometimes(well some more than others!) but I have for years been telling Ariel not to pick on Fiona as she will turn around and punch her back but Ariel was all blase OH NO, I COULD BEAT FIONA IN A FIGHT! Until, I think it was just before Christmas,Ariel said something very unkind to Fiona and it was the straw the broke the camels back! Fiona lamped Ariel and Ariel was left crying,more with shock than pain! Well answer me this, if you are only 5ft 9in are you really going to p..off someone who is over 6 feet tall EVEN IF they are younger than you? Not a wise move there Ariel! Heck she scares me! Well back to the developmental leap. Now when Beauty is told it is time to go to bed she says Not bed and Not bed now and No bed! And when she asks for a drink she says Drink Please, red juice not orange juice! I can also get her to help me tidy away her toys and when she asks for cereal, I can get her to get the cereal,milk and sprinkles(sugar) and put them all away afterwards. However,her ingenuity as an escapologist increases daily! She has escaped the front window, heck I can't even open that! She has escaped through the back gate a number of times  to dance in the street!!!!! don't even go there! which has made me lock the back gate whenever we are in the house! And she knows when we are out if she runs off her Mobility Challenged Mother(you can call me a cripple!) will have difficulty keeping up with her! Beauty on our visit to Roath Park The other day Runningman and myself took Beauty for a walk around Roath Park lake and at one point Beauty ran off and I had to walk fast to grab her and I wasn't pleased as it hurt.....A LOT! So I turned to Runningman and said LET'S MAKE THIS CLEAR,YOU ARE CALLED RUNNINGMAN FOR A REASON.........IT'S BECAUSE YOU RUN! SO WHEN BEAUTY RUNS OFF YOU RUN AFTER HER! He was not a happy bunny! Yesterday Ariel arrived in Florida and fell exhausted into a bed and Woody fell asleep next to her.......well Belle took a photo and posted it on Facebook and when Beauty saw it she said HELLO S___ HELLO PUPPY! Also yesterday the IT man visited and Beauty is usually in school when he calls but a few months ago he called when she was off school ill and she was thrilled that he had brought his dog with him.Well he showed up yesterday straight from work so no dog in tow and when  she saw him she immediately pushed passed him into the study and said DOG(I have a basket there for the dog)? She was very disappointed to find no dog. And Beauty has discovered something on the internet called  STARFALL CAMP. This is a brilliant website for teaching your child to read and Beauty found it all by herself and before I had never known how much Beauty could read and from this site I can tell she knows A LOT.Her reading is probably a lot better than other children her age. As yet she hasn't made the connection that with all this reading knowledge she can read books on her own. Do you know that even at my advanced age and not being able to remember things that happened yesterday,I can remember the first time I was able to read at home a book that wasn't a school reading book.......it was a surprise, a delightful surprise.I remember being thrilled at what I could do and the thought now of a life without words and books and reading would not be a life at all. I can remember the book now,not the story just the book. I was a childs story book and it was a thin,blue paperback book.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sh9xV8fqkVI/AAAAAAAABm0/yxBSnt-viW0/s1600-h/new+may+052.jpg", "http://www.starfall.com/"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/05/leaps-and-bounds.html", "title": "\nLEAPS AND BOUNDS!\n"},

Yesterday, Beauty had a meltdown of the most amazing kind.It took maybe 20 minutes plus to drag her from the tills in ASDA in The Bay to the car parked in the disability bay which would normally take 1 minute if we ran(if I could run!). And the problem? Beauty and I had just taken my sister who was visiting from Sussex to Pizza hut and when the meal was over and we were leaving the waitress gave Beauty a balloon which I tied to her wrist.The string remained tied to her wrist but the balloon came loose and floated away(helium filled) to the ceiling of the shop and ASDA has very high ceilings. Well Beauty refused to leave her balloon and I had to drag her inch by inch to the car park, I now feel as if I have dislocated my shoulder AND my back. I was soaked with perspiration by the end of it and it was nothing to do with my age. I have also lost 2 pounds in weight since yesterday and that is not a joke. My joints also went into their own personal meltdown and the only way I can describe it is the way that your mouth feels when you have a dentist injection BUT in all your joints.Even today my hands and neck and back are still asleep. As a result I now have another duffel coat( the pink one) that has to go to the dry cleaners due to the fact that the car park floor was very wet! Who would be a mother? I need a holiday. I feel a bit like the people in history who brought their animals in for the winter, the pigs and the rabbits are now happily ensconced in the front porch. I know they have their own fur coats but the front garden where they live is very exposed(even with a 6 feet high fence) .....OK ,I'm  a sap I admit it. For all you Guinea pig lovers out there,we visited IKEA yesterday and IKEA has a new toy .....a guinea pig, so Beauty insisted on buying one. I also saw Simba last night and he was thrilled to see me, I haven' seen that cat in ages but he definitely remembered me and wanted lots of fuss. You will have to go and check him out when you come home for Christmas Anastasia.

But most of all, can Mr California Man see that the sun is shining in both pictures? The sun may not shine here all of the time but it does shine as you can see from both the photographs! We are awake at STUPID O'CLOCK again! Well anything is STUPID O'CLOCK if it is before 6am if you are not prepared to be awake.When I worked nights,I loved working nights but that was because I had slept during the day and was ready for being awake all night but this is a form of torture.Thankfully today is the day the childminders take Beauty so I will be able to have a nap whilst they go and play somewhere like  JUMP . CARDIFF JUMP PLAY CENTRE  Can you see why Beauty loves  this place ?It is an amazing place for children(and their mothers!) They took Beauty to  Techniquest  a few weeks ago which she loves equally as much and I intend to buy a family season ticket so they can take her more often. You can see why Beauty loves Techniquest.The adults look like they are having lots of fun too! I have just been in to check what Beauty is doing and I am happy to tell you that she seems to be thoroughly enjoying watching a repeat of  Antiques Roadshow .I think Beauty may grow up to have similar interests to mine! One activity I really must get sorted out for Beauty is cycling which was recomended by her physiotherapist to help with her joints.  PEDAL POWER   is situated in Sophia Gardens in town.they are able to cycle around Sophia Gardens,Pontcanna fields,Cooper's Field and Bute Park.But hopefully not all on the same day!   BUTE PARK A poem I remember reading in school. SUNDAY MORNING Down the road someone is practising scales, The notes like little fishes vanish with a wink of tails, Man's heart expands to tinker with his car For this is Sunday morning, Fate's great bazaar; Regard these means as ends, concentrate on this Now, And you may grow to music or drive beyond Hindhead anyhow, Take corners on two wheels until you go so fast That you can clutch a fringe or two of the windy past, That you can abstract this day and make it to the week of time A small eternity, a sonnet self-contained in rhyme. But listen, up the road, something gulps, the church spire Open its eight bells out, skulls' mouths which will not tire To tell how there is no music or movement which secures Escape from the weekday time. Which deadens and endures.

{"date": " August 11, 2008", "body": "\nA watery sun and for only a few moments but I definitely saw the sun. Beauty awoke very early this morning, it was still dark but she stayed in bed until it was light and for that I am grateful. But first thing this morning there was definitely some watery sunshine. Perhaps some more sunshine later on.....we can but hope. Today I took Beauty for a ride in the car to the Bay and we stopped at IKEA to get Beauty her favorite.....ice cream!  We only went to the Bistro but it certainly had to be one of our  most eventful  trips to IKEA!  I entered the shop doors to a near constant high pitched screaming, a child had trapped their fingers in the moving handrail of the escalator. There was blood everywhere. Thinking about the situation I feel quite guilty really as on at least 2 occasions I have caught my fingers on the same rail and it was really painful and the reason why I didn't report it was because I thought the shop wouldn't take me seriously and they would think it was my own fault. A few months ago we used a disability trolley in ASDA Pontprennau and the handle of the trolley came off and so I reported it to customer services and as I left the shop I saw the staff return the trolley to the trolley area. I reported the trolley twice more and now it stands in the trolley area MINUS a handle! This is how much ASDA Pontprennau cares about the health and safety of their customers. Today I encountered A Yummy Mummy and I had the sincere desire to knock her out! She and her bratty children  needed a dose of Super Nanny. Her way of dealing with her children reminded me of the Doctor Spock devotees of the 70's and  80's.I once knew a mother who believed that the works of Doctor Spock were the only way to bring up your children, instead of telling her children off when they were naughty she would 'divert their energies' into something else. Two of her children ended up using drugs and one resorted to serious crime to feed his habit. Yummy Mummy's overly loud, whining daughter drove me to distraction with her constant questioning of WHY WAS THE QUEUE SO LONG. Her son swinging constantly on the queue barriers and tipping the barriers over and Yummy Mummy telling the daughter to leave the son alone and let him play! And Yummy Mummy seemingly unaware of the danger her son was to himself and other customers. It was this unawareness that 'fished' me off most. AND yes I have been there when your children drive you to distraction and you let them do almost anything so they will give you a break BUT it wasn't anything like that. Yummy Mummy was blithely unaware and appeared perfectly in tune with the universe. This all happened in the Bistro queue in IKEA and SnoWhite who works there has recounted many tales of the 'Yummy Mummy' and their children and how they behave and I now believe every word of the stories she comes home with about their obnoxious behavior. Amongst many punters who use the IKEA food facilities there seems to be the impression that those who work there are stupid people and are there to be verbally abused. From what I know though,many of the workers are doing A Levels, are in college or are in university and even so, working full time in the catering industry is nothing to be ashamed of. We live in an age where manual work is more and more despised and not treated with respect. I may be a qualified nurse and teacher but over the years I have worked as a cook,waitress,dish washer, cleaner, housekeeper,nanny and various forms of shop work and I am very proud to have done these things. All my girls have worked part time whilst they have studied and because of this they were able to buy things and do things and go places that they  wouldn't otherwise been able to. Now that was good BLOG RANT.....I haven't done that in ages. Almost as good as a bowl of strawberry Ice Cream!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/08/i-saw-sun.html", "title": "\nI SAW THE SUN!\n"},

Whilst I still spent half of the day sitting down,I managed to catch upon the washing,cleaned the lounge and the bathroom in between my many sit down breaks! PLUS.....I managed hourly toilet training with Beauty which showed a small amount of success. Today I am hoping for a similar amount of success, with feeling better AND toilet training! On Saturday night and Sunday night,due to the fact that I had been resting all day,I only slept part of the night and for the rest of the night I was convinced that my back garden was inundated by visitors and no I wasn't having hallucinations! I have a number of  gnomes in my garden which Beauty loves and one of them has a sensor which produces a wolf whistle every time somebody walks past him. And that particular gnome was whistling all night! My garden is built in such a way that the only real entry is through the gate and that makes a hideous screeching noise when opened so I knew nobody had entered the garden.  So what could it have been? I spent my wakeful time convinced that my garden was inundated by wild animals ie cats,rats or foxes Or even the gnomes and SnoWhite  and the other garden ornaments were partying! But no..... Yesterday I went to see what had been going on and found the answer.....it had been very windy during the night and the old piggy hutch door had been blowing open and shut in front of the gnome all night,setting off the sensor!

It is the sleeplesss nights that are the biggest problems. If only the nights that the pains in my arm kept me awake corresponded with the nights that Beauty decides to stay awake and party!

The class was held at  The Howardian education centre  and I was really surprised to see so many classes available for one morning, I have never been to such a large education centre before. In the first class we separated into 3 groups and each group discussed a poem about ageing and then presented their findings.I was in the group that discussed and presented the poem Warning ,better known as When I Am Old I Shall Wear Purple. Afterwards we had to write a response to what we had discussed and studied. In 10 minutes I wrote the following,remember ......10 minutes is a very short time! Now I am older And my children older too, I no longer have to worry Or do the things I had to do. I eat Sugar Puffs for my supper And cold pizza at breakfast time, Even though I know I shouldn't, Guilt is no longer a trait of mine. Not much I know but it is a start.

Eighteen viewers complained the singer, from Nefyn, Gwynedd, was not wearing reflective clothing and her bicycle had no lights in the Diet Coke commercial.  The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) also said four viewers worried children could copy her behaviour.  Coca-Cola argued the ad was supposed to reflect \"Duffy's fantasy\".  The commercial shows the singer coming offstage before sipping from a can of the cola and cycling through dark streets and into the store, before returning to her concert in time to perform an encore.  Coca-Cola argued the commercial depicted Duffy's escape from the pressures of stardom and was \"far removed from the real world\".  Highway Code The company also said they had gone through a \"vigorous\" production process to ensure they met the Highway Code criteria for riding a bicycle on public roads.  With the regulations recommending cyclists wear reflective clothing in the dark, Coca-Cola pointed out Duffy wore a black and white sparkly top that stood out, while her bicycle had lights on the front and rear in each shot.  After investigating, the ASA did not uphold the complaints, noting the \"fantasy context\" and deciding that older children would understand cycling round a supermarket was not a realistic situation.  A Brit Award winner, Duffy is best known for her number one hit Mercy and her album Rockferry.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.growingcommunities.org/recipies/greens.htm", "http://www.growingcommunities.org/recipies/greens.htm", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sjq2_mDBLuI/AAAAAAAABnU/JC3WKHX4WHg/s1600-h/linny.jpg", "http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?Duffy_to_add_fizz_to_the_Brits&in_article_id=537575&in_page_id=7", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/Sjq7cndDUHI/AAAAAAAABnk/yjOWubCuAlo/s1600-h/duffy.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/06/man-is-harder-than-iron-stronger-than.html", "title": "\n\u201cMan is harder than iron, stronger than stone and more fragile than a rose.\u201d\n"},

Beth Windows, a 24-year-old student in her final year of the Contemporary Textiles Practice course at UWIC\u2019s School of Art & Design, has produced a powerful selection of work inspired by the shootings.   \u201cI was touched by a documentary that looked at school shootings and human tragedies,\u201d explained Beth who is originally from the Forest of Dean but now lives in Cardiff. \u201cThe 2006 shootings in Pennsylvania at an Amish school house particularly disturbed me because of the overwhelming sense of innocence in that particular community.   \u201cI have a background in fashion design, so taking the very distinctive dress and the need for plainness, my work became a burial gown. Five children lived and five died and they are represented by the tags hanging from the gowns.    \u201cWhite is used for the idea of innocence, while red is associated with youthfulness - no matter what they will always be youthful and they will carry the scar for life.    \u201cThe tags include paraphrased quotes from the children; there is one that has the prescription from over the door of the school house that reads \u2018visitors bring joy to our school.\u2019 A horrifying thing that people noticed when they visited the school afterwards.\u201d                           Following the shootings, the Amish community continued to dominate the headlines for their attitude of forgiveness towards the gunman and his family, as well as stories leaking about how the young children reacted during their hostage ordeal.   Beth said: \u201cAnother of the tags says \u2018God\u2019s perfect timing\u2019. So it\u2019s a child that understands the Bible to some degree. One of the older ones said \u201cshoot me first and let the little ones go\u201d to save her sister. The Amish people forgave \u2013 I don\u2019t quite grasp that.\u201d   Beth\u2019s work will be on display at UWIC\u2019s summer exhibition at the Llandaff and Howard Gardens campuses from Saturday 7 June to Friday 13 June, open from 10am to 8pm daily, 12noon finish on Friday 13.

I think I will gain more from going to classes where I will learn and practice individual techniques. I would love to learn how to paint with oils properly and also how to properly use pastels.

{"date": " September 24, 2008", "body": "\ny SORRY GIRLS FOR NOT UPDATING REGULARLY. For the last week and a half I have had a sore throat, sore ears and a b-tch of a headache! I have had one of those constant thick head aches that doesn't want to shift plus getting on the computer has been almost impossible at times. And no it isn't the result of alcohol......it would have to be a bloody long hangover as the last alcohol I had and that was merely a sip , was the 31st December1999. I probably need new glasses. Beauty appears to be using mine! Really good news on the weather front. The rain seems to have gone and we are having some sun everyday, plus it is a little blowy so the washing is drying well and the pigs and rabbits get to go out in their playpen everyday. Beauty in her new winter coat. PED EGG No this is not me promoting the product I have ALWAYS had dry feet( I know, too much detail) and I seem to have spent my life ( and a fortune on foot products) trying to keep my feet nice. The Knap  Sunday  Evening. Barry Island Sunday Evening. I have been watching re-runs of the  COAL HOUSE  and I am hooked. When the program was first shown we were on FREEVIEW and we couldn't get the COAL HOUSE due to poor reception but now we have Virgin TV it is one of my favourite shows. I was disappointed at the beginning when I started to watch it but that was only to do with my own pre-conceptions of what it was to be about. My father had been a miner and I thought it would shed some light on what  his life had been like growing up but staraight away I could see it was culturallydifferent but even so it was still fascinating. My father was brought up in Cwm Amman near Aberdare and his mother died when he was very young of TB spine and his aunt lived with him and his father and she took care of the house.My grandfather was a signal man on the railway and worked all the way through the depression and so whilst his work was not brilliantly paid the money was still constant and they had  quite a good life. I remember my father telling us how his aunt would give away the clothes that he had out grown during the depression years and they must have been doing OK to be able to just give clothes away. My father went to the Grammar school but decided to go down the pit with his friends and left school early even though his family wanted him to stay at school.When the war broke out he joined the army. So whilst he was a miner for a short time, his was not the typical mining family. Being an only child I am sure my father's up-bringing was probably better than the average child. It was difficult to correlate the hardships of the COAL HOUSE with my father's childhood but even so it was a fascinating show. Fiona and SnoWhite felt that I would probably enjoy being on the COAL HOUSE program and I think I probably would. The way they cook on the COAL HOUSE is really not too different to the way I cook and tonight is Corned Beef Hash Pie for the meat eaters of the family. Due to the number of adverts on TV by different stores about how you can feed a family of 4 for under \u00a35 my girls seem to be especially interested in how much the evening meals cost. Last night we had a home made pie filled with vegetables and soya mince, potatoes, peas and carrots and Beauty had pasta and sauce and the total came to under \u00a33:50. Not too bad for these CREDIT CRUNCH times or whatever they are callingit now. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SNoeHIA9XiI/AAAAAAAABE8/GEvkjWbrGtI/s1600-h/09-09-08+057.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SNoc6_t0gbI/AAAAAAAABE0/842fRk9ARWk/s1600-h/09-09-08+048.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SNomJEvttOI/AAAAAAAABFE/Ts4XchOp9_U/s1600-h/20-09-08+059.jpg", "http://www.jmldirect.com/product.asp?pf_id=P3399&changecurrency=GBP", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SNondMAeXnI/AAAAAAAABFM/zKAqVHENV6o/s1600-h/23-09-08+033.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SNooBjolcoI/AAAAAAAABFU/shWe_DZx1ZQ/s1600-h/23-09-08+067.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/coalhouse2/index.shtml"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/09/yes-i-am-still-here.html", "title": "\nYES I  AM STILL HERE.....\n"},

The Bay was set up for the Weekend Food Festival so there was plenty for Beauty to see when she had finished with her puddles. AND I am pleased to say that her boots were well and truly waterproof. Which is more than can be said for my CROCS! It was nice that the rain had stopped and that the sun had come out. The grass around the Helter Skelter was absolutely sodden so this weekend I predict a MUD BATH! The Norwegian Church. Beauty thoroughly enjoyed puddle jumping. This puddle was so deep that it came up to my ankles! I had to run into the puddle to stop Beauty sitting in the water! As I said yesterday, it may not seem like it but the sun does occasionally  shine in Cardiff. The proof. Beauty had a lovely time. As well as these photographic memories, I also caught a BLOODY cold! Our next excursion will definitely be somewhere dryer. Fiona is totally convinced that adults are strange creatures(well her mother anyway!). I belong to  Cardiff Freecycle it is a site where people give things away for free rather than put them into landfill or allow further energy to be used recycling them. Recently I managed to get an old Singer sewing machine and a portable TV. As well I respond to peoples requests for items. This week I gave away some of my jam jar collection to someone who wants to make jam(I left them in a basket by my back gate as I had to go out) and I am also giving away a beginners Guitar book( awaiting collection in the empty but clean rabbit hutch). Fiona being a product of a disposable age,cannot get her head around just not going to a shop and buying something. I think the leaving things in a rabbit hutch also throws her a bit! However,in defense of the rabbit hutch, Amazon also uses it to put my parcels in when I am out so I am not the only crazy one.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SHb7B0NQnNI/AAAAAAAAA58/IhM_8xD1iig/s1600-h/DINGLE+020.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SHb62j55xTI/AAAAAAAAA50/n4VHQCRFZU0/s1600-h/DINGLE+017.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SHb6tTtZBFI/AAAAAAAAA5s/PDvhhdhYJfY/s1600-h/DINGLE+016.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SHb6levEmqI/AAAAAAAAA5k/EQg9JPK-kJo/s1600-h/DINGLE+015.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SHb6eBQwZuI/AAAAAAAAA5c/YNhA38CMpWs/s1600-h/DINGLE+014.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SHb6UdUvbwI/AAAAAAAAA5U/x7BWr5HOZo4/s1600-h/DINGLE+007.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SHb6J7Una7I/AAAAAAAAA5M/YJUZ6oSPgWY/s1600-h/DINGLE+006.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SHb6A_96AhI/AAAAAAAAA5E/KVWZl8mvxlo/s1600-h/DINGLE+012.jpg", "http://www.freecycle.org/group/UK/Wales/Cardiff"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/07/puddle-jumping.html", "title": "\nPUDDLE JUMPING!\n"},

{"date": " June 20, 2008", "body": "\n For tea yesterday I made curry and the reason it was so green Fiona was the fact it was a veggie curry with broccoli! It also contained Quorn 'chicken' chunks(which of course did not add to the green colour!).  I also made sun dried tomato, olive and cheese bread rolls. Fiona complimented them by saying she preferred home made bread and then proceeded to pick out all the pieces of tomato! Due to yesterday being a CATCH-UP-ON-SLEEP day, I seem to have slept for 24 hours and I am still exhausted. I went to bed when Beauty went to bed to get as much sleep as possible and I have to say that it was strange going to bed for the night when it was still a bit light. Which reminded me of the following poem that I read as a child. Bed in Summer by Robert Louis Stevenson   In winter I get up at night   And dress by yellow candle-light.   In summer, quite the other way,    I have to go to bed by day.    I have to go to bed and see   The birds still hopping on the tree,    Or hear the grown-up people\u2019s feet   Still going past me in the street.    And does it not seem hard to you,    When all the sky is clear and blue,    And I should like so much to play,    To have to go to bed by day? Yesterday we watched Big Brother, we felt compelled to watch the whole 'Alex Thing'. When I saw the part where Alex made the threats against the other contestants and their families I felt that she came across as a silly little girl full of bluster rather than anything to be taken seriously.HOWEVER, I do agree that her behaviour was threatening and unacceptable. I also felt that her behaviour towards Mohamed was totally unacceptable, telling him his behaviour as a Muslim was unacceptable when hers as a human being let alone a Muslim was atrocious. I also felt that her behaviour towards Rachel was unacceptable, when Rachel made spaghetti and left it on the hob for people to take as they wished, Alex went on and on and on and Rachel did not retaliate. My girls would never behave like Alex because I have taught them it is just not good manners. For example, when my girls were younger I taught them it was rude to stare at people if for instance they were different in anyway and especially if they had disabilities. Today I feel that teaching manners to children just doesn't seem a high priority anymore. When I take Beauty shopping almost all the children stare continuously at Beauty, some children even follow us around the shop and their parents are totally oblivious. Perhaps respect and good manners is something that needs to be included in Personal,Social and Health Education in schools, however I can't see it NOT being included already. Perhaps it is the reinforcement at home that is lacking. I have come across many well behaved, well mannered lovely children and when I meet these children I always wonder why more children can't be like them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SFtEauBHVoI/AAAAAAAAA0k/CN527Gy8nq4/s1600-h/SUNSHINEY+DAY+053.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SFtF6eHwStI/AAAAAAAAA0s/b3EoHO--kh4/s1600-h/SUNSHINEY+DAY+050.jpg", "http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lone-star.net%2Fmall%2Fliterature%2Frls%2FBedinSummer.htm&ei=KEZbSNioJaKQQNvyoIkM&usg=AFQjCNHFrKJ7N-lL17dPj6MYVpTZw_RJ3A&sig2=dHT5pw590zYdH1UsAAa8tg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/06/green-curry.html", "title": "\nGREEN CURRY\n"},

Not much of an achievement for most people but for me that is amazing. I am so not a Luddite but I do have problems with technology and this is the woman who passed the first year of computer degree! I just cannot retain these things in my head but I am really good at the arts so that is something.  However, the girls are all better on the computer than me (even Beauty) but it is me that has to sort out any computer related problems. Fiona was having a meltdown the other day because the computer wouldn't work so I suggested that I take a look and she sarcastically said WHY DO YOU HAVE MAGIC FINGERS? To cut a long story short.....It seems that I do have magic fingers and was able to quickly get the computer working.....the plug had come out! So it seems that I have other uses than JUST supplying money to the LITTLE DRAIN ON MY RESOURCES. Whilst Belle was home I decided to take all the girls out for a meal, we had a brilliant meal at Pizza Hut in the Bay. OUR PIZZA HUT PARTY  BELLE,MIKE&ARIEL I also have pictures of SnoWhite and Fiona but they like to approve all photographs so maybe later. I have to rush off now as I have to go feed Pianoman's mother as social services only do 2 visits a day. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/ST-VIMRtEiI/AAAAAAAABWY/YrkOtf4sz2c/s1600-h/440.JPG"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2008/12/i-have-spared-you-all-today-no-cliff.html", "title": ""},

{"date": " April 11, 2009", "body": "\nAs a true Brit I am constantly looking at the weather forecast and the skies. Last night there was a `red sky` and today the weather forecast says sunny spells which means a good day to wash clothes and car boot! Last night I finished cleaning the front garden so today I am hoping Runningman will jetspray the floor. The floor is made of child safety surfacing to stop Beauty hurting herself when she tumbles and it is very difficult to keep clean! Fiona is such a sweetheart! She told me yesterday that I wasn`t very photogenic! She told me that my face, my skin and my hair look better in `real life` rather than in a photograph.Oh and I look better when I smile but not smile too much. Well that was a backhanded comliment if I ever heard one. Here is a photo of Fiona`s unphotogenic mother! Just remember Fiona, I am a mother of 6 and I have an almost 27 year old! A big  HI  to  SnoWhite and Ariel in Syria and I hope you are having fun. And I hope the weather is nicer than here and if you want to but me a present SnoWhite then a couple of balls of wool from the market would be nice. Some photos that I took at Allensbank In keeping with Easter I especially love Celtic Crosses \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SeAs_sKJInI/AAAAAAAABjI/1mvtscOmPH4/s1600-h/186.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SeAwzC7HhdI/AAAAAAAABjg/nEJ-rU9Xz4E/s1600-h/101.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SeAwzog0AkI/AAAAAAAABjw/xdzRazu-BEA/s1600-h/113.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SeAwybVc5AI/AAAAAAAABjQ/b7z3c8ioYt4/s1600-h/084.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SeAwyptLrzI/AAAAAAAABjY/7GUY4yIzb48/s1600-h/089.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SeAwze3zLmI/AAAAAAAABjo/WxZGgI7eMvE/s1600-h/115.JPG"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/04/happy-easter.html", "title": "\nHAPPY EASTER\n"},
{"date": " September 08, 2009", "body": "\n I have a juicer I do not often use but all my juice recipe books say to keep the juicer out on your counter or on your kitchen table and then you will use it more. So my juicer now has pride of place on my kitchen table and I have started to juice again. And my first recipe was to help my skin repair itself after the sunburn. The recipe called for 3 carrots, 3 pieces of brocoli and some water cress. Sounds disgusting? I totally agree but it tasted a lot better than it looked. And if it does my skin good!     \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SqZ1Hx0LtRI/AAAAAAAABos/roWpOL45rRo/s1600-h/IMG00879%5B1%5D.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ewUTPgcfHys/SqZw-0Z0uvI/AAAAAAAABok/UWi_01vdA2A/s1600-h/juicer.jpg"], "link": "http://ablogonthespectrum.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-juiced.html", "title": "\nI JUICED!\n"}
