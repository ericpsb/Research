Allan's sleep machine is in a steady breath rhythm. \n \nJoey is having some trouble. Congestion. Sometimes he wakes up with a cough, and I listen. I have him set up in the recliner, so he'll be sitting up- easier to breathe. He swallows, semi-chokes on the congestion in his sinuses in his sleep. I listen. A little cough, but no bark. The breathing is thick, but consistent. I'd go to sleep, but I listen instead. \n \nWe went to see the doctor earlier. He was scratched by the cat, and it got infected despite our cream regimen. The doctor suspects cat scratch fever, but we'd have to do a test for confirmation. The treatment would be the same, so no point. He has his antibiotic. Since the scratch is on his face, I worry- the nearest lymph nodes are the neck ones, I think. I listen. \n \nA little choke, but he recovers. I doubt he'll be going to school tomorrow. He can't be getting much decent sleep. I don't know if the congestion is part of the infection, or just an opportunistic something else. It's almost 4 am, and I have things to do tomorrow. I need some sleep. Instead, I listen. \n \nCaught between the quiet waking and the quiet of sleeping, I listen to my baby, making sure he is safe. It's what moms do, isn't it?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2016/05/between-waking-and-sleeping.html", "title": "\nBetween Waking and Sleeping\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, May 01, 2016", "body": "\nI was reading an article today, and nerves sang. The article was \" Let's Be Blunt: The Illusion of Inclusion. \" The message was one we face: kids with special needs not only don't count, but are openly despised by the general population. \n \nThe truth of inclusion is that it doesn't really exist- and hence it didn't work for us. Joey is in a special school- and we wait to find out if he is going to be wait listed for the only high school program that can accommodate him next year that we know of (and what happens if he is wait-listed? Where will he go? How will he get an education, and access his RIGHTS?) \n \nEven the \"inclusion classroom\"- which is really a special-needs classroom where kids just require less support or can be pulled out of the classroom for services they need- didn't work for Andy, and we had to pull him from school altogether. The attitude of \"you are taking resources from NORMAL kids!\" is so prevalent and ingrained, we don't do any real inclusion. My kid is seen as a project, a nuisance, a threat, a drain, an \"inspiration\", an idiot, a distraction... instead of as a member of the community, a child, a human being. \n \nThat ingraining comes out in so many ways, from so many directions. People think nothing of insulting your kid casually, and then getting mad at you when you try to make it stop. They tell you to leave spaces because they think you have no right to be there, to exist as you are. They judge you, often openly and loudly, in public places. That people think this is OK is just insane. Cruel. Heartless. \n \nI will never forget sitting in the rows of parents at the spelling bee. Third grade. Joey introduced himself with his typical flamboyance and joy. They laughed; not with him, but clearly and explicitly  at  him. The attitude was clear, and voiced in plain English:  oh how cute, they let a retarded kid up there. Isn't that sweet. Poor kid, making a fool of himself, why do they do that? \u00a0The assumption of his intelligence- that he lacked it and didn't really deserve to be on that stage- so clear. They didn't notice me there, saying nothing. I'm a big lady, but this isn't unusual. I am often the Invisible Person. I assume these other people knew each other, and they certainly did not know who  I  was. I assume they weren't  deliberately  cruel and mean. \n \nBy the end of the bee, they were out of their chairs, cheering for him. If the last round of a spelling bee worked like all the other rounds, he would have won- but you have to spell an extra word. And when he missed it, he got flustered and decided to bow out. He deliberately mis-spelled the next word, when the other two contestants were brought back, even though they had mis-spelled their words and he had spelled his correctly in the next-to-last round. Changing the rules confused him, made him frustrated and angry, and he was done. He bowed out. But he had shown those idiots in the crowd that their assumptions about the special needs kid not deserving to be on that stage were totally wrong. \n \nThey knew he had won that spelling bee. \n \nI often wonder if they took the lesson to heart, or if our society is so ingrained with discrimination against those with differences, those who require different things from society, that they just went back to those comfortable old assumptions. The ones supported by  society , by  media , by  comedians , by  schools , by  legislators ,  by   businesses , by  politicians , even by the  medical establishment (and these links are just examples or information I could dig up on the fly). Did they imagine him as an inspiration porn meme, or did they actually go out and change their attitude? Will they now really include him, and people like him, or did we just make it worse- spread the stigma by counter-example? \n \nJoey is a human being. Andy is a human being. Guess what? So am I. So are you. Let's all start acting like it. We are all in this together, and none of us make it out alive. Treat others as you would wish to be treated, no exceptions. Why is this acceptance thing so hard for everybody? Would you want to be the kid that gets laughed at, left out, segregated, and left behind to rot? Can't we even be inclusive of ourselves? \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=27817243#editor/target=post;postID=6854132518744685884", "http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/feb07/vol64/num05/Confronting-Ableism.aspx", "http://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/files/library/Barnes-Media.pdf", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8arl3izldo", "https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/09/03/17942/kayleb-returned-court-schools-alter-discipline-policies", "https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs39.htm", "http://abilitychicagoinfo.blogspot.com/2014/10/failure-to-accommodate-employee-with.html", "http://wkrn.com/2015/11/09/homeless-advocates-seek-justice-for-man-kicked-out-of-murfreesboro-aldi/", "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-appears-to-mock-disabled-reporter-video", "http://badcripple.blogspot.com/2012/01/organ-transplants-and-disability.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2016/05/where-awareness-and-acceptance-end.html", "title": "\nWhere Awareness and Acceptance End- Inclusion Illusion\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 04, 2016", "body": "\nThe alarm goes off. My mind swims back to consciousness, prodded by the chimes of my cellphone and the soft nudge of a cat. She wants breakfast. I want more sleep. I've been having issues with that, trying to sleep and being awakened, or simply worrying myself for hours. I need to start a new story, so I can make up some characters and let my brain whirr on that instead of the fifty things I need to try to do tomorrow; I'd get to sleep faster. Allan has already left for work, so the bathroom is free. I stumble in that direction. \n \nSometimes Joey is already up, playing a game or chasing cats. Sometimes he comes in and slips into Allan's spot, cuddling (and sometimes also playing a game), getting in some mom snuggles. Today, he is rolled up like a boy burrito in his blankets in his own bed. Andy is up, on his iPad, petting a cat. \n \n\"Rise and shine, Buddy!\" I call as I head down the stairs. There is lunch to be made, cats to feed, pills to prep, breakfast to put together. Sometimes I let Joey make his own lunch, but it makes him grumpy. With the late sleep, another possible red flag, I start on it myself. A sandwich, an apple, some crackers he may or may not eat; sometimes they are fine, sometimes he puts them on his \"junk food\" list in his head, and won't touch them. I think of the wonderful, creative lunches I've seen online. I bought some containers to make some, but I've never done it. \n \nJoey appears in his favorite shirt, and I hand him pills and breakfast. We keep trying to find something to reel in the anxiety, but this combo is the only thing that both takes the edge off while not having him go nuts or feel weird. I am not looking forward to the day his body compensates and makes it useless. I push aside the pang of futility and go through his notebook, looking for forms I need to sign and return. \n \n\"STOP TAKING MY HAND!\" Joey yells, and I jump. What? \n \nHe's staring at me, and my brain is racing. What is it? I'm not near him. His hands are empty. \n \n\"STOP TAKING MY HAND!\" he yells louder, and then laughs. \"LET GO OF ME!\" He picks up a stick- a walking-stick or cane size, not his usual writing size- and heads to the back yard. I finish the lunch, put the bag together with a supply of chewing gum, and my next alarm goes off- time to remind Joey to put on shoes and make sure he is ready for the car to come. He tromps back in just as I reach my phone to turn it off. \n \n\"THE GARBAGE WILL DO!\" he shouts, grabbing his backpack, and giggling mightily. \n \nOh, Right. Star Wars. It's going to be a yell-the-script kind of day. \n \nAs he slips into the back seat and buckles in, I silently wish the school folks good luck. It's going to be loud. Very loud. \n \nMay the Force be with him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2016/04/autism-month-day-4.html", "title": "\nAutism Month, Day 4\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 15, 2016", "body": "\nMost days with Joey are good days. He's happy. He feels safe at school. He likes to learn new things, and show off what he knows and can do (just ask him a math question...) He's discovered imagination and Star Wars and healthy eating. Let him script and do his thing, and he will skip through the day being Awesome and trying to bring you along in the Awesome. If feeling slightly off, he may script more, or turn to his favorite video game (which currently involves making cupcakes). \n \nThen there are the bad days. Usually he's not feeling well- it can be hard to know when Joey is sick, or tired, or just grumpy, because he's working so hard to be happy and to please everybody and be perfect. When this fails in his own eyes, the spiral begins. He thought he was playing, and you mistook his action for something aggressive or inappropriate. He accidentally knocks something over or spills his water. He stubs a toe. He gets something wrong on an assignment. These little things become a straw upon the camel's back, and once it breaks, we have a Bad Day. \n \nJoey has a lot of difficulty recovering from a Bad Day. He can't just let it go, calm down, or start over. He can't shrug it off and turn it around on his own. He needs help. Sometimes he just needs a nudge in the right direction in the right way. Sometimes he needs a lot of support and patience. Sadly, there is little knowing which it will be right this minute in the Bad Day, and if the spiral continues, we are headed for meltdown. It builds. The steam doesn't really release; those early signs of spiral are just more pressure. He knows this isn't going well. He doesn't know how to change it. He can't stop the spiral, either. The frustration of continuing to \"do it wrong\" bursts out as self-deprecation. Too often, this has turned out badly, very, very badly, and so he has now cut to the chase and started in himself, knowing from experience that this is a Bad Day, and there is nothing he can do about it now. \n \nIn the regular school, Bad Day meant write-ups, suspensions, punishments. Even if he was allowed to recover, after about 20 minutes- when he was outwardly looking better- he would be sent back into the frying pan; no one understood he needed much more time, that this was more like a seismic affair, complete with growing quakes and aftershocks. The blow-up is the center of the event, not the beginning- or the end. \n \nJoey has internalized this criminalization of being overwhelmed, of being unable to recover without help, of spiraling without brakes. The frustration of it makes him more aggressive, in trying to get out the fear, the frustration, the explosive energy of the anxiety of I Did Something Wrong and Now They Will Hate Me. That aggression can turn into flight. Without flight, it becomes fight. Will be bite his arm? throw something? posture aggressively towards another person? There is no way to know how that fight will play out. \n \nOn those Good Days... the majority of days, when things are quiet, and Joey is humming along doing his thing and being himself and starting to store up those little irritations and straws up on his back... those days, he can do anything. He could move mountains and conquer the world. A flash of that grin and a high five and he melts all hearts. \n \nIt's on the Bad Days that he needs the support, the help, the extra time and patience. It is on these days that often Joey, and many like him, get exactly the opposite. Instead of understanding that this is just part of Joey (everybody has bad days, after all- you don't stop being their friend just because they are having a bad day, right?), he's treated as a broken thing. A you-aren't-Joey-today-what's-the-matter-with-you monster, instead of a kid having a bad day. If you were having a bad day, wouldn't you want your friends to cheer you up, maybe pop in your favorite movie, bring you some flowers or something? You certainly wouldn't want them to scream at you, tell you to leave, turn you away, or punish you. If that became the regular response to you having a bad day, you might start being self-deprecating, too. That's what happens to people who are emotionally abused, day in, day out, even by people who have no clue what they are doing or that they are doing it. \n \nRecovering from this kind of grueling abuse is a long road, even when the exposure wasn't long at all- it doesn't take much to grind a child down. Several years of school is not a short time, and we are just beginning our road. I am grateful for his school, where people are understanding Joey and trying their best to help him, instead of just punishing him for having Bad Days- even a spate of them. This understanding and effort is the first step in teaching Joey how to cope with Bad Days, how to build a toolkit to respond to (and even prevent) getting overwhelmed, and giving him some brakes for the spiral. Without this first step, there is no way for him to understand, because he reads loud and clear that he is, as a person, Bad, since you are refusing to help him and are punishing him for being himself, and trying his best. When a child does their very best, and it isn't enough, you don't slap them. \n \nYou help them. \n \nThat is how they learn to be independent and confident in their growing skills. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-good-with-bad.html", "title": "\nThe Good with the Bad\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 09, 2016", "body": "\nOh, right, Spring. It's here. Kind of. And Joey's birthday is upon us- he is so excited, he couldn't focus in school at all or get anything done. Besides- spring! Time to go ALL OUT NUTSO-BONKO!!! \n \nSensory processing issues are part and parcel with autism. Since autism is neurological and pervasive, Joey's whole experience is affected, and his nervous system interprets and deals with sensory data as differently as all the other data he gets. We spend a lot of time figuring out what his sensory needs are, how he is seeing the world around him, and what strategies and interventions will help him cope and function in the world. \n \nOne of the reasons we spend so much time on this is because it isn't constant. Every spring, everything shifts and changes. Things that bother him now will suddenly be fine. Situations he could tolerate at Christmas now become overwhelming and impossible. He does this again in the fall. The season change and shift, the transition between extremes of weather and temperature, throw him into a tizzy, and his body shifts and changes with it. \n \n \n \nThis annoys people who don't know much about sensory integration and why it can be a problem. They treat it like a bee allergy, where once you react, you always react. This month he may be sound-sensitive; in six months, that may shift around and have him not be able to process sound (resulting in not being able to understand people talking to him) or to an over-tolerance (so that he will actually seek loud sounds, and his own voice volume goes up). Certain textures will swing wildly from tolerable to intolerable to craved. There is no way to know what will shift, what it will shift to; old problems re-emerge and newer issues fade or dramatically worsen. \n \nHe can't tell, either. If you thing it is confusing and frustrating for us, it is tenfold for him. Things he enjoyed doing are now too noisy, too bright, nor not enough. This means his own strategies no longer work, and he has to go back to square one, just as we do. He has to re-think it all out all over again, while being uncomfortable and even scared. Not fun. \n \nThe excitement of upcoming birthday gets tossed into the spring mix, along with the looming summer schedule changes. Anxiety everywhere! I wish there was a way to predict which way the sensitivities will swing, so we can prepare, so we can help him prepare, so we can get out the right tools for coping with the changes. \n \nRight now, I'm just doing what I can- making sure my sensory bag is stocked, checking up on the paint and playdough supplies, getting ready to get the back yard in order so he has space to run and jump and think. Oh, and shhhhh... birthday surprise... buying him a new bike...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-46PQblIrtBU/VwiYtPgFS0I/AAAAAAAAGNg/dtLnK20VRBgM6szmgnphxrTF8p9Dic6RQ/s1600/IMG_0360.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2016/04/what-day-is-it-where-am-i-whats-going-on.html", "title": "\nWhat day is it?

{"date": "Thursday, March 03, 2016", "body": "\nWhen Joey was small, IEP season meant weeks of angst, fear, research, late nights worrying about doing things right, doing things wrong, what to fight, what to compromise, and what Joey's future might be. The pressure for early intervention, the stress of finding ignorance where you were supposed to find wisdom, help, and support, and the absolute terror that if you took a misstep, Joey would suffer; these are things that meant weeks of preparation, power point construction, and study of goals, possibilities, services. \n \nIEPs shouldn't be this way. Being part of the team shouldn't mean a parent should have to become a PhD in disability, education law, and service plans. Why have a team at all? As a partner, the parent has vital information about the child and the needs of the child, which need to be translated into schoolspeak and effective goals, accommodations, and programs for those children by professionals on the team. That isn't what usually happens, sadly. \n \nAnd because it isn't that way, I found that all those weeks and hours were mostly a waste of time and a builder of stress, rather than being helpful to anyone, including Joey. My time and energy was better spent on Joey himself, because school just doesn't really get it. They are going to do what they are going to do, and you can have a ton of stuff added into the Present Level of Performance and have 15 goals and write out every little bit of accommodation and strategy he needs, and they are still going to call you at noon to tell you that oh, dear, he's just a mess today and ran out of the building. Really, the way we lessened the \"come get him\" response was to put him in a special school. \n \nWhat goals does he need to meet to become independent? How much expectation can we have of him ever being independent? Since he is academically fine, will he lose support at 18? What if he isn't ready to function at 18, even if he's mastered calculus and won a Nobel Prize? \n \nHow do you get an IEP to reflect \"we have to get him through puberty, people!\" ? \n \nSo instead of weeks of planning, reams of paper, carefully constructed notebooks and powerpoints and statements- all of which were rewarded by rolling eyes of teachers and administrators- we look over the draft, chat a bit about how they don't address this or that, cross our fingers, and spend a couple sleepless nights realizing we should have done this or that, years ago, months ago, in this grade or that grade, but can we fix it now? Is it too late? \n \nThe angst seems to be less focused and sharp, more insidious and pervasive. It's exhaustion. Knowing that all that effort, and here we are, with the same question: what will happen when it is time for him to be an adult? Will he be able to advocate for himself and live independently, or should we start preparing for him to need support and stay with us? \n \nIt is a question no one can answer, because like all human beings, his development is going to go at his pace and in his time and with his agenda; not ours. Trying to get that translated into schoolspeak has proven elusive. What skills does he need to get to that goal? It is difficult to put a finger on them. \n \nI can say that a person who walks up to random people in a store and tries to start of a conversation with \"I lost thirty pounds in three months!\" is... unexpected. A person who loses ability to self-regulate when frustrated is likely to be killed by police in this day and age, because of that same unexpectedness. Much of the fresh, bright, joyfulness that makes Joey so much Joey is going to be rejected by the wider world as strangeness, and people fear the unexpected and the strange. What will he need to survive a world that is going to be afraid of him, think he's strange, and probably assume he is stupid and less? \n \nYep, 2am, the morning of an IEP meeting.

After all, I had promised Joey could go grocery shopping with me, and I couldn't do that if he was in melt down mode. Even brittle mode would not work. \n \nHe wanted to go to the grocery so he could pick out \"healthy food.\" Joey has been on a weight-loss kick, and he's been working hard to get his exercise and movement up and his diet healthy. Although the middle-of-the-night eating is still an issue, we have been working hard, and he has been working hard- down 20 pounds, and he's terribly proud of it. The last two weeks have been school-free, between him being sick and the  Snowzilla  of 2016, so he is really ready to go back- and has decided healthy lunches are to be part of the return to school. Lettuce, celery, carrots, low-fat cheese, sunflower seeds, and apples were on his list, though he also asked for chocolate milk, peanut M&Ms (peanuts are healthy, Mom!), and ice cream. \n \nOnce he declared himself ready, off we went. By the time we got to the store, he was positively beaming, though scripting. Excitement can do that. He was going to go to the store with Mom, and pick out his very own food for his very own lunches for school and he's going back to school tomorrow- very exciting. Across the parking lot, we talked about lettuce and celery and he doesn't like tomatoes, but trying some roll-up sandwiches might be fun, and no thanks to the salad dressing. \n \nOnce we got inside, Joey was totally on. He walked right up to the first lady he saw, a small woman trying to pick out crackers, and started. \n \n\"What's zero divided by zero?\" he asked proudly, with his big smile. The lady gave him an odd look, so he added, \"You can't divide by zero!\" \n \nThe next lady chuckled, and played along; she got about five minutes of instruction on division by zero, multiplication by zero, and multiplication generally (77x12 is 924! 120 x 4 is 480, because 12 x 4 is 48, and then you have the zero, so you add on the zero!). \n \nAs we picked out cheese, and lettuce, and apples, I just let Joey be Joey. I let him talk to people, because he loves to talk to people and engage people. Some answered him and spoke with him a little. Some did not. No one was rude, or mean, or even just ignored him; they at least turned their head and smiled and nodded. So Joey let the sunshine out, and filled the whole store with it. I watched and listened to him in his joy, his desire to connect, his shiny, sparkly personality that loves all the world around him. \n \nI wish we had more days like this.

You hardly have time for the phone calls you need to make for doctors, appointments, counselors, more therapists, more schools, more meetings, there is little time for calling a friend. \n \nWhen Joey was little, I worried about meltdowns, overload, and unexpected behavior. We went out, anyway, because I could always bring my Mary Poppins unending bag with us, prepare, and hey, I could always pick him up and take him to the car. I'll never forget the first time we used our handicap parking placard- we had been nervous about getting it- and discovered that it made our lives safer and easier. We could at least expose him to a variety of places and activities, even if we had to leave suddenly and quickly. \n \nHe's bigger now. He lasts longer, but when he's done, he's done. He's too big to pick up and save. If he melts down on the boardwalk, I'm in trouble, he's in trouble. When they are little, people shrug and smile and frown and whatever. When they are big, they can be perceived as a threat. I have to pick up on the warning signs before he gets to the screaming stage, or it can be dangerous for everyone. That means I have to pay even more attention than before.  I can't make a mistake. \n \nThis means less going out- it takes a lot more planning to go, a lot more energy. Fewer people are tolerant, and far fewer accepting and helpful. Less going out means seeing less people. Going out with fewer friends. Less and less playdates. And when you do go out, less conversation. When you talk less, fewer people want to hang out with you and your family. \n \nWith special needs parenting, you find yourself more often in crisis mode. All those phone calls aren't being made for fun, you know. Hitting puberty means more danger of depression, anxiety, frustration, angst. Add the anxiety, depression, and frustration of autism on top of that, and you have emotional nitro glycerin. You work to keep your kid safe, engaged, moving forward; this can take an enormous amount of energy with a  non -disabled teenager. As we run about trying to find a new school for Joey, the anxiety for his future mounts, adding to the stew. \n \nWhen in crisis mode, very often the checking on friends falls to the wayside. You want to be a good friend, and if they fall into crisis, you would totally be there. But right now, unless they are in crisis, your energy has to be focused on your own page-turning chapter. You might have a time for a quick check- you thank the stars for Facebook- but unless they can say \"hi!\" in about three minutes, you have to make do with the info you have. Yes, I've heard that you make time for what's important to you, but in crisis mode, your kid is what is important to you. His future. His life. \n \nYou might think you know where this is going, but I'm going to turn right here at Albuquerque, and give a shout out to my friend, Sue. \n \nYou see, here in the middle of crisis mode isolation, I get reminded that you make time for what's important, and that's a reminder that my phone isn't exactly ringing off the hook with people looking for me, or wondering where I am, or what the heck is going on. I put up Facebook posts, and assume everybody else must be in crisis mode, too, and that will have to do. Quite a few people are- when you are in the special needs community, you know a lot more families stuck in that same crisis mode you are. \n \nBut there is only one who has actually called, and regularly pokes me with a \"you OK over there, woman?\" \n \nThat would be Sue. \n \nWe were roommates in college. I have no clue how she survived that. I am the WORST ROOMMATE EVER, especially when you are clean, organized, get-it-done woman like Sue. Even more astonishing, she has stuck to me through thick, thin, stormy weather, and all the colors of the rainbow. Holy Hannah, the effort that woman has put into staying friends with me! She calls. She shows up in DC and makes sure I know, so I can get together and see her. Even in the face of months of unreturned poking and prodding and calling and everything, she sticks with me. If I called her tonight and said, help! You know what? \n \nShe'd help. \n \nA shout out to good friends, through years and ages, and hoping she knows if she finds herself in crisis mode, that's why they invented cell phones... so you can call at any time, day or night. And they invented planes, too, in case I need to get there. I know she'd do the same for me... because she does. \n \nThank you, Sue.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2016/04/autism-month-day-6.html", "title": "\nAutism Month, Day 6\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, August 29, 2015", "body": "\nWhen you reach those years of hormones, aggression, confusion, frustration, wild swings, and moody depressions, it is a good idea to keep something to remind you that you aren't talking about your hormones. It isn't your fault. And you are still a human being, an adult human being who is allowed to like a little something for you. \n \nMine is a little bottle of perfume. \n \nI'm not a big wearer of beauty products. I don't own any make-up, and haven't worn any since I got married. Well, maybe once since then, I'm not sure; I think I put some on for a job interview once, maybe twice. I'd have to go out and buy it if I wanted to wear any today. I'm not a fashionista. I used to wear jewelry, and plenty of it, but with babies, you have to mostly lay off. My husband gets me some beautiful pieces. Every once in a while I sneak into my jewelry box and watch them sparkle a little, because they are just like his eyes. I don't get to wear them much. Perfume was something else I didn't wear much. I had some nice ones. I wore Anais Anais when I was much younger, and I liked Sunflowers a lot; my sandalwood and mango oils were always nice. For a while I had a kind of spritzer of lilac, and one of honeysuckle, that were lovely, but the scent doesn't last long with those. I like rose water, too. But I could never finish a bottle quick enough, because I just don't wear a lot of anything. Not even perfume. \n \nWith showers not as prevalent as they once were, perfumes became more important- after the shower, it was an indulgence, a statement of being human again, to use those spritzers. Ready to jump back into adulting, while smelling super good. \n \nMy mom wore KL when I was growing up... on special occasions. Whenever the KL went on, something good was about to happen. Dinner out. See the grandparents. Going shopping. She would dress up and look beautiful and smell awesome, and that was my mom. I can detect KL from a room away, and think, \"Mom!!!\" \n \nI hope my boys will someday get that whiff of Daisy and think, \"Is mom home?\" \n \nMom bought me the first bottle, and it was love at first sniff, after the shower. It had been a rough day, and it was a few minutes I stole for a shower, with Allan home and kids distracted. A few spritzes later, and I was ready to adult again. \n \nAnd that was when I thought, you know those folks who go about with too much perfume or cologne or whatever on? They must think they smell super. And I bet it makes them feel good to smell super. It must help them be ready to adult again. So I gave myself some more spritzes. \n \nBecause the perfume ain't for you. I like it. It smells fantastic. And it's for ME.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2015/08/flowers-in-bottle.html", "title": "\nFlowers in a Bottle\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 02, 2016", "body": "\nToday is Autism Acceptance Day. It is mostly a day for autistic people to celebrate their existence, since so many people seem bent on wiping them out and making them feel like burdens on society. This is much like many other identity holidays- the vast majority of folks want to make them shut up, go away, and (terrifyingly many) die. \n \n \n \nThat's right. There are people who think Joey should not exist. And since he does exist, he is a waste of resources and oxygen, and that he should die. \n \nIf that doesn't make you see red, and want to fix this huge ignorance problem, I cannot imagine what you would care about at all. Or maybe you're one of those people who want him to go away, whether you admit it or not. Joey is a human being. Like you. How would you feel if someone told you to shut up, go away, and die? Likely, you would do everything in your power to fight that person. \n \nImagine doing that everyday. Everywhere. All the time. If you are minority in this country, you probably know what I am talking about. \n \nWe have a saying around here: never read the comments. Whenever autism pops up on mainstream media, reading the comments is asking for high blood pressure and Raging Momma Bear Syndrome. People who write that the child misbehaved, so they deserved to be handcuffed, manhandled, arrested, beaten, tossed into closets, put into straight jackets. People who scream that school budgets take resources from \"regular\" kids and my kid should just go home. People who think supporting my kid to be educated is a waste of taxpayer money. You know, my money- I pay taxes, people. \n \nIt gets worse as they get older. People seem to understand more about being outraged when a 5-year-old is arrested. Not so much when that child is 13, and still having meltdowns. Because they are- surprise!- autistic. \n \nI will never understand people who tell me and families like mine that we shouldn't take our kids out in public, because our kids make them uncomfortable. People who call us selfish because we want to eat in a restaurant or shop in a Walmart or play in a park. People who accuse us of poor parenting, laziness, or Welfare Queens because our kids have a disability (which is laughable, since we don't get any public assistance benefits, other than the special education the law says is the right of my child- you know, to have access to education like everybody else. They keep fussing at us to get Medicaid, though, because a lot of service providers don't take private insurance, only Medicaid... what?) \n \nMy son can read, too. He can read those horrible things people say. He hears the obnoxious things people say. He sees what they do- the exclusion, the bullying, the neglect. That if he doesn't meet the expectations of people who have no clue what his life is like, he is worthless and should disappear and stop existing. He hears you. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is why it is important to celebrate. Visibly. Clearly. Loudly. Like the Whos on the dust speck on Horton's flower, it is a way for Joey to say, \"We are here!  We are here ! WE ARE HERE!\" \n \nLet's help him out, so people will stop trying to boil the flower in oil. Get a pan. Get a horn. Make some noise. Let everyone know,  WE ARE HERE! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NEvq-frlao4/Vv_rsmC2mUI/AAAAAAAAGM4/xSq1xHfge0A-Fg-xDImusKJb7Q80ZljNg/s1600/IMG_0288.jpg", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f7EKrhdJfxg/Vv_r9qLdycI/AAAAAAAAGM8/MI7G7o7rxB4i4E-5yItBDG264_qIEJMMA/s1600/IMG_9364.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2016/04/on-second-day-of-april-we-are-here.html", "title": "\nOn The Second Day of April...

{"date": "Saturday, March 26, 2016", "body": "\nIt's almost midnight, but Andy peeks into my door. \n\"Whatcha need, Buddy?\" I try to keep my voice low; Allan is already asleep. \n\"I woke up. Can I have a song to go back to sleep?\" \n \nHe had a long, hard day, with a lot of think about. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis morning we started our search for a new school for Joey. We finally got him settled and feeling safe at his school, the one where Joey's safety has been paramount. The one set up with him specifically in mind. The one where he was finally in the groove and getting things done. \n \nThe one we were told he would never have to leave? Oops, they aren't going to do high school. They are going to stick to K-8. Sucks to be us. \n \nIt's like people are new here. Or to autism. Or to Joey. The point was to limit the changes, the transitions. To figure out his needs and get those met effectively. To get him settled so he could focus on important stuff- like reading. Or history. Or math. \n \nBut here we are, and we saw our first option today. There aren't many. \n \nWhat we need is a school that can provide the intensive sensory integration and regulation he needs, be a safe space, and accommodate his intellect, all at the same time. He needs 1:1 academic instruction, an array of testing accommodations, and a number of classroom accommodations, including readily available space for recovery and regulation breaks. He needs academic challenges in math and science, and extra support with language-heavy tasks such as writing and responding to questions (history is a definite issue). He needs faculty that can deal with communication difficulties and learn to \"speak Joey\" while he learns to communicate effectively. He needs all this is a low-stress and flexible environment because of severe anxiety.* \n \n \n \nWe took Andy with us, because one thing we definitely need is a kid point-of-view, and we can't introduce Joey into a bunch of strange places. We need to have a plan and a strategy before we take Joey to a place he may assume is where he is destined to go. Yet that kid-view is key; kids know when things are uncomfortable or not-good in ways adults no longer think about or understand. On the other hand, it must be a bit surreal for Andy, to be basically acting as a big brother for his big brother, and scoping out these strange environments. After all, Andy has his own issues with schools, settings, and anxiety. \n \nOption 1 is a beautiful school. There is no doubt that it is designed to do what it does, and that is what it does. The walls are full of student art, and the projects are wonderful. The students have a beautiful, professional kitchen, where they learn to prepare their lunches- and we are talking about pork roast and gourmet cupcakes, food for about 60 (students and staff). Kids with more difficulty have cooking lessons after lunch, so that they can have basic independence skills. A big, beautiful classroom for life skills, with a variety of task areas, to meet a range of abilities and needs. A science classroom with live animals, including frogs, fish, and (to the delight of Andy) a hamster. A wonderfully clean and organized shop for working on bicycles and small motors. A well-organized vocational program where the older students go out into the community to learn jobs, from stocking shelves at the Goodwill to helping at local restaurants and small businesses. There is a piano in the cafeteria, which is more like a nice room for eating than a typical school cafeteria. They use positive reinforcement charts and paychecks and motivators. They have whiteboards installed, labs with sinks ready, and plenty of counsellors with office all along the length of the building. The teachers are friendly and seemed glad to see us. Everything was very clean. It is a beautiful school. \n \n \n \nAnd we walked out, knowing Joey could not manage it. They change classes four times a day, with a very loud bell between periods, which are 90 minutes long. They have break rooms, but only one is being set up as a sensory break area (as an experiment) and all are locked, so he would have to wait for a key to access them. When we asked about math, they proudly told us they once had a kid who got all the way through Algebra II... some time ago. That would be the end of a normal math curriculum for a high school.** Red flag: bragging that ONE of your students, once upon a time, actually managed to complete a normal course of math? Not a good sign. But with the usual assurances that \"they would teach what he needs,\" we got little else clear about the academics. No music, except as a once-a-month \"club.\" The strict structure, the changing rooms, the long hall and wide spaces, and what space was there for 1:1 instruction? The 4-to-a-class seems great until the teacher talk about their 6-person classes, and no clear space for smaller-ratio needs. We didn't see any classroom aides, which limits flexibility. There were metal detectors and a person at the front student door, but their policy for bolting was to catch up and walk with them. No speech or occupational therapists on staff. We were told straight out and early on, they don't have students with intensive OT needs, so no OT, no gym, no sensory space. \n \nIt was a beautiful school. It was the kind of school I hope Joey could navigate, with all the trappings of a regular environment, but a lower ratio so that students could get more attention and support. \n \nBut that is not where we are. And without that sensory integration piece, no way to get there. \n \n \n \nAndy asked questions. He giggled at the hamster. He had his eyes open. He noticed many of the lockers had no locks, and know Joey's fascination with locks, so he asked about that as an issue very early in the tour. He took a good look at the fancy kitchen. He shook hands with teachers (many of whom likely assumed he was the prospective student). If the academics were more clearly solid, it would be a good school for him. But he isn't the prospective student, he's the brother. He checked out the labs, noted the cameras (the whole building is camera-monitored, but no one was actually monitoring), looked around the classrooms. He liked the school. Thumbs-up from the kid perspective. \n \nBut he had to see our smiles vanish as soon as we were in the car and heading home. The looks between us as we realized, yes, it is a beautiful school. Had he stayed on the course he was on when he came out of second grade, we would have totally been here. \n \nSadly, that is not what happened. \n \nIt is a beautiful school. Joey just can't do this now. And there is something in my heart that just screamed when I realized there was no way he could do this by the fall. These are kids destined for the kinds of jobs and lives that may keep them independent (or at least marginally so), for living on their own or with minimal supports, and Joey can't join them. He can't do this. Too much stress, too much noise, and not enough brainwork, not enough sensory interventions. \n \nThere is nothing more heartbreaking than knowing this isn't where you are going. I can only blunt the pain by adding, \"not yet.\" \n \nI pick my best songs, and sing to Andy as he turns and tried to settle. He was the one who added the words, as we waited for Joey to come home from school, sitting on the porch. \"He'd like it mom. Just... not yet.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*Yeah, you might see the problem here. Despite a wide need for such an educational environment, most schools seem more interested in dealing with academically and intellectually challenged kids, and shoving them into dead-end or highly limited employment options. Where are the options for kids with solid academics or academic talents, who still need support to manage the environment and learn coping and regulation skills? And don't tell me there aren't many- shoving a kid into \"mainstream\" isn't always the best option for everybody, especially if they end up being written up a lot, or spend their lives creating stomach ulcers and just trying to navigate their day. Anxiety is often ignored, ridiculed, and dismissed. \n \n**In our system, the usual course is algebra I, geometry, algebra II, trigonometry, calculus AP. Most kids stopped after algebra II, or you had \"college-bound\" kids who took algebra I in eighth grade, so they would go through trig and possibly the calc AP. If you were a total math nerd like me, the school folks freaked and didn't know what to do with the college credits you took to continue your math in your senior year.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gj48GUMHw7E/VvYkqmjppGI/AAAAAAAAGMI/c-sEe1fP7QsM9U_sYWU5ZUS25r823rJ3w/s1600/IMG_9906.jpg", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PBOatdQsSMs/VvYkq5xua-I/AAAAAAAAGMM/7jPt4Ky7asgtwON8YpKvzrGwugROEVkHQ/s1600/IMG_9796.jpg", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kKWPEcLtC5c/VvYkraJ5LiI/AAAAAAAAGMU/-sPcANjJG00OMC0TleEkt9wesfWvlTWjQ/s1600/IMG_9961.jpg", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dMClrv-cEbo/VvYkqjB8B1I/AAAAAAAAGME/ap5FfPO58gIW-HaQ_PfRjdlGSH-7EMZIA/s1600/IMG_9552.jpg", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eckaJtx6mmQ/VvYkqz-yaXI/AAAAAAAAGMQ/Lmc0Yap35l09KfXPKjlfRrNaP9U-CqIVg/s1600/IMG_9946.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2016/03/back-to-square-one.html", "title": "\nBack to Square One\n"},

{"date": "Friday, April 12, 2013", "body": "\n He leaps onto the table \n\"Mama Mia!\" Dare they claim \nNo imagination?  \n \nWhenever I hear someone begin with, \"people with autism...\" to describe any  one  person with autism, I tend to cringe. A lot of lip service is given to the uniqueness of people, include autistic people. However, the power of over-generalization still reigns in society, and all too often an individual is overlooked and even disregarded, in favor of pigeon-holing categorization and labeling. Such is the danger of labels.  \n \nWhen Joey was very young, and we first took him down to  Kluge , one of the most striking of comments made by Dr. Blackman at the time was to the effect of, Joey displays all the classic signs of autism- but not in a classic combination. At the time, it was striking because we found ourselves having difficulty understanding what it meant, because we were newbies to the road of discovering what it meant that Joey is autistic. The better we know Joey, the more the comment makes sense. It also explains some of the problems we have getting others to understand him.  \n \nWe have been told Joey is \"too social\" to be autistic. We have learned this is rooted in ignorance of autistic people generally, and why they may- or may not- avoid or have issues with social interaction.  \n \nWe have been told Joey is \"too verbal\" and should have his diagnosis changed to Asperger's Syndrome. This is rooted in ignorance of autism and the specifics of Asperger's Syndrome, as well as the work Joey has put in to learning to speak and use language. It also ignores the amount of energy and processing it takes for Joey to use language. It is the first skill that plummets whenever he gets angry or upset. Besides, we started this path with a non-verbal child. We are totally sold on the merits of early intervention.  \n \nWe have been told that autistic people don't lie. This is a laugh, rooted in the problems autistic people often have with processing language or using language as a tool for expression. Joey does have trouble with some kinds of visualization, certainly has issues with language and idioms, and often has trouble with his \"filters\" (both receptive and expressive). He is, however, quite capable of lying, and understands the concept of both the \"white lie\" and the blatant falsehood. He knows that if he breaks a rule, lying is one way to try to get out of consequences- and sometimes it is a highly successful tactic (especially with folks who think autistic people can't lie).  \n \nWe have been told Joey is too intelligent to be autistic. This is jut plain ignorant.  \n \nWe have been told Joey is not smart enough to be autistic. Setting aside the basic ignorance this reveals of Joey's intelligence or person, not every autistic person is a savant. As far as we know, Joey is not a savant. I refrain from setting out complete and total judgement until we see how he grows up. We are still learning about Joey and his talents- as is Joey.  \n \nWe have been told Joey is too heavy to be autistic. He is too well-behaved. He has too much eye contact. He has too much joint attention. He has too much or too little or too soon or too late.  \n \nIt is all rooted in ignorance and blindness, and the devaluing of the individual. It is born of wanting to sweep people under a label and not have to worry about thinking about them anymore. It results in reluctance to provide support and service, to welcome him into his community, or to even get to know him. It is a dismissive attitude that often plays out in rudeness on the playground, people who make faces and comments and even actively bully. Ignorance is the root of fear.  \n \nJoey is Joey.

The driver's seat has always been a fascination, but now it is generalizing to the idea of growing up and gaining freedoms. \n \nWe are driving to the dump. My mom doesn't have trash collection, so Joey is with me to do a Trash Run, where he can help me with the bags (tossing them into the big compaction hopper is awesome heavy work) and watch the trash be compacted away.

His voice loses the mechanical quality at its edges for a moment, a pause in the general driving script to make an observation. But I know this new tone, too; and I suddenly feel that turn in my stomach that always accompanies it. \n \n\"Of course you will, Buddy,\" I assure him. It is the expected response, and I want him to feel the familiarity, the cheerfulness, the casual air of my response. \n \n\"No,\" the grief in the word could be a whole conversation, but he goes on. \"My age limit is twelve and under. I will never be a teenager. I don't have a birthday.\" \n \nIt's a tone that makes you want to leap out of your soul and hold him, until all that pain he is expressing goes away. I have never figured out why he is sad, or why it comes out when it does. \n \nInstead of holding to the tack and spiraling into the abyss the conversation teeters upon, I decide on something else. \n \n\"There are three basics of driving,\" I put in my lecture-voice, \"The two pedals- this is the gas, this is the brake; and the steering wheel.\" He stops, his head tips to one side, he looks at my feet. \n \n\"The gas pedal makes it go faster. The brake pedal makes it stop,\" he chants. \n \n\"One thing to remember about a car- it is made to move. So you don't even need to press the gas pedal to make it go- you just turn it on, and it will move forward. You press the gas pedal to go faster. To go slower...\" \n \n\"You hit the brake. Not too hard!\" \n \n\"Not necessarily,\" I grin, throwing in a little wrench to get him thinking. \"All you have to do is stop pressing the gas pedal. See?\" I take my foot off the gas, and we slow down. \"You use the brake when you have to stop faster than just letting up on the gas lets you.\" \n \n\"I'll use both my feet to drive,\" he announces, still look at my feet. \n \n\"No, actually, you just use one foot,\" I observe, stepping on the gas for a moment to keep us moving. \"When I want to stop, I just move my foot from the gas to the brake,\" I clarify, and demonstrate. \n \nFor a moment, he is fascinated. Then I blow his mind by showing him that after a turn, you just let the steering wheel go, you don't turn it back. He stares at my hands a moment, frowns, the script returning. \n \n\"The speed limit is 45. You are going too fast.\" \n \n\"Well, that's one thing you will have to learn about driving,\" I sigh. \"Sometimes the rules bend. I know how to drive this road. If you are out on the Interstate, the speed limit is 65. But if everyone around you is going 70, you don't want to be a traffic hazard- you need to go 70, too.\" \n \nThis totally Does Not Compute. \n \n\"But the speed limit is the rule,\" he spits out in dismay, a phrase I have never heard him use before. In the face of the idea of rules that bend, but not break, I glimpse the black-and-white thinking that dominates Joey's world, in a way and with an intensity I have never really seen before. Perhaps as he gets older, he is expected to understand more about shades of grey, and so it is now more obvious. \n \nHe returns to the more comforting gas=go, brake=stop. Then he returns to never getting any older. No birthday. Twelve is his age limit. Its a conversation that I find terrifying, simply from the frankness with which he presents the idea of not ever being a teenager. That he will never learn to drive. That he will never have a birthday. \n \nMy stomach lurches. My eyes burn. I show him turning the wheel again. He is distracted again. Now he chats merrily about owning a truck when he grows up, so he can \"haul my things easier.\" \n \nAnd I search for my heart in the fog of grey.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2015/01/shades-of-grey.html", "title": "\nShades of Grey\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 08, 2013", "body": "\n Taking a walk, \"Mommy! \nDaffodils! Hyacinths! See \nthe birds flying home!\" \n \nWhen you have a bumper sticker on the back of your car saying, \"Yes! You can ask me about autism!\", people tend to ask you about their kid. Especially their little, little kid who is not quite in preschool, but Momma is worried that something may be up, and could I please watch him a minute and say what I think?  \n \nI remember needing that reassurance, that connection, that validation when Joey was little, and we were first told he might have autism. That scary edge of \"OMYGODIHAVENOIDEAWHATTODOIFSOMETHINGISWRONGHELPHELPHELPHELP!!!!!\" It is even harder to be on that edge when ignorant people are all around you saying, \"There's nothing wrong with that kid! All these diagnoses are a crock! Just wait a little longer/quit spoiling him/smack him.\" You realize a huge gulf just opened at your feet, dividing you and your special needs child from most of society, which is intensely ignorant of special needs- even when their sibling/cousin/neighbor/extended family member has special needs.  \n \nThe first thing I do when presented with this panicked situation is to calmly say sure, I'll be happy to meet your child. After all, who doesn't want to meet an awesome kid? Second, I remind the parent that I am NOT a medical professional, and if they are concerned, they should absolutely have their kid screened. Screening is almost painless, usually quick, and can be really helpful when done by a good professional.  \n \nThen I watch, and ask some questions. These parents want to be asked questions. They want to talk about their kid. They want something, some information or support or guidance. Some of them even have ready answers to some of the regular questions, about common milestones (does she talk? does she wave? does he line up his toys?) or general info questions (why are you concerned? did you notice something different? Do they seem different when around other kids?) But my big, star screening questions is, \"Do they point?\"  \n \nOne of the common threads I find with the autistic kids I know is trouble with (not complete absence of) joint attention. There may be a variety of reasons for this issue, but generally, it is shown when they are very young by kids not pointing to things- things they want, things they notice, things they want other people to see. Joey still is limited in his ability to actually point at something. He has found other ways to draw your attention to something, but pointing is not his best. His finger flicks, instead of creating that line-of-sight between the fingertip and the object. He also does not follow other people's pointing very well. He cannot make that connection in space between the finger and the item.  \n \nThis issue gives rise to a lot of the \"in their own little world\" myths about autistic children. Not knowing how to show you something, or how to see something you want to show them, is not necessarily a disinterest in showing; it is a problem of communicating. The disjoint can be so severe and frustrating that the person learns to avoid joint attention, or even shun it. After all, if you were told every day, day in and day out, that you were bad at something- not necessarily in a straightforward manner, but in a myriad of hints and signals- you might give up on doing it, too. Go with something you are better at, something less frustrating and more constructive for you. Try to find other ways to survive.  \n \nThis is, once again, an instance of measuring a fish by how well it climbs a tree. Sometimes you have to take the time to get in the water and swim, if you want to get to know a fish. You may never grow gills and have to come up for air, but you'll see the real beauty of the strength to slip through water with teh flick of a fin. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/04/autism-understanding-day-7.html", "title": "\nAutism Understanding: Day 7\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 19, 2013", "body": "\nYep, you guessed it: IEP season is upon us. In fact, it has taken us by storm. And when I say \"storm\", I mean \"seized by the throat and shaken vigorously in a tornado about to crash into a tsunami.\"  \n \nI told our new case manager that our IEP meetings tend to take about 3 hours. She didn't believe me. We're scheduled for an hour and 45 minutes. I have people hired to come to this meeting, and I do not want to have to have a continuance and try to coordinate these people again. Fortunately, they are there for a single purpose: the get Joey's placement right. And that is just one facet of an IEP meeting. Hence, I want to have our ducks in a row for the other stuff, like goals and accommodations. I want those all drafted and ready, so we don't have to have a long discussion about them that takes, say, an hour and a half.  \n \nOr maybe I do. Then I can just pop up and say, \"And your school can't do all this, so here's a form to sign to send him to Awesome New School. Sign here. Thanks. Have a great day!\" And the school folks would sign it and we would merrily be ready for next year.  \n \nLike  that  would ever happen.  \n \nWhat this means is that we- being the teachers who actually care about Joey- and I are trying to work in time to get the goals and accommodations hammered out properly. Or at all. I think its time for an independent educational eval, so we get a better look at Joey's education as a package- and have a clearer view of where he is, where he should be, and what skills he may need support with- including gifted support. We definitely need some notion of what needs to be in this IEP- its for Middle School, and I want everything spelled out  exactly . IF we get stuck in the school, this will be a whole new world of people, a whole new culture with a whole new attitude toward accommodation. It is important that we leave nothing vague, no guesswork, no \"well, I know what you mean by that, we can fiddle\". They don't know Joey. They don't know me. And I am not a whit convinced they know what they are doing or getting into.  \n \nSo we're having a meeting, to start hashing. Right before the meeting where we work out the ESY. Then we have the Big Meeting next week.  \n \nI think I really need a nap.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 09, 2013", "body": "\n Forehead to forehead \nI am lost in the blue depths \n\"I love you, Mommy.\"  \n \n \n \nJoey turns eleven tomorrow.  \n \nNo child develops the same as any other, nor consistently in all areas at a given rate. Sometimes when I think of growing, I can still hear Mr. Rogers singing  \"Everything grows together... because you're all one piece...\"  But that doesn't mean you develop all the same, at the same rate. In some ways, Joey is 15. In some ways, he's still 5. But in all ways, he's all Joey, just the way he is.  \n \nIt is  shame we live in a world that can't just accept people as they are, as they develop, in their wonderful uniqueness. We do a lot of lip service to the idea, and there's lots of kids' shows that address the idea (some well, some not so much); but in the end, as we grow up, we move away from valuing people as they are, and towards a sort of dark prejudice and fear of people who differ from us. People who are, in some way, unexpected. New. Unknown.  \n \nMiddle school is the vortex of this change, from \"we're all in this together\" to \"exclusive secret club\". Yes, it starts early- kids are quick studies of their parents, neighbors, family, and friends, after all. But the real abyss yawns at that moment when we feel that transition begin, from a child to an adult, and we try to make our own space in the world, construct our identity as something separate from the world of our parents and families.  \n \nIt is well known that Middle School is Social Hell.  \n \nAs we stand upon its brink, we know that we start at a beginning- a moment when balances must all be correct, lest we slip from the edge and into the dark. Will my guidance and example be enough to see my child through the maelstrom? Or will he be lost in the tempest, emerging as a stranger I hardly know? And if he emerges a stranger, who will that stranger be? Being unexpected, as we know from our social skills group, is not always bad. It is just not expected. Different from the expected.  \n \nI could return to the rant about needing social skills groups to help this whole age group navigate the storm, but that is not my point.  \n \nMy point is that Joey is not ready.  \n \nWe have spent the last three years treading water in a majority of skills other kids just \"pick up\", but Joey has to be specifically taught. Not that there has been no development of skills; but the pace is such that instead of moving forward towards being able to keep pace with his peers, he falls more and more behind. He may be the king of long division, but how many kids want to talk about it all afternoon?  \n \nJoey is dealing with growing frustration in trying to connect with people around him. He loves people. He likes to talk with them, be with them, play with them. However, his attempts to generalize conversation skills has been... not quite successful. If he gets the words right, they still sound canned, and the script only takes him so far. If he deviates from the script, his topics and words are so unexpected, the other person often has no point of reference to use to respond. If someone came up to you and, smiling broadly, announced, \"Slay means to kill! Or to amuse immensely! Immense means really big!\" what would you do? For most people, you would hesitate, trying to process what just happened and determine a way to respond. Some people smile while hesitating. Others frown. Other get this deer-in-headlights look. No matter what, Joey knows what that hesitation means. He feels it. He has been \"unexpected.\" Weird. Different.  \n \nHe is becoming aware, via his classmates, that being different is becoming problematic. He is entering upon a world where Different is Bad.  \n \nAnd that is a lesson that I want to counter. Because you know what? Different is  not  bad. Unexpected is surprising, and surprise can be fun. It gives you a new perspective. A new take on the world around you. Something new to think about... if you allow yourself to accept it, think about it, enjoy it. When you separate \"bad\" and \"unexpected\", you might end up at a surprise party.  \n \nWith cake.  \n \nJoey turns eleven tomorrow. And that part of him that is still five- it wants chocolate cake.  \n \nThe part of me that is still five wants some, too. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.neighborhoodarchive.com/music/songs/everything_grows_together.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/04/autism-understanding-day-8.html", "title": "\nAutism Understanding: Day 8\n"},
{"date": "Friday, January 25, 2013", "body": "\nAs you may remember, our last IEP meeting- which was supposed to produce a BIP- was... well, a disaster. I had requested to get the eval info ahead of time, but the school psych wanted us to \"hammer it out in the meeting\" and didn't send anything, so I went in with no info. When I saw the info, I realized I still had no info. What they called \"data\" was nothing of the sort- and even the interpretations and notes provided were basically \"variable- variable-variable\"- in other words, they failed to note any pattern in Joey's behavior. Which, of course, makes no sense and is completely useless when trying to figure out how to intervene. The only thing suggested looked to me like a data collection they should have been doing in the first place, trying to learn to read Joey emotionally by checking on his well-being regularly. This isn't an intervention. There was no plan for what to do if he had another meltdown. \n \nI have been feeling like an idiot ever since. And I didn't sign that waste of time. I need to get together a letter about why.  \n \nAnd as I mull that letter, I struck upon an idea I should have remembered when I went to the meeting in the first place: I need to provide solutions. I need to state what I think needs to happen, what I want an intervention to look like, what services I believe are required should there be another issue. I need to be clear that suspending him is not appropriate. That when he is so overwhelmed that he loses skills and control of his mouth and his behavior, what needs to happen to calm him, guide him, and help him. We need a clear understanding that screaming obscenities is not OK in a classroom, but we also need to be sure we are doing what is needful to not let things get that far. What are the red flags, and what can be done for each one? What should be done so that you avoid escalation?  \n \nAnd since no one was interested in doing that at the meeting, obviously I need to do it myself.

{"date": "Saturday, December 29, 2012", "body": "\nGoodbye, 2012. See ya. Don't let the door smack you on the behind.  \n \nSeriously, we've had worse years. And we've had better. But altogether, we seem to be holding on tight and taking the roller-coaster in stride.  \n \nWe now get to face new and ongoing programs for improvement and progress. With a new year, its a good time to think over what is needful, and getting the balances right for a good beginning.  \n \nI've been having a lot more anxiety lately, and that leads to an odd sort of depression. I'm anxious about our current Joey mystery, moreso after seeing the report from Kennedy Krieger, which seems to ignore it. We thought the doctor was more receptive to what we were saying than this report reveals. I worry that I worry too much, that I'm finding demons in shadows that aren't really there. I worry about over-medicalizing and over-analyzing and being over-bearing.  \n \nWith a spate of good days, it can be hard for me to remember the bad ones. After all, I'm a mom who's been through labor, and then decided to have a second kid, anyway. The good crowds out the bad, and to be honest, I'm usually glad. But then the anxiety comes. Should I be something something more? Something else? Is everything I should be doing getting done? Do we have time for all the interventions I've been told to do? Are they all necessary and helpful, or am I being... what do you call a person who is a hypochondriac about their kids?  \n \nAnd then there are the things that can't be turned aside as over-worrying. Joey needs help with his reading and testing, with his social skills, with his ability to function in a highly complex social world. He's not picking up important cues by example or model; he has to be specifically taught. Middle school is coming, and watching him among his peers is increasingly terrifying when my goal is to give him the skills to cope and survive as an independent and self-advocating adult. I know what model will work, I can see it, and I can see a place that will give it to him. How do I get him there? How do I get the folks at school, who are working so hard to help him, that he needs to be somewhere else? That they are not doing enough, not giving him the appropriate education and support he needs to learn to survive? How do you convince people who are totally sold on inclusion that it isn't working for your child anymore?  \n \nAnxiety. And that's just the Joey saga. Andy has an entirely other set of challenges and anxieties. I worry about his mental health, his world dominated by the challenges of his brother. I worry about his own coping with his own challenges. I worry about his arsenal of nerf guns.  \n \nThen there is the employment situation. We are dependent on a contract that is in-between projects, and have no timeline for when the next project will get started. We have no idea how long we have to hold on before income resumes. We have no idea how long we can hold our breath, waiting for others to decide to get started. Do we close down the main office, and save that rent money to last a little longer, hoping that the client won't come to inspect our location? Can we come up with new revenue streams, enough to tide us over, and fast enough? What if we don't survive the gap?  \n \nAnxiety means insomnia. It means things forgotten and things left undone, to create more anxiety. It means a constant feeling in your stomach that everything could crumble around you any instant. It means looking at the overwhelming tasks before you and being... overwhelmed. To think my kids feel like this every day of their lives is one more anxiety. The spiral begins, leading down into the dark. I didn't even get all my Christmas decorations up this year, and I look around and want normalcy. There isn't any, anywhere.  \n \nI am not a normal person living a normal life. I'm more of an Alice wandering through life trying to convince the Cheshire Cat that I don't want to go among mad people, and finding myself at the foot of the caterpillar's mushroom.  \n \nWho are you?  \n \nSo it becomes time to rush into a new year, with new plans, new programs, new ideas. We have Joey and his new suggestions from his new nutritionist. We have a a new school to look forward to, though we are not yet sure which new school it will be. We have new ideas for keeping the house in order (well, the first floor, anyway). We have some new hopes, and new dreams, and new possibilities.  \n \nAnd new anxieties.  \n \nDid I mention I don't like roller-coasters anymore? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/12/stampeding-into-new-year.html", "title": "\nStampeding into a New Year\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, February 23, 2013", "body": "\nSo you find yourself at an IEP meeting that you never really wanted to go to, having to say things that make your heart hurt, and trying to figure out what can be done to keep your child from losing ground until you can have  another  IEP meeting that will make your heart hurt and try to actually do something useful.  \n \nWait, I think that might be  every  IEP meeting.  \n \nThere's a lot to make my heart hurt right now.  \n \nI had to admit that Joey cannot hold his own in a \"mainstream\" classroom without support. And not just any support, he needs specialized, experienced, trained support to be successful in there. And that is something the school not only does not have, but has no time to create or hire for this year. A para, we could probably locate. An understanding teacher, apparently not so much.  \n \nBut it got worse. If we take him out of this room, where do we put him?  \n \nLet me back up a minute to give you a better picture.  \n \nOne of Joey's outstanding strengths is his grasp of math. He loves it. He breathes it. He perseverates on it. HE finds it logical, sensible, comfortingly regular and patterned. Math. It rocks.  \n \nAt the start of third grade, I was called into the principal's office. I was nervous, as we had already been running into tough bolting situations with Joey by then- and it was a new behavior, so we didn't know the signs yet. TO my surprise, he was suggesting we might want to move Joey up a few grades in math, if we could find someone to teach him. He had just passed the end-of-year tests for both fourth and fifth grade. However, they didn't move him, because he didn't pass the third grade test, and there were some holes in skills- so hey, we had time to fill them, and use math time for social skills practice. I should have made them move him up.  \n \nJoey's favorite car riding game is to shout out math questions and answer them. Sometimes he does the shouting. Sometimes the answering. It's all awesome to him. And I'm not talking namby-pamby, simple-arithmetic stuff. I'm talking 34X78. No, you have to do it in your head. And you have about five seconds.  \n \nWhen Joey does well for his school speech therapist, she allows him, as his treat, to do a math problem. Right now, he's in love with long division. Only he doesn't like to write it all out, because that's messy. If he absolutely  has  to write it out, he'll flip the paper over, re-write the question, and the answer, so it looks tidy. He will work hard so he can have his math problem.  \n \nHe also loves to watch other people do math. One of his favorite treats last year was to watch one of his other teachers, who was a bit of a math wiz, do long division on the white board. It made him giggle to see her do it so fast. I found out this week that he'll giggle when I do it, too. And he'll work hard for a treat of watching you do math super fast.  \n \nThis past quarter, he got a C in math. And the reason? He was flunking math tests, big-time. He got  40 on his 9 weeks test. This quarter, we started off with a C on his fractions test.  \n \nDoes. Not. Compute.  \n \nWas it one of those \"holes\" that needed to be filled? I looked at the paper, asked him the questions. He responded immediately- and correctly. So I asked more complicated questions. Still correct. Still immediate.  \n \nDoes. Not. Compute.  \n \nSo as part of the IEP meeting, we confronted this enigma. The excuse? Well, there are more word problems now, because the SOL is \"more rigorous.\"  \n \nAfter we cleared up the meaning of the word \"rigorous\" (after all, the test isn't asking for more relevant skills or higher degrees of mathematical knowledge- it is simply adding a bunch of language to process), the conclusion was stated point-blank by our administrator: the problem wasn't the math. It was the disability. Joey has a language processing and communication disability, remember? And guess what is  NOT  accommodated when you plunk a bunch of language-heavy tests in front of him? \n \nI'm not even going to start with the problem of doing this on the SOLs, and the discriminatory obstacle it is going to put in front of my child (what do they want to test? Math ability? Or language comprehension and test-taking ability? That's rhetorical, BTW. Unfortunately, we know the answer there). I just laid it out there that I don't give a damn about SOL tests, because they are useless. They are poorly designed and poorly administered. They disregard a child's developmental level- or even the appropriate developmental ability and level of any age group- making the tests nearly impossible to take in the first place. They are \"scaled\", but not to an scale that would be remotely useful for comparing the scores to anything else known to man. They teach kids more about how to get through testing than acting as evaluation tools or helping kids learn anything. They can't even be used as data points for a child's progress or level of ability.  They are useless, stressful, inappropriate trash .  \n \nBut back to Joey. If you want Joey to be able to handle word problems, you have to teach him how to handle word problems. We've proven that before. When you teach him the key words and what they mean, he does fine. They become part of the puzzle, part of the pattern, and it is all good. If Mary has six apples and Johnny eats three apples, how many apples do you have left? \"Do you have left\" means to look for a subtraction problem. The big number probably comes first. The little number comes second. Bingo, 6-3=3. Johnny and Mary are left with three apples. Almost every word problem has these patterns, you just have to teach them- especially to kids who have language processing disabilities.  \n \nI'm not sure why a decent teacher would not pick up on the problem here, or its solution. Kid has no problem with math. Kid failing word problems. Stop and teach kid to decode word problems. Problem solved. Heck, I'd be thinking of that even if the kid  didn't  have a known language processing disability. Lots of kids trip on word problems.  \n \nSo, we have no trained, experienced support, and a teacher who has no concept of language processing disabilities or how to accommodate a child with them, she just flunks him. Then she lets him leave her classroom without even watching to be sure he gets across the hall, and thus he ends up in the parking lot. Or at least at the door. The story kinda got changed at the meeting. Again. Communication even between the staff appears to be in shambles.  \n \nTime to get him out of there, before someone gets hurt. Or has to be bailed out jail. You get the picture.  \n \nSo, where to go? What do you do with a twice-exceptional child? Where do you place a child who has serious disabilities in language but is brilliant in math? The self-contained room is not designed for that. The inclusion room is not designed for that. Both of those are designed for a slower pace, not a faster one, in the lesson material. How do you keep the math coming, while working on the language? How do you fight boredom while addressing challenge?  \n \nThe fact is, schools are not set up to deal with children as individuals in any way. Special ed is \"so expensive\" partly because regular classrooms are not designed to deviate or flex. Regular ed teachers are not trained to deal with a diversity of student needs, only a narrow scope of student skills- specific skills at that. Special ed is a whole different way of understanding kids and how to teach them effectively; a way that would benefit all kids. Most of the special ed \"techniques\" I've seen are just plain old good teaching. Yet, there are those who need something different. Something unique. Something individualized.  \n \nWhat, you mean, like an IEP?  \n \nRight. An IEP with nowhere to go. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/02/nowhere-to-go.html", "title": "\nNowhere to Go\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, January 06, 2013", "body": "\nThere is an article bouncing around social interwebs which claims to take a bald-faced look at the \"truth\" of having a child with autism. That \"truth,\" according to the article, is that having a child with autism destroys your life.  \n \nIt is the most horrible article I have ever read in my life.  \n \nFor one, it is not the truth. It is the opinion of a person watching a family with an autistic child (not even their own child), noting how the parents had to give up their careers and have no one to help them but a set of retired parents- who are now at odds with each other, because Grandpa resents having to spend his retirement money on his grandchild. I will spare you both the details and the article. It is a waste of valuable time and will just skyrocket your blood pressure.  \n \nNo, raising a child with special needs is not easy. It is very different from raising a child without special needs, because most people understand and know what to expect in raising a child without special needs. We spend a lot more time in \"therapies\", rather than \"extra-curriculars.\" We know fancy words such as \"propioceptive input\" and \"pathologic encephaly.\" We understand plenty of weird acronyms, such as \"IEP\" and \"BIP\" and \"FAPE\".  \n \nI still watch the kids at the park and think \"wow, that kid needs some OT.\"  \n \nMy life is not what I had thought about and planned for. It is, in fact, very, very different. No, I do not have a full-time job, but a string of part-time gigs and contract work. My husband and I go out by ourselves about twice a year, though we have finally found someone we could use for babysitting (an aide with our OT office does babysitting on the side, and is awesome with our guys). Up until now, it was Grandma or else we stay home. Sometimes, that is how life goes. Not as planned.  \n \nDoes that mean my life is \"destroyed\"?  \n \nMy life is different. I don't know many people now without special needs kids, so I am not quite sure how different. For us, this is normal. To go on a trip, you don't just get in the car and go. You have back-up plans in case the trip doesn't work. You pack familiar items, even for a day trip. We are in love with Steve Jobs and Apple for making our lives so much easier.

However, I did manage to get my passport updated last year. Just in case.  \n \nYes, my life is different, and it changed our plans and dreams and ideas of the future. But we will never say we no longer have one. We have a life, and it is an awesome adventure of a life. We will work through the challenges- just like everybody else. It has ups and downs; even if the downs dip a little lower, the ups rise a little higher. Or perhaps, they just dip and fly at different moments, for different reasons.

{"date": "Saturday, June 09, 2012", "body": "\nWe are arriving at the last week of school. We survived another year. Kinda. \n \nJoey's school has a big after-school party the Friday before school ends. Joey was really excited about it, and insisted he wanted to go. Ever been to a school party? Well, for ours, there's a basic set-up. They have a moonbounce outside, in the central courtyard. This may sound like a good idea, until you realize there is one moonbounce for an entire school of about 1000 kids. And their siblings. Right. They also set up a bunch of chalk in that courtyard, so that kids can write or draw on the pavements, which is as good an idea as the single moonbounce for 1000 kids is bad. Inside, they have three different crafts set up for kids to do, a dance floor with lots of very loud music and flashy lights, and a table with drinks and snacks (parents are asked to bring a box of drinks or a box of snacks as the \"entrance fee\" to the party, and that works really well). This year, we also had a cakewalk (well, a cupcake walk) in a side room. All in all, as school parties go, Joey's school does a really decent job of putting one on. \n \nUnless, of course, you are autistic and sound-sensitive and heat-sensitive. Then it could be a little tricky. \n \nI, like an idiot, bowed to my child's repeated requests to attend this event, and took he and his brother to the party. I wasn't a  complete  idiot, though. I fed them before we went. I did my best to have them all regulated and ready to go. Really. \n \nIt started out not too bad. The only places to sit were the lunch tables, which have those itty bitty round seats, and I am too fat to fit (sorry, folks, that is the truth. There was only one free chair available, and since I fell and killed a knee, I started to sit in it- until someone started yelling from across the room, \"That's mine! That's mine!\" It was a lady who was older and rounder than me, I guessed someone's grandmother come to watch the fun, and ceded the seat (after all, if it was  my  mom, I'd want her to have a chair, too). \n \nThat's right. I went to this highly potentially explosive event, by myself, with two sound-sensitive boys  and  a bad knee. You know this isn't going to turn out well, right? What was I  thinking ? \n \nWell, it seemed to be going swimmingly. The boys were dancing, having a lot of fun, and I don't think I've smiled so wide in weeks. I would have danced with them, except for my knee. Then Dance Contest time arrived. The DJs played a \"practice\" line dancing song, then they went with another one for the contest. All seemed to be going great, the boys were having fun and dancing... \n \nLife has a funny way of turning on a dime for us. They were picking winners (which, to be honest, is mostly done at random) and Andy was asking me if he could go outside and get in the moonbounce line. There were plenty of adults we knew out there, I was standing where I could see that line, so I agreed, and he bounced happily off. I turned back to the dancing children. \n \nWhere was Joey? \n \nI blinked. \n \nHe was gone. \n \nI glanced out at the moonbounce and courtyard, but he wasn't there. I peeked into the cakewalk room, as he loves the music teacher and loves cupcakes. No Joey. I checked the dance floor again. No Joey. I started moving though the cafe-gym, scanning for him. No Joey. \n \nNow, at our school, we have three top people to talk to. We have a principal, a vice-principal, and a person who is called the \"principal's assistant\" who is kind of a second vice-principal. This assistant person was welcoming families at the door and handing out glowsticks. He is also very familiar with my son. I saw him gesticulating at me, and my heart went to water. Those motions could only mean that Joey had gone out that door. \n \nI believe the man said something like, \"I thought he was going to the car\" as I whipped by him, but when I looked, Joey wasn't at the car. Nor was he in the parking lot. Another moment, and I broke into a run- he was beyond the close lot, on the sidewalk toward the farther lot and the road that leads out to the major state highway, and he was moving at his pretty steady bolt-trot. The one no one thinks is fast until you realize he's gone. \n \nWhen the doctor said, \"stay off your knee,\" I don't think he meant \"do a hard run for a quarter mile to catch your son.\" \n \nFolks, I was fortunate. God was looking out for me. Angels exist. And this time, they materialized into the shape of our friends, Joey's best bud D and his mom. They had arrived and had to park in that far lot, and were walking towards the school. They turned the corner of the walk just as Joey arrived to that point. Even at a hard run, I was not even close to catching him; but D's mom knew to stop him, and managed the feat (which is not an easy one when Joey is in full bolt). \n \nThe trigger? He didn't win the dance contest. In a single second, we had gone from brilliantly happy to devastated bolting. I had taken my eyes off him just long enough for my other child to ask me a question. It happens that fast. If D and his mom had not appeared, I could easily have lost him; he would certainly have made it to the road, and probably the highway, before I could have caught him. \n \nIt happens that fast. \n \nSo I hope you'll forgive me if I start blogging about knee recovery, followed by serious weightloss and then running training. Someone's got to be able to catch this child before we have a serious catastrophe.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/06/disasters-averted.html", "title": "\nDisasters Averted\n"},

{"date": "Monday, July 23, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nWe haven't been on too many adventures lately. The boys have been tremendously busy, as have JoeyAndyDad and I. Also, neither boy has been riding well, so long drives are not on our agenda right now. Add another jump in Joey's anxiety level, and our apparent incompetence in helping him cope, and well, we haven't been on too many adventures lately. \n \nWith the day overcast and cool for once (this has been the Summer in the Oven here), we decided to try the  zoo . So we packed everybody up and merrily began our jaunt, which did really well until we almost arrived- everybody was hungry, car-weary, and the battery on the iPad gave out. We pulled over to get some food. \n \nAnd that is when I decided to double-check when the zoo actually opened, to find it was completely closed on Sundays. Who ever heard of a zoo being closed on a weekend day in summer? Really? \n \n \n \n \n \nSo we took our $60 elsewhere (yep- we were going to shell out $60 to see a zoo. But you get to  feed giraffes , people. We are totally going to try again on Friday.) That elsewhere was our old stand-by,  Maymont . We re-upped our membership, and got down to business- which was wandering through the children's barn, through the little zoo to see the bear, and then hiking back up the hill, huffing and puffing because no one was expecting to be at Maymont, and no one brought a fan, water, or an inhaler. \n \n \n \nThe boys liked the raptor display best. It's shady, clean, and full of awesome birds. They liked the hawks and owls best, though I must admit the bald eagle is always the show-stopper for me (and I  love  owls). \n \nOne of the cool parts is the viewer, which (for a quarter) lets you see with the acuity and range of an eagle. Andy was especially excited, as his new powers of vision and focus let him really be able to use the thing. Joey balked as usual at having to use both eyes. We are totally having that checked out, as soon as we know we have the up-front fund to put down on the therapy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThey also liked the snow-cone stand, an especially vital feature when one has not brought a fan, water, or an inhaler. It's a very pleasant walk to the bottom of the little zoo, and very cool and lovely down there, but the humidity was a mess. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd did I forgot to mention that we were taking Sonic the Hedgehog and Luigi to the zoo? For some reason, as soon as they realized we were going adventuring, they both dressed in costume. Anxiety is a strange thing.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nJoey as Luigi, with his stick for his air-writing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAndy as Sonic the Hedgehog.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe did manage to see the bear, who was the biggest black bear I have ever seen- that thing must have been 300-400 pounds, it was definitely as hefty as me. Not a bear I'd want to meet in a dark forest with a fish in my pocket. Awesome creature.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJoey had some trouble picking out the animals from their environments, but he was happy to at least see this bear. And hug it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs lovely as it was, it had to end. We didn't have tickets for the tram, so we had to trudge back up the little mountain, past the raptors, the fox, the bobcat... Andy was so excited to find the bobcat out on our way back! He usually hides in his den most of the day, especially hot days.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe finally arrived back at the car, so we could head for the Nature Center and cool off. It isn't a big center, but it is pretty nice, and full of aquariums, little activities, a hall with night animals, a beautiful discovery room, and Joey's favorite, the otters.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe volunteer brought out a snake for everybody to pet, which made Joey very happy. He loves handling snakes. I think he was kinda cold and smooth, but Joey was very excited. The volunteer was very patient with Joey, and I can't tell you how much that was appreciated! She was ever so sweet as Joey sat next to her with a toy snake, and started \"interviewing\" her as the snake. The two snakes had a very nice little conversation about being snakes.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n We spent a nice long time watching the otters. They were doing a show when we first arrived, but once the tricks were over the otters were fed, the folks cleared out and gave us back our nice, quiet otter corner. We took some photos, and laughed about the otters wrestling and playing, and Joey followed them and played with them, and all was happy.\u00a0 \n \nIn watching them, as Joey started talking to me about them in his chatter-chatter-otters-are-awesome way, I noticed that the one otter now had the other firmly by the neck. I have watched enough nature shows to realize what this means- and obviously, after dinner and a show, otters get... um... frisky. Amorously frisky.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nLately, Joey has discovered the power of colorful metaphor, and his favorite word to use is the one that gets the most heads to turn. I was sorely tempted to have him turn around, and explain that every time he used that particular colorful metaphor, this behavior is what he was referencing. Fuzzy, frantic otter sex. Sorely, sorely tempted. But I was good, and didn't scar my child for life.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nInstead, I decided to treat otters as I would have otters treat me, and discreetly maneuvered Joey back to the fish and snakes in the other room to give them a little--- ahem--- privacy. Besides, it was time to head home. We had two very tired boys.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBut never fear- we managed to stop at the Russell Stover outlet on the way home.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c7UE9yo9E80/UA3-9lnfM4I/AAAAAAAAEqI/4jTuALTqv54/s1600/boys_maymont.jpg", "http://metrorichmondzoo.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NJPcUlJ-YAA/UA3-9CHWw5I/AAAAAAAAEqA/m1MeYOxkRRM/s1600/boys_hug.JPG", "http://metrorichmondzoo.com/AnimalEncounters/FeedPetGiraffes.html", "http://www.maymont.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s5DjHF_I4Ck/UA3--KmkfKI/AAAAAAAAEqQ/VOF9Fqe-OMk/s1600/boys_raptors.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p_yjvWNH36k/UA3-8GgQHII/AAAAAAAAEpw/2wn3ZY05Ies/s1600/andy_spyglass.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L2LkUb-ySTo/UA3-_iPdQ5I/AAAAAAAAEqo/YpUdVGU0iIg/s1600/dad_joey.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0Q1h1nSA0sw/UA3_CZyA1eI/AAAAAAAAErY/BYRo4eZg6yI/s1600/joey_snowcone.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y3L09CCOJmo/UA3_C4aHBaI/AAAAAAAAErg/hstsl6WJLUk/s1600/joey_stick.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kSNKAnr0bV4/UA3-74BqgvI/AAAAAAAAEpo/zEF1e-wDN_c/s1600/andy_snowcone.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2OTkLKVamGU/UA3-7R88d5I/AAAAAAAAEpg/0HJYuGV34-Q/s1600/andy_goats.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FGVNhyttzJw/UA3-66t5_wI/AAAAAAAAEpY/PtPZXJILGmo/s1600/andy_bearlooking.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ncK6Fpi1jhY/UA3_ApdsbMI/AAAAAAAAEq4/1yss6o6SZl0/s1600/joey_bear.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MeNimsX3tCg/UA3-_MZJumI/AAAAAAAAEqg/xW2k0zn7ZdY/s1600/bridge.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8ZVKdNBzc5I/UA3_CLtftUI/AAAAAAAAErQ/iDOM-nWyVCs/s1600/joey_snake.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0pDIqNGCWZA/UA3_BnXXwaI/AAAAAAAAErI/k0vpmsDx9qY/s1600/joey_otter.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wS69s7K0rV0/UA3_DrszfaI/AAAAAAAAEro/2adyEgqg2wo/s1600/mom_boys.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/07/wait-zoo-is-closed-on-sundays-lessons.html", "title": "\nWait...

Once again it is a shock, since guess who is the top math student in the class yet again? \n \nWhy do educators not understand the importance of recognizing a student's strengths? Especially a student who has many, many challenges? \n \nYou can send me any excuse you want. Not recognizing Joey's math prowess teaches Joey a single, poignant and heartbreaking lesson as a child: his talent and gift is of no worth. His work is of no value. The one thing he does spectacularly well is of no consequence. \n \nThen we wonder why our schools are struggling academically. \n \nThink of it this way: if you are good at your job, you expect to have better salary and perhaps look forward to a nod from the boss. Certainly, if we do a job well and there is a big ceremony once a year to acknowledge people who do their job well, we expect a mention. As an adult, we are equipped with certain tools for coping when and if that is not forthcoming- and very often, we start looking for another job. \n \nAs a child, what is the purpose of these \"awards ceremonies\"? If these certificates are supposed to be motivation for kids to enjoy school and work hard, shouldn't they be used to, well, motivate? \n \nThe excuse last year was that no one seemed to know who was in charge of nominating Joey for an award. If that is the excuse I get this year, I think I may have to get that warpaint back out, and make sure everyone understands not only that this  is  discrimination, but  why  it is discrimination. Basically saying, \"oops, your kid is special ed so they don't get nominated\" is, frankly, bullshit. \n \nSo I am dying to hear what the excuse is  this  time. \n \nUpdate: His case manager, the Awesome Ms. H, is also looking into what the excuse is this time.

{"date": "Monday, April 30, 2012", "body": "\nLooking back through my April blogs, you might notice something distinctly different this year: not a whole lot of autism awareness pots this month. In fact, it appears blogging has taken a serious back seat in life here. Blogging requires things like time and energy. This spring is being a bit of a roller-coaster, leaving me short on both. I am looking forward desperately to next week, when I will have all my classes graded and closed out, no soccer practice, and just a few more minutes on Tuesday or Thursday (probably not both) to do stuff like... clean. Or read. Or maybe even blog. \n \nAndy's vision therapy is going fine; and while she's at it, the therapist is also working on his manners and some of his ADHD issues, fine motor issues, and bilateral coordination. Unfortunately, he also decided to hit a growth spurt, so Total Dysregulation is upon us- he is very brittle. He runs out of energy reserve super-fast, so we have to keep on top of feeding him. Add the constant motion, and we are in meltdown city. \n \nOn the other hand, Joey has been caught sneaking snacks again, so I have returned to the apples and sugar-free popsicles plan- ie, those are the snacks in the house. Everything else is Verboten. I have been trying to encourage scooters and other outdoors play, but glitches in the day means there is a lot of Mario Brothers being played to calm... and revv. It's a delicate balance. \n \nYep, I have one that needs to sit down and eat, and the other needs to get up and not eat. Great. \n \nAt any rate, Autism Awareness Month is now at its close. Most of the folks I know will also turn to their next interesting Awareness project, and leave autism aside for another year- if, indeed, they bothered to pick it up in the first place. I keep turning around to find such a lack of understanding, it stings to have it so close; turn again, and there is a sense of wanting to know; and another corner, and I find some folks who get it, and others who never will. You just never know who will be around those corners. I am sometimes surprised. And shocked. And surprised. \n \nAs the calendar turns, please don't forget us. Don't forget Joey. It is important for everyone to not just be aware for a day, or a month, but to really think about their lives and how they are living them. Awareness isn't just about putting a blue light bulb outside or a ribbon on your car. It is about understanding what it really means to treat others as you would want to be treated- all the time, every day, every moment. If we all just learned to do that, all the world would be a better place to grow and be free.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/04/month-comes-to-end.html", "title": "\nA Month Comes to an End\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 09, 2012", "body": "\n With autism awareness month upon us, one of the questions I often get from those not familiar yet with autism is, what does autism  look  like? There are several different reasons for asking. Some folks want a list of thing to \"look for\" in their own family and friends, for a sort of self-diagnosisof things they see. This is a difficult reason to answer, because autism does not manifest in one single way; every autistic person is unique, just like the rest of us.  Also, when I start making that list, I am often interrupted by comments such as \"well, I do that, and I'm normal! (or not autistic!)\" because so many of the red flags are not a matter of doing or not doing, but a matter of degree. I wind up in the discussion of the difference between a tantrum and a meltdown. It is hard to explain to someone who has never seen one or the other. Where does one draw the line between \"very focused\" and \"hype-focused\"? Sometimes it is not so obvious. And some people are just not very bright, and trying to tease the knife edge between them is useless. Sometime you just have to say, \"yes, I know you really like cats, but it doesn't get in the way of you doing other things, like eating.\" Which isn't the boundary at all, but at least they get the idea.  Then there are people who ask this question because they want to look at random strangers and diagnose them. After all, with many disabilities, you can see the person is disabled. They have visible differences- wheelchairs, for instance. Or distinctive facial features. Also, I get a lot of comments about how Joey doesn't  look  disabled- especially when I pull into the handicapped parking spot and get out our hangtag.  Autism is an invisible disability. You can't look at someone and say, \"oh, s/he must be autistic!\" You need other cues. That is something to keep in mind as you walk around in the wide world- just because that person doesn't look disabled, doesn't mean they might not have special needs. Be prepared to meet them so they can join in the working of the world. After all, you want  your  special needs met, right? In fact, people who don't meet them often get labeled very quickly in your mind as a person to steer clear from, right?  Anyone you meet might or might not be autistic. Autism occurs in people with or without other disabilities. Because autism is a pervasive neurological disorder, other disabilities can be bundled into the issues. Or not. Consequently, autism looks different for everyone- as uniquely as you and I look from each other. Autism is a diagnostic label related to certain behaviors and deficits; it may not even be a single condition or state, but a variety of pervasive issues that have similar results. Social connection/social skill difficulties, communication disorders, issues of movement. Neurology is pervasive in our bodies, so anything inside or out might be affected- sensory systems, digestive systems, respiratory systems, endocrine systems... I could go on.  So there is no one way autism \"looks\". I can only tell you what it looks like for us. And for us, JOey is the ultimate face of autism; autism is intrinsic to who Joey is and how he experiences the world. Watching him, listening to him, accepting him helps us to have new eyes and see from new angles, to understand the world from a point of view we could never have imagined without him.  What does autism look like? It looks like birthday parties and video games and days at the beach. It looks like grins and giggles and sparkly blue eyes. It looks like round rosy cheeks and running around the bases. It looks like homework and balloons and tricycles. It looks like a boy, growing up fast.  To us, autism is a roller-coaster, much like raising any other child, with the difference of the extremes. You notice the difference when you see Joey next to his peers; the things they do oh-so-easily (such as, say, talking and walking), are not as easy and free with Joey. But when you just have him, can you see it?    Well, can you?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FMQPypXjgTk/T4OF0l0HSAI/AAAAAAAAEbQ/PM0p7uUM4ks/s1600/P1030284.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9KnS77mK3mA/T4OF0WfatdI/AAAAAAAAEbA/9nOLM-p8oWs/s1600/IMG_1310.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-73rD0Tj-ERo/T4OF0CV8wfI/AAAAAAAAEa0/uX60J8dQhwI/s1600/IMG_1108.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--sQCFHycWEg/T4OFz3emIFI/AAAAAAAAEas/PWN5x8hs8so/s1600/IMG_1098.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rU331FWTCr0/T4OFouykt8I/AAAAAAAAEag/zD5cU_VhxkQ/s1600/IMG_0936.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i5u1e0K0owI/T4OFoIO2Y-I/AAAAAAAAEaU/GtV749bxrK8/s1600/P1030313.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oAymdebrnLQ/T4OFn9EwsGI/AAAAAAAAEaI/bEQTpBsPbFg/s1600/IMG_1127.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IroQE6ZnJWg/T4OFna8mM4I/AAAAAAAAEZ8/KTwU4ztjXb4/s1600/IMG_1102.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TR3T2a8AH1c/T4OFnCoDsyI/AAAAAAAAEZw/WotPTX9Hzts/s1600/P1030306.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/04/being-aware-what-does-autism-look-like.html", "title": "\nBeing Aware: What Does Autism Look Like?\n"},

Here are the people to call:\u00a0\u2028 \n \n *Local\nAutism clinic , if you didn't get get the diagnosis there. Here, that would\nboth Kluge Children's Rehab and Kennedy Krieger. Some centers, like Kennedy\nKrieger, take a year to get an appointment for anything. Kluge takes a couple\nof months. A year is a little long, but a couple of months is OK. This is\nurgent, but not an emergency. Besides, you have other folks to call and get\ngoing.\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *The local school district . Many of teh supports your child\nneeds are the responsibility of your local school district. You want to get a\nfeel for the place, have an eval, get into the system- even if you decide to\nhomeschool.\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *Your insurance . KNow what they will cover, and what\nthey will not. Many insurances will cover OT without batting an eye, but will\nnot cover speech therapy because it is \"educational.\" Some insurance\nsee \"autism\" and cover NOTHING. Some see it and cover EVERYTHING.\nSome therapies are considered educational and not medical- and this can be\ndifferent from insurance to insurance, state to state. You may choose\ninterventions that are not covered, and you need to know what you will be\npaying for, how much it will be, and what you will need to do to cover\nit.\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *The speech pathologist . Some centers have them, some local\nhospitals have them, and there are lots of private practice ones. Be sure they\nare going to work on communication, not just speech. Do they do sign language,\nswitches, PECS? How do they use these as tools for communication, and not just\nlearning to speak? How do they use them to encourage- but not force- speech? Do\nthey also work with reading and other visual communication?\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *The\nphysical therapist.\u00a0 Many autistic kids have gross motor problems that\nneed to be addressed. Many don't need a PT (Joey doesn't need a PT).\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *The\noccupational therapist. \u00a0Ask specifically about sensory integration\ntherapies. Most autistic kids have some form of SPD (though not all!). You\ndon't want just a buttons and zippers OT, you want one that will take an\nintegrated approach and can address the needs of your child.\u2028 \n \n \n \n *Your\npediatrician. \u00a0Be sure they are immediately aware. Ask questions. What\nwill they do for you? What do they know abotu autism? Are they willing to do\nsome research or attend a conference or workshop about autism? If you have a\ndoctor who seems ignorant of autism- and many are-\u00a0 and \u00a0is\nunwiling to beome educated, then you will be needing a new ped.\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *Psychologist. \u00a0You may\nneed some testing done in ways the school doesn't accomodate, some\nunderstanding of your child's mental health, and yes, you may need medications.\nBe prepared.\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *Your local Disability Resource Center. \u00a0These\ntypes of organizations can help you navigate local resources, prepare for\nthings like Medicaid Waivers, even help you understand disability law and\nrights. They can also help you network with other parents of disabled\nchildren.\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *State agencies for the disabled. \u00a0Many\nstates have offices specifically geared to helping people with disabilities and\nprotect their rights. Its a good idea to be familiar with these offices and\nwhat they actually do in your state or locality.\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *A Lawyer.\u00a0 You're about to\nbecome an expert in disability law. School districts and insurance agencies can\nbe not fun to work with. Be prepared. Find a lawyer and advocate who deal in\ndisability and educational law. BE prepared in case you run into problems- its\na lot easier to prepare for a fight if you already have your champion lined up,\nrather than waiting until you have a problem. I haven't met a parent yet who\ndidn't have a problem.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u2028\u2028I know that is a lot of phone calls. Prepare\nahead of time- get a big loose-leaf notebook to keep paperwork, evaluations,\neven phone messages in. Just keep it by date; when you make a call, note it on\na sheet with the date and a summary of what was discussed, and put it in the\nnotebook. When the evals come, just put them in the notebook. Bills. Letters.\nIEPs. Anything. I even have Joey's birth certificate at the front. I'm on our\nsecond 3\" binder.\u00a0\u2028\u2028 \n \n \n \n 2. Here are things you need to do:\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *Relax. \u00a0Your child\nhasn't changed. You just have a new label to point you to resources you might\nneed. \n \n \n \n *\u2028 Read.\u00a0 The books I recommend are:\u00a0 \n \n From Emotions\nto Advocacy \u00a0by Pete Wright.\u00a0 \u2028 \n \n 1001 Great\nIdeas For Teaching and Raising Children with Autism \u00a0by Zysk and Notbohm.\u00a0 \u2028 \n \n That will give\nyou a start. I encourage folks to include their favorite resources in the\ncomments.\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *Read some more. \u00a0You will need to research\ndifferent methods and strategies used with autistic children. Some I can think\noff the top of my head are ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis), PECS (Picture\nExchange Communication System), Floor Time, Sensory Integration, Therapeutic\nListening, GFCF (Gluten free/Casein free diets) {and other possible allergies\nand diets- if your kid has sensory issues, allergies can drive them crazy!], ABLLS\n(Asessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills), TEACCH (Treatment and\nEducation of Autistic and related Communication-disabled[or handicapped]\nChildren).\u00a0 \n \n \n \n *\u2028 Get online. \u00a0Check out the links I have in the\nsidebar. I've developed a handout for new parents here in Virginia, I'll be\nhappy to email it to you. Also, you can network with more great folks like us.\n:)\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n *Go out and have some fun! \u00a0Remember, your child hasn't\nchanged! Go out and do the stuff your child likes to do! Try to introduce your\nchild to new experiences- as you would any child! These outings may take more\npreparation(and work) than for non-autistic families, but it's worth it.\nKeeping kids locked in the house will drive you crazy, too, and deny them\nliving. Yes, some folks will stare. You may get unkind comments, or offensive\ncomments. But you know what? You would have gotten them even if you didn't know\nabout autism. Now you know how to support your child in the face of these\npeople- \"My kid's doing a great job with this new experience. What's\u00a0 your \u00a0problem?\"\u2028\u2028 \n \n \n \n Summary?\nYou now know your child is autistic. Now you have a better plan for moving\nahead and educating your child- which now makes your life better, not worse.\nYes, now that you know the kinds of resources you need, you now have work to do\nto tap those resources- but now you have narrowed the field to the resources\nyou may need!\u2028\u2028 \n \n \n \n See? Not scary.

{"date": "Wednesday, May 02, 2012", "body": "\nJoey is ten years old now. I keep thinking back to when I turned ten. I liked to walk through the woods. I liked to make stuff. I could get on my bike and ride down the road to pick blackberries. I could make Christmas cookies. I still liked my Barbie dolls and my dollhouse. I liked to make cassettes of my favorite music- with my fancy record-player, I could take the music right off the records. That was a big deal, very fancy (I could also record tape-to-tape... woo-hoo!) \n \nI also have been looking at what other 10-year-olds I know or knew like/d and do/did. For the  Cousins ' tenth birthday, we gave them a keyboard and a telescope. The took my boys on a tour of my Uncle Lou's property, and took them to see the chickens next door- something they normally could do by themselves, without adult me tagging along.  Awesome Neighbor \u00a0would go around the neighborhood, visiting friends and just generally being a kid. When you talk about ten-year-olds, things like go-karts and playing spy and running down to the swimming-hole come to mind. \n \nJoey can't or doesn't do these things. I can't imagine him in a workshop, watching and helping with building... well, anything. He likes cooking, but needs a lot of supervision. He likes toys, but doesn't actually play with them very often. He would have little clue what to do with a telescope, and hasn't shown much interest in the keyboard here. Having him go anywhere independently? That is asking for big-time trouble, with bolting and \" eloping .\" He's interested in making his own music lists... kind of. \n \nIn some ways, Joey is 15. He can do math like a whiz kid, for example. And in some ways, he is 5. He still likes his kisses. But there seem to be very few ways he is 10, in any way I can see most ten-year-olds meeting expectations of ability and maturity. It's not just me, either. His OT hasn't moved him up in the social skills groups- he's still in with the 6-8 year crowd (and these are disabled kids, so they are lagging even for 6-8 year kids), not the 9-12 group. \n \nSometimes, when these kinds of thoughts crowd in, it is good to breathe in and remember what he does, and loves, and enjoys, and just enjoy him being Joey. After all, Joey is awesome. He loves to laugh and make other people laugh. He loves baseball (he's a big hitter, too!). He has completely defeated all the levels of  Super Mario Brothers  on the DS, and is well on his way for the Wii. He likes chattering as if he is making video \"walk throughs\" while he plays, now- a professor, just like his Mom, explaining what to do and how to do it and why he is taking a certain path or power-up. He loves to ask math questions, and correct you when you get them wrong. He loves loves loves playing with his brother- even if it gets frustrating and little brothers get annoying. He loves to give us hugs and kisses. He loves wearing basketball shirts. He loves the beach and swimming in the pools, and playing with the hose. He loves his scooter and his computer and his notebooks. \n \nI  told  you he is awesome. And really, did we expect any less?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.awaare.org/", "http://mario.nintendo.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/05/expectations.html", "title": "\nExpectations\n"},

When I first touched his cheek, it was so soft, it was like touching nothing at all. My Joey came into the world via emergency c-section, precisely at 8pm. And who could not love that beautiful, smoochy Buddha Buddy?  It's hard to imagine loving someone more than the moment my Joey came into the world. Until the next moment came, and we all loved him even more. Then the next moment came, and we loved him even more...  If you have never had a newborn in your arms and sniffed that newborn baby head, you cannot possibly imagine the true meaning of the universe; until you smooch that baby head, you cannot imagine the totality of existence. There is nothing more life-changing than the real understanding that life is more than just you. That the cosmos is bigger than just you. Not just know it.  Understand  it.  I had no idea how much I would learn from my Joey. If I had known, I would have had him years sooner. And he would have a lot more siblings.  When Joey was born, my mom said I would be amazed how fast the time would go. She's right. I'm staggered. Time slips through our lives with no turning back, and the best you can do is hug your dear ones tight and enjoy the ride. Fortunately, Joey still loves to be hugged. And smooched. And squished really, really good.  Happy Birthday, Buddha Buddy.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2012", "body": "\n A miracle has occurred at my house. Not a big, holy hannah there is a saint living here kind a miracle. No... one of those small, beautiful little miracles that really reminds you that every minute is a miracle, and you should celebrate each one by hugs and smooches. You know, the kind that  really  matter.  I was grading exams, when Joey comes into the den with a big grin on his face and what appears to be a sandwich in his hand. With the pride of a boy who has just conquered the known universe, he announces, \"Mommy! I made a peanut butter sandwich!\" His first peanut butter sandwich, all by himself, start to finish. Then he took a big, beautiful bite. Then he let me take a picture.  In case you don't see the miracle in this, let me outline what it means to make a sandwich:  1. Sequencing. Take out the bread, get out the peanut butter, spread the peanut butter, put the sandwich together, put away the peanut butter and close up the bread. I could get into finer steps of the sequencing required, but you get the point. Sequencing is something we always have trouble with here. Yes, he can turn the key and get out the door no problem, but doing something like making a sandwich? Way too many steps... until now.  2. Hand control. Ever watch a little kid try to spread peanut butter? The bread is usually unrecognizable by the end, or you have this very large lump of peanut butter, or both. It takes a huge amount of control to spread anything with a knife, especially something as stiff as peanut butter from the fridge. Controlling the pressure exerted as you move the peanut butter across the bread is something you may not even think about, but was impossible for Joey... until now.  3. Bilateral coordination and crossing midline. Ever try to do that spreading with one hand? To make a peanut butter sandwich, you usually have to hold the bread with one hand and spread with the other. This requires coordination, and an ability to cross your midline while you hold that bread in place. Joey has limitations in his ability to cross midline, which results in poor bilateral coordination. Holding something in one hand and manipulating it with the other with any real accuracy is something he struggled with.. until now.  Now, he can make himself a peanut butter sandwich. That boy  rocks .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nvL72RYN2i4/T2qZQc6GgtI/AAAAAAAAEYY/7m13iufVHfQ/s1600/IMG_0958.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/03/peanut-butter-sandwich.html", "title": "\nA Peanut Butter Sandwich\n"},

I also get tired of people who stomp their feet over the interventions used to help kids learn to cope, focus, and self-regulate. I get so tired of people who chose to remain ignorant.  It can only be by choice at this point. The extensive awareness campaigns for autism and ADHD in the popular media should at least by now have gotten through the thickest skulls that there are people out there who are different, and who may need extra support- therapies, medications, whatever. But no. Idiots and selfish, ignorant numbskulls remain.  Trying to speak reasonably to such people can be an exercise in blood pressure control and deep breathing. After all, the majority of them are not reasonable themselves. They send you to websites that are so obviously hate-mongering snake-oil-selling conspiracy-theory gibberish that you wonder how they are getting through life without a room full of diet pills and  turnip twaddlers . Or maybe they haven't.  Here's the truth, folks: ASD and ADHD are both very real, and they affect both children and adults every day. Not everyone who are ASD or ADHD require medication, but some do. Occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy... there are lots of interventions out there, far more than 30 years ago when I was a kid, and I thank God for it. Because seriously, that question, \"where were those kids thirty years ago?\" is plain annoying. Where were they? ASD kids were labeled weird and mentally retarded (using the term of the time), and all too often locked away, sent to special schools or self-contained rooms, or bullied out of school altogether. ADHD kids were labeled disruptive, often became angry, and as they grew older, often fell to self-medication through illegal substances or alcohol abuse. Growing up believing they were lazy and stupid, many resorted to extremes of behavior, and even suicide. Yeah-  those  kids.  Today, those kids can be supported and be functioning participants- very valuable participants- of classrooms and communities.  I really wish these people would go volunteer for their local special ed classrooms. They would learn  SO MUCH ... including some lessons on courage, perseverance, and humility. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/76484458@N00/156980933/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/03/tired-of-reading-jerkface-comments-on.html", "title": "\nMessage Boards are not good for my blood pressure\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 05, 2012", "body": "\nJoey is getting big. Like, big. He's nine and a half, and he's going to be a big man- even if I get his weight under control. We are starting to really understand the issues that come with being the parent of an autistic young man. For one, if he loses control, he could really hurt somebody. Like me. Or like Andy.  I know I often leave off the blacker side of living with Joey, and trying to help him, but I am realizing that many more of us are dealing with issues of temper and anger than perhaps we want to admit. It is a challenge to teach any child about controlling frustration and expressing anger in ways that are constructive rather than destructive. Trying to teach one that has issues with communication in the first place? Then add a daub of impulsiveness to it? Now add some not-so-healthy depression? Holy. Freaking. Cow.  Honestly, I am finding myself at a loss. Trying to discuss the issue with Joey is a super challenge that I am finding myself struggling to meet. Joey does not cope with criticism well, and starting the spiral into \"I'm a bully! I'll never...!\" makes it that much harder to try to get him to understand; and until I can get  him  to understand, I'm not sure how I can get him to help  me  understand.  I know that didn't make much sense. What are we trying to understand?  Both of my kids use communication system we call  Engine Run  to help others understand how they are feeling, to get in tune with their own regulation issues, and learn to self-regulate and manage. Basically, you think of your emotional state and body as a car. If your engine runs too high, you can crash or go flying off a cliff, or get into a speed-related accident. Not good. If your engine runs too low, you block up traffic, people honk at you, and you don't get where you need to go. You want to get your engine running just right. Then, the program works on teaching kids what kinds of sensory integrative activities and strategies help them for when they are running too high or too low.  My problem is when Joey goes from running a little on the high side to running white-hot HOLY MOLY and crashes off the cliff, what do I do? And how do I prevent it from happening again? Or at prevent him from hurting himself or anyone else? This is a question not only of what to do in the white-hot moment (restraint), but also prevention (de-escalation).  The other day, we came home and he was upset with me. I can't even tell you about what now, probably I had to take a toy or a stick from him. What I remember is standing at the door of my house, trying to turn the key, and getting pummeled. Absolutely  pummeled . I had enough sense to get his arms and keep him from running off down the street, getting the door open, and screaming for help from JoeyAndyDad. Being chubby likely saved me from having major damage to my arm, he was slamming me with his fists so hard. I'm surprised none of the neighbors called the police. We got him inside and into his room. We got Andy inside and checked on him, because talk about scary! And of course, ten minutes later, Joey had another melt because he realized what he had done, and that I was hurt. All I could do was hug him, and get him through another round of \"I'm a horrible boy!\", which can only be countered with assurances otherwise, and lots of assurances of love.  But I knew right then, I was in trouble. Deep trouble.  I have had to ban Mario Brothers from the house for a while. Both boys get so over-excited that it becomes dangerous. They play away fine, and then some small issue rears its ugly head, and danger strikes. Someone gets hit. Someone gets kicked. Joey flew at Andy an bit him so hard on the shoulder he left a bruise- I'm surprised he didn't draw blood. It was like watching a tiger attack, and just as lightning-fast... and terrifying. And horrible. How does one get across the seriousness of this behavior, and the need for it to end  RIGHT NOW ? Getting him to calm down was my first response, but nothing I could think of seemed adequate. Sure, I banned the game. Sure, I shut down the Wii, hid the DS, sent him to his room, brought him down for a talk. Andy was already apparently past the whole thing by the time Joey was calm enough to speak reasonably. But he could have been seriously hurt.  It's a growing problem. And as he grows, and we stare puberty in the face, I fear this isn't going to get better any time soon... unless I act  now . And even then, it may not be enough.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.alertprogram.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/01/growing-problem-curbing-anger.html", "title": "\nA Growing Problem: Curbing Anger\n"},

The one I shall jump upon my soapbox this evening to highlight is: \"My sense of humor may hurt your feelings. i suggest you get over it.\"  Why do people think that demeaning others is \"funny\"? Why do people think it is OK to get pleasure by causing another pain? How would they like it if it was their feelings being hurt, their lives being demeaned? What happened to that basic of respect, treating others as you would want to be treated?  Do people really think I ought to keep this in mind the next time I hear or see a \"retard joke\" in front of Joey? Sadly, they do. Really. I wonder what those people would think if I took a baseball bat and smacked them upside the head with it. Hey, lots of people think slapstick is funny, right? Do people not understand that emotional pain can be far more damaging than physical pain?  Humor is a very culturally determined thing. As culture emerges from the dark and learns how important respecting others really is- and how well it really works- we change our idea of what is funny. Little Black Sambo is not funny, it is demeaning; and when society realized it was demeaning, Little Black Sambo jokes disappeared.  But there are still groups and people that society do not see as fully human, and so demeaning them is seen as acceptable. When those groups begin to protest, telling them to just \"get over it\" is not acceptable, either. There are plenty of wonderful, joyous, and really hilarious moments in the world, without having to cause another any pain at all. Causing pain isn't funny. Hurting isn't humor.  No, I will not get over it. I hope that you will, instead, rise above it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/10/if-it-is-demeaning-it-isnt-humor.html", "title": "\nIf It Is Demeaning, It Isn't Humor.\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 27, 2011", "body": "\nThere are few things that strike fear into the heart of a parent than a note home from a teacher. Especially one that politely requests a conference to address the behavior of your child.  I get used to notes about Joey. In fact, if I  don't  have one, I worry. What did he do that day? Was there a sub? Was he OK? WHERE THE HECK IS MY JOEY NOTE??? But Andy? Um, wrong child. But, you see, I think we are heading into the world of I Told You So. I've had Andy in ChildFind three times. His speech still lags. He's ADHD. Without that special ed support, we risk him getting a teacher with no clue how to keep his little derriere in his seat and his eyes on his desk long enough to get his work done. Because, see, there  are  secrets for doing it. On the other hand, we may just be reaching that point when the ADHD is just going to get in the way, and start having that negative impact on his academics and education that I've been told is going to happen, that I warned everyone (including this teacher) might happen, and usually does happen. We just thought it would happen sooner. Perhaps his other teachers had more experience in heading it off.  The day appears to be here.  We've been having a slow spiral into I Don't Want To Go To School and I Don't Want To Do Homework. I have put off the latter by reverting to positive reinforcement: do your homework, and you get to watch the show you wanted on TV, or get popcorn, or get a prize. Hey, it works. And besides, this lady is sending home huge amounts of homework. Now at least I know we'll only be at it about 45 minutes.  The former? Well, I need to get in there and see what is going awry. If he's in a noisy, distracting classroom, then he's likely to be uncomfortable and distracted. This will lead to behavior and focus issues. Which will lead to visits to the office. We don't want to go there.  We'll see how this teacher is going to handle the challenge.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/09/and-now-for-completely-different-child.html", "title": "\nAnd now for a completely different child...\n"},

Hopefully, I will get some writing time in later today. But I am making no guarantees. Meanwhile, here's a quick peek:  Andy's teacher says he is definitely ADHD, \"but it isn't affecting his ability to function.\" Question: so why are we having this meeting again? (But I will say she is being very proactive and understanding, so I think this teacher generally rocks.) Joey starts his swimming program today through school. Pros: Joey LOVES swimming and water, he gets extra movement every Wednesday for the next six weeks, and he gets the extra sensory time. Cons: He qualifies because he is \"moderately to severely disabled.\" You might notice that \"he misses school\" is neither here nor there. I doubt he'll fall very far behind in math, which is the academic subject he will miss.  We have confirmed SOL testing is a waste of time and stress.  Andy's teacher has added yet another dimension to homework. We are now up to an hour and fifteen minutes. Every night.  We have our first pumpkins! (you know you want to see  that  post- PICTURES!!!) We think our last Challenger game was rained out. We're hoping for a reschedule, but since it would be the third, we're not holding our breath.  We completely re-arranged our house. I got a great, wonderful, fantastic deal on a really high-quality entertainment center set, and the dust is finally starting to settle. We have a new den, and I have two new cabinets for showing off all my collected knick knacks. I have one case just for my cut crystal bowls, vases, pitchers, and wine glasses. Happy happy Joeymom. Now I just need to clear away all the boxes, bins, and detritus from moving furniture and display cases all around.  My cats remain warm and furry. This is good, as Fall has arrived and it is now chilly.  And not for a full post, but as a note to  Stimey : I got attacked by not one, but  five  squirrels, in a mob, driving home from my mom's house yesterday. I swear they all leapt from the trees directly at the car, in a big group, all at once. I didn't actually hit any squirrels, but it was a good thing it was a little back road with no curbs to burst a tire on. And that no one was there to hear me scream like a little girl and swear like a pirate. But, my friend, they are gathering and plotting to take over the world. I am a living witness.

{"date": "Thursday, September 01, 2011", "body": "\nWell, that went... weird. \r \r There is a standard format for open house around here. You show up sometime in the time slot provided (1-3 or 5-7 for Andy's school), stand in line to get the name of your kid's teacher, roam about until you find their classroom, dump the large bag of school supplies on the desk with your kid's name, shake hands with the teacher, convey vital info (my kid needs a lot of structure! or my kid is on these meds! that sort of thing), and leave. It takes about half an hour, with the wandering and line waiting and sometimes you have to wait a little to shake the teacher's hand. \r \r So we had a little trouble deciding on lunch, and Joey was at Grandma's, so we decided to just go over, do the open house thing, and then do the lunch thing. \r \r We walked into a big, formalized program with, like, sessions and stuff. Apparently, someone thought parents had a couple hours to kill the week before school started, and should spend all of it at the orientation session. Only they didn't tell any of the parents there was going to be this formal session format thing, and parents were wandering in whenever, just like usual. And they didn't tell the secretaries, who at first set up to do the lines for getting the parents informed of teacher names, then suddenly had to just rush everyone in so the principal could do the keynote thing. I'm not sure how much warning the teachers had, but I got the distinct feeling it wasn't much. \r \r Consequently, very weird. No way to have that quick, private two minutes to tell the teacher your kid has some minor little difficulty that just needs to be known so it won't be a problem. No time to personally connect with the teacher, because they ar busy giving a little presentation to everybody. It was really, really weird. \r \r If people had known it was going to be a two-hour formal-session event, it would have been fine. Even awesome. Say your info once or twice, instead of repeating it with every handshake or expecting the parents to read anything. Have a little tour of the school and the specials classrooms. Break up the crowd so you know you on;y have a certain number in an area at any one time, avoiding bottlenecks. But they didn't bother to tell anybody, so we had us who really needed to skedaddle and feed our kid. We had lost, confused parents wandering in the classroom at the end of the little presentation, looking embarrassed and feeling uncomfortable as they disrupted the little session they didn't know they were supposed to be attending. It was really, really bad. \r \r The teacher seems OK, and I have heard good things about the class (this is the teacher's seventh year at our school, an all seven years have been at this level) and the pod (the group of 2-4 teachers who divide the students up into smaller math and reading groups in a few weeks- allows more individualization in smaller groups, as you can have each teacher specialize in certain levels of a skill, instead of everybody trying to do the whole spectrum of skill sets. In a given set of time, a teacher can do what? two groups? three? And instead of having a kid have a choice of three levels, with a pod of 3 the child can now be in any of 6-9 levels!). It is a regular-ed setting, which is a new world for us, as Andy has been in inclusion classrooms the last two years. It is a larger class than he is used to, so I don't know how that will play out- it seemed to be a full set of 28. \r \r The teacher seemed well organized, and is going to have a website for us to check on homework things and projects, and any supplies or volunteers needed or wanted. She is going to do homework packets, so we can better work around our sports and therapy schedules, totally awesome. The first week will be read for ten minutes and then write two sentences, which I think is a great thing- for one, we know what is coming for the first week, and for two, Andy can use refreshment and reinforcement in writing (sorry, folks expecting my boys to write letters to them this summer- it didn't happen because I suck). So all in all, things are looking just groovy on the Andy front. \r \r Tomorrow: rest and relaxation. School's coming. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/09/andys-open-house.html", "title": "\nAndy's Open House\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 26, 2011", "body": "\n \r \r Dear Folks Who Buy the Prizes For the Antique Cranes: \r \r Please take a long, close look at this photo. See the baby in the background? That's me. I'm going to be... a lot older in December. I'm in Marty's in this photo because my parents thought it was fun to show those antique cranes. After all, they had played them as kids, as had their own parents. It was important to have their kids come to Marty's, to see and play those cranes. \r \r  Take a closer look. See how the bottom is filled with sand, and the prizes are stuck in it? Pretty cool, huh? And when I got a little older, the bottom was filled with tiny little seashells. There was little more exciting to me than when the claw scooped up a prize- or even better, a tiny seashell. \r \r \r \r Now take a look at this one. this is my own son, overjoyed because the claw picked up a spring thing. It didn't pick something up every time, but it was totally awesome when it did, and it did more times than not. We ended up with a lovely bag of little plastic cars, rings, poppers, aliens, erasers, baseball cards, witchfingers... small prizes that not only kept us coming back to the cranes, but to Marty's Playland. Not only were we in the habit of spending long happy afternoons in front of the cranes, but also the skeeball, the coin-pushers, the roll-ball poker machines...\r \r That picture is, unfortunately, two years old. Last year, you started putting in prizes that the claw had no chance of picking up. This year, you added to the insult by raising the price to 25 cents. \r \r I don't mind the price change. I'm sure they started off as a penny, when my grandparents were loving them. They have been 10 cents as long as I can remember (we always called them the \"10-cent cranes\"). Keeping up antique machines is likely to be expensive, and the prices of the prizes- well, you could tell they were going up. Those springs are now retailed from Oriental Traditng Company for 2 cents. A little popper thing, the prize my other child liked most, now retails from Oriental Trading Company for a whole .04 cents (yes, I am aware other places sell them cheaper). \r \r I do mind the prize change. \r \r See, part of the charm of the cranes was going out with a bag full of those little toys. If you managed to snag a pen- the sign of a true crane master- you got a bigger prize. When I was younger, the prizes where indeed bigger- in size. Not in price. Blow-mold plastic was cheaper then. Getting a little acryllic animal (imitating those fine little glass ones) was a treasure to keep. Oh, yes, I still have them- from when I was seven. \r \r How important are those cranes to your business? I don't know. But I can tell you that with the change, when we had a chance over our week stay to go to an arcade again, we didn't go to Marty's. We went a block down from our apartment, and had a ball, and got a lot more tickets that got us a lot more prizes. Any other year, we would have gone to Marty's. Every other year, we HAVE gone to Marty's. \r \r And next year? We are considering if there are places other than Ocean City to take our vacation. \r \r All for 2 cents. Seem strange? That's what happens when traditions are snapped. \r \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pe2bysbIm9U/Tle1Q_k7lYI/AAAAAAAAEJc/7gQn6SIqtOQ/s1600/amy_martyscranes.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T1YGaT8uNwU/Tle3_Nt7NdI/AAAAAAAAEJk/ki5zzwwKfqk/s1600/16_joey_claw.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/08/to-martys-playland-and-trimper-family.html", "title": "\nTo Marty's Playland and the Trimper Family\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 31, 2011", "body": "\nJoey's school open house was this afternoon- our first back-to-school event! And it wasn't an IEP meeting! Hooray! \r \r I got to meet the new team. Apparently after some scrambling and threats to force the principal to call me and explain why certain things were or were not happening, Joey's education team is nicely settled in 4 classrooms grouped at the end of one hall, so everybody can chat and pass him around as needed. Everybody also seems to understand the plan is to go with the flow, and if something happens that isn't groovy, its time to chat it up and work it out. Awesome. \r \r Joey gets to start off the year in a good chunk of self-contained class to keep him in small groups, where he seems to work best. He will, however, have a regular class homeroom and a regular class math group to start. Not inclusion- regular. He imitates inappropriate behaviors too readily, so they are trying to re-incorporate him with his old upper-group regular-ed buddies. His math friends are used to him, he's used to them, and he'll have a lifeguard if he runs into trouble, plus the other three classrooms nearby are full of friends, both peer and adult, to help. We're hoping this gives Joey some sense of safety, or at least comfort, so he can function. Also, boredom is not our friend. He needs very advanced math, or we risk a mess. \r \r The plan is to slowly move him into regular-class reading groups as well, but to keep him in smaller-setting situations for what would normally be large group in a regular-ed class (ie, science, social studies, shared reading, writing, etc). He will also be with his regular ed class for \"specials\" (art, music, library, computer, health, phys ed) and recess, to keep those kids more used to him, to keep him more used to them, and to keep him away from behaviors and issues of the special needs classrooms that were feeding problem fires. His lifeguard will be present in all of these regular-ed settings. At least that's my current understanding, and not having one in these situations would be perilous- we still have the threat of bolting to contend with, after all. \r \r So we seem to all be on board, ready to go, and we exchanged email and cell contact info. \r \r I returned later with Joey's school supplies, and had another solid chat with the self-contained teacher. We have a better personality fit than last year's teacher, which makes it easier to exchange info; also, she's worked with Joey before, so could understand more of what I was trying to communicate. All good. Yay!\r \r Am I still nervous? Oh, yeah. Last year was a total disaster. I didn't know how anxious I was until i started driving away at least, and realized I was shaking, and started to cry. I think it's going to be a much better year, with a more solidly prepared team. But it is still school. And one never knows. \r \r Tomorrow: Andy's open house.

Take my word for it. The video character is very aptly named. Unfortunately, he is also very striking and memorable, and thus very striking and memorable to imitate, despite his behavior being, well, annoying. And insulting. And offensive. And ugly.  Some of Joey's friends are very into Annoying Orange. They, and many of their parents, think it is funny. They also apparently think it is OK material for their 7-to-10- year-olds to be watching. I am hoping for the best by assuming they use it to discuss why the orange is annoying and so why you want to avoid his behavior. But alas, the majority of children we know who watch this trash are echolalic and imitative. Children such as... Joey.  So the other day, while they were eating snacks in the cafeteria, Joey thought it would be funny to throw his lunchbag at his teacher's face, in a \"remake of Annoying Orange.\" He and his buddy D thought it terribly funny, especially when she gasped- a sound Joey has been finding hilarious this week. Needless to say, the teacher was not pleased. And Joey realized quickly that he had done something that had made her not pleased. The spiral spun to disaster from there.  The good news is that people who needed a good look at what our life has been like for the past year got a spectacularly dramatic view of it, and can now better work on helping improve it.  The other good news is Annoying Orange is now officially banned from my house. In fact, we may be watching a lot of Little Bear, Franklin, and Peep for a while. I may try to sneak in a Mr. Rogers. You know, some positive behavior models. I don't get to choose who he imitates, but I can do my best to present him with all the good models I can lay hands on.

They have lives so different from what I had thought they might have, so different from my own, with challenges I never imagined when I was young. They come through with the grace and dignity and strength that takes my breath away sometimes.  My grandfathers and grandmothers never knew my boys. That seems somehow really strange. My last grandparent died two and a half years before Joey was born. Pop Conway would be proud of my boys. I do my best to make them all proud. They show respect to other people as they can (hey, they are only 7 and 9)- please and thank you and bright smiles go a long way in a world where they seem to be fading from general use, especially in young children. Joey is smart and sweet and ready to help his friends and please his teachers. Andy cares for his brother, loves animals and gardens and light sabers, always ready to include new friends. People remember my boys when they meet them, they have presence and character. There are skills that come from parenting, which combine with solid character and personality to create good little people.  We work on those challenges of growing up together. We work on the hiccups and potholes and trips and falls.  Andy wanted a snack at bedtime, and was told that wasn't appropriate. He had eaten dinner, and hadn't asked for more, only an hour before. He was actually hungry, and not just bored and trying to prolong bedtime, and blew up. What other stresses were in play? He went upstairs dutifully, but with his mouth going.  \"I hate Mommy!\" we heard quite clearly downstairs, as we prepared to go up. He was instantly recalled, and affirmed that he meant this, and was sent back upstairs with no prospect of a bedtime story.  He figured out really quickly that he was in trouble. Bath was done in record time. There wasn't a peep from that room until Joey was done his own bath, then a little boy creeping to the top of the stairs.  \"What do you need, Andy?\" JoeyAndyDad stopped the little feet coming down.  \"I want to hug you,\" came the little voice.  Dad put an apple in his pocket and headed up to have a chat.  \"Your Mommy loves you. That really hurt her feelings,\" I heard, and waited. There were tears, remorse, grief. Down he came to tell me he loved me and get hugs and kisses. I told him I loved him and gave him all the hugs and kisses he wanted. Back up he went.  \"Did you tell her you were sorry?\"  \"No.\"  \"Get your bottom back down there!\" JoeyAndyDad ordered in a loving, almost teasing tone. Down he came again.  \"I'm sorry I said I hated you,\" he said in a small, teary voice. I hugged him more, kissed him.  \"I know.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 13, 2011", "body": "\nAh, April. The month of Awareness. Lots more articles, shows, ads, and information bouncing around about autism, and not all of it accurate or useful. There are a few phrases and myths I just get sick of. And since I am grumpy this morning, here they are. 1. Autistic people do not feel empathy or sympathy.  Horsehockeys. There is a difference between being able to empathize and being able to do something about that empathy, or being able to communicate empathy. Joey knows how people are feeling around him- often acutely. Being able to react appropriately is more of a problem. If someone is hurt on the playground, he is quick with a hug and kind word. When people around him are nervous and fretful, he gets anxious, too. When folks are sad, he tries to help make them feel better. 2. Autistic people are trapped in another world.  Joey's problem is he is trapped in  this  one, where people seem to lack empathy for him. Who is the autistic one, again?      But seriously, communication disabilities aren't about being locked up somewhere else. They are difficulties in being able to communicate what you are thinking and feeling to other people. That's not being \"locked up\" somewhere else.  I have often seen it bandied about medical blogs that people would rather die than live with a communication disability. The idea that a person who can only move their eyes or who can't communicate should be abandoned for dead is horrifying to me- can you imagine being in a room and hearing, \"Well, she can't communicate, so let's turn off this respirator...\" and you want to scream like Horton's Whos, \"I am here! I am here!\" and your life being so little valued simply because you cannot speak? Are you \"locked in another world\"? Or are you trapped in this one? What if someone took the time to teach you another way to communicate, work with you to move your eyes, your hands, anything at all? Would you still want that respirator turned off? Or have them stop all food and water and just \"let you die\"? How scared and frustrated would you be?  How many kids live that way every day, because people who are not autistic, who are supposed to be special needs professionals, have no empathy for them? And then they wonder why the kid melts down?  3. Autistic people are violent, or prone to violence.  Prove it. Show me the studies. Autistic people are likely more prone to frustration and acting out because of communication difficulties, but \"Acting out\" and \"prone to violence\" are two very different things. They are likely more prone to depression because of a lack of understanding, acceptance, and empathy towards them, but \"depressed\" and \"violent\" are two different things. Frustration and depression can result in increased aggression, but not just in autistic people. See #2.  Seriously, people, let's look for some real awareness. When going about your everyday lives, try to empathize with and respect others instead of judging them. Try to help rather than scorn.

We also talked about patting someone on the bottom or being kissed in public being possibly embarrassing to the other person. Things seemed to be going well on this front.  However, one of Joey's classmates apparently thought it was funny that Joey liked to pat people on the bottom, and worked really hard to get Joey to to this to some poor young lady today. Naturally, the girl was upset, and the whole incident was reported, and we got a call from our Vice Principal...  ... to tell us how proud she is of Joey, because when this child tried to get him to smack the girl's bottom, Joey said, \"No. That is  not  appropriate!\" and  refused to do it .

{"date": "Friday, February 25, 2011", "body": "\nSo today I put a toaster and a hair dryer into a duffel bag and headed to Joey's school. I think it went OK. The room was both Joey's inclusion class and his self-contained friends, minus Joey and his friend D, who is also autistic. We talked about toast and drying hair and the fact that Joey is learning about toasters just as they were learning about hair dryers. We talked about the fact that Joey was born a hair dryer, and that you can't turn toasters into hair dryers or hair dryers into toasters, that hair dryers are not \"sick\". We talked about communication, and anxiety, and things Joey doesn't do well that his classmates think nothing of doing, and things Joey does well (en chorus: \"MATH!\"), and how one might cope with anxiety and fear when one cannot speak well. We talked about Joey's need for consistency and predictability, and why he might not like sudden movements or loud noise. We talked abut echolalia and ways Joey copes with his world using sound and behavior. We talked about how autism affects Joey (such as speech, movement, and being able to make friends), and how it doesn't (such as intelligence and desire to make friends). We talked about how important they, as Joey's friends and classmates, are to Joey. We talked about why he is good at math and spelling and video games. We talked about why he sometimes needed a break away from people or in a room with a computer. We even had a young lady decide she was curling iron.  One of the Big Questions was \"Does autism hurt?\" It isn't a question I have a ready answer to. I don't know the answer. Does it hurt? How do you define \"hurt\"? Does being overwhelmed and uncomfortable \"hurt\"? Does constant frustration \"hurt\"? When Joey processes sensory stimuli differently, it could very well hurt. He talks about not liking to read because it \"hurts.\" I didn't give a straight answer, but instead talked about ways Joey may feel things and understand things differently than other people. We talked about how it might feel to be overwhelmed all the time. We even talked about what \"overwhelmed\" means. We talked about how Joey uses language and words, and what it could mean when he says something \"hurts.\" It isn't a yes or no question, really.  One of the kids asked if Joey took medication. Mrs. C and I explained that Joey does not take medication for autism, he takes medication for anxiety; that is, he had medicine that keeps him from feeling scared and overwhelmed all the time. Another question was what happens when he doesn't take his medication; and we noted he would be grumpy and anxious, so they would likely notice. However, most people feel grumpy or anxious sometimes, anyway. But it is a hard question to answer; how much do you reveal about Joey without him knowing you are telling people? What will third graders do with this information? Will they tell him to take medicine every time he gets grumpy?  The the biggest question was what to do about all the unanswered questions. I was really pleased that the kids were all very interested in Joey, from the Big Questions to little connections, like asking what video games Joey plays and does he have a Wii? Joey is important to these kids, just as they are important to Joey.

{"date": "Monday, June 06, 2011", "body": "\nIt happens to kids at all ages, all abilities, all over. The snickering. A little knot of kids glances at you, lean together, and it begins. You just know there is something about you that they think is weird, odd, ugly, funny. What really gets you is that they have their own quirks, and would be just as hurt if the snickering was about them.  Some kids get more snickering than others. I remember the snickering myself, the tall fat girl who knew too much. The curvebreaker. The weird kid. It can be very hard to see it so obviously aimed at Joey, to hear what the snickers are: Weird kid. Retard. Fat. Stupid.  Most of the snickering is a passing thing. Like driving along the road, I hardly even notice it anymore, registering as ignorant person is here-snickering-gone-forgotten. The effort needed to interrupt and educate would be seen only as further annoyance, the lesson lost on those who couldn't care less what pain they cause. The weird kid's mother is saying something, but it sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher: \"wa wa wawa waaaaa.\" Yet they stick like little pins, even in good times. Especially in good times.  A child, older, at the Beach Party. Joey said hello. The kid responded off-handedly, then mumbles something to a friend. Did I blanche at hearing those terrible snickers fall from the lips of a child Joey bothered to speak to, called by name? The friend says, \"hey, that's the kid's mother!\" and the kid turns his face to me. There is no point in saying anything, the child might be eleven, he knows his words are not something he would want \"that kid\" 's mother to overhear. I restrain myself to simply glaring at him. He stares back, he doesn't know what to say or do. I pass him to go say something about a picture Joey has drawn. Hint, kid: if you wouldn't want the kid's mother to hear what you are saying, you should be thinking hard about why are are saying it. Or thinking it. Or how you would like it if someone said that about you to someone else. Especially in front of your mother.  Two boys, nine? ten? one might be eleven? playing at the pool. The youngest says hello to Joey. Joey is absorbed in his own activity of shoveling water and barely responds. They move away from him- but if I can hear it, Joey can hear it. Weird kid from school, that's what he is to them. They play a sort of odd play with him-shun him pattern most the afternoon. I'm not sure he notices, he is busy with his own play, and seems unperturbed when they swim away from him after addressing him. He has a friend to play with, a girl with Downs, the boys refer to them as the \"retarded kids\". I probably turn purple. If I get up and fuss at them, would they hear me? Would they care? Would their parents simply back them up? I know these boys, I have seen them at the pool before and the playground, and I know the answers to these questions. Consequently, I save my breath. There are plenty of other kids for Joey to play with, he steers clear of them, he knows.  These aren't run-of-the-mill child-jibes. This is serious. My child is going to have to go through his life dealing with these people, because there are people who believe it is OK to make fun of people with disabilities. They think people like my son are of less value than themselves, or think so little of themselves that they want to devalue Joey in an attempt to inflate their own. People believe that to be disabled is to be broken, to be less, to no longer be worthy of being human, or even having the right to live. People see no value in including those with different abilities and challenges, fail to learn the lessons of understanding, acceptance, faith, perseverance, strength, and hope that my child has to offer- in addition to the lessons he offers in reading, writing, and arithmetic, those all-important school subjects. To so many, Joey is a waste of time, a waste of money, a waste of resources, a waste of breath. Those many miss so much, lost in their ignorance, spreading it to their friends, their neighbors, their children. They don't understand that it is wrong, because they have been taught by our society that it is OK to snicker. Everyone snickers. Everyone gets snickered at. We all learn to just cope with it- ignore them, or worry about them, or poo-poo them, or whatever. What's the big deal?  Those standing in similar shoes as mine know exactly what the big deal is, as we struggle to teach our children to cope, as they don't just \"pick it up\" and are at a loss to defend themselves. The cry of \"get thicker skin!\" is such a sad one, a cry of of despair, one that shows complete ignorance of where I stand or the challenges my child faces. Trying to communicate the problem sounds incredible to those who are ignorant of it. We all get teased, it's what kids do, learn to deal, all kids have to, its a phase, they'll get over it. It is like trying to explain the difference between a tantrum and meltdown. The difference between a picky eater and a neophobe. The difference between a child wanting a toy to hold and a child needing a toy to hold. The limitations of human language become frustrating, but waxing mythic doesn't help. Most people don't want to think about things on the slant, don't want to deal with narrative metaphor. We seem to think it a deficit when autistic people only think concretely, but when non-autistic people can't move beyond the concrete, it's our problem that we can't communicate.  Then they snicker about how stupid  we  are. How's that for weird?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/06/snickers-is-not-just-candy-bar.html", "title": "\nSnickers is not just a candy bar.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 05, 2011", "body": "\nI just did my first 'unfriending' on Facebook. And it hurt. A lot.  I don't just 'friend' anybody. If I have allowed you to look at my life on Facebook, I have very good reason for doing so. However, sometimes relationships come to an impasse. Sometimes you have to let people go.  I got a very acrid message from a \"friend\" about some of my posts about the r-word and short bus jokes. I'll be straight up: not only do I dislike them, flinging about these words and \"jokes\" are very painful for me and for my family. You have the right to say them. That's Freedom of Speech. But I was always taught that with every right comes responsibility. You have the right to say anything you want- so take care when speaking. Use your right responsibly. You may have the right to drink, even to excess, but not to then drive a car. Someone could get hurt.  In recent testing, Joey passed the fourth grade end-of year tests for math. He's in the third grade. He can recite the birthdays of every family member, including ones he only sees a few times a year (and a couple he never sees at all). He reads dictionaries and encyclopedias for fun and comfort. So why does my son ride the special needs bus?  Well, because he has special needs. He has trouble with expressive language, so has difficulty telling us what happens to him during the day, and would have difficulty reporting problems he may have with peers. If he got upset, he might try to bolt, and the regular bus stop is around the corner and out of sight of the house, and no one is required to be at the stop to meet the children. In other words, he is on there for his safety.  Why would I feel the need to justify the safety needs of my own child? He's on that bus because it was decided he needed to be on that bus. He gets to school. He's smart as a whip and does good work when he's there. How he gets there should be nobody's business but ours. However, we've entered the moment where every year, a new variable pops up about his transportation: his social situation.  See, making fun of kids who ride the short bus is socially acceptable. Flinging around \"retard\" and \"short bus\" jokes is common, pervasive, even encouraged by adults. Joey cannot effectively defend himself from these types of jabs, but he feels them. He knows. Those words and jokes have been levied at him, and he's an easy target. And you know what? Even if my child embodied every single thing such jokes and jabs implied, they would be wrong. And you know why? Because my child would still be a fellow human being. Degrading fellow human beings for your own amusement is not only wrong, it's callous and heartless and cruel.  We teach Joey and Andy the importance of treating others the way they wish to be treated. it is a vital life lesson that so often falls by the wayside.  You can say anything you want. Having a right doesn't make it right.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/01/life-on-short-bus.html", "title": "\nLife on the Short Bus\n"},

For two, I didn't go in with a powerpoint or notes about my kid's strengths and weaknesses, drawn up specifically for the meeting. I just took The Notebook.* Apparently, they figured out that when I said Joey is \"good at math\", what I meant was, \"he's frickin'  BRILLIANT  at math.\"  So the principal wandered into Joey's class, mostly to see how he was doing. Often if Joey is having a hard time, and Mr. R walks in, Joey can pull it together and at least get to his desk (kind of like having the CEO come in to your office, even if the politics around there are awful... you do your best to pull it together so you don't get fired). So he sometimes just pops in and checks.  It was math time in the inclusion room, and the class was busily working on a math test. Well, everybody except Joey, who was at his computer. Mr. R immediately asked why Joey wasn't also working on his math test, and Ms. C handed him Joey's test: he completed it in about two minutes, and got a 100% on it.  Yeah, Joey is good at math.  Whatever else I might say or think about Mr. R, he definitely has this going for him: he knew this was Not Right, and that having Joey bored in a classroom would aggravate the problems we're already having. Hence, the meeting today.  The plan is to see where he is in math skills, and get him in a proper math section, even if he has to be in a fourth or fifth grade section. If he goes to a fourth or fifth grade section, he will absolutely have to have his own aide to take him and help him navigate all the non-math stuff that one deals with in a classroom while learning math. As I said to Joey's kindergarden teacher, Ms. S, long ago: It's not the academics that are the problem. It's Everything Else.  It was a really interesting meeting. We were seriously trying to get a general idea of what might happen if he blew away the fifth grade test and needed sixth or seventh grade math instruction. They saw it as a very real possibility. They were serious.  So was I.  *The Notebook contains all the papers, IEPs, letters, emails, etc. for a given school year.

When Joey was little, I often noted to his teachers that he had a huskiness to his voice, a sort of talking-through-cotton sound that other children his age didn't seem to have. I was, for the most part, laughed aside with the idea that that was just his voice. However, Andy does not have this thickness to his speech, despite all the speech issues he has. However, I notice it in many of the kids I meet with dyspraxia; the issues of motor control are coming into play when Joey speaks.  Now and again, and especially when he is doing well and having a really good day/moment, Joey's voice is clear as a bell. In fact, it can be hard to distinguish him from Andy at these moments, even though I know his voice is slightly lower in pitch. When Joey can speak clearly, his brain is moving in synch with his mouth. I also have noticed his language use improves in these moments, though his grammar often takes a slip. He can talk about his toys, or what he did that day, or what is going on in  Poptropica , even over the phone.  When his voice thickens beyond the norm, it is a bad sign. Frustration mounts. His body is not in synch, his language use diminishes (though often his grammar improves...), and it is time for a break. Most likely, he is tired and/or hungry, or otherwise worn thin. It is not the time to press him.  So now my ears are primed, ever listening to the rises and falls in my Joey's day, searching for patterns that coincide with thick and clear.

This might be tricky, since Joey has been something of a lump of anxious nerves since summer started, and part of the idea is to give him some structure. On the other hand, I need to limit expenses, as we need every dime we can put hands on to spend at the beach, since we will be there a whole week.  I thought the highlight of the week should be the Aquarium in Baltimore, but there are few roadblocks to this. For one, Joey has not been riding well in the car, and to ad to his anxiety, my van died. We're in a small neon right now. Two hours in a neon might not be good for the child's nerves. I also must consider he is facing a 4-hour trek to the beach in a week. For two, the aquarium is something of a love-hate thing for Joey. He loves the dolphins, the fish, the mirrors. He hates the dark and crowded parts. Do I risk adding anxiety in hopes that he will have a good time, in face of lots of new and exciting things in a week's time? On the other hand, it may be our chance for the summer to get up there. After we get back from the beach, Joey starts OT camp, and shortly thereafter my classes start. He has been saying he is interested in being a lifeguard, and he loves the dolphin show, and catching his interest might be worth the risk.  I also want to set up a schedule for the day, something I can put on paper and stick to. This is very difficult for us, as life is in constant flux, and things change quickly. I'd like for the days to go something like this:  7-8am: Rise and shine, get dressed and ready for the day.  8-9am: Breakfast 9-10:30 am: Mom works with grandma at the office. Boys get playtime or work on worksheets and reading. 10:30-10:45- Snacktime.  10:45-12:45: Pooltime. (Joey has swimming lesson at 11 on Fridays, so that would be covered).  12:45-2:00: lunch.  2:00-4:00 Camp Time!. (On Tuesdays, we have Speech Therapy at 2, and OT at 3-4, so this would be covered)      *** 2:00-2:30 Science Activity 1      ***2:30-3:00 Craft Activity      ***3:00-3:30 Science Activity 2      ***3:30-4:00 Snack Activity 4:00-5:45- Pool Time.  5:45-6:30- Dinner 6:30-7:30- Boy Relaxation.  7:30- Time to start bedtime routines.  Now I just have to come up with all those activity things. I have some awesome science kits that Mom got for us, so if we don't have to stay too focused on a theme, we should do OK. I also have this odd feeling that I may need to clean my house- space and organization might be helpful. Fortunately, my summer classes are done, so I have a few minutes.

Or what a base is.  3. 11 out of 12 six-year-olds have never played baseball or T-Ball. At least, on our team that is true.  4. The 1 child who has played before still doesn't know the field positions, or what a base is.  5. 11 out of 12 six-year-olds don't own a baseball glove or hat, and therefore must borrow the coach's.  6. Even if you have no idea what a base is, or where to stand, or how to catch, or even to run around the bases, hitting the ball is fun. So as long as everyone gets to hit the ball, we're all good.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/06/utter-chaos-that-is-t-ball.html", "title": "\nThe Utter Chaos that is T-Ball\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 15, 2010", "body": "\nJoey did some pretty amazing things this week.  He looked forward and anticipated both joy and discomfort.  He knew he was anxious, and knew exactly what he was anxious about.  He communicated that anxiety to others- us, Grandma, Ms. Macy.  He helped think up solutions for situations that he anticipated would be uncomfortable.  When he became uncomfortable, he communicated his discomfort to others.  He voiced ideas for relieving his anxiety and discomfort, and communicated what he needed effectively.  When an attempted solution didn't work, he communicated his continued discomfort.  He independently attempted calming techniques to try to alleviate his own discomfort and anxiety.  Can we all hear a collective, \"WOW!!!\"?  Joey and I were at the pool yesterday, as we so often are. The pool was closing at 4 for a swim meet, but that suited us fine- we had to go home and get ready to get Andy. Joey and our Awesome Neighbor jumped off the diving board a few times when we first arrived, then they headed for the shallower water as they got tired.  To my surprise, about 3:30, as I was gathering up our stuff to make room for the folks starting to arrive for the swim meet, I noticed Joey padding his way to the diving board.  That's odd , I thought.  He doesn't usually like to jump in the deep water when we've been here this long already .  As I set my armful of towels down, I watched him step out from the diving board, and thought,  Oh, good job, jumping out instead of just stepping off.   I heard the splash. I heard the cry in his unmistakeable little voice: \"Oh! Help! I'm stuck!\" He was treading the water fine, but not going anywhere, and he was already tired.  Before I could set my legs in motion, the lifeguard was already leaping into the water from his high chair (did I mention how dramatic it is when the lifeguard leaps into the pool from his chair?). As I reached the edge of the pool, Joey was already holding on to the float and almost to the ladder. He climbed out as I profusely thanked the guard.  Then he turned himself, saying, \"Thank you for helping me!\" and he scuttled back to the shallow end and jumped in. The guard laughed.  As Joey leaps out from the safety of the board into the pool of sensory overload and input, I still get that leap of the heart until his head breaks the water again and I watch with amazement as he swims, a beginner paddle and awkward stroke, to the safety of the ladder. Yet sometimes, it's still good to have a lifeguard close by, just in case we get \"stuck.\"  Thank you, Ms. Macy. We love you. We will miss you. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/07/stepping-forward-stepping-out.html", "title": "\nStepping Forward, Stepping Out\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, May 06, 2010", "body": "\nAfter school, it was such a lovely day, we just had to wander over to the park for some serious playtime. There were some families we knew already there, so that was exciting, and I stood around with a bunch of other moms while our kids ran wild over slide and swing.  Its always a little odd to be in a group of \"regular\" moms. This particular group is very interesting, because the women are all so different, and here we are tossed together because our kids run in the same age cloud. One mom is a powerhouse who has her kids in Montessori schools. One is a health nut from South Africa who doesn't believe in vaccinating her child because she thinks it is \"more natural\" for her child to simply get diseases (but she's doing something right- her child is an absolute wonder). One is a hippie-type laid-back mom who doesn't say much, but hears much. The other is a very strict mom who doesn't seem to think her kids ought to get dirty... at a playground... One of them works, the others are all stay-at-home (though I suspect the quiet one is actually a work-at-home). The variety of life experience always makes for interesting insights and ideas bouncing about.  Then there is the odd part. The topics of conversation are odd to me. Working mom had a job interview, hoping her job goes full-time permanent, because she is in the process of a divorce. There was talk about working and giving up work. Having just had an interview myself, we managed to have some common ground there. Then there is the discussions of school activities. Since we have speech on Tuesdays, and the after-school programs require that you attend all sessions, we can't participate in them. Then there was the discussion of packing lunches. This was an extensive conversation about a fancy lunchbox that is divided into a lot of little sections, so you can provide a variety of foods, \"not just a sandwich and carrots!\" The swapping of lunch ideas was mind-bending. Do 8-year-olds really eat sushi and hummus? Does cous-cous keep well in a lunchbox? We're a bit of a sandwich, carrots, and fruit family. I'm not very creative with the lunch thing. Maybe I ought to be. Then the topic of movies and TV... I hate that one. I have never seen  Titanic . I have seen exactly one scene of  Desperate Housewives , and that is because Marlee Matlin is in it. And it didn't make me want to see the show. On the flip side, these ladies have never heard of Buckaroo Bonzai or  Ground Force . They apparently have a book club, but I had never heard of the book.  No one talking about IEPs. Nothing about teachers, services, therapies, or odd behaviors. They let their kids run without even turning their heads to check them. A group of slightly older boys came straggling through, boys that have given Joey a hard time before, and I quickly clicked into watchfulness, and had to intervene. The other moms gave me a Look. There isn't a good way to explain that your kid was about to be seriously abused, and the words you heard suggested the abuse might go physical, and you had to do something because your kid doesn't understand to just walk away, doesn't understand that what was being said to him in that tone was intended maliciously. Also, how can you explain that your child is a little off-kilter because you are not sitting in your usual spot, even though you are in full and clear view?  The little group broke up, probably due to the time rather than my intervention in \"playground politics\". There were goodbyes and exchanging of new cell numbers amongst them, pleasantries. I'm perfectly welcome among them, but definitely different. I have very limited ground to share. I've spent my life that way, so it is nothing new, but it always feels odd.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/05/at-park-part-ii.html", "title": "\nAt the Park, Part II\n"},

Tonight, we are expected to have some whopper storms as the cold front comes through. Tomorrow, wet and chilly. So I decided to take advantage of the sunshine, the warm, and get the boys up out of bed and to the zoo.  Then Andy decided to sleep in, for once. Until 9. If you know anything about the zoo, you know that you kinda need to be there at 8:30 to get a parking spot, which would have meant getting up at 7 for us, the usual time my boys are bouncing into their clothes. So, no zoo. But very rested, very bouncy children. What to do, what to do.  My mom came up with an idea of pure brilliance- one of the parks we don't usually use had some new play equipment up, why don't we grab some lunch and check it out? And I would just like to say, thank you, Mom. Because it was an absolutely glorious afternoon.  We grabbed some sandwiches from the downtown deli, something I don't plan to repeat. They turned out to be expensive and not very good. But kids don't care when there is New Park To Be Explored. Fortunately, I also had chips and sodas in the back of the van, so it was totally awesome. We went down, munched our lunches, and ran around like wild things. The equipment is gorgeous... and dinosaur-themed. Totally. Rocked. Then they discovered there is a little creek running through the park neat the equipment, and that mommy doesn't mind boys getting muddy and dirty, so there were Adventures To Be Had. There were also plenty of kids (we almost didn't get a parking spot there, either!), and I had plenty of little ones to watch and families to be entertained by. I usually do some \"writing\" when we go to the park, but I never managed to get my pen out today, too much to see, so many little ones being so adorable.  When we got bored with that, we took a stroll, and discovered another little playground with slightly older equipment just out of sight- fewer kids, but that meant it was quieter, and it turns out the other kids who had discovered the area were ones that liked playing with my kids. More adventures! More exploration! More bouncing!  We were at the New Park for over four hours. We went through half a case of soda, and would have gone through more if we had taken some on our stroll (which we would have done if we had known there was more equipment). Next time, I'll know to come equipped with water and apples. We'll see how long the charm lasts of having this park in the Regular Visit rotation.  But now, the rain. So tomorrow, the library.

Like a little spoiled drama queen girl who doesn't get her way.  I have a lot of things I am supposed to be doing. Normal, regular things that got out of hand, out of control, and outer space. The fault is entirely my own, because my nature is not the neat and tidy kind. In fact, I think I put pack-rats to shame. When I see a house in worse shape than mine, its A. on TV and B. on a show about how to clean out a packrat nest, and usually involves a team of 3-5 people and a large skip.  Not only am I naturally a disaster, but keeping on top of the pile takes time. Time around here is a tradable commodity. I'm not a stay-at-home mom, I'm a work-around-the-kids'-schedules mom. I put the kids on the bus, grab a shower (usually), check my email and tweets, and hit the road. Mom's office, where I do stuff like track our genealogy research cases, prep manuscripts for publishing, and light cleaning. My classroom, teaching intro art history to a variety of students at a variety of levels of college-readiness (and fewer and fewer of them are college-ready for my college class). If I'm lucky, I might get a few minutes to do some normal errand stuff, like pop into the grocery, or peck at my garden. The weekends are usually dedicated to my essay scoring job. Then I have the guys home, and I try to peck at some stuff. Usually I'm trying to engage them, picking up their toys, or taking Joey to speech (the OT is on temporary* hold), and trying to get Andy to do his homework. I try to sneak in some email and stuff if they get occupied with their own stuff. I'm on a kick to cook dinner better instead of tossing sandwiches, hot dogs, or something from the freezer at the boys and hope to get around to feeding the adults later, because my sugar numbers don't like me eating after about 7, and besides, its better for everybody. However, cooking takes time. Then its bed-time, and Andy still insists someone be in the room with him to go to sleep. Now it's 8:30, which isn't bad, and I have my online classes to do. When I have some time, I read some blogs, and somewhere between 11 and 12, unless my nerves are bad, we get some sleep. I'm supposed to have Fridays off. That's now a big joke around here.  Yeah, I could clean instead of reading blogs. I am aware of that. Thanks.  This last week, I actually made some progress. This is partly because the boys are in school an extra 20 minutes, though that's only translated to about 15 minutes later getting off the bus for some reason. Anyway, I managed to dig out my kitchen table, which I needed to do to support my Cook Dinner Better campaign. I was hoping by this time in the school year, I would have my basement dug out and set up for the boys, my garden mulched, pruned, and ready for spring, and perhaps have made some progress on my guest room, but so far, I've gotten the kitchen table dug out. Kinda. Oh, and the utility strip out front mulched, so I can keep down the dog poo. I need to add the herbal spray that discourages the dogs from using our utility strip as a latrine to my list of things to get at the store. That's about it.  Oh, wait, I actually cooked dinner.

{"date": "Sunday, July 17, 2011", "body": "\n We had our Big Summer Trip today:  the Aquarium in Baltimore!  This is always a big adventure, because it is a long drive, then a trip through dark, crowded places, then an exhausting drive home. In the past, Joey has had trouble dealing with the dark, with the crowds, with the fish, and with the whole overwhelming experience. But this year, we have the return of Happy Joey- so we decided to give it a try. Joey was so excited to be going to the aquarium, he was up at 2 am, singing to me in bed. At 5 am, he was dressed and informing us (who were still in bed) that it was time to go to the aquarium. Yes, he was a little excited.  We left about 6, because we wanted to be there when it opened to mitigate the crowds. Also, we were technically going with Team Stimey, though I got to see Stimey for all of... ten minutes? And I think we had an opportunity to say about three sentences to each other. The Aquarium is an all-hand-on-deck proposition, and all hands were busy.  Both boys were very, very happy once we arrived. They were excited to see fish, they were excited to sharks, they were excited to see turtles. Happy happy boys. That is the way it should be. We took the usual route through the sharks, up through the different waterways to the rainforest and coral reef. We were hoping to make it through the Australia exhibit this time, but no dice, we wore out. At least Joey as very happy through the whole thing, and really took time to look at the fish, not just glance at the cases and cope with the dark and crowd.  We tried at first to stick together, but JoeyAndyDad and I split up at last so Joey could take some breaks and Andy could go ahead and look at stuff and not wait around. Team Stimey came in behind us and we all met up at the top of the Coral Reef. Andy liked to get Joey's attention by grabbing his head or neck, and physically pointing Joey's face where to look. It was effective.  It was wonderful to see Joey actually looking at the fish, not just glancing at them. He would actually watch each case for a while, talking about the fish and animals he saw, noting that fish need to live in water (and couldn't come to his pond...) He was especially entranced by the octopus (no photography allowed of the octopus, but he was AWESOME) and the divers feeding the fish in the coral reef. He also liked to point out turtles everywhere. He was so interested, I am going to fish out some of the book I have bought him about fish and reefs and see if he will look at them.  Andy liked the rainforest and the exhibits about the Amazon basin. There were alligators, rays, and lots of frogs. Even  he  wore out at last, though he wouldn't admit it- he wanted to go see the jellyfish and hang out more with Team Stimey (Andy loves him some Sam!)  Andy was especially fond of the rainforest itself. HE saw it three times- once with Dad, once showing Joey to get him caught up, and one more time with Team Stimey, to get  them  caught up. He's fond of these open aviary type exhibits, seeing the birds fly and everything with no cage separating him from them. He also got to see a sloth and several nice tortoises. Joey was more interested in the parrots.  Andy even got to feed some of the birds- one of the staff gave him some mealworms to put out, and the birds came right up to get them. He was as happy to be able to actually touch mealworms as he was to have the birds come eat them. He saw the Wild Kratts feeding mealworms to aardvarks and was really interested in them, so getting to hold real ones was awesome.  The boys liked the frog exhibits, too. For some reason, Andy was calling the yellow tree frogs \"ninja frogs\", but apparently this added to the charm. Andy also wanted to show Team Stimey the frogs, but mostly ended up fascinated by Sam by the time we got back to them.  Though I didn't get to see them as much as I would have liked, Team Stimey was awesome as ever. We had lunch at the (very expensive) cafe before attempting the coral reef. It was a nice place, because you could see the whole harbor, and watch the dragon-shaped paddle boats skimming about. Apparently there was also a \"ghost boat\" in the water, but I didn't see it.  Finally, it was time to hit the reef. It was feeding time, so there was a diver there talking about caring for the reef and the fish. As I was leading Joey around to see him, a wail went up- alarm! alert! Danger, Mom Robinson!  The problem was that Joey had dropped his totem green sparkly pencil into the water, and couldn't reach it. This was a calamity on several levels- Joey's totems keep him calm, so we really needed the pencil; and we were afraid the fish might try to eat it (or at least the eraser) and get hurt. Andy dashed over to the diver for help; and he kindly thanked us for letting them know so they could get it out of the water, and he sent one of the divers ho was feeding fish to retrieve it for us.  We got to see the diver swim over and rescue the pencil, very exciting. She handed it to Joey, who was ecstatic and thanked her enthusiastically. He then was very excited to see her feeding fish a few minutes later as we descended into the reef.  And while the boys were bouncing about, excited about the diver and the fish and the pencil and everything, Andy lost a flipflop. Yep, it fell right between the grate and the glass of the tank, and landed just about the lighted shark silhouettes- and out of reach. I got a staff member, who kindly went to get someone with a pole. He came back to stand with me while I waited, and apologize for the wait (I must have looked as tired and exasperated as I felt), and tried to make me feel better.  \"Oh, don't worry, M'am; a few minutes ago, someone's kid dropped a pencil in the tank and they had to send a diver over...\"  I had to tell him that was us. I think he got his laugh for the day.  In the end, the flipflop was retrieved, we went to see the dolphins, and all was well with the world. We were worn out, so we hit the gift shop and headed home.

And he grew up fast! Andy: And we get to eat his cake. And blow out his candles because he died. And eat his cake. He had a dream. Joey and Andy: And we don't have to go to school! One of the truly wonderful things about my kids is their acceptance of difference. It partly comes with the territory of being one of the \"different\", but it also is something about just growing up with all sorts of people. Much of the school lesson about Martin Luther King, Jr. emphasizes the racial problems this country experienced. Last year's summary from Joey was that \"Brown people and apricot people didn't get along.\"  I think this is a mistake. The emphasis of early education about Martin Luther King should be an appreciate of others, respect for other people, and acceptance of people for who they are. There should be a lot of lessons about self-worth, dignity, and friendship. We should be entrenching that respect and acceptance. Like so many other cultural norms, the idea of people are who they are should simply  be . The idea of judging another person by their skin color should be a completely foreign concept to these kids.  After all, that is the dream of Reverend King: that we should be judged by the content of our character, rather than the color of our skin. When children are older and more able to grapple with abstract concepts, they can learn the issues of the historical moment, the reasons why this was a dream, and not a reality, when those words were spoken. For the little ones, let's try just having that dream be the reality they live. Let's focus on diversity, not difference.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/01/happy-birthday-mlk.html", "title": "\nHappy Birthday, MLK!\n"},

Currently, I have two little guys working hard to earn their last few stars, because they wan to go to Chuck E. Cheese something frantic. It is scheduled to rain this afternoon, so I am hoping they earn those stars sooner rather than later. Crowds are still titchy things for us.  Yesterday, we were at the park. One of Joey's classmates showed up, a very nice girl, we had seen her and her mom here and there all last summer, but never really gotten to speak with them. Joey and his friend juggled through playing, making concessions for each other so that Joey could call \"Bonnogoes!\"* as he liked, and she got to maintain her personal space. The mom was interesting. The friend isn't vaccinated, and they go to a pediatrician who offers \"holistic practices\" alongside regular medicine. She was surprised that I urged vaccination. She was surprised that I didn't think autism was caused by mercury and heavy metal poisoning. She was surprised that I thought Joey was autistic from birth. In other words, she thought I was crazy as the proverbial loon. But she remained pleasant (why get titchy with a lunatic?), then JoeyAndyDad and I took the two very tired boys home.  Andy has taken to hopping up first thing in the morning, running downstairs, and making sure the fish is still alive. Every. Day.  But otherwise, life goes on.

We come in, and I have a couple of coins left over from last time to distribute while I purchase the new round of pizza and fun. Boys romp off to remove shoes and get playing. I order and find a table to act as Home Base, where I set up shop (including going and finding the removed shoes).  The boys then play until the pizza comes. Then Joey comes and eats pizza, while Andy flits from table to games and back taking fleeting bites of sausage and cheese. When the pizza is gone, we play a little longer, usually about 25 tokens' worth.  Then it is Prize Time. The boys put on their shoes and coats, we clean up, and we take our tickets and ticket slips to the counter. We pick out prizes, and go home.  It works really, really well. It is still a little odd to me to sit and read or write and not know exactly where both boys are at every single moment, but we'll all live through it. I do tend to sit in one of a select group of tables to make it easier for Joey to find me, and easier for me to play air hockey with him without having our coats stolen. It also happens to have the best and widest view of the floor, so I can look up at any given moment and make a good sweep to see where they both are. But anyway...  It was really crowded yesterday. Sunday afternoons are normally a good time, nice and quiet, but yesterday the place was loaded up with  four  birthday parties, and every seat in the house occupied. Madhouse. I ran out of spare coins before I got more, because the registers were down. People were everywhere. I had a ten-minute wait to snatch up a table (which, fortunately, appeared in my select group, yay!), so here came the pizza just as I got set up. Finding boys? Aye-yai-yai. Did I mention there were people  everywhere ?  When there are lots of people in a Chuck E. Cheese, one thing that mysteriously happens is the skee ball balls disappear. I don't know why. However, it is highly annoying to try to play skee ball without the full number of balls. The more tired Joey got, the more frustrated he became with the lost balls. And did I mention how many people were there? Crowds are not a good thing.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 27, 2010", "body": "\n So about every, oh, two, maybe three, years I manage to  get to the beauty shop . When I get there, the first thing I do is chop off my hair. See, I have hair that grows like wisteria up a pine tree. So over once in a while, I cut it off and send it to  Locks of Love . This organization helps disadvantaged children by providing them with prosthetics for hair loss (for example, when children are going through chemotherapy, or when they have  alopecia areata ).  Once upon a time, one of the children attending therapies at the practice Joey had for OT had alopecia areata. She was a darling of a child, and I always remember her mom finally had to pull her out of public school because she was being teased so badly. The child was seven years old. And though I will not invade her privacy by giving you her name, I donate my hair to Locks of Love in her honor. She was a strong, hard-working, sweet child who was a pleasure to know, and I am sure brings joy, intelligence, wit, and all other great things to all who know her. Those kids in the public school who gave her so hard a time that her mother felt compelled to take her out? They are definitely paying a price, even if they don't know it.  As we all try to learn and teach tolerance, we need to really emphasize empathy, and emphasize it from a young age at every opportunity. We are all unique- that is what makes living such a special, wonderful, fabulous adventure every single day of our lives, and beyond.  Locks of Love take all hair donations. With donations of ten inches or more, they can make the actual prosthetics they provide to the children. With shorter donations, they sell the hair and use the proceeds to support the organization and pay for the production of the hair pieces. The next time you head over to the beauty salon, please consider donating. Put your hair in a ponytail holder to keep it neat, place it in a plastic bag, and mail it to:  Locks of Love 234 Southern Blvd West Palm Beach, FL 33405 (They just moved, so be sure to use the correct address!)

{"date": "Saturday, January 09, 2010", "body": "\nThere are stories out there that keep me up at night, wallowing in thought. The story of  Zakh Price  is one of them.  For those of you not aware of this ongoing epic, Zakh Price is eleven years old and just started at a new school in Arkansas this past fall. Unfortunately for Zakh, the school's ignorance about special education practice, law, and purpose now has this disabled child facing felony charges and institutionalization. Needless to say, his grandmother, who is his guardian, is beside herself- and out of money. Lawyers ain't cheap, and going head-to-head with a school like this requires lawyers.  If that's not enough to make for sleepless nights, get this: one of the school personnel involved in the escalation of the situation and pressing charges against this child is the school principal.  I am currently working to start the transition process for my son. Our district has gotten on the trendy bandwagon of separating elementary grades into upper and lower elementary. Now, I know there are lots of really good reasons for doing this, particularly with regular-ed kids. After all, there is a huge difference between a kindergardener and a fifth grader. On the other hand, it makes for a pain in the butt for special-ed kids. We lose consistency in staff and philosophy. You just start getting the kinks out of IEP implementation, and you have to basically start from scratch with a whole new set of people who don't know you, don't know your kid, and may have a completely different idea of what educating your kid even means.  I have emailed the school principal three times. Only two of those emails have apparently gotten through to his office. One, I was told he would call, and he never did. The next was only acknowledged after I pointed out this issue to the director of student services, was again told I would be called, and... never have been. This man clearly doesn't understand why I am concerned and want to get this ball rolling  now . I have been told balls started rolling among the school personnel, but the relationship with me? Not batting 1000, that's for sure. I find that frightening, especially in light of stories like that of  Zakh Price . If the principal is not on board, not trained, not educated, then it clearly is not a priority to that principal- and how can we expect the teachers and staff to be appropriately trained, if such training and understanding are not considered a priority by the principal of the school?  Fortunately- and unfortunately- I have seen some of the special ed staff at this school in action. I have seen excellent teachers. I have seen fair-to-mediocre administrators. I have seen representatives of the school inappropriately railroad a parent in a public forum, and steer a public forum inappropriately to a specific case instead of considering the broader issues involved in that case. Overall, I'm really not comfortable with sending Joey to this new school based on my current observations and conversations with parents in that school. The best teacher on the planet can be railroaded by a mediocre administrator- I've seen it happen first-hand. I know for a fact they have not yet hired the personnel they will need to appropriately understand my son and appropriately support him in regular-ed classrooms. We are not looking forward to the step back we are likely to see if that doesn't change in the next few months.  Yes, the story of Zakh Price keeps me up at night. I fervently believe that we will not have such a dramatic and ugly experience as the Price family is experiencing, but it doesn't need to be so dramatic to still be disastrous.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.examiner.com/x-4959-Special-Education-Examiner~y2009m12d30-Autism-is-considered-a-felony-in-fifth-grade?cid=exrss-Special-Education-Examiner", "http://autismwomensnetwork.org/article/zakhquery-price-and-danger-incarcerating-our-youth"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/01/zakh-price-sleepless-nights.html", "title": "\nZakh Price: Sleepless Nights\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 09, 2009", "body": "\nJust as I often think of Joey as, well,   Joey , and not as autistic or disabled, I often lose sight of the way people around me think. It comes as a bit of a shock that I think so differently from so many people around me- or more exactly, that so many other people think so alike, and I'm not one of them. Perhaps I insulate myself with others who also think differently, so \"different\" becomes the norm; and when I find myself out in the world, the general herd is a bit of a culture shock. Perhaps all those people think differently, too, but it just comes out a bit of a herd.  One night, some time ago now, I stumbled into a book club down the street for an evening, and stayed for the conversation. The book they were discussing, which I had not read because I just stumbled in on a totally different errand, had a scene where a man apparently was holding a child as a servant (or perhaps a slave; it was a little fuzzy to me, but definitely forced service) and the child got sick and had to be put into the hospital, and the man was bemoaning how horrible was was to himself, and why did these things always happen to him?  Appalled? Shocked? I was. I mean, seriously, there is a kid in a hospital sick, and you're complaining how horrible life is to  you ? Get a grip, idiot, right? But this little group went on and on about how honest this portrayal was, how we all felt like that, yadda, yadda, yadda. I thought I was appalled before. I beat a hasty retreat after  that  conversation. Do so many people really think only of themselves?  I don't think  Wuthering Heights  is a great love story. Ditto for  Titanic . I have yet to see an episode of  SpongeBob Squarepants  that I thought was appropriate for children. Neither  Seinfeld  nor  Friends  did anything for me.  Standing at the bus stop, I find myself once again in the crowd. It is an odd feeling. Yesterday, they arrived with their children in neat little outfits, waiting for the bus in the rain. My kids had new shirts and stuff, but I had them in their raincoats. It was  raining . Oh, all those parents had rain gear on; but not the kids. This morning they were chatting about nannies. I had nothing to add to that conversation. I must say they are very nice to Joey, trying to engage him and include him with the other kids. I just find I have very little to say, because I have such a different view of the world than these people are painting.  I sometimes wonder what it must be like to live in a world where the lives of famous people you don't know is so engaging, where what they consider a messy house I find cold, clean, even museum-like; where your shower is number one priority in your morning, not the sound of birds or hugging your children. I have a very hard tim even imagining how such a world works. Perhaps I have gotten used to the chaos. Perhaps to me, life is guided chaos, and we only go around once, so explore all the corners and back niches you can find!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/09/black-sheep-in-snow.html", "title": "\nBlack Sheep in Snow\n"},

I kiss Andy awake, and he curls and stretches, a luxurious kitten. \"Time to get ready for school!\" I sing, and he giggles. I kiss his tummy, and he giggles some more. Then I have to go get Joey up.  That room isn't as dark. Light is creeping in, and his faux fishtank is on, changing colors in a constant loop, red, blue, green, pink, red... I kiss him awake, too. He opens his eyes and smiles, stretching, happy to see me. \"Time for school!\" he chimes. I agree.  We tumble into the bathroom for morning routine. Joey needs help with his shirt. Andy want to toss him underwear in the air. The clothes organizer has helped a lot- we lay out clothes for the week, and they just take Monday clothes out on Monday ad put them on. I hunt down some socks. How do we lose so many socks? I send them down the stairs with armfuls of stuffed toys and pair of socks each.  They busy themselves with socks and shoes, and I put together the day's food. I have things in ready reach, ready to go. I haven't had time to repackage the carrots, so that takes some extra time. This week's fruit is apples, so that saves some. It all evens out in the end. The boys have their shoes on, no one needed help this morning. That's an accomplishment. I praise the shod feet. They are busy drawing while Joey plays  Peep  on his computer. Joey is writing words, his favorite. Andy is drawing a house, and talking about who is in all the windows: Rabbity, Beavery, Chipmunky, Twisty-Twirly Tail, Chris, Smiley Lolly... Its time for coats. We hunt down the jackets we forgot to put away properly when we came home yesterday. Joey gets his own zipper up, all buy himself. That's a  huge  accomplishment. Praise ensues. Andy gets upset because his zipper is being persnickety, and he needs help. Praise ensues for asking instead of screaming. Backpacks are pulled on, and we're off to see the Wizard.  The morning is crisp, and the boys race each other to the corner. Now that I am assured, from practice, that they will go to the corner but not into the street, I permit the race without comment. They bicker about who won. We hold hands and start to cross the street together, but both boys let go and race across from about halfway. It's fall, the street is full of leaves- mostly ones someone has taken care to remove from the sidewalk. The boys commence creating a large leaf pile in the middle of the sidewalk.  We're about halfway through this process when Joey notices that picking up leaves gets your hands dirty. He starts to get anxious. I assure him it is OK to wipe his hands on his pants, because I have nothing to wipe them with, and I would prefer he not wipe them on  me . They get clean enough to calm him, and he resumed leaf-collecting. Then they start jumping on the pile and giggling wildly. I wish I had a camera with me.  They are starting to rebuild the pile when the bus comes down the street. Andy races on without giving me a kiss, excited to see his friend K today. I wave an  \"I love you\"  to him as he settles into the first seat. He sets his fingers, then waves them back the same. The bus is gone. I miss him.  Joey and I amble back to the house, hand-in-hand. He is motor-mouthing the announcement for the buses from the end of the day: \"V van, R rabbit, T turtle, W watch, please *mumble mumble* boys and girls!\" (He actually mumbles in the middle in a very exact imitation of a mumbled and muffled announcement. Its actually pretty cute). Then he looks at me and bursts out with, \"It's fall!\" We cross the street. \"I have a boy dog and a boy cat. They are pretend,\" he explains as he pretends to hold leashes. I pet the new pretend pets. \"The dog is Sy. The cat is Beryl\" he tells me as we wait. I hear the familiar brakes, and give him a kiss. \"I love you, Mommy!\" he chimes as the bus turns the corner. I wave to the bus driver. He is on the bus, settling into his seat. I wave my \"I love you,\" but I'm not sure he even sees me. That's pretty par for the course, actually. I wave anyway. He's gone again. I miss him.  I fetch a broom, wander down the street, and start sweeping the leaves off the sidewalk.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.peepandthebigwideworld.com/", "http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/i_love_you.htm"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/10/good-morning.html", "title": "\nGood morning\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 14, 2009", "body": "\nWhen I realized we were going to have a clear diagnosis for Andy, there were feelings I was expecting. Relief. Understanding. Anger. Even confusion. But I was not expecting to feel like a Diagnosis Newbie all over again. Having to start from scratch, digging up research, trying to track down solid sources and information, trying to understand what this new label was saying about my child, and what it was telling me he needs. Perhaps I am not a complete newbie, though; I certainly know there will be pitfalls and woo out there, and the  first step to avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence .  There is the extra hurdle in ADHD of most the public thinking the label itself is woo. Well, that's just dandy, ain't it? Even among special needs parents, most seem to scoff at the ADHD label. Autism awareness is currently semi-fashionable, and when you say your child is autistic, it is becoming less and less common that you have to defend the diagnosis. With ADHD, it is fashionable to respond with comments such as, \"Well... you know, I think so many kids are over-diagnosed these days...\" or \"What do you expect? he's a boy!\" or \"Well, most kids can't sit still for five minutes.\"  You think autism is an \"invisible disability\"? Try ADHD.  Most of the time, Andy comes across as an energetic, vivacious, happy little guy. Then you learn he's  very  short-tempered. But is it a disability? In most situations in public, does a child need the skills that ADHD kids lack? The problem is when he needs to be to sit, focus, and socialize in semi-closed but not adequately structured and very noisy settings- say, a noisy cafeteria. A bus. A classroom. Have you been in a \"normal\" elementary school classroom lately? If I was five or six, I'd have trouble with the distraction and explosion of sensory input, too. It's like the whole room vibrates with color, imagery, motion. Wow. How is Andy going to be able to sit and listen to a story with so much stuff to  look  at in there? Where does one draw the line between \"distractable\", \"distracted\", and \"ADD\"? Where is the breakpoint between \"energetic\" and \"hyperactive\"?  Because all of these labels are a matter of degree. Even autism. \"Spectrum\" means you can be there and not have it getting in your way (and hence not be \"disabled\")- it is only when it causes trouble that you need a label. Its a fine line between ability and disability.  A generation or two before my own, Andy's energy and vibrance would have probably been an asset. A kid on a farm who gets up early and can go go go just needs a little channeling and guidance, and few prompts to get them into the routine of farm living. My family grew tobacco back in the day (as well as vegetables for the DC markets). You have to get up and feed the horses every morning, or they get hungry. You have to care for the fields, or  you  go hungry. There was structure and expectations and a need for energy and wiry strength and quick intelligence. Andy would have blended in and nobody given him a second thought. Perhaps his room would be messy, and his inability to focus been mistaken for a little laziness, but the energy would have probably made up for it. Heck, my house is a disaster and I'm not disabled.  However, Andy is not growing up on a farm forty years ago. He has to be able to go to school and participate in circle time, walk in a line, eat with his friends, play in a gym. He has to be able to organize his belongings, get to his classroom, and complete his assignments. Listening to a story means you have to be able to sit still and focus on the teacher for fifteen minutes. These are now skills to survive in society. These are the kinds of skills ADHD kids lack. Impulsiveness is not considered a virtue, and is considered a discipline problem rather than a neurological problem (facts be damned).  When you explain to someone that your child has autism, you get looks. Pity is a weird thing, especially when you don't need it. When you explain to someone your child has ADHD, its a different look. Something akin to \"ah... you're one of  those  nutters. Go take a parenting class.\" Yes, they see you as part of the Great Medicalization Cult.  Unfortunately, getting services without a diagnosis is like trying to get a cat to fetch a stick.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dunenovels.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SoTtSyFQXRI/AAAAAAAAC6Q/6Q9b2Q9iPcA/s1600-h/noservice_smallbut.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/08/cult-of-label.html", "title": "\nThe Cult of the Label\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 05, 2009", "body": "\nFriday was quite eventful here. We got to meet  Team Stimey , which was exciting and wonderful; but we also met with a psychiatrist about Andy, on advice from our family doctor, who found his constant motion to be- well, not normal. It was an odd interview, with ups, downs, and both positives and negatives from many angles.  For one, I am a little suspicious of a pediatric psychiatrist with an office that is not designed and prepared for children. There were two overstuffed and cushioned couches, the kind my guys like to bounce upon, and I suspect so would many other children, especially ones with attention and hyperactivity issues (and this psychiatrist is supposed to be a specialist in ADHD). The doctor insisted we have an interview in this room, because it the room always used to interview the family; but being alone, I had to keep the guys with me. I can't imagine I am the only person to walk in on my own with my kids, so I was surprised to find in the room a single plastic table and chair- no toys, no crayons or coloring books, nothing for a child to actually do. Should I assume most five-year-olds can sit quietly on a couch while mom answers a lot of uninteresting questions? That is completely alien to me; I have no idea.  Consequently, my children promptly trashed the two couches. They put on their best display of the  Witching Hour  I could have possibly wished for. With nothing else to do, they turned their attentions to pillows and each other, and the plastic chair. Andy worked steadily to make himself a nest. Joey worked hard to use the same pillows for his own purpose.  The doctor asked Andy to sit on the couch for ten minutes, indicating the clock itself as a visual. I think if there had been a  time timer  available, we would have had better luck, but the fact that he couldn't even sit for  two  minutes was pretty impressive for the doctor.  And then I got a taste of how biomed parents must feel when sitting in a doctor's office explaining their experience. The doctor turned attention to Joey, and pronounced him an Asperger's child. When I explained his diagnosis was classic autism, not Asperger's Syndrome, we got into a bit of a heated debate on the matter, because Joey is so obviously social. This, according to this psychiatrist, precludes a classic autism diagnosis, because autistic people \"don't like to socialize.\" I noted that this was not my experience; the autistic children I had met were very much interested in social interaction, but had communication and sensory issues which prevented them from doing so in a fashion that was expected. When  Yale  and  Princeton  ere shoved in my face, I tried to graciously back off the subject by noting that yes, my evidence was certainly anecdotal, and I would indeed be interested in the studies the doctor had participated in, though it would be difficult for me to draw a conclusion without actually meeting the subjects; and after all, we weren't here about Joey. We were here about Andy.  I find it concerning that people in an institution such as Yale would make that most greivous and discriminatory assumption, that a person who is not responding to you doesn't  want  to respond to you, rather than that they may be  unable  to respond to you. It is hand-in-hand with the idea that a non-verbal person has nothing to say. Prove to me that this person doesn't want to be social. Take out the sensory issues, the communication issues, and the frustration from being repelled themselves, and show this to me. Because honestly, it is not what I have seen. The autistic kids I have encountered, when given appropriate opportunity, have all shown interest in social contact... though often not in ways society might expect. Society doesn't expect a child to play with a stranger's hair, or say things at apparent random, or hit them. Yet these can all be attempts at contact, at social connection.  Meanwhile, back to the children destroying the office. Joey was removed from the equation briefly, but apparently the improvement was not considered significant. With Joey's return, the situation exploded. Andy even bit Joey, upturned the plastic table, and kicked at me. I haven't seen him that bad in a long time. Yes, we were in rare form; but certainly this is critical moment when we need advice and help! The doctor did not beat about the bush, they wanted to know what steps I had taken to get him help. I explained that I had been through Child Find twice already, and been told he was fine; I had moved him to his school to give him more movement and opportunities for heavy work and sensory self-regulation. Also, I had presented a letter from my private OT with accommodation recommendations, only to be brushed aside. The doctor was, to be gentle and reserved in my words,  appalled . Why had I not been given an IEP? (and I did not appreciate being upbraided about it, especially after I had just said I had been through Child Find not once, but  twice .) I think the doctor was just as appalled that no one in the Child Find had picked up on the problem.  Because according to the doctor, Andy has a very severe case of  ADHD . Severe enough that the doctor wrote a letter to present to the school to that effect, and  STRONGLY  (with double underscore and large letters) recommending Andy have an IEP- and didn't charge me the usual $35 for it.  There were bright and encouraging points in this conversation. First, the doctor wants to avoid medication if at all possible. They even impressed upon me more than once that the school had no right to tell me to medicate my child, they had to provide appropriate accommodations with they assumption that he would  not  be medicated. I got the feeling this was a common problem, and I was actually glad to have this emphasized. The doctor wants to do nothing at all until October, so that the school is forced to deal with Andy as-is and discover his needs and challenges.  I have no intention of waiting two months for Andy to get appropriate educational accommodations. I intend to take the letter to the school Monday morning and make a formal request for another evaluation. Maybe someone will get the idea that I am not nuts (as I am sure they consider me right now). Well, maybe \"nuts\" is too unprofessional; \"pushy\"? \"demanding\"? \"crazy as a loon\"?  Am I concerned that we had a diagnosis of ADHD because we went to an ADHD specialist? A little, considering some of the other issues we encountered at the office. So JoeyAndyDad and I have done what we always do when presented with something we feel we are completely ignorant of: we have started to do the research. I'll keep you posted as to what we find when we get an idea of where to look things up (ie, when we've gotten a good bit beyond our Google PhDs and into real materials). I also will be taking a copy of my letter to our family doctor, and see what information I can get there. I may even contact Kluge. But again, I am left with a lot of questions, not the least of which is, what is the connection between ADHD and sensory processing disorder, and the autism spectrum?  But I have a lot of hard questions to be asking the school first, and I want answers,  now .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.timetimer.com/", "http://www.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/", "http://www.pcdi.org/", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/adhd/DS00275"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/07/little-understanding-preparing-war.html", "title": "\nA Little Understanding: Preparing the War Paint\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 29, 2009", "body": "\nWe're having an interesting issue with Joey's speech therapy. He's been saying he doesn't want to see Ms. Nikki (his private therapist). Is this just part of him being tired from school and his tummy troubles, or are we seeing some therapy fatigue?  We're toying with the idea of going with a shorter session with a new therapist. Nothing against Ms. Nikki (who brought this to my attention and said she is not offended, it happens), she has really been working OK with Joey. Perhaps a new face, with some new things to do and approaches to try, will bring some novelty and fun back into speech therapy, which may seem too much like work as he gets older.  However, I think we ought to consider some of the other issues we have seen with the move to the new office. For one, there s now a mini-office in the therapy room- a desk with a computer and files and things. This computer has been causing a lot of headaches, and I think it is a serious distraction for him. The old rooms in the old office were just rooms, they didn't have the computers and things in them, and I think that worked better for Joey. Also, a lot of speech therapy seems to involve tables, instead of using the whole room and activity to promote speech. After sitting in school all day, Joey may not be too keen to sit around another room doing more table-top stuff for another 40 minutes.  One thing about the OT is though there is a general structure to the sessions (half fine-motor in the \"small room\" , half gross-motor in the \"gym\"), every session is a surprise. What will they make? What games will they play? What will they do? Our OT has a knack for trying new things, mixing up new activities with old favorites. There is a sameness to the speech therapy, you sit at the table and talk about what you did today, and work on asking and answering questions. This has been pretty effective, actually, but it may be getting old as he masters these skills in a basic way.  So what to do? Speech is a definite issue, and his oral communication is still seriously limited. His use of language still needs to be addressed so he can function and communicate with his teachers and peers. As nice as it might be to think the world will learn to speak Joey, its definitely not realistic. Right now, we're weighing the options, and making sure this isn't really about him just feeling bad in the afternoons; but I think a little freshening up might be in order.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/06/thought-on-speech-therapy.html", "title": "\nThought on speech therapy\n"},

{"date": "Friday, May 22, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the great joys of having children are all the things you learn from them. They can teach you a lot about dealing with life, people, and reality; they bring you a breath of youth and new eyes.  1. People do things for a reason . No matter what you think of another's actions and words, none of it comes  ex nihilo . That kid tantruming in the store aisle? That's not random. Is the child tired, hungry, bored, overwhelmed? That adult tantruming in the store aisle? That's not random, either...  2. Don't judge people without knowing those reasons.  Overreaction, or inappropriate reaction, makes everything worse. Even the Witching Hour has a reason- tired, overwhelmed kids excited about the day and seeing each other easily turns to bickering, whining, and hitting.  Distract  and  Engage  works far better than Yell Until your Throat Is Sore, and is far less traumatizing for everyone involved. Assuming someone is \"just spoiled\" or \"being unreasonable\" leads to trouble. This screaming is reasonable to the child; it is our job as a parent to sleuth out the reason and work on the cause, rather than trying to just treat the symptoms.  3. Let them be in control sometimes . This one is very hard on me, much harder than I was expecting. If you don't let kids have control, they don't learn how to do for themselves. Yes, it is faster and easier for me to make the peanut butter sandwich, zip the jacket, and water the flowers. However, it is important for Joey and Andy to learn to make their own lunch, zip their own clothes, and care for our garden and world. Assuming competence includes allowing them to practice and demonstrate that competence. Oh, and if you let a child have control of a hose, they  will  spray you. Just saying.  4. There is a whole person in that package . My folks used to say this about babies all the time: \"There's a whole person in that tiny little package!\" But it is true. Your children are not you. They are their own people. Its one of those lessons you have to learn on your own, no one can tell you (no matter how many times they tell you). These boys are two very different people. As I told the school folks on registration night, Andy isn't Joey, or even Joey's twin; he's a compliment. Joey is laid-back, Andy is a firecracker. Raised in the same house by the same parents.

{"date": "Friday, May 01, 2009", "body": "\n How important is language? How important is it to be able to speak?  I had a student in my college courses with a processing issue. They needed supports for auditory processing. They also proved to need supports for language. This was a smart person who could communicate; but I soon realized that although the speech was clear, I was doing a lot of the connecting and fill-in-the-blanks and word-order-untangling for them when they spoke in class. Because my own son uses odd word order, I did it without even thinking. I know exactly what the student was saying, and it was really wonderful; and in my lecture style, I automatically translated for the other students, because I often re-word what students say to give them appropriate and more exact vocabulary. No one thought the student was stupid, or not an asset to the classroom in any way. However, when I got that first paper, I was in for a shock. Also like my son, this student wrote exactly as they spoke- with odd word order, slightly misused words, and jumbled thoughts. I started paying attention to how the student spoke; and beyond the crystal-clear annunciation, it was exactly what I was seeing on paper. We worked hard on that writing, but there is really only so much I can do as a professor and three writing assignments.  My sons do not speak clearly. Neither of them. Joey has a sort of stuffiness to his speech, like he is trying to speak with a mouthful of bubbles. It was a lot worse when he was just getting started- it probably has to do with controlling his mouth and facial muscle tone. Then, though I compared my student to Joey, Joey's word jumble is a lot worse. I expect all this to improve as we work hard on it, with speech therapies and occupational therapies, his muscle tone and tense use and word jumble will improve. But will it ever be enough? Will he be able to get through a college class if he wants to?  And what about Andy? All of his substitutions and rapid pace has been determined by the school to be \"normal\"... but none of his classmates sound like this. Once we figure out what he says, it is clear that language is not the issue; but will people assume he is not intelligent because they can't understand what he is saying?  The answer, as we know from adults we know with speech issues, is yes. Speech is very much taken as a cue of intelligence. It is one of the social cues our society considered important. We forget how culturally determined those social cues are; and it is important to remember when we are trying to teach our autistic kids how to see and read social cues!  How we consider others is culturally determined. How we view others is culturally determined. How we communicate with and about each other is culturally determined. How we treat others is culturally determined.  And we can- and should- change culture. A culture where people are valued for who they are and what they can do, instead of devalued for what they can't, is a culture that can build and move forward in solving problems and functioning to everyones benefit. A culture of respect for other people means less crime, less violence, less bigotry; and so more exploration of life, more enjoyment of each other, and more understanding of the world- even universe- around us.  Move beyond the social cues, to consider the possibilities of the people around you. Some cues are useful. Some, in reality, are not. Just because a person cannot speak doesn't mean they cannot think. Or feel. Or be.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2009/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/05/blogging-against-disabilism.html", "title": "\nBlogging Against Disabilism\n"},

Frustration and boredom are terrible enemies to learning, progress, and development.  What can be especially dangerous is in the push to get gets \"mainstreamed\", intellectual gifts can be used to end much-needed special education services, or can mask special needs in the controlled settings of the classroom.

Students start to cuss you out, especially online (hint: don't start snarking me on Rate My Professors until AFTER the grades are turned in. I can kinda tell who you are by what you complain about.)  Funny, but the vocally negative students are the ones you wanted to smack upside the head most of the semester. Who continues to read a book after the professor finishes roll call and steps forward to start the lecture? Who goes three weeks into a semester without either buying the textbook or locating it in the library, and thinks this is a legit excuse to have deadlines extended? What is the point of being a good teacher if people are going to complain that you actually expect them to do work, and do it by the due date. Do these kids really think their future employers are going to accept unproofread work, or late work? Talk about the fast track to no where- or more likely, the unemployment line.  And hey, our new department head seemed really happy with the student reports about my teaching, so much that she mentioned it at a faculty meeting... but it looks like I'll have fewer classes in the fall. How does  that  work?  Someday, I will get a real job. That day is coming. I can feel it. I was kinda hoping it would be at one of these local colleges, actually, because I grew up here. This is home, and I want to really be adding to it. But if this is the way it is going to be, maybe a change in career is in order.

He became enamoured with a spaghetti squash, so I bought it for him to try. (Hey, any of you know what to do with a spaghetti squash? Because I haven't the slightest clue.) Even later, when he was screaming for some other thing, and he could have the sweet or the squash, he decided he wanted his squash.  I'd love to be able to write a long, wistful post about how many vegetables my kids eat a day, but I really can't. Usually, getting Andy to eat dinner at home is a battle. The only place he consistently eats is Grandma's, where he will eat from the time I leave him to go teach, until the time I pick him up. Granted, I usually leave him with a supply of ham, strawberries or grapes, and Cheetos. Not vegetables. But there you are. Joey likes vegetables OK, but the on;y one he really goes out of his way for is broccoli.

She just hasn't been a good fit for my child, and perhaps that is as far as I should now discuss the matter. 35 minutes less there means 35 minutes somewhere that  will  be a good fit. Specifically, he will get extra 1:1 time working on language arts, social skills, and subjects he needs extra support on, such as social studies. Time is a funny thing for Joey. He is fascinated by clocks, analog and digital, and by time and telling time, and has been for over a year. However, the idea of  past  and  history  completely elude him.

He is good at knowing where he is supposed to be when, but asking him what he did last week-  issues .  Joey is usually very good with change, as long as he has a clear idea of what is expected when the change comes.

She was busy outside her hole, digging up reports, franticly reading articles and books, and trying to find out what her baby bunny needed to be successful in school. As she was looking through all of her papers and books and websites, an administrator fox came up to the rabbit with jaws open wide.  \"Haha!\" said the fox, \"I am going to eat you up!\"  \"Oh, please, Mr. Fox, don't eat me yet,\" the rabbit pleaded. \"I just need to get through this IEP meeting so my baby bunny will get the services she needs to be successful at school.\"  \"Oh, hoho!\" the fox replied. \"I won't fall for that. You'll never get the services you need, because there isn't enough money in the school to pay for them!\" \"But the law says budget concerns cannot be used to turn a student down for services. Besides, these services will save the district money in the long run. Come on down into my hole, and I will show you all the calculations I have done to prove it.\"  The fox was incredulous, but he followed the rabbit down the hole. He was never seen again.  A few days later, the rabbit was again busily preparing for the IEP meeting. She was surrounded by letters from specialists, generalists, and therapists. She had three-ring binders stuffed with paperwork, carefully organized. She was working on a powerpoint presentation about her baby bunny's needs, strengths, and supports. As she was busily preparing, a school coyote appeared from the bushes with mouth open wide.  \"Haha!\" said the coyote, \"I am going to eat you up!\"  Oh, please, Ms. Coyote, don't eat me yet,\" the rabbit pleaded. \"I just need to get through this IEP meeting so my baby bunny will get the services she needs to be successful at school.\"  \"Oh, hoho!\" the coyote replied, \"I won't fall for that. You'll never get the services you want, because we can't hire any more personnel for the school year, and we have no one qualified to provide these services!\" \"But the law says you need to provide an appropriate education in the least restrictive environment,\" the rabbit explained, \"These services are needed for my bunny to participate in an appropriate environment. Come on down into my hole, and I will show you all the data I have collected to prove it.\"  The coyote was incredulous, but she followed the rabbit down the hole. She was never seen again.  The following week, the rabbit was sitting on her front porch, having a glass of wine, waiting for little bunny to come home from school. Her friend squirrel saw her and stopped to chat.  \"How did the IEP meeting go?\"squirrel asked politely, and prepared for the onslaught of commentary. But Rabbit smiled broadly and offered her friend a celebratory glass of wine. \"The meeting was great, We got the services little bunny needs, and she is already doing much better at school. Come down and have some wine!\"  So squirrel followed the rabbit into her hole, which though not exactly tidy, was comfortable enough. To one side of the cozy living room was a pile of fox bones. To the other side was a pile of coyote bones. And in the back, stretched out in front of a cozy fire, was a large Advocate Lion.  Moral of the story: the schools may give you all sorts of crazy reasons to not provide services, even if you do all the work to prove the services are needed. What really matters is having the right advocate/lawyer on your side.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/01/for-stimey.html", "title": "\nFor Stimey\n"},

Good news- we've been brushing their teeth with those motorized toothbrushes- the only ones they will let us put in their mouths- and it has paid off. No cavities! I think they actually had a good time, but I'm not sure. I wasn't allowed to go with them. I did warn them about they guys when I made the appointments, so they were prepared. Also, I only use the dentist office I know to be the best in town- not just the great dentist, but great support and reception staff. If you're in this area, there is no other place to go.  The boys got balloon dogs as rewards. They of course promptly popped, causing some natural melty episodes. However, I think they left with a positive dentist experience.

However, we can now take down the fall decorations, and get ready for the sparkles and twinkles of Christmas to be upon us!

Think that is the #1 Google search today? I have less turkey left than I expected- partly because the cats broke into the container I had packed for Evan while I putting the boys in last night, and ate every last scrap.

Joey got to go see the classroom yesterday while everyone was at \"specials\". He got to see his desk, and explore the room a little, and talk with Ms. Sc about math.  I admit, I was a little nervous. I have an email from Mrs. A to the effect of \"His new schedule means he can't get his sticker for Word Wall in here.\" The tone was crisp, though I don't know how intentionally. Now, personally, if I had a student who was being moved out of my classroom with no real preliminaries- just \"he's going!\" I think I would want to think about my attitude. I would at least want to say something like, 'I'm glad Joey is doing so well that you want to move him into an inclusion setting for more time- hope he does great there!' Perhaps that is how I was raised. You acknowledge stuff like this. I'm certainly not any more comfortable with the time he has remaining with this lady. Does she care? She doesn't even care enough to get creative and find a way for him to get his Word Wall sticker.  Joey came home from school in after-school mood, so I let him relax a few minutes before bombarding him with questions about his day. The smile when I asked if he met his new teacher was worth the wait. He told me he saw his classroom, and talked with Ms. Sc, and that he is very happy and excited. We're telling him the truth of it- he is doing so well at math that he needs to join the new class and new friends, and have a new teacher. He seems mightily pleased.

{"date": "Sunday, November 02, 2008", "body": "\nWhen I was young, my Dad had a knack for making weekends miserable. Yes, we went and did some fun things. But any time fun was in the cards, my Dad would go nuts about every little thing we did wrong. Shoes in the hallway? Commence yelling. Rooms not cleaned? Commence yelling. Over-excited children getting a little excited? Commence yelling. Everyone was miserable before we could go have fun.  And I have fallen into the negativity trap.  We've been having some sketchy weeks, which means my nerves are frayed. I wonder now if these weeks are not the result of falling into the trap. When one makes it a constant struggle to get through the day, it wears on everyone's nerves.  So I would like to take out this moment of this post to thank my Mom. I still have so much to learn. Growing up, my mom made life positive, even when things seemed to be upside-down. She may think she needs to stay out, to not say anything when I'm doing things she wouldn't do in raising my boys. Fortunately, she's also a good friend and  does  say something. The boys may not be her children, but I  am . I'd rather she told me if I am doing something stupid.  And making holidays a negative experience is definitely in the stupid range.  Now, we  have  a system for working on behavior issues. If the boys are good all month, they get to go to Chuck E. Cheese. They have three \"checks\" over the day, which is a little stretched by the addition of \"yellow light\" and \"red light\" (so we weren't giving two checks for the same incident- and it gives the guys a little but of warning that something is wrong). Hitting and biting have no lights, just checks. So they earn their privilege.  Hence, holidays shouldn't be in the list of things to earn. Trick-or-treat is just a given. Thanksgiving dinner is eaten. Christmas morning comes (despite the general cultural threat of \"be good or Santa won't come!\"). Easter baskets appear on Easter morning. Fireworks light up the night on Fourth of July. These things are non-negotiable.  Instead of my father's, \"Be good or no trick-or-treat!\" (Can we believe that came out my mouth? And not just once! No parent of the year for me!), the more effective and positive method I'm going adopt is my mom's \"Distract and Engage.\"  Distract the kids from the unwanted behavior (like \"Don't touch me!\" and smacking on each other) by engaging them in positive conversation or activity. When we started getting bored with putting up porch decorations, Mom had me fetch coloring books. When the guys, excited and giddy, started pushing each other's buttons in the car, she had them talk about trick-or-treat: what treats did they want? What costumes would other kids wear? What was their favorite part of Halloween?  No, the pinching the poking did not completely cease. The whining did not completely cease. They remains excited and giddy. But it was positive. It made them think about what was ahead. It kept them engaged in the excitement and happiness, rather than devolving into anger, frayed nerves, and resentment. It gave them focus on the joy and celebration.  And after all, that's what holidays and fun trips and adventures are all about.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/distract-and-engage.html", "title": "\nDistract and Engage\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, October 28, 2008", "body": "\nOne of the problems with relying on standardized testing to determine whether children are being educated is that \"standardized\" and \"individualized\" are extreme opposites. Even with non-disabled children, you learn more about their ability to take a test than any material that may be on that test. And I grade standardized writing tests for a living.  Joey is a whiz at math. Hey, its numbers, how hard can it be? Numbers, with predictable, unwavering rules and answers! No problemo!  Joey is not a whiz at language. He has a lot of difficulty with expressive speech, he has some issues with connecting events and scanning (just try to ask him to find anything, such as a toy he left in the kitchen).  Word problems can pose a challenge to all sorts of people with language and processing issues. The ability to analyze a statement and glean relevant information is something I have college students struggling with in my classes. However, in standardized testing,Joey will be expected to look at a word problem and come up with the answer. Just like that. It isn't that he can't do it- it is the time it takes him to do it. Not only do you have to answer correctly. Next grading period, he will also have to do it fast.  A little flashback: when I was in fifth grade, we took tests to determine which math and reading sections we would be in. Those of you who were not in the nerd crowd in fifth grade may not realize the consequences of taking those testing and ending up in the wrong section. You were already a social pariah; being a misfit even among misfits was like finding yourself a  reindeer with a stupid glowing nose on the Island of Misfit Toys . It was social and academic ruin.  These tests were not just about getting the answers right- you had to get them fast. In the end, kids who finished the test, even though they got questions wrong, were rated higher than kids who got everything they did right, but didn't finish. So I, already teetering on the brink of Extreme Nerd-dom, was pushed over the precipice. Every question I answered was correct. I just wasn't fast enough. I spent the entire fifth grade bored to tears in the second-tier math section. It wasn't math that was the problem. It was processing and writing.  Therefore, I hate timed math tests.  Meanwhile, Joey needs to learn to do word problems, or suffer the same fate, only worse, because what he really needs to do is be in the second-grade math class, not piddling about in some second-tier first-grade math class. But we have to prove it via standardized test- his classwork isn't enough. Especially when he is being assigned \"P\" grades* in math, despite his  boredom .  So we (his case manage Mrs. Huff and I) swung into action, and called his speech therapist, Ms. Nikki, to help. And here is what happened:  Ms. Nikki, being a genius, explained to Joey that word problems were like little stories, and playing a game of \"Blue's Clues.\" He needed to find all the clues in the story, put them together, and answer the question.  She then gave him some word problems, and showed him how to \"find the clues\", how to figure out how to put them together (creating the abstract equation- are we adding the numbers or subtracting them?), and then how to \"answer the question\" (such as \"how many more...\" or \"What is the total...?\") Not only did he learn to do it himself by the middle of the session, he was having fun, he was proud of himself for figuring it out ( he's really smart !), and he understood what he was supposed to be doing.  She gave him something to connect to, and understand what was expected. She used his love of reading (stories!) with his love of  The Mighty Striped Man  and his Blue Sidekick, and got him to really be interested in what he needed to be doing. I bet we have very few problems with those word problems- unless being timed gets him.  *In our school, the lower grades do not get ordinary grades. They get \"S\" (Satisfactory), \"P\" (\"Progressing with Effort\") and \"N\" (\"Needs Improvement\"). So this lady spent our meeting telling me how great he was doing and how bored he was with the math, then basically gave him the grade of \"C\" for his math.

We would catch him, hug him tight, and then just hold on until he said (usually through his giggles), \"Let go, please!\"  Now he uses this phrase whenever he is done playing with us, and is ready to move on. Andy does, too. And we always let go, even if we aren't really done hugging yet (is one ever done hugging a boy?) The purpose of this exercise was multi-fold. It provided Joey with words to end a situation and control his environment. It encouraged him to talk and use words. It provided the lesson that words have meaning. Words are tools, and used correctly, have results.  In some ways, self-advocates are just now starting to garner words and expect results. This is partly a \"Horton Hears A Who\" effect- you need enough people using words at once for people to hear you. And it is partly because improvements in interventions, supports, and communication skills among persons with disabilities- particularly communication disorders- is improving at a rate that many new voices are being added to the chorus.  It is a sad comment on society that people are not protected unless they yell loud enough to be heard. But there it is. We add our voices to the cry: \"We are all unique! We are all human!

You can get an idea of it  here  and  here , as well as  here . Most of us would rather go to the dentist and have our wisdom teeth out without novacaine than go to an(other) IEP meeting, but you know without you in that room, your child doesn't have an advocate.  And it is the attitude that would otherwise leave your child to the wolves that makes attending the meeting so painful.  Some of the challenges and responses and run-arounds to try to deny our kids their needed supports, services, and rights are so common, they become well-known jokes, t-shirt slogans, and bumper-stickers. In fact, we have a  \"Pop-up IEP\"  webpage with the common obstacles and suggested responses! How sad is  that ?  Folks, kids with disabilities were being so abused by our society, we had to enact laws to protect the rights they should have had simply as fellow human beings and citizens. The fact that schools and government personnel still seem to want to circumvent those laws and deny their fellow humans and citizens their rights is frustrating, aggravating, horrifying, depressing, and traumatizing. This is what special needs parents go through at least once a year; often more, because that IEP you set up in May probably needs to be revisited in September, and with us, December and March are also good times to take another good look. And every time you walk into that meeting, you are in the Danger Zone. We've been lucky these last couple of years, and our case manager has been supportive of Joey and his needs. The couple of years before that, we weren't so spoiled, but we weren't faced with the extreme horror stories we hear from other parents across the country, and when faced with what we still believe was an attempt at active sabotage, we held our dignity and got through. (The one time  I didn't hold my dignity , it turned out all right- we ended up with our wonderful case manager and para).  IF you need some of those bumper stickers and t-shirts, allow me to recommend  The Parent Side  and my own  Joeymom's Autism Awareness Bazaar .

Said boys splashing in the tub, splashing, having a good old time, while Dad struggles to wash and dry them while keeping at least half the water in the tub, before dressing Joey and Andy. Lately, there have been a lot of complaints- about the water (too hot, too cold, sometimes simultaneously), the drying (\"I don't like that, that hurts\"), and the dressing (\"I don't want to\", meaning they want to either be naked or wear their day clothes). Enough, I said. So, with only one night's notice, the boys are now responsible for actually undressing, bathing, drying, and dressing. Are you cringing yet? Joey was my first victim. I explain what he's going to do, and he begins stripping down. He gets into the tub as asked and turns the water on. Then he looks at me. This is where I usually step in and do it all. I say 'Is the water the right temperature?' It isn't, so I explain how to adjust the temperature, which he then does. 'Are you ready to wash your hair?', I ask. He is, so I explain how to get the sprayer turned on (shower head attachment). \u00a0I talk him through wetting his hair, hand him the shampoo bottle, and talk him through the rest of the process. No fingers were lifted in the washing of this child. He decided when he was done- about five minutes later, got out, and I handed him the towel and told him to pick out his pajamas. He dried himself off, then took his pjs to his room and got dressed. Joeymom was still working with Andy- something about counting to 10. He was struggling to do it in order, I think just being persnickety. So, having discussed Joey's summer reading list (which has heretofore gone unread) last night with Joeymom, I hunt down an eligible book and hand it to my big boy and have him start reading. It was  Strega Nona . He got about a third of the way through tonight. Andy did very well, too. He needed some help with the spray attachment- the bathroom walls are still dripping, I think. But overall, it was a smashing success. The real trick will be making this last, and then we can move on to brushing teeth, which should be a snap after all this. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strega_Nona"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/08/bath-time.html", "title": "\nBath Time\n"},

Listened to some sound bites. Now my question is, \"what is he  talking  about?\" I'm in an odd position here. Since I am active in the special ed community, the local autism community, and am the chair of parent sped advisory committee, I have a fair grasp of the kids who have diagnoses of autism, and even a few who are probably autistic, but haven't been diagnosed. I spend a lot of time sitting around OT and SLP offices, and see a lot of kids with ASD diagnoses go through. I haven't met a single child with an autism diagnosis (including PDD-NOS and Asperger's Syndrome) who are not ASD.  Not one.  And what money? Most of these kids are trying get through with what they can. The school tells them its a medical problem. The medical folks, especially insurance, say its an educational problem. There is no magic \"autism pill\" out there. Most of these kids muddle through attempts to gain skills with whatever the schools begrudgingly dole out to them, and I assure Mr. Savage, that ain't much.  You know, I have a lot of people who tell me Joey isn\u2019t \u201ctruly\u201d autistic. He can talk. He can display emotion and form relationships. He can do a whole myriad of things I am told autistic children don\u2019t do. But guess what? He\u2019s still autistic. Spend a whole day with him. Watch him in a room of non-autistic children. If he never screamed in frustration again, he'd still be autistic. Clearly, demonstrably autistic.  How many times have I seen him next to non-disabled peers and have it really hit me in the face, in the stomach, in the heart how disabled he really is? And it hits so hard because most time, I don't really think about it. I'm too busy enjoying and praising and seeing all the wonderful things he can and does do, all the ways he is beautiful and wonderful and able.

{"date": "Friday, July 18, 2008", "body": "\nThis was my first morning with Joey; the first week of ESY 2008 has come to a close. We were thinking of going swimming, but my trainer kicked my patookas yesterday, and walking, rising, or sitting sets my thighs on fire. Four ibuprofens haven't touched it. Tylenol? A joke. I have a high pain tolerance. I'm a lady who got through her first c-section on Advil, not Percocet. Swimming was out.  However, I had some things to mail, so I thought a trip to the post office would be good. Joey's been talking about post offices lately, and his new re-interest in Blue's Clues includes Mailbox. So off we went, to chat about the post office.  Most of the short trip was a barage of questions from me (\"What do you do at a post office? See what Mommy has? What are these? We're going to send these thing to other people-  mail  them. We pay to have them  taken to the other people. See the postman print out the stamp?\") with only grunts, deliberate silence, or sullen \"I don't know\" in response. This was not going well. So I decided to switch to letters instead. Mailbox gives letters to Steve. People write letters. They tell other people all the news and all about themselves. Would you like to write a letter? Who would you write a letter to? Dexter? Andy?  Max and Charlie ?  Joey perked up. \"Want Max and Charlie.\" I finished up my business and persued this interest.  \"You want to write to Max and Charlie?\" \"Want to see Max and Charlie.\"  \"You want to see them? You want to visit?\"  \"Yes.\" Alrighty, then. Into the car, we're off to see Max and Charlie. I'm worried he might be thinking of his cousins, one of whom is also called Charlie, but when we get to Aunt Christina's, he goes over and says hi to Max and Charlie. He wanted to see them. Then he plays with Jack, their younger brother (Jack and Joey were in the same class at one point).  Why is this amazing? For one, Joey doesn't often communicate what he wants. He tends to go with the flow and take what comes. This is especially true in activities. For two, we haven't actually gone to play with Max and Charlie in months. We haven't even played with Jack in a long time. It was probably around Christmas when joey saw them last. Finally, having a playdate with Max and Charlie is a little different than having one with other children. Their mobility is highly limited. Their communication is highly limited. Its not like he could play his favorite game, duck-duck-goose, easily with these children. Even Jack is a different matter. Joey does make them laugh, especially if he is running about or acting very silly. Perhaps he enjoys making them happy. I don't know. Joey has always liked them- now I know he has missed them. We need to get over there more often.  And yes, he had them all in stitches. He played with Jack, too. I got to talk to Aunt Christina.

{"date": "Sunday, July 20, 2008", "body": "\nWe're thinking in case of an emergency, it might be a good idea if the boys got used to possibly sleeping at Grandmas house. Since Andy has been a Grandma Boy lately, and didn't want to go home the last couple of visits, Grandma thought it might be time to start letting them have Grandma Sleepovers, where they spend a night at Grandma's house, one at a time.  For our first attempt, we asked which boy would like to stay with Grandma, and the volunteer was Joey. That was a surprise, but we went with it, because after all, he's the one that is going to have the harder time. We called Grandma, and it was settled. Joey was going for his first sleepover!  i helped Joey pack his bag, and talk about his trip. We talked about things he might do with Grandma, how this would be special time with Grandma, and how he would be staying there, and Mommy and Daddy and Andy would go home, while he stayed at Grandma's house. We made sure we had LittleBear and fresh pajamas and his good toothbrush.  We drove out to Grandma's, talking about what was happening. Andy started getting antsy and saying he wanted to stay with Grandma, so we had to assure him he would have a turn. The assurances were not altogether successful.  Once at Grandma's, we had a little visit, then it was time to go. Boys were hungry. Joey started saying he didn't want to stay today. We assured Joey we would see him in the morning. Grandma offered pizza for dinner, something Joey is starting to like to eat because of the new infatuation with Chuck E. Cheese. We hugged him and kissed him and let Andy say goodbye, and we were off.  We drove out of sight, waited a few minutes, then called Grandma.  All was not well.  Apparently he returned to Grandma, shaking, and talking about \"the machine has left me\" and \"going to the beach!\" Grandma asked us to come back. He was holding together- barely. He was unhappy. This wasn't fun.  When I returned, I tried to act casual. Joey was hugging Grandma, and she was assuring him that we wouldn't go to the beach without him. He was pretty red. As Grandma pointed out that I was back, he looked at me and said, \"Mommy! Why did you come back?\" All the sudden, he wanted to stay at Grandma's. Only he didn't want Mom to leave. Or \"the machine\" (which is a new name for the car, apparently). He was especially upset about the  car  leaving. Mom and Dad and Andy could go, but not the car.  It was decided that Joey needed to go home instead of having his sleepover tonight. We'll go back and have an adventure tomorrow, and then try another sleepover another day.  I'm thinking there were a few of mistakes on my part.  1. Not enough warning. Joey may need several days' notice, at least for the first couple of times. Of course, in an emergency, there would be no notice, but I think he held it together enough that if we really had an emergency, he would be OK. Not happy, but OK.  2. Not enough prep. We needed to think about exactly what Joey would be doing, so he could get right to it, and distract him from us leaving.  3. Too big a leap. We might need to do this in small steps. Have a \"campout\" at Grandma's that is a long evening instead of an all-nighter. Work up to a family slumber party, first just a late night, then all night together. Maybe have a few \"afternoons with Grandma\" where he spends a couple hours alone at Grandma's, but we come back for him. Then have our sleepover.  When Joey was a baby, we used to leave him with Grandma a lot. I was working at a couple of distant campuses, and so Grandma would take the baby for a while. He even spent the night with her once. But that was a long time ago- he probably doesn't even remember it. As he got older and needed more routine (plus having a second boy), we just had Grandma come over here to watch boys. It would be nice to have an option for them to stay there, and enjoy the wonders of being with Grandma. Besides, Grandma's house is surrounded by woods- boy heaven.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/07/sleepover-at-grandmas-first-try.html", "title": "\nSleepover at Grandma's: First Try\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 05, 2008", "body": "\nYes, we have lived through another Fourth, and we've done it with style.  We ran over to  Ferry Farm  for their celebrations, and it was really well done. George Washington spent his childhood on Ferry Farm, which is just across the river here. I was very pleased. The had a tent with a little band going, talking about music history of the area. They had lots of folks in costume to see and talk to. They had weavers, a tent setup to use quills with lemon juice (then go get your \"invisible ink\" ironed and see what you wrote!), a cooking area, a juggler, and a native American tradesman showing pelts. They had some other tents with costumed people, but we didn't get to them- some were out by where  they think they've found the house , and there were cannon demonstrations out there- not a chance of us headed out there. They also had a pavilion with crafts for kids, and facepainting (Joey had himself done as a clown; Andy wasn't interested). Behind that they had all sorts of games set up, and a parachute, and some folks teaching kids how to juggle. They had a couple of food stands, and an ice cream stand. All in all, very nice, and plenty of shade, so a good time had by all. The only problem we had was the dogs- dogs are allowed at Ferry Farm, and folks brought them. Joey is terrified of dogs. We did have a few minutes of \"perfect storm\" sensory issues (broken comfort toy, just as the cannon went off, just as a big dog walked by) and subsequent meltdown, but we found a quiet spot to calm down, and cheered up when we saw a friend from church.  Andy charmed the juggling lady, Joey learned to bowl, and so we had a fun-filled day at Ferry Farm.  Then we headed out to Grandma's for continued festivities- including the much-anticipated fireworks. The boys had picked out fireworks when we were buying them. We always get them from the  Knights of Columbus , who do a lot of good stuff around here. Most anticipated was the new  jack-o-lantern firework , which did not disappoint.  There was a huge thunderstorm first. We had the slide up and running when it blew up, but since the boys were pretty tired, having them sit down instead of running about and sliding was probably a good thing. So after a relaxing evening of Boy Videos, duck-duck-goose, and fruit salad, we settled in for the display.  Joey loves fireworks. Yes, he holds his ears, but then, so do I- I hate those whistles. The sparkles and glitter of the sparks really gets him excited, and he cheered and clapped and had a great time. Poor Andy, however... Fourth of July is our annual Torture the Boy Event. He had forgotten how loud fireworks are, so he was all excited, only to have the second firework start popping and whistling, much to his terror. He managed to make it through the show only because Mommy promised to clamp her hands over his ears and sides of his head, while he sat in her lap. The bad news was I didn't get many pictures- its hard to work a camera and hold a child's ears at the same time. The good news is I got to actually watch the fireworks. We only had two we wouldn't buy again- Earthquake The Big One and Laser Dragon. Unicorn Fountain was really nice, and the jack-o-lanterns were the stars of the show.  It was nearly eleven before we got the boys in bed. Naturally, we got some extra minutes to sleep this morning. But not many.  Happy Fourth of July.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kenmore.org/ferryfarm_homepage.html", "http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/07/03/washington.boyhood.home/?iref=hpmostpop", "http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Meadows/4652/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92hXs762MFk"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/07/annual-boy-torture.html", "title": "\nAnnual Boy Torture\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 06, 2008", "body": "\nWe have begun a new campaign- if the guys are good the  whole  day, they get a sticker; if they collect 21 stickers in a month, they get to go to Chuck E. Cheese. I'll let you know how it goes, as it started today. We had the grand start by showing them they got a sticker for each day this week already, and talked about what we did each day and the good things they did to earn their sticker. I will be refining this program this week to give them a specific task to work on, such as \"no whining\", \"no hitting\" and \"more sharing\" (translate the \"no\" to \"less\"). They are given three warnings through the day. Like I said- I'll keep you informed.  Most kids, when bored with a trip, begin the chorus of \"Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?\" Joey has discovered a fun variation: \"Where are we going? Where are we going? Where are we going?\" This is a question, so he would get praise for asking, reinforcing the behavior. It is a question he can handle better, because it begins with a \"cue word\" (Where?) Besides, the question apparently sounds cool, so perseveration kicks in. He knows perfectly well where we are going, just as other kids know perfectly well that you are not there yet.  \"Where are we going?\" he pipes up behind me. We have just left the driveway. The car has been on all of thirty seconds.  \"We are going to church,\" I answer with my I'm-Being-Patient Mommy Voice. We could probably walk, but the clammy day and Joey's cough speak against the plan; driving the six blocks it is. There is no backing out. Our Sunday school teacher is on vacation, and I volunteered to teach this week, and I'm by myself. I put the car in drive.  \"Where are we going?\" he asks again and sighs.  \"Church,\" I repeat. \"We have Sunday School today, remember?\"  \"Where are we going, Mommy?\" the other little voice chimes in.  \"Chuck E. Cheese!\" Joey replies joyfully. They both cheer.  \"You haven't earned enough stickers to go to Chuck E. Cheese yet, guys,\" I remind them. \"Let's work hard and earn our stickers...\" \"Then go to Chuck E. Cheese!\" they cheer together.  This may be a long day. I've never taught Sunday School before, but it seems OK. I have six kids (summer is here), used to running a bit wild for the hour. We do some singing, then look at the little books we're supposed to read, ad do some coloring. I get some of them to make a paper-plate fish.  Time is winding down, and Joey turns to me with a big grin.  \"Going to Chuck E. Cheese now?\" No, dear. Not today.  The church parking lot is a madhouse, coming and going. The folks from the pervious service are trying to get out, and the folks from the next service are vying for those parking spots. I plead for quiet while I try to concentrate on driving and not hitting anyone- while not being made into a bumper car ourselves. Joey is chanting one of his usual perserveration phrases, \"anseeDAdeeanseeDAdeeanseeDAdee...\" \"Please be quiet so I can focus on the road,\" I plead again.  \"AnseeDAdeeanseeDAdee...\" I need to take a lesson from  Maddy  and get some earplugs. We narrowly miss being hit by a LandRover.  \"Mommy! MOMMY!  MOOOOOOMMMMEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! \" Andy squeals suddenly.  \" Yes , dear?\" I try to hold on to my temper as we avoid a silver Cadillac.  \"I'm bein' quiet! I get sticker! I go Chuck E. Cheese!\"  Yes.

The boys learned some new songs, and new dances, and got to play with lots of crafts and art stuff, and they seemed really happy about going. The folks who organized and ran the program did a great job. The Marketplace was gorgeous, and there was plenty for everybody to do, and try, and discover! Our last day included a visit from a real goat, and we could try goat milk and goat cheese. Joey really loved that. Andy talked about meeting the goat, too. Joey finished his basket, and he was  so  proud of himself. He also made another necklace, and got to go fishing with a big bamboo pole (the fishing guy was sticking aluminum fish on clothespins on the ends. The kids were thrilled.) We wrapped up today by singing some of the songs we learned- with signs- for the whole congregation. Joey was so excited to be able to show off. Andy wasn't so excited, but did a good job.

I'm hoping to get the pool out this afternoon. Ah, the full days of summer are upon us.  When I was young, summer days were spent by the river, after a morning in the garden. My Dad loved to till the garden, but then all the work was left to us- the planting, watering, weeding, picking, etc. My mom did a good job of making the work part fun. My Dad had a knack for extolling the virtues of something, doing the fun part of it, then expecting the work to be done by somebody else.  Sometime it left everybody feeling like the Little Red Hen. Only you weren't the one who found the seed; Dad handed it to you and said, \"Let me know when the bread's out of the oven.\"  Sometimes he didn't even want the fun part. He'd get all grumpy because there was fun to be had, or refuse to do the fun because it wasn't  his  idea. I assure you that there is little more annoying than to be trying to have fun and have some grumpy person scowling at you the whole time, or suggesting something fun, only to be told off. How dare we think of something fun?  So a lot of summer days were spent in the woods. Wading in the river, lying on the moss, these places were safe to have fun of your own invention. And not a weed in sight.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/boys-at-home.html", "title": "\nBoys at home\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, June 12, 2008", "body": "\n The funeral for  Officer Todd Bahr  was today.  Officer Bahr  was killed in the line of duty on Friday, shot in the head, probably by a man who was later killed in a shoot-out with police (the police didn't kill him; the coward* shot himself). For some places, the idea of a shoot-out might be a daily, no-longer-newsworthy occurrence. Here, it is a shock beyond comprehension.  We haven't lost an officer in the line of duty since 1964.  Mom wanted to see the procession, and I thought it was a good idea. I hadn't pulled Joey from school, but I thought Andy should see it. The escort of mounted officers... the lines of officers from all over the region, both Virginia and Maryland... the emergency vehicles. Two ambulance drivers who were not able to go to the funeral stopped at the roadside with us (and several dozen other cars) to see the procession, to take photos and footage for their comrades who remained on call. The entrance to the cemetery was flanked by fire engines, their ladders up to hold the flag directly over the entrance. The procession took about 45 minutes to pass (we didn't get to see the whole thing- only about 1/2 an hour).   I agree with mom- I think they should have closed schools and lined the route, had the children watch the display of respect and mourning for this person.  Police officers put their lives on the line for us every day, so we can be protected, we can be helped, we can have someone to turn to when trouble strikes. Every child in this city should have seen what this means when an officer is killed. They should have stood there and shown their respect, they should see the lives and families who risk everything, every day, so they can go to safe schools, ride on safe streets, walk on safe sidewalks. They should see how precious a single life is and can be.  I am sorry I never met Officer Bahr- at least not knowingly. I thank him and his family for their efforts and sacrifice in keeping my community safe.  May we never have such a procession again.  *If it proves to be, as we all suspect, that this person really is the person who murdered Officer Bahr, please substitute any and all deragatory terms of choice here.

{"date": "Monday, May 19, 2008", "body": "\nIf you are stressed out, it's your own damn fault.  That's the message running around these days. Modern lifestyle is too hectic- if you'd just slow down and simplify, you wouldn't be stressed. If you'd just take a minute for yourself, you wouldn't be stressed. If you'd just take a nap, you wouldn't be so stressed. If you'd just accept life as it is, you wouldn't be stressed. What's your problem? Why are you so stupid? Get out of the rat race and you wouldn't be stressed! Yes, and when these things drop from mouths and screens around me, I start wondering about how that would sound if I turned it around on someone else. Replaced a few choice words. But offending others isn't going to help my stress level. It isn't going to get me any more sleep. It's not going to do a thingy-dingy for my blood pressure, or my PVCs, or my asthma. Nor will it help Joey or Andy.  Yes, modern life asks me to do things differently than they did once. Not too long ago, a child with communication issues like my Joey would have been probably labeled mentally retarded, and ended up in a group home (at best), working menial jobs (at best), and probably not spoken about. Children not much more severe than my Joey would have been locked up in institutions and  forgotten . Or perhaps a kid with Joey's communication issues could have been found a place on the farm, if he managed any form of communication enough to understand directions. If not- well, those farm kids probably ended up locked up, too- in institutions, in homes- like Boo Radley. Having enough receptive language to understand \"muck out the stables,\" he might have gotten by and survived, scorned as the local idiot or weirdo. We have people walking around our town suffering this fate  right this minute . Today. Is this the life I want for Joey?  I see plenty of parents who do little to support their disabled kids. They refuse special education services. They send them to school, and trust the school to provide all the necessary therapies. They assume the state will take care of their child, help their child reach their potential. That's not even what schools do for non-disabled kids! I look at these kids, and glimpse echoes of what might Joey be like if I did the same. If I just went about my \"normal\" life, instead of what I do. I haven't seen any current outcome that is positive.  None .  So I drive him to speech therapy. I drive him to occupational therapies. I work four jobs, so I can pay for them, and for the little ABA he gets. I take him with me all over town. I take him to the store. I take him to the farm. I take him to Williamsburg. I take him to the zoo. I take him to the beach.  It was almost two years ago when we last took Joey to the Aquarium in Baltimore. We went again yesterday. What a difference a couple of years can make. You might remember the  disaster  we had last time. Basically, meltdowns at every scale level throughout the day, but mostly in the 8-10 range. Dark, crowded rooms are not Joey's thing.  This time, he had a blast. He loved the fish. He's very into fish right now. It can sometimes be hard to tell what Joey is really interested in, so I'm tickled to discover something he really likes, and isn't just saying he likes because other kids say they like it. He's very into the beach and sealife. Maybe he'll be a marine biologist! He looked  into  the tanks, and  saw  the fish, and  pointed  at them, and wanted Andy to see them, too. He laughed. He looked for Nemo and for Dory. We saw Dory-fish (blue tang). We saw sharks. We saw anemones.  Then we went to the dolphin show. It was far better than the show we saw before- and we sat in the splash zone. We got soaked. Andy freaked. Joey was ecstatic. He proudly proclaimed himself wet to anyone who would listen. He laughed and squealed with glee at the tricks, and wanted to get in the water and swim with the dolphins. He's been pretending to be a dolphin all afternoon today. How's that for success?  Yes, he's growing up. That makes a difference. But he's also doing a lot of hard work, because he wants to know about the world, he wants to communicate with us, he wants to be in on the action of life. Did he blend in, look like other kids, act like other kids? No. No need for specifics. He's Joey, and he was Joey at the aquarium. But he was  happy .  That's worth a lot of stress on my part. Modern life is still life, and I still think it is important for him to enjoy it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SDIc9jmslmI/AAAAAAAAAu8/IitEQMIDaQ8/s1600-h/05_boys_aquarium.jpg", "ttp://suitcaseexhibit.org/", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SDIc_DmslnI/AAAAAAAAAvE/IbM5HA8kzcw/s1600-h/dories.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SDIc_TmsloI/AAAAAAAAAvM/GQnGdfPdX30/s1600-h/dolphin.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/on-edge.html", "title": "\nOn the Edge\n"},

They are not picky about what it under their feet; they seem to be absently pressing their feet onto the objects. Often they stand in the middle of the floor, absorbed in their little worlds (or the TV), with something under their feet. I usually have to tell them to stop stepping on whatever it is.  Joey often steps on things because his motor planning is poor. It take a lot of extra planning to lift your foot and place it on the floor somewhere other than your natural gait. It also is tricky to be watching the floor while you are trying to plan out where your body intends to go and hurdle your body in the exactly correct direction.  What I am talking about is different. This is a deliberate action, a purposeful, slow, planned stepping on an object.  this becomes a real problem when the object they are stepping on is not intended to take any weight. Like metal buses, fishing poles, pens, blocks. Either we end up with broken toys, or broken feet.

I'm sure it's great if you can afford a nice room in one of those fancy new places on that boardwalk and already know which are the good dives, and your favorite thing is to bake to medium-well in the summer sun. However, for a nice little daytrip from somewhere else, I saw nothing to entice me back. Parking was horrible and expensive, with a long walk to the actual sand. All of the boardwalk places looked alike- no character, nothing special, all chains (or too sterile to make any nevermind), shops were packed with bikes to rent, to the point you couldn't see what was for sale (if you could park close enough to go into a shop at all.) Forget something when you're on the sand? There's hardly any shops or anything on the boardwalk itself- you have to walk another block, through tunnels through the fancy hotels, to get to anything. There was one shop on the board near our stretch of sand- and it was quite a hike. No others in sight, up or down the walk. You have to cross the bike road to get to the sand at all, and hope you don't get run over, all day long. I saw a few glimpses of character left- only one of the once-ubiquitous haunted houses, for example. But mostly its been knocked down and rebuilt into Anybeach, USA. Inconvenient Anybeach.  The beach itself was OK, but not great. The sand was full of straw for some reason, and hadn't been sifted at all, so there was a lot of trash debris. I know some folks want the sand to be white, but to me, sand is yellow, and Virginia Beach is yellow, so no biggie there. There was a good number of people, but it could have been worse. No shells, but then, OC doesn't have shells anymore, either. That was one thing I remember from California that was so wonderful- you could really collect seashells. Not just shell scraps and bits, but whole shells. Very cool.  The boys did well in the surf, and had a grand time. We let them run about until they were tired enough to volunteer to leave. Joey immediately regretted his decision and spent the rest of the trip trying to convince us to return to the surf.  We  were  impressed by the Virginia Zoo. The main part of the zoo is open and the animals are more free-range, so they wander about and seem very happy. The lion area has windows right on the level with the cats, so they are walking right at you! Even with so much torn up, being remodeled, built,and rebuilt, there was plenty to see.  My sunglasses turned out to be the big hit of the trip, though. Very fashionable. All in all, and my apologies to Va Beach fans, but we saw no reason to go back. Its fine if, like this trip, we're down there for other reasons and want something to do, but as a destination?  We'll take Ocean City, all the way.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SB6A8851jqI/AAAAAAAAAs0/8cUc-PcMVTA/s1600-h/01_boys_crabshirts.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SB6A8851jrI/AAAAAAAAAs8/ApuGhdlfyDE/s1600-h/01_boys_surf.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SB6A9M51jsI/AAAAAAAAAtE/Xhufy_gKcd0/s1600-h/01_joey_sunglasses.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SB6A9M51jtI/AAAAAAAAAtM/cP8Nv7N_0jg/s1600-h/01_andy_sunglasses.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/back-from-beach.html", "title": "\nBack from the beach\n"},

{"date": "Monday, April 14, 2008", "body": "\nJoey has been taking drumming lessons for a good long while now. They are supposed to be good for his bilateral coordination, and he was enchanted with drums and music when we started. Lately, we have been seriously considering discontinuing them.  First, the rules kinda got changed on us. The guy who was running the lessons and I had a kind of unspoken agreed understanding about how this was working with us- we paid week-to-week, instead of by the month, and we had some flexibility where if Joey was sick or having a particularly bad day, we could cancel without having to pay for the missed lesson (technically, we are supposed to pay and then have a \"make up\" lesson, but when would Joey be able to \"make up\" a lesson?) Now that guy is sick, and the fellow in his place wants us to pay for the whole month, and the lesson we missed when Joey was sick (even though the teacher has a very sick father and so asked us to please cancel if Joey is sick). I paid up, but it really makes these lessons expensive, and the new lack of flexibility means I really need to give it some thought about continuing.  On top of that, and far more relevant, Joey has been doing the \"I don't wanna\" dance. \"I don't want go Mr. Shelby. No Mr. Shelby today.\" Joey has been increasingly sensitive to noise, so that we started using earplugs for the lessons- and that helped for a while, but now not so much. Today the drum was \"scary\". This is exactly the kind of shift in sensory trouble and attitude that I was worried about- why we had that week-to-week idea in the first place. He seems to perk up about halfway through the lesson. But is that enough? If this isn't fun, what's the point?  I'd wait it out until our other guy is back, but we're not sure when that will be, and time is short- I have to give two weeks' notice, and before I pay for another whole month of lessons Joey may not want- and that would be now. :P  On the other hand, is Joey really not interested now, or is there something else going on? Has being sick knocked him for a bigger loop than anticipated, and he just wants to stay home for an afternoon, and Mondays are particularly tiring? Should I just try to juggle the appointments and find a different lesson day? It's not like I can just ask Joey and expect a direct answer to decide the matter.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/04/drumming.html", "title": "\nDrumming\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 04, 2008", "body": "\nSo last night I printed out Joey's school list and hopped over to the local Wal-mart to get Joey's supplies for the year. He needs to provide his own glue, pencils, scissors, dry erase markers, dry erase eraser, notebooks, folders, crayons, soap, ziplock bags, highlighters, tissues, paper towels, wipes, and sanitizer. This weekend was tax-free weekend here, so we also bought shoes, underwear, and socks.  The school list for Joey alone was $45, and only because Walmart does cool stuff like sell glue for $.22. Normally, these supplies would be two or three times what I paid, plus tax.  When I was in school, I think my mom bought loose-leaf paper, a binder, and pencils. Oh, and I needed a lot of erasers. Things like scissors, chalk (we didn't have dry-erase), crayons, paper towels, and soap were provided by the school. Funding for schools has been so devalued that these things now are provided by the students. I always toss in some extra, because I know several families in our classes can't afford $45 for school supplies. There are also some things not on the list that I put in, because I know they are used, like magic markers and construction paper. Teachers shouldn't be having to buy these things. But then, I don't think I should have to, either. I kinda feel like because I buy these things, the schools get less funding- because why should the general taxpayer pay for what individual families will provide?  We get stuck with that sword with therapy, too. Joey needs OT and speech to progress. The school offers minimal amounts of these services, so we supplement, paying for private therapy ourselves. Because we provide the private therapy, Joey progresses, so the school will not give us any more service. Instead of helping the school provide adequate service, I feel like I am enabling an irresponsible teenager.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/08/school-funding.html", "title": "\nSchool Funding\n"},

He's going to be home all week. I had to think fast. How to help him get through an entire week with no schedule? One day at a time...  Today's solution was the pool at the gym. Our gym has a lovely children's pool, and its rarely used, especially in the morning. I can see both boys at once, and no one can get in over his head.  Usually, this venture is an adventure. Go to gym, get two small boys into dressing area  before  clothing removal commences. Get two small boys into swimsuits. Get mom into swimsuit. Gather clothing from all over the room, including the sink and toilet. Get towels at top of bag. Get children to swimming pool. They usually keep their suits on OK. Breathe while they play. When it is tim e to go, transition appropriately to avoid meltdowns. Begin at least 15 minutes before you really need them out of the pool. Herd small children back to changing area  before  removal of bathing suits commences. Get wet bathing suits off of small, wet bodies. Get own bathing suit off. Chase down small, naked children who have escaped back to pool area. Hope you have suit still on, or towel handy when this happens. Hence, I always get dressed first to minimize opportunities for escape while mommy is still naked. Get two small, wet bodies back into normal clothing, without anyone slipping and hitting head on wall or floor, or water from sink flooding same floor. Gather up towels and suits from all over changing room, including sink and toilet. Herd small children back to car with various offers of positive reinforcement.  I have noted this exercise and its delights before, much to my pain and a mountain of unfortunate email comments (to the point I had to remove one of the posts). However, I have considered the work worth it, because both my boys LOVE the water  SO MUCH . Ecstasy is the emotion when I announce to these two, whilst they bounce upon my bed this morning, that we are going swimming today. Pure bliss.  Today, I was rewarded for my generosity. Two boys entered the gym, and headed to the changing area without losing any clothing on the way. They patiently got into their swimsuits, and gathered their  own clothes  and put them  in the bag . THEMSELVES.  Then they walked patiently out to the pool, and commenced immediate fun.  And it got better.  Time to go? No problemo. Five minute warning, ONe minute warning. One countdown and one count up, and they were out. Very impressive. All the way to the changing room, no lost clothing. I spread a towel on the floor, and they patiently sat criss-cross-applesauce waiting for their turn to get out of wet clothes and into dry ones. They sang the ABC song (over and over) while they waited. They helped put their wet suits into a plastic bag, then marched out to the car with proclamations that it was time to go find Grandma (which was perfectly true).  Who are these children, and where have they put mine?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/03/excellent-morning.html", "title": "\nAn excellent morning\n"},

I just gave out an award to the blogging folks I would normally pass this award along to- including Maddy herself- so instead I am going to take a time-out to recognize some not-blogging folks who \"make my day\" especially when I am down, out, and ready to cry.  First and foremost, I'd like to award this award to my husband, Allan. I don't really talk about Allan much here, because I am mostly focused on the boys and the times when poor Allan is slaving away in the salt mines to keep the roof over our heads, the food in our tummies, and the therapists providing service. But I am one of the luckiest women on earth to have a husband like my Allan. Here is a man who sees his tired wife at the end of the day, and offers to order pizza. This is a man who does laundry and dishes. This is a man who loves to wrestle with his boys. This is a man who thinks nothing of putting his sons to bed, and sitting with Joey until he falls asleep. This is the man who has put off putting Joey back in bed when he creeps into our in the middle of the night, because he won't be little long, and he's  so cute!  The fact that I married him just proves how clever I really am. ;) This award also goes to my mom, who loves to take me to lunch (and the boys!), who is always here to remind me how much leeway to give my guys, and what normal looks like. My poor mom got a good dose of my life over the weekend when we went to the chocolate store, and Joey felt the need to push the cart down the aisle at top speed- with his brother in it. Trying to keep those guys contained was nothing less than monumental. After all, they were literally  in a candy store!  And yet she managed it, so I got two minutes to pick out some chocolate. She gets me through the day.  I also want to pass this along to my friend Christina. Every once in a while I actually get to talk to her. She sometimes shows up at my door with chai. Despite her own challenges, she is always genuinely happy about our little triumphs- and our huge accomplishments. She always tells it like it is. And besides, she has the wonderfully cheerful shade of brilliant red hair (natural!).  This goes to Janine, who has helped Joey through thick and thin, and even let me foam at the mouth (and foamed with me). Thank you for caring about Joey. Thanks for being a great OT. Thanks for being a bright point in our week.  Also to Anne, who shares her sanity every other week. I always look forward to seeing her smiling face, and hearing her gentle voice, and know I'm not the only one out here doing all of this. Also, to her kids; her daughter who shows such patience with Andy, and her son who has become such a great Tuesday Buddy for Joey.

But I'm game, as usual, so here it is:  - If you blog, do you tell people in your family or at your job about your blog? No. My husband knows about my blog, and people find it, but I don't run around saying, \"Look at my blog!\" I have directed a couple folks to it directly, but not a whole lot. I have a separate more photo-laden site for family and friends to follow, that is a little more of a polished and shiny happy look at our lives. This blog is a bit more down-in-the-trenches.  - If so, how does that impact your writing? I'm not sure. I know it effects the focus here, But mostly I direct people because of the focus, instead of focusing because of the people I direct.  - Do you keep hard copies of your blogs? I keep a back-up copy on my computer. Which reminds me, i need to make a new one. I don't keep it entry-by-entry because I am an idiot.   - Do you ever not post comments you get? No, but I have deleted a few that were ads or inappropriate. I do not allow anonymous posting, so that cuts down on the trolls.  - How do you balance writing versus reading? Balance?  - Do you think of it as a chore or a diversion? It is a way of life.  - Do you use RSS to keep track of blogs, or what? No. I don't actually read that many blogs. If I want something new, I check out where my usual crowd is sending their awards, and often see if there is anything that looks interesting on the Autism Hub. Also, I like to check out folks who comment.  - Do you worry about what you write, or what readers will think? Sometimes. I know that my students can \"Google\" me and this blog pops right up, so I try to check the language and I don't often wander off my topic. But I don't do anything crazy and interesting enough to threaten my jobs or anything. Otherwise, well, this is what I'm thinking right now, There you go.

A little surreal in some ways, but maybe that's because they are growing up so fast, and every moment is so precious to me.  The party actually had two parts- a sing-a-long, where the kids sat together and sang holiday songs, and then a classroom party. The classroom party was organized to keep the kids engaged for the hour by dividing the group into four stations, and having them make somethign at each station, then at the end, Mrs. S turned on the Nutcracker and they ate their snack. Really well done, I was really impressed.  Anyway, most of the parents sat in the gym in these rows of chairs behind the kids, who sat on the floor in two big blocks. Andy and Joey insisted I sit with them, and since I wanted Andy to participate and feel a part, I sat my butt on the floor with them. It was an excellent choice. Those other parents? They missed the best part of the fun! To sit in that sea of children, with my two little guys, and sing and laugh and cheer together... yes indeed. I wouldn't miss that for the world. One of the parents afterword told me I was having  way  too good of a time. My response? No such thing as \"too good of a time\" with my boys! Some of the second graders sang special songs and even got up in front of the school and performed. Joey was beside himself at that point, wanting to get up with them and sing and play instruments and dance. He did work himself up to the point Mrs. Macy had to take him for a little walk and a drink of water to calm down. He SO wanted to participate! Don't worry, little Buddy... you'll be up there so very, very soon. The time will just fly. You'll see.  Then the party! The inclusion class joined them, so it was a pretty good group- about two dozen kids, making crafts and icing cookies and eating those cookies and other goodies and having a jolly good time. They noticed I was taking pictures, and I have some hilarious ones of other kids in the class. Andy and one of Joey's classmates got along famously, buddy-buddy for the whole party. A good time had by all.  Joey and one other little girl didn't get excited about the picture-taking, but that's OK. Andy blended right in, even with the noise and the chatter, so that was fanstastic. I think that child is school-bound at last. Growing up. Thats my boy.  But I did notice that Joey was a bit isolated. Whereas Andy picked up friends and other kids were hugging and chattering and playing together, Joey did his thing, on his own, then sat a little apart to eat. There was another little girl doing this as well, from the inclusion class. It was so marked, I figure she's probably an aspie or \"HF\" autie; they kind of shared the same corner, even though they didn't speak to each other. I worry about the communication difficulties Joey has, which seem to isolate him in groups. He tries so hard to be a part, to participate, to play with the kids; but usually ends up slightly apart, alone. I'll have to stay aware; is this his way of being comfortable, or will this eventually depress him? Stay tuned.  He is his mother's child, though. He wore his reindeer antler hat almost to the end, long after everybody else's was cast aside. Silly hats.

{"date": "Monday, February 04, 2008", "body": "\nThank you, Stimey, for my shiny new award! I'm always surprised when I get one. I spend a lot of life on fringes of things, a forgotten bounder, present but not part. I'll blog about that some time, I suppose.  Anyway, I got this cool award. It's called \"A Roar For Powerful Words\" and its from the  Shameless Lions Writing Circle.   Stimey gave it to me because I  \"regularly make [her] think.\"  I wonder what I could possibly make an amazing someone like Stimey think about that she thought deserved an award. It's a humbling thought.  Part of this award is you have to come up with three things that you think makes writing powerful. I would have to say first, I think that good writing keeps in mind its audience and its goal. For blogs, this can be many and diverse; for here, my goal was to remove fear, provide grounding, and give other parents access to an experience of raising children that was accepting, joyful, and naturally human, with all its ups and downs, so that those highs and lows were not something to dread, not something dark and foreboding in their mystery. One of the great blogs I know for this ability to know her audience is MonkeyGirl at  Musings of a Highly Trained Monkey . Those of you who have not yet swarmed over to her site to check out life as an ER nurse, go. Now.  Next, I would say that good writing, especially good blog writing, needs more than just a sense of humor- it needs a firm grasp of the absurd. You need more than a chuckle here and there, you need to realize that life is one long belly-laugh if you just stop long enough to take in the joke. I know Maddy at  Whitterer on Autism  is the true mistress of this, but she's already gotten this award. So instead I'll send you over to my other favorite ER/medico blog,  Ambulance Driver . Besides, he likes getting lots of hits.  My third thing is that you have to have something to say. That may seem a strange thing to mark down, but when I was in college, I had a very serious problem with this. I was taking a wonderful poetry seminar with  Andrew Salkey , which was a bear to get into because you had to apply in person with a poetry portfolio, everyone wanted to take the class, and there were only 15 slots. I was absolutely abashed to get in, especially when I walked in and found myself in a room full of English and Creative Writing majors... and me. He said straight-out that I would never be a poet. I had a wonderful grasp of language, but nothing to say. Everyone else there had the opposite problem. Without something to say, what good are words at all?  The blogs I read all have something to say, but I'll direct your attention to these:  Casdok at  Mother of Shrek  and her message of hope, love, and joy in her son, C. I direct a lot of families to her blog, but especially families who seem to think I can be loving and accepting of my own children because my experience of and writing about autism is \"autism lite.\" You can accept people for who the are, as they are... no matter what challenges they may be facing.  The Autistic Bitch From Hell at  Whose Planet Is It, Anyway?  with her powerful reminders that autistic people are, first and foremost, people.  And then there is  Big White Hat , where we find life and faith can indeed meet, and are relevant to one another. That's a good message to keep in mind.  There were lots of other folks I thought of, but most of them already had this award, and I hate to tag someone who already got tagged. Since I don't read too many blogs regularly, coming up with fresh destinations for you is- as you may notice- not too easy. I've probably sent you all of these places before. But then, i read these blogs- and the others I thought of- for a reason. I've not much time for idle blog-reading. Hugs to you all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://theshamelesslionswritingcircle.blogspot.com/2007/11/roar-for-powerful-words.html", "http://stimeyland.blogspot.com/2008/01/hear-me-roar-and-kiss.html", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R6fAf8WtVMI/AAAAAAAAAYY/Cpb1CIPAExc/s1600-h/Roar%2BLarge%2BLighter.jpg", "http://highlytrainedmonkey.blogspot.com/", "http://whittereronautism.com/2007/12/awards-roar-for-powerful-words/", "http://ambulancedriverfiles.blogspot.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Salkey", "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/", "http://bigwhitehat.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/02/roar-mew.html", "title": "\nRoar.

Today is the day I looked about and thought, \"I need to get these fall things packed up.\" But for our house, its a hair too early to put out Christmas things. Just a cople of days- Advent calendars need to appear on Saturday- but just that moment on the brink, between fall festivities and Christmas holidays.  I should spend this moment cleaning, making the house ready for the decorations to come. I have an extensive Christmas decoration collection, so I need everything cleared and cleaned. I was originally planning a whiz-bang Christmas decorating campaign, but with Andy not in preschool, there's no time. So just normal levels- the door garlands, the trees, the mantel, the greens, the baking... we'll see. Here at the brink, anything is possible.  Fortunately, Joey loves Christmas, and gets happy about the Christmas decorations; but I do think it throws him off. We have increasing trouble with him through Christmas. After all, everything is so exciting and different and strange. New things to do, sparkles everywhere...  I have four weekends between now and Christmas. I'm hoping to work two of them. This weekend, we have the parades; Joey loves parades. We're hoping Andy is well enough to go to at least one of them, too. I might try to sneak a trip to Santa in here, too- but Andy won't like that. Next weekend is our trip to Valley View. Then two Saturdays of working. The tree will probably go up the evening of the 21st, and be done by the evening of the 23rd. That's teh way to open the Christmas break! By then, everything else will need to be done.

I called to see when Santa would be starting, and the lady told me ten o'clock. We got there shortly before ten, to find not a soul waiting... there was a breakfast with Santa event, and the pictures wouldn't start until 10:30! I was hot. Really hot. But we made it through, and actually got a decent picture of Andy. Woo-hoo!  Then we dropped Daddy off to do some Christmas shopping, and drove out to Grandma's to see the Spotsy parade. It was OK, but with only one band, Joey's interest didn't hold. In fact, he was pretty scattered and everywhere. Andy did OK.  Then we went to church- Andy sat right in the  front row like a perfect little angel the whole time! Not even a flinch! And Joey got to play drums; then we went outside to the Fredericksburg parade. Joey, being his love-the-world self, made himself a friend; a nice lady who helped me keep him on the curb, and made sure he got candy, and even got him into her lap when he got chilly. Andy tried a cinnamon candy, but I don't think he liked it much, too hot. The parade was so long, though, we had to leave, after being there two hours and no end in sight. :P  So a happy opening to the holiday season...

Joey is not the child at issue here; there is no escaping the fact that Joey is autistic, and requires special supports to teach him to function and cope. Joey's communication issues and behavior clearly \"mark\" him in a crowd of non-autistic peers (though we sometimes have trouble with the special ed people forgetting that he is in need of service...) That the label of autism has been medicalized is another issue.  Then we have Andy. Andy is three years and four months old. He doesn't like loud noises or chaos, and displays \"ritualisitic\" behaviors when attempting to cope with noise. He flaps his hands when excited or agitated. He has stopped eating most foods. He prefers to keep his hands clean. Until a couple months ago, he would not jump or swing, or do things that required his feet to leave the floor. He hates to spin or go in circles, such as on a carnival ride.  Is Andy just a quirky three-year-old, taking his time an ddeveloping in his own way, or does he require a special label and special service?  Labels are a double-edged sword. Andy being labeled \"sensory integration dysfunction\" means we know he needs service. He needs speech therapy to make his language intelligible (and the therapy has been highly successful in this regard.) He gets OT for hyper-sensitivity issues (like the noise problem, and the vestibular issue). But how much does this child need to be medicalized beyond that?  It can be great fun to sit in the park and watch the children run about playing, and thinking about them with the labels that bounce around my house. Oh, look, that kid like to push the turnabout- heavy work for propioceptive input. That kid prefers to spin around on the swing, on his tummy- vestibular input. A child covers his ears when someone squeals. Another kid clearly prefers to play alone. One prefers the spring-riders. Another prefers slides. Some run, some climb, some like to be under the playset in the cozy spaces, others prefer to be out in the open. Some kids play in the dirt. OThers run their fingers through the pine needles. One kid squeaks and squawks to find a smudge upon their hand. Sensory issues. Motor issues. OCD issues. Communication issues.  And these are the \"normal\" kids.  There are so many characters out there today to remind us- and our kids- that \"normal\" is a relative term. Its a spectrum of experience, just like any other. Variance is normal. Being quirky, or even eccentric, is still OK, and has value. There is such a thing as \"having character,\" and it is far more interesting than just being part of the common crowd. Gotta love \"Runt of the Litter\" from  Chicken Little . How about Henry (or Daisy, for that matter) on  Oswald ? We could even bring up  Dopey  or  Beaker . These characters aren't called \"disabled.\" They are who they are, and fit into their worlds in their own ways.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2007", "body": "\n Abfh  has put up a really funny and thoughtful response to one of my favorite essays I use to try to knock a clue into the clueless,  Welcome to Holland.  If you're one of my friends without special needs kids, I recommend reading both essays. They are both wonderful gazes into coping with a life that isn't going as expected.  One thing I mentioned in my comment to abfh is that there is a basic attitude and ignorance problem in the \"normal\" world regarding not only autism, but special needs generally. The example that goes in context here are the parenting and childbirth classes I took when I was pregnant with Joey.  The textbook that came with the class does have a chapter on special needs children. It mostly focuses on problems with premies, but it also mentions things like Down's Syndrome. Autism isn't mentioned at all. The information is mostly about testing, and \"talk to your doctor.\" Thre is very little useful information. The possibility of having a special needs child was only mentioned in passing in the class itself- mostly Down's Syndrome, and a mention that some kids might need some time in the NICU, especially if they are premature.  Why omit this very real and natural possibility? Why not bring it into the discussion, and let expecting parents think about preparing for the possibility? It's like being on a plane to Italy (you knew this part was coming, didn't you) without even having the suggestion that landing in Holland would be a possibility- and in fact, many excited holiday-goers have no clue that a plane routed for Italy could possibly land anywhere but Italy, or even that other countries exist. I mean, what if the plane lands in Lichtenstein (a country of which I am also fond)? I know a lot of people who have never even  heard  of Lichtenstein.  Wouldn't it be far better to note the possibility, so that we can at least take a peek at a tourguide of Holland before getting on the plane, or have an idea of where the embassy might be? But this is not the prevailing attitude \"out there\" in the \"normal\" world. Instead, instructors are concerned about frightening new parents \"unnecessarily.\" Frightening them?  Standing in front of new and expecting parents, I think the first thing to say is \"don't be afraid.\" The second is, \"expect the unexpected.\" Even \"normal\" kids have \"special needs.\" Some people just need more support than others to be able to survive and thrive. A child with special needs- born with them or otherwise- simply needs some extra support. How much depends on the need. What we should be providing is some basic resource information. OK, your kid has special needs... now what?  Parents who themselves have special needs seem to have a firmer grasp on the concept, because the possibility is so very present to them. For people who have never really dealt with special needs and disability, the whole idea is foreign. These are people who have no idea what an \"IEP\" is, have never heard of taking a kid to a neurologist, a gastrologist, an endocrinologist, or may even not know what a perinatologist is. These things are not part of their world. When I spoke, once upon and a long time- over a year- ago, about the day the word \"autism\" came into my life, that is really how it felt. I had  no idea.  And folks, I'm a  very  educated person. I know why people think of Rainman when the word autism drifts in- its the only exposure people had, if they had that much. Nowthere's a couple other pop culture references, but no more real education out there for the general, run-of-the-mill Nellie or Nathan Neurotypical.  People with \"special needs\" and disabilities are different. Different is unknown. Different is scary. But why? Take the fear out of the possibility of having a special needs child. Special needs kids are kids, like all other kids, with their own talents and gifts to offer, and their own lives to live. Don't be afraid. All kids come with challenges.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/07/welcome-to-italy.html", "http://www.our-kids.org/Archives/Holland.html", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Rp65id51XuI/AAAAAAAAAE4/lG7C1fT-t5k/s1600-h/nofear.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/dont-be-afraid.html", "title": "\nDon't Be Afraid\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, July 17, 2007", "body": "\nJoey has been picking up on questions about his day. He's at least starting to understand that we expect him to make some kind of answer, and that saying something to the effect of \"I had fun!\" means the activity is likely to be repeated. He will answer yes and no questions with more or less accuracy, depending on how tired he is and how much of his attention you have.  However, he will not talk about school. Trying to get him to talk at all immediately after school is a lost cause. I am going with the working assumption that he is tired, trying to regain his bearings, and perhaps is simply unable to access language after a lot of hard work. I'll keep you posted as I test this theory, as he gains more ability to communicate with us. Anyway, no point in grilling him immediately after school. I'm lucky to get any words at all.  However, asking him questions about school is generally problematic. If he's really with me and I have his attention, he'll give me scripted responses (What did you do at school today? \"I had fun, Mrs. Huff was at school today, Went to school\" etc.) and will answer all yes/no questions with \"yes\" (Did you sing a song today? Yes. Did you read a story today? Yes. Did you play outside today? Yes. Did you turn your teacher into a frog today? Yes.) For other activities, I get some spontaneous answers. (Did you sing a song in Speech Camp today? Yes- Wheels on the Bus! Did you enjoy swimming today? Yes- sprinklers! Fun!) For school... nada. i have no idea what he's doing this week. The teacher sent me home a note on the first day, but since then, nothing. I find this a little odd, and a little worrying. I could do some more peculation as to why school seems to be a taboo subject for question-answering, but it wouldbe just that- speculation. It's also worrying that I have no way to really supporting the school program at home. If I don't know what songs are being sung or what stories are being read, I can't keep up the theme at home. For example, if they are doing, say, Three Billy Goats Gruff, I can play the Leah's Farm Signing Time more, maybe plan to take him down to Maymount to feed goats this weekend, and read him fairytales with trolls, and talk about fairies and things with him. Or if they are singing \"Wheels on the Bus\" every morning, I can get out his buses and we can sit outside and watch the Fred Bus and the trolley go by, and talk about how people get where they need to go. But I have to wing it.  I'm starting to think he really did turn the teacher into a frog.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-happened-at-school-today.html", "title": "\nWhat happened at school today?\n"},

I want to see the magical world filled with more than just us, and have them have their own struggles with good and evil.  4. I want Ron, Hermione, and Harry to live.  5. I want to know more about the curse that killed Dumbledore's hand. Was he turning into something really bad? Or was it just killing him?  6. I want Molly Weasley to go medieval on somebody's butt. She must be a pretty powerful witch, but we haven't really seen any of it. Ditto for McGonagal.  7. I want to know what Dudley was sweating bullets about when he was attacked by the dementor. What was his worst memory?  8. I want lots and lots more about Lily Potter, and when James learns not to be a little twit.  9. I want to know what happened to Ollivander.  10. I'd like more about Slughorn and the Slytherins. I'd like those shades of grey clarified- being a Slytherin is not being evil, but ambitious and self-serving.  Here's to J.K.

{"date": "Sunday, July 08, 2007", "body": "\nWe had a teaching moment today. Joey has been running out of doors, and today he managed to unlock Grandma's door and run outside. Fortunately, Grandma lives in the middle of nowhere, but in the house I grew up in, so he couldn't get too lost, even if he ran REALLY FAST- but he just wanted to go open and close the car doors. While he was wandering about, though, he managed to pull on Grandma's calla lily, and break it off. I found him slamming a car door with the stalk in his hand.  I managed to remain calm. After all, its just a plant, not a disaster, but I expressed my displeasure and dismay in the situation, and explained that he would have to go inside and explain to Grandma what he had done. Grandma made an excellent show of displeasure and disappointment, and we explained to him that breaking plants and touching other people's things and whatnot was wrong. We talked about the fact that Grandma had planted the plant, and was waiting all summer to see th eflower, and now she never would see it, because the plant was broken. We discussed the fact that when you break a plant, it dies, and can't flower or be green and pretty, but will instead get yellow and go away. We explained that saying sorry wasn't going to bring the plant back, and wasn't going to fix it, and that sorry meant that you wish you had not done something wrong. He seemed to get it- at least that we were upset, and he said he was \"sorry about the plants.\" This was a pretty big jump, for him to at least connect the words to teh apology- he didn't just say \"I'm sorry, Grandma\" but \"I'm sorry about the plants.\"  So, trying to pretend we weren't celebrating the advance in language use, we went home. There was more discussion about responsibility, and not switching to \"Andy broke the plant\", and how important it was for him to tell the truth and say that he broke the plant, and that sort of thing. He kept perseverating on the subject, so we kept working through it. Finally I got the music on (its also good not to dwell too long on such things, so that he will learn we still love him, and that no one is angry or upset forever), and we got home. Allan came down the stairs.  \"Joey, tell Daddy what you did today,\" I said. I kept my tone even, because I didn't want to give him a huge prompt for what to say; we are tryign to teach him to self-narrate, and so far, we've washed out. Joey's usual response to this request, put in any fashion (What did you do today? How was school today? Where have you been this morning? Did you do anything fun today? etc) is to pretend we don't exist. Other requests, he'll at least turn his head or try to answer (even if the words that come out have nothing to do with what you asked), but this idea of constructing his own narrative completely shuts him down. Lately we've started to get some attempts at response, but mostly echoes and responses that have nothing to do with the past, with actions or activities, or anything vaguely resembling a response to the actual request. The closest we've been getting is \"Joey's in the white car!\" which is true, and kind of on topic, so we've been praising it.  \"I went to see Grandma... \" Joy! Jubiliation! Get out the champagne! Call the neighbors! Call Grandma! Chocolate and prize box for all! \"...and I broke the plant. I'm sorry about the plant.\"  My son just told his father what he did today. He answered an open-ended question requesting narrative about past activities. He remembered he broke the plant, and  told his father .

We told him he was goign to see his cousins and go swimming, and we had a joyous chorus of \"Joey's swimming in the water!\" all the way there. It was only an hour and half.   This is one of those days when the idea of Joey being disabled simply isn't in the equation. He simply is who he is. Yes, we had a good bit of tracking today, and that meant he didn't engage with his cousins so much, but he did enjoy seeing them. He loved being in the pool. Andy certainly had a blast hanging out with the \"big boys\" (the boys are actually my cousin's kids, and they are some 4 years older than Joey). The thing was, even if Joey couldn't focus on a game or fully engage with the other guys, he was having fun. He was trackign because he got worn out from all the excitement, but that is just his way. We only had one screaming fit, and that was because Joey could have stayed in the pool for the rest of life and been happy, but he was exhausted  and cold and really needed to get out and get dressed. Like any little kid, he anted to keep doign what was pleasurable, despite falling asleep on his feet.  It didn't matter that he couldn't talk like other 5-year-olds. It didn't matter that he couldn't really socialize like other kids. This was his family, and he could be who he was, just as he was, and that was fine. I wish all my family was like that. Ah, wishes again...  Sometimes you pick your battles. We'll just keep taking him around to the ones who love him, and not inflict the others upon him whenever we can avoid it. He has better things to do. Life is short.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/06/swimming-in-water.html", "title": "\nSwimming in the water\n"},

In an attempt to revitalize my interest in school, I was given a project to landscape a small strip of land between the road and the bus pull-off in front of the school. iI was told the budget and sent off. I measured and made diagrams of the area ot be done. I interviewed landscapers until I found one that would work with me and within my budget. Instead of just planning to stick some trees in a line and stick in some annuals aroudn them, we planned the landscaping to be low-maintenance, able to withstand heavy traffic in case of fire drills and the like. We considered the view both from the school and the street, and came up with textures and line that worked from both directions. We wrote up the contract, and I took it all in to the principal.  Two weeks later, I got off teh bus to see a few trees stuck out in the space in a little line, with annual s stuck in around them. The annuals were promptly trampled three days later, when we had a fire drill. \"Well, we decided to just go ahead and get something in,\" I was told when I asked about my project.

{"date": "Sunday, June 03, 2007", "body": "\nI have two very important opportunities to advocate generally for autistics. I am the chair of the Parent Advisory Committee for our local special ed system, and I am also on the committee that is supposed to be training school personnel about autism. No one who is actually autistic is on either of these committees, yet both have a good deal of power over the lives of autistic children, and even some autistic adults (special ed can rule your life until you turn 23).  I have a friend who was appointed the chair of his department. He took it as the huge honor, that everyone must think so much of him. Itried my best to tell him that being chair of a department is not an honor- it often rotates like a hot potato among faculty members- it is an  opportunity . You have your chance to do things your own way, to get your own ideas heard, to get things you think are important on the agenda.  Being chair of the advisory committee and being on this autism training committee are similarly opportunities. I can stand in front of the school board, the superintendant, the director of student services, the principals, the teachers, and say  anything I want.  Here is an opportunity- and a rsponsibility, What do I say? When do I say it?  So far, my message has been \"disabled people are, first and foremost, people.\" When asked about curing autism and what stance the school should take regarding autism, this has been my answer: Autistic people are people. Treat them with the same respect you expect to receive. They have the same right to be educated that any non-autistic child has. They need the same opportunity to be independent and socially responsible that any non-disabled child has. If a normal child had trouble in reading, you'd provide tutoring, right? So what's the problem with providing the support a disabled child needs to succeed?  This message seemed to be supported by autistic people I knew in person, and was certainly supported by the other parents I know in the system (though admittedly, both are not extensive groups of people, and may not be respresentative.) This is the best I could do... until now.  And now I ask you... now that I have readers who are autistic, raising autistic children, been through the special ed system, and have a wide variety of persepctives of the message to send- if you have the ear of of all the powers-that-be of the school system, what would you say?

{"date": "Monday, May 14, 2007", "body": "\nI had a few minutes with my friend Christine this morning. We haven't seen a lot of each other lately. She's the one with the three hydrocephallic boys, and I have my two little guys, so the two of us are definitely hopping. She needed to go to the grocery store this morning. Andy and I were not doing anything at all, so we picked her up for the ride. I have a rental, because my car is in the shop from being rear-ended, and we thought it might be nice to ride around in a new car for a few minutes after we got out of the store. We drove lazily around town looking at the houses for sale. There are quite a few, because the recent assessments on everyone's property just doubled, and people are being taxed out of town. The problem is, if you sell, where do you go? You have to leave the area. The assessments are obscene, by the way. I have a nice little house. We were very, very lucky to get it, and just a couple years before things started going crazy. It is right in town, and I have made a nice little garden and everything. But it is not worth what this assessment is saying it is worth. Maybe about half. But we're in town, on the east coast,  in teh DC metro area. Apparently large numbers of people want to pay way too much money to live here.  Or do they? Several of these houses have been on the market a while.  Anyway, its not like we're planning to move, but it can be fun to wander around and look at other people's houses and gardens. Some need some work. Others are gorgeous. Oh, look at the gingerbread on THAT one! In the midst of this chatter, plans for summer, goals for the boys for summer, what we are going to do with ourselves in teh fall when Andy- the last of our boys- is actually in school two days a week. Dreams of getting housework done, yardwork done, porches repairs, ramps built, couches recovered. Dreams of time.  Generally, my house looks like a bomb went off in it right before the tornado hit. I am not a housekeeper. I keep my life in mounds and piles. If I have no time, those mounds just keep getting bigger, instead of occasionally disappearing. It is also over-run by toys. this partly because of a lack of time, partly because Joey needs almost constantly supervision. Toys invaded our living and dining rooms because of this, when I kept him occupied while I got things done. And then I stopped being able to do things. Both boys get very, very upset if I do stuff. Its very, very strange. And then keeping them engaged is very important, so I spend a lot of time- poor me- playing with them. ;) Having them be able to spend some time outside by themselves has been lif-changing. I can cook dinner- real dinner- every once in a while. Its nice to have some real food.  We're having tacos tonight. I can divide everything on teh plate, so Joey will eat it- even the meat. Yay for dinner! Once Christina's boys come home, it is a constant schedule of feeding, changing, and trying to get her housework done. The housework usually ends up not happening, but her house always looks neat as a pin.

{"date": "Wednesday, May 09, 2007", "body": "\nI've been reading a lot of blogs lately, and especially  Musings of a Highly Trained Monkey  (did that work? I'm new to this linking thing). Its a blog about working in the ER, and it has a lot of insights about different kinds of people who present themselves to the ER. Around here, ER bashing is a spectator sport. The local hospital is infamous for poor service, overpriced doctors, and sending people home with inappropriate medications. In fact, there's a lot of bashing of other people and complaining and whining that seems to go on here and there in places I've kind given up visiting because now that I have  Autism Hub  blogs to read, and there is a LOT less negativity there. But anyway, on to the random thoughts...  I will never forget the people who came to take care of my Joey when he had the croup and was turning blue. Those were incredible, amazing people. I hope they aren't too surprised when I call and ask if Joey can come see the ambulance station this summer, and thank them personally. They hopped right in, made him feel comfortable, let him know everything was going to be just fine, so that for Joey, it was just a fun adventure by the time we got to the ER. The ER nurse was hilarious. He knew a freaking-out-parent when he saw one. Even the nurse who was changing sheets stopped to talk to Joey and try to find cartoons for him on the TV. These people took a situation that was potentially terrifying for my child, and made it into something that included laughter, smiles, and new friends. They made a situation that was terribly stressful on us and made it a walk in the park. I have no idea if they thought I was some stupid person calling 911 over croup. They seemed to be more interested in the fact that they had a child in their care, and to make that child comfortable. We are forever grateful.  On that note, I'd also like to thank the lady in the grocery store the other day who was trying very hard to get Joey to talk with her. He wasn't feeling that great, so he was echoing the questions instead of answering them, yet she remained pleasant and undeterred. She didn't ask, she didn't frown, and she didn't treat him like an idiot or a spoiled brat. She took him as he was, and when his own words failed him, she provided some, without being annoying.  I'd like to thank the bongo drummer at our church who this last Saturday let Joey get up and actually play the drum with the band while they were performing. You could see that Joey thought this was the coolest moment ever. This person has started bringing kazoos to Saturday servicce for the kids. Joey now has two. He plays them all the time (and so does Andy, when he gets hold of one.) I'd also like to thank the lady who works for Enterprise at our local body shop, who called to get an appropriate vehicle for us and made sure it was waiting for us when we arrived on Tuesday, knowing I had two sick little guys I had to bring with me. I just transferred the carseats and we were on our way. In that vein, I'd like to thank the police officer and the lady that rearended us for being so polite and making a bit of fuss over my boys in making sure they were OK, and telling me how handsome they are. I know how hard it can be to stay nice when you're having a hard day.  And I'd like to thank all the folks who have been leaving me comments here.

This was a bit of a surprise, since his schedule was all screwed up yesterday by a field trip to the elementary school, but I'll take it. :) His ABA therapist said he worked really hard for her, and then his OT was really happy with him- they are making a special project that requires cutting, and apparently he's doing it all by himself- and then our music lesson was brilliant. In the past, Joey hasn't wanted to watch and focus on the teacher, he's just wanted to bang on the drums. Today, he paid attention pretty well and followed the lesson along, and played the rhythms (or at least tried to). I am so proud of him! He even alternated the sticking! What a star! Andy, however, was terribly sick all day. He threw up until about 4 this morning. He kept down some juice and toast for me during the day, but I came home from therapies to a report of a baby throwing up. He slept a lot. He just looked awful. I took him over to the doctor. We have a set of clinics in this area that take walk-ins, and we use them a lot for when the boys are actually sick, because trying to get in to see a doctor around here is always a couple days' wait. I don't know about you, but I certainly wouldn't want a pounding headache-ear infection for two days before I could even get in to a doctor; why would I make a 2-year-old wait two days? I'm probably the kind of parent most docs hate anyway- since my boys can't really tell me what's going on, if they act in certain, unusual ways, I take them in. Tell me its a virus if that's what it is, but please check them, just in case. I think I've been \"wrong\" once- and two days later, we were back with an ear infection. :P  So I take my bundle of dead weight over to our usual clinic. The problem with walk0in clinics is you never know who the doctor is going to be, and they have a rather high rate of turnover and musical-chairs. However, I've never been outright refused service before. They've hired someone who won't see children. What's up with THAT? At a walk-in clinic that a good many folks use as primary care? You're joking, right? But no- I was told to call my pediatrician (why would I be standing in a walk-in clinic if my pediatrician would see me at 7 o'clock on a Thursday night?) or go to the emergency room (um... the kid isn't in mortal danger. He just needs you to look in his ears). Fortunately, there's also a location in the next town over, so we called ahead (in case I ran into traffic and got there after closing) and off we went. Those people saw us just fine. Double ear infection. Start a new round of Zithromax and see what happens. Woo-hoo!  So far, his fever seems o be down, and he's sleeping, and hasn't tossed the medicine back up.

But tonight he would not sit down. Even when they started, all he could do was track, track,track. Track the banister, track the pews, track the cords for the guitars, track a seam in the carpet. Then he wanted to run out to the street, out into the halls, up and down the main aisle. Track. track, track.  This means one thing:  Joey is coming down with something.  This is really depressing, because we just finished a round of antibiotics because he had never recovered from teh croup. It means if he goes to Sunday school tomorrow, he will probably have a bad day and need the director to come be the aide again. We might not go at all, trying to head off the storm. He's already missed a week of school, so his schedule has already been a complete mess.

The Megablocks have larger \"pegs\" like big circles, and he likes to count them. The line-blocks, with three or four of these pegs in a straight row, are the blocks he loves. The rest rot in the toybox (Andy has already moved on to Duplos).  I work on Saturdays. I actually work three jobs, as I teach two places as well, one online and one live. the live class only comes around every couple of years, but I do love it when I have one. The online classes are just OK. Too many students think that having an online course is a lisence to sass the professor or skip the work. Anyway, that's not what I do on Saturdays. On Saturdays, I hole up in my bedroom, in my hubby's oversized recliner, with a computer in my lap, and score GRE writing assessments. (No, I can't tutor anybody, its against my contract. No, I can't grade your essay, its all automated and I have no control over which essays I get. Its all standardized, anyway, so it wouldn't effect your score). On breaks, I do weird stuff like write blog entries and change bedsheets. Its a pretty good deal. Sometimes I even stay in my pajamas for the morning (I'm weird, I like to be dressed).  So I am sitting here, holed up for the day in my comfy chair, when a little face appears at teh door.  The idea of letting the boys come up the stairs without escort is new for us. Joey's motor planning is usually so poor that stairs were a major source of concern and falls. Andy is better, but still, he's not yet 3 years old, and we want to know what he's DOING up here. My house is not exactly clean and neat, and there is plenty of trouble to be found. So much for childproofing.  The other problem with independent stair climbing is that Joey has trouble remember what he came upstairs for, and then just wanders about the upstairs, and finally melts down, because he knows he came up here for something, but what was it? I can sympathize with the frustration there, it happens to me all the time since I was pregnant. If anybody needs anecdotal evicdence that pregnancy causes brain damage, I'm your girl.  So here I am, and aroun the corner comes a little face. \"Hi Joey,\" I say brightly, wondering where Dad is.  \"Red four?\" he replies in a hopeful question. I'm stunned. He came up the stairs, and knows exactly what he wants. And better yet, I happen to know he left his red blocks- a four and a three, his usual set- right here on the chair. HE knew which room he wanted andd everything! \"Do you want your red blocks?\" I ask, to encourage speech.  \"Red blocks.\" Red is Joey's current favorite color. Everything has to be red. I produce the required booty, and the little face lights up. \"RED blocks! Thank you!\" He fetches them from my hand with a kiss, and is gone.  My baby is growing up.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/04/red-blocks.html", "title": "\nRed blocks\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 29, 2007", "body": "\n With a dose of allergy meds, the boys went to church this morning after all. The Sunday School teacher and I had a little chat. Apparently, they've given up on days when the director isn't here to be his aide, and he wanders about and does whatever. Not what I wanted to hear, but they haven't tossed us out yet, so we'll keep working on it. It would be nice to have an aide in there for him, because with his gum, he is able to sit and attend- but still needs a little reminding that the rules apply to him. They also now have too many kids in there to keep track of his sensory stuff, and having someone in there could make sure he got his vibrator or his gum or his chair cushion when he needed it, and teach him to get these things for himself. But he makes it through, he's in with kids his own age, and nobody's gotten hurt. So that's a good thing.  The boys were still antsy, so I took them out to Wakefield. This is a regular trip for us, I'm sure I've blogged about it before, but I'm no going to swim through right now to check, and for those of you who just pick up blogs where they are, I'll save you from wading as well. Wakefield is the birthplace of George Washington. It is a working colonial farm, with animals and everything. It's also a pretty safe place to let the boys run, and not a lot of people go there. So we go there a lot when the weather is good. I took some pictures today of things to make up a nature walk list, and while I was at it, I took lots of boy pictures and movies. They like seeing themselves on the TV, so I thought I'd make a little DVD. Besides, its calming. This is the calm before the week's storm...  We've decided that putting Joey into the speech and OT camps is the best option for him. Its going to be a little rough on me, and I have to figure out what to do with Andy (as in, what we can do together, not what shelf I am going to put him on), but if he can do intensive therapy this summer, maybe we can at least get him going with using his sensory book himself, make sure he can dress and undress himself, and do some other things in groups and independently, that will help him in kindergarden. I can also control his schedule better, so I can do the brushing and work on the oral issues (ie, get him to eat more foods). So this week I'm going to call up and say, \"Since you guys were ammenable to this- this is what will happen.\" I expect them to promptly start having small bovines. If they don't, you'll be sure to know.  Because the boys can run at Wakefield, I end up taking a lot of photos of their backs. It seems strange for them to be walking on ahead like that. Most places, I have to have them firmly by their hands, so I mostly see the tops of their heads. At Wakefield, they run on ahead, checking out their freedom and the world around them. My boys get a chance to grow up a bit.  I like going to Wakefield. I think they do, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RjVGIDfQVXI/AAAAAAAAABI/Elj8YFj1sFw/s1600-h/07_boys_culvert2.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RjVJ5TfQVYI/AAAAAAAAABQ/E-LXOKpV_5Q/s1600-h/07_boys_leaving1.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/04/another-happy-sunday.html", "title": "\nAnother Happy Sunday\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, May 01, 2007", "body": "\nEvery day I am amazed by the rampant disabilism in special education. Here is an education system that is supposed to be designed to help, to support, to give these kids a chance to live independently and get an education; but instead you get full-pitched battles for resources that are not only limited, but designed to meet needs your kid doesn't really have (and in fact, I am finding most of the kids in the system don't have.) Special education here is designed for severe mental retardation- so long as you don't also have a physical disability. We have a brand-new school here, an upper elementary built from scratch over the last two years. I have a friend who has two severely physically disabled children- whether they are mentally retarded as well is a matter of debate, since their physical disabilities make it impossible for them to acquire speech- and they are debating whether or not to send them to the new upper elementary school. Apparently, the special education classroom would have to be altered to accomodate them because of their wheelchairs and physical therapy needs.  Why? These people were aware of these kids in their system when construction- and even design- began. Besides, they likely won't be the only kids in wheelchairs they'll ever have. Why, in this day and age, would you design a BRAND NEW SCHOOL that is not fully accessible?  Now, let's go back to the speech thing. These kids' mouths are not formed properly, and speech is probably physically impossible for them (I defer to her expetise of the mom in this matter; I don't know the particulars). Little attempt has been made to give them an alternate form of communication. You'd think the school would work hard to give them some form of communication, even if it is simple switches or large buttons with pre-recorded phrases, so that these guys could at least communicate some of their needs. I am thinking seriously of buying such buttons for them for the summer, and having my cousin's boys (who are about the same age) record simple messages (like \"yes, please!\" and \"no, thank you\") and see if these guys would use them. They are 8 years old, and have no way to tell their mom they need something, other than tugging on her clothes. And why? Because they can't speak, they're not supposed to communicate?  These are the challenges of two boys who have obvious, clearly visible disabilities. People know they need help, it is blatantly obvious they need skills, accomodations, equipment, nursing care, aides, respite, the works. They have terrible problems getting these things. It took them years to get medicaid waivers. The school doesn't recognize their skill needs, and they have no academic goals for them- any progress is considered sufficient. I can only assume that is because such severely disabled children are not usually expected to live to see Upper Elementary- by people without disabilities. They are \"low functioning\" and will \"always be dependent\"... so the attitude- more or less subtle- is, \"why waste resources on them\"?  Skip to my own child. Joey talks. If you are not familiar with Oobi, Little Bear, Pinky Dinky Doo, Blue's Clues, Cars, Toy Story, and Franklin, you might miss that every word he says is based on words he's heard before. He likes other children, and has some stock phrases to start contact, but then he doesn't know what to do, especially if a children reacts in an unusual way- which is any way other than how Andy would react. He knows his letter, his numbers, his colors, can write his name, and can match and sort and make patterns- if you can get him to sit down long enough to show you. What chance has this child, whose disability is not so apparent, have at getting accomodations in a world that wants him to be invisible?  At least, they say they want him to be invisible- but then won't address anything that is actually visible, or do it ways hat would be sublte and acceptable in a \"mainstream\" environment. Needs to chew? Gum is a no-no, lets give him a chew toy. That chewing gum is far more \"invisible\" than having a plastic tube in you mouth is beside the point. And who needs brushing? That takes too much time, it has to be done every two hours, after all! Food issues are the parents' problem- we put the food we are serving in front of him. But you want to send in food? That's too much work for the teacher and aide. Social skills? Toss him in the gym with the HeadStart kids and hope he figures it out! After all, that's how other kids learn social skills...  And these people are special educators- he's in self-contained environment, not even an inclusion setting!  What is disabilism? It is an attitude that people who are not facing the challenges of disability are inherently superior. That their ways of coping and interacting are innately superior and preferred. That people with disabilities are, somehow, not as human, and have less right to try for independence and education. That people without a disability somehow know what is right and proper for people who do. That people who need support and accomodation are somehow children; or if they are children, that they are babies.  It is also the assumption that people shouldn't need to be accommodated, shouldn't need support, shouldn't have \"special needs.\" The shock special education personnel keep displaying that their kids might have special needs is discouraging. How far would their day get without their coffee? Their few minutes of favorite music? Perhaps a cushion on the driver's seat, or hot water in their shower? Perhaps they like their food a certain temperature? We all need to be accomodated in certain ways to cope with living and functioning. To say my child's accomodations are unacceptable, just because they are unusual or different, is ridiculous. To deny him education in learning to self-regulate is equally ridiculous. It is discrimination.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/day-against-disabilism.html", "title": "\nA Day Against Disabilism\n"},

He likes letters, it is comforting for him, and he's been learning to write letters, spell words, and make sounds. the words are the funniest. It has a setting where you can spell out three-letter words, and if it is a word, the toy tells you the word and praises you (K...I...D... spells... Kid! Great job!) When Joey, pressing random letters, discovers not only a word, but a word he knows, he just beams with delight. D-O-G! Dog! Wow!  The problem is that he is starting to perseverate on it. Instead of doing his work, he is echoing the toy. Instead of participating in class, he echoes the toy. Instead of interacting with the world around him, he echoes the toy.  Hence the seeking of a doctor yesterday. Is he uncomfortable, maybe sick? Is he using this toy to comfort himself because he is uncomfortable, unhappy, afraid? Is there something wrong at school? Are we doing something that is making him want t retreat into reciting, echoing, letters? With all the advances he has made, he still can't tell us. He thinks the question \"Are you OK?\" is, without fail, \"I'm OK.\" Its a form... and increasingly boring one... not communication.  I meet with the school OT in the morning. I haven't much faith. This woman and I have personality clash issues in the first place, and now she's threatening my kid... and has actively worked to deny him service.

We think it started with Cookie Monster, devouring cookies and letting the crumbs drop everywhere. It's turned into something of a problem.  Telling him to stop is also a problem. One of the sure signs that the behavior is not appropriate: try to stop it, and complete meltdown ensues.  All in all, we're pretty lucky with Joey. He doesn't tantrum much; in fact, he's usually an easy-going little guy. When he does melt down, it's complete pandemonium. He screams with teh frustration and aggravation. He tosses himself on furniture or the floor. He throws things in all directions. If you try to restrain him, he beats on you. The entire day is shot with your nerves. Ever had someone get less than an inch from your face and just unleash their lungs?  Sometimes I forget that Joey is autistic, or disabled. Perhaps I want to forget. Perhaps he's just such a sweet little thing, and I'm just so used to him being who he is, it just doesn;t even cross my mind. Then there are the meltdowns. It becomes so mind-bendingly obvious that its not right. I've seen normal kids have tantrums. They are nothing compared to Joey, and are over before Joey even gets going. Even Andy stomps his feet and cries when he can't have another potato chip or has to go to bed- nothing compared to a Joey Meltdown.  There has to be something we can do to help him, to give him some tools to be able to calm himself down; but I have no idea what to do for him. We hug him mightily when it is all over, but what else can be done? We can't let him drown in these repetative, unappropriate actions. He drifts away into them, and we can't afford drifting. Its not like a normal kid, who vegs to process and rest. Joey just disappears. We lose simple skills. He talks less. He does less.

For those of you not familiar with sensory diet, this is a series of strategies to deal with Joey's sensory integration issues. Joey has been displaying some disruptive behaviors lately- clicking, scripting, etc. If you give him a peice of gum, it stops; he gets the oral sensory input he needs. Seems simple, yes?  Apparently not.  The note I got back from the school OT was that she finds it effective to put her fingers on his throat and tell him \"stop.\"Will he swallow the gum?  What will they tell the other children about the gum? And they don't allow gum in regular classrooms.  Hello?  I doubt this woman wants to run after my son all day with her fingers on his throat, so the intervention she is recommending is not functional. Swallowing gum is not fatal. What do they tell children about other people's needs- such as chocolate for a diabetic, or special lunches for children with allergies? And what do I care what they allow in \"regular classrooms\"? For one, he isn't in one, and for two, inclusion classrooms should have no toruble accomodating such a simple strategy! What the HELL??? So I called the teacher. That went OK.

We decided to drive- neither Allan nor I could imagine Joey in an airplane- and that was BEFORE he threw up while we were driving over the mountains. Nope. No planes for now.  However, car sickness is a normal problem for small kids. It was a trip that reminded us just how disabled Joey is. I hate trips like that. I far prefer the ones where I never even think about it, where its weeks later and I think \"wow, he did really well that day\" or when I am telling someone else what we did, all I remember is how much fun he had. Not that it was a bad trip; he enjoyed the dogs at Granny's and the slumber parties in the hotel rooms and all, but there were those little prickles of \"this isn't right\" and \"normal kids don't do this.\"  The stopped at the Nashville zoo. Andy LOVED it. Its really a lovely zoo, I recommend it. Its shady and comfortable and they are doing a fabulous job. But Joey's main concern was riding in the rented stroller. He didn't want to look at the elephants or anything. I guess I could say he liked the meerkats, and the alligators, but anything that was any distance from the fence, forget it. Andy was straining over the fences to watch; Joey was wondering why the stroller wasn't moving, and how he could get it to move.  Then there was the dinner meltdown. Our second dinner at Granny's was late- significantly late, like 8 pm instead 6pm late. Any kid would have been grumpy. Andy was grumpy. But Joey just lost it completely. He was too hungry to eat. The dogs were all over him. Allan's sister was clearly annoyed with us. What my mother-in-law and father-in-law thought I have not the foggiest, I was afraid to even look, and I think they were trying to be tactfully silent. It was disaster.  While I'm at this point, I really wish I was better at describing Joey's meltdowns. When I tell these kinds of stories to my friends and relations, I often get told that most kids \"meltdown\" and would in a similar situation. I understand that concept, but clearly I am not communicating how Joey's meltdown is so different compared to what I see other kids do. When other kids meltdown, it is unpleasant, probably annoying to people who have never had children or are long done with them, and grates the parents' nerves. When my child melts down, the earth stops spinning and explodes. Partly this is because of my perspective- Joey is MY child, and having him freak out is very heart-wrenching for me. However, it really does seem to be far more violent than anything I have seen \"normal\" kids do anywhere, and its a different sort of unrelenting screaming, kicking, frustration to the core. When Andy melts down, no one is in immediate danger of losing one's mind or severe injury, he never purposely gets into my face and empties his lungs (and there is no doubt of the strength of Andy's lungs), the vibes of frustration are superficial and in the moment. When Joey melts down, his whole person seems to explode.

Now Andy gets his! And having him talk about likes and dislikes is odd, too. The way we know what does dislikes is because of the fuss he makes. Andy tells us. Very strange- and wonderful! I was in New Jersey this week for my job, and Allan had the guys. Joey uses the potty nicely for Dad... wish he would get on that potty for me! Or perhaps just with less fussing. Fuss fuss fuss! All that energy wasted!  They guys have been watching Disney movies this week, too. Movies Joey wouldn't even look at, Andy is enthralled.

{"date": "Thursday, May 11, 2006", "body": "\nOK, this is my peeve of the day: thimerasol fascists.  When one is dealing with other parents of children with autism, you find a large pool of people who are depressed, in shock, in disbelief, scared, worried, exhausted (both physically and emotionally), angry (or as my son would insist, \"furious\"), and generally in not good shape. And those are the folks who have been dealing with this for a while- the people who are just getting into this with this diagnosis are in worse shape. You end up meeting a lot of people who insist that what happened to their child and what works for their child is what happened to and will work for your child. Unfortunately, some of these things are not useful for Joey, would be dangerous, or are simply bogus in the first place.  I can understand wanting to  DO SOMETHING.  That is one of my mechanisms for coping, too. When the doctors are telling you to try medicines, diets, shots, exercises, therapies... you try them. I can also understand wanting to share strategies that work for your child with other parents. That's very kind and helpful, and a compassion for other people. But I do not understand people who not only insist you do what they do, or believe what they believe, or experience what they experience, but get downright ugly about it when you don't.  The worst of these for today are the thimerasol fascists. These are the people who believe that thimerasol is to blame for autism. Thimerasol is a preservative that is/was used in vaccinations, and it contains a type of mercury that drug companies insist is harmless (as opposed to the kind that makes you Mad as a Hatter). Personally, I think anyone who thinks putting mercury into a child's system is a good idea is just plain nuts. Even if is was safe to do, most folks don't know there are different kinds of mercury, and the perception of danger alone would be enough for me to question its use. However, I seriously doubt it is safe. It is still used for flu vaccinations.  However, I knew thimerasol was bad news when I was pregnant. Joey has never had any. NEVER.  NONE . He never had a flu shot, because he's allergic to eggs. My doctor and I discussed the problem and she had stopped using vaccines with thimerasol in them before Joey was born. Thimerasol did not cause Joey's autism.  Thimerasol fascists don't seem to care about Joey's lack of exposure. To them, thimerasol is the problem, the rest of us be damned. I'm not saying thimerasol isn't a problem. I'm not saying that mercury exposure is not a cause of autism. I'm not saying there doesn't need to be a push to end its use. I'm just saying it isn't the only cause. We need to look at all the causes of autism, all the strategies for treating it, and do what needs to be done for our children- ALL of our children. Research needs to explore not only thimerasol and mercury poisoning, but other possibilities- genetic problems, other environmental factors, even possible causes during pregnancy.  Thimerasol fascists are closely following on my peeve list with Diet Fascists (who insist that  ALL  autistic children need to gluten and casein free), ABA Fascists (and Joey gets ABA therapy, so I know it works for us- but for everyone? I'm not convinced), and Medicine Fascists (sorry, Joey is not on any medications for his autism. He doesn't need any.). If these things work for you, then fabulous! I'm glad for you! But getting nasty when I say Joey is not in 40 hours of ABA therapy per week, eats bread and cheese, and doesn't take any medicines is really not necessary. Honestly. He's my kid, and I'll do what works for HIM.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/05/thimerasol-fascists.html", "title": "\nThimerasol Fascists\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 11, 2006", "body": "\nI have a horrible habit f wakin gup about one in the morning with the realization that no one is going to help Joey. The school personnel couldn't care less- in fact, they seem to be actively trying to deny Joey services that everyone else says he needs. I hired some private therapists, but they seem more interested in their paperwork than in tailoring a program from Joey's training and education. I am not a trained speech or occupational therapist or special educator.  When I was in India, I had an IndRail pass. There was extensive flooding in an area I was scheduled to visit. I went to the train office to change my reservation, and the people there told me incedulously that since I had an IndRail pass, I could get on and off the train at will, what was I bothering them for? Just tell the conductor I wanted to stay on the train, no problem. They refused to change my reservation. When I did as I had benn told and mentioned to the conductor that I wanted to remain on the train past my reservation stop, I was told this was impossible, I *had* to get off the train, IndRail pass or no. In the end, after being nice, being polite, being firm, being slightly sharp, I finally had to scream, cry and stomp my feet for them to do what I was told was not only the possible, but the only option. I find throwing a fit to be rude, dehumanizing, undignified, and embarrassing. However, getting off teh train at my original stop was putting my life- and the lives of my traveling companions- at great risk. I did what was needful, and will never forget. Was the conductor to blame, or the people in the train office? The attitude at the train office seemed to be that why should they work when I, as a westerner, could scream and yell at teh conductor to get what I wanted? But to me, forcing me to scream and yell is the ultimate insult. It shows clear disrespect not only for me, but for that train conductor, who was doing his job; the train office people had the power to change the reservation and avoid the problem, and chose not to.  School personnel are like train office people in India. They only do what you scream, stomp, cry, and yell for. They complain about parents not coming for meetings, but considering the abuse *I* get at IEP meetings, I can't say I blame other parents for saving their sanity and not wasting their time on them. I came to teh last meeting with a letter from Joey's doctor, the latest research on autism, and an analysis of Joey previous educational experience, as well as the extra training in autism and strategies for autism provided by teh department of education. All of these were promptly dismissed as \"not individualized.\" Excuse me? Is my doctor not an appropriate expert on my child? Is my only real option to put my child in a specialized, private school? There is something inherently wrong with a special education system that has no intention of providing students with the same opportunity at independent living that is provided to \"normal\" students. The goal of special education here seems to be to keep kids- especially high-functioning ones- in special education.  So I lay awake at night realizing this time next year, I will be stomping my feet, losing sleep, and spending whole days in tears over the definition of \"Least Restrictive Environment\" and the fact that the school would rather my child rot in a ditch than provide his teacher with a paraprofessional (to the lay world, an aide) to help him/her teach Joey the basics of kindergarden curriculum. Joey's problem is not socialization- he LOVES other kids and WANTS to play and please his teachers- his problem is communication. Its a gap that could well be bridged with the simple addition of a paraprofessional to the classroom, so that Joey's communication problem do not interfere with the education and experience of non-disableed children in his classroom. In fact, such a paraprofessional would be good for everyone in the classroom- they help the teacher, not the individual student. But I want Joey;s teacher to have one, I will probably have to hire a lawyer. I'm sorry, that's just wrong. I need that money to provide Joey with extra therapies at home, so that he won't have to be in special education forever. I do my part. Why can't the school do theirs?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/05/another-day-another-sleepless-night.html", "title": "\nAnother day, another sleepless night.\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 09, 2006", "body": "\nI will never forget the day the word \"autism\" became part of my life.  I was sitting in a small, windowless room, trying to keep my three-month-old baby from crying by rocking his stroller, watching my two-year-old baby not react to anything the speech pathologist was doing. He had picked up a small car that she had gotten out of a little showbox, and nothing she did could detract him from it. She rang a bell behind her back- no reaction. She asked him questions. Nothing. She asked him to feed a bear, play with another toy, hand her an object. Nothing.  The adventure had actually begin two months before my second son was born. Joey had been quite the star at each of his check-ups; every milestone the doctor had asked about had been acheieved with flying colors. He always smiled, laughed, and seemed to be a happy kid, sitting on the examination table or opening all the cabinets and slamming them closed. His two-year appointment was markedly different. For one, Joey had taken to being fascinated with the edges of things, and wandered about the room with his eyes less than an inch from the edges of the countertops and windowsills. But all kids have eccentricities, right? Then came the big question: was he talking?  Joey never spoke. Before you launch into your favorite my-cousin's-best-friend's-first-child-didn't-talk-until-he-was-four story, unless that child had a serious speech problem, it isn't the same thing. Most kids who speak late say things like \"mama\" and \"dada\". They point to objects they want. They pull on your pantleg and let you know they want a cookie. If they are hungry or thirsty, they let you know its time to eat. They wave bye-bye.  Joey did not do any of these things. He was just as happy to shop all afternoon, even if lunch was late. He had never pointed to anything in his life. If he was unhappy (especially if we were encouraging him to speak for a treat or redirecting him from an activity), he would prostrate himself on the floor in a howling tantrum we called the \"I'm Not Worthy\". If you waved at him, he looked at you like you were nuts. This child did not just \"not speak\"- he did not communicate.  However, he was clearly a happy, affectionate little guy. He would hug and kiss me if I asked him to. He made facial expressions, he laughed, he threw his toys around. He wasn't doing things like jumping, but kids develop at different rates, so there was no real alarm. The doctor told us to see if the birth of the baby would have any effect- perhaps having a need for attention would spur him into speaking.  At the baby's six-week check-up, things were not just not better, but they seemed to be getting oddly worse. He was still a happy little guy, but a quieter little guy who smiled less. He still loved edges, spinning balls (which he did himself), and slamming doors. We decided we needed some help- we were obviously spoiling him, and we could use some pointers for how to get him talking. Off to the speech pathologist! Which brings us back to me rocking a stroller, watching my son ignore said speech pathologist. She looked up at me.  \"I don't know you,\" she explained with an odd look on her face that made me uncomfortable. \"How blunt do you want me to be?\"  \"You might as well be blunt,\" I had responded, as if the words were coming from somehwere about four inches behind my head. She thought for just a moment. That pause marked a change in my life, in my sons' lives, in our whole future. It was the calm before the storm.  There were other words that emerged from her lips, but the ones I will always remember were: \"Your son is either profundly deaf, or profoundly autistic.\"  I am an educated person, In fact, I have two master's degrees and a PhD. When I got pregnant, it was done with careful planning and education; my husband and I read books about child development, child psychology, parenting, and pregnancy. We took courses on breastfeeding, first aid, and parenting. We made the choice to have children; an educated, informed choice. We even knew there would be a second child, because the research we knew indicated that having a second child was a benefit to both children.  Nowhere in anything we read, any class we took, any website we examined, had we come across autism as any more than a passing possibility. We knew enough about it to ask our doctor about Joey's vaccinations and thimerasol, but that was about it. It was a word that was relegated to the shadows of statistical improbability. We had no family history of problems. Joey had no thimerasol shots. He head grew normally. He was happy and affectionate. There were no red flags for us, until the flag was slapped in my face on August 31, 2004.   So this blog is about living with autism. My Joey is not just an autistic child; autism is a fact of our entire family. It pervades our lives in a way that can only be compared to the way having a child in and of itself pervades your life. Its like the toys that lay scattered not just in the bedrooms, but also in my livingroom, my kitchen, my diningroom, my bathrooms, and even what was once our basement recroom (and is now Joey's therapy room). Even our front porch, back deck, and yard have the presence of toys. Trying to put them away is useless; I might be able to fool someone for an afternoon that I don't have small children, but why would I? Even when everything is put away, you turn around and step on a matchbox car.

Its was a good segment, better than the normal \"what is autism?\" segments you see, because it shows these kids respond to therapies, and presented the therapies that were working for the child. It also did not even try to answer the question of cause, which I found very nice.  The fact that our school system does not have paraprofessionals for their inclusion classrooms is very disturbing. This leaves it up to each parent to request one for their child's IEP. Requesting anything for an IEP means going to war with the school- at least it always has before.

Having me stay with him is a phase he slides in and out of; in a couple of weeks, he'll complain about me staying. The light thing is a little more worrisome. Summer is a long few months of waiting until 9 to be able to clean, work with my students, or take a shower.  Showers are one thing that has become a trade-able commodity in our household. There is little chance of getting one while Joey is awake, because he needs to be constantly supervised now that he can get out of his child-safe room. However, now that he is up constantly from 6 am to 9 pm, that doesn't leave much time for both a shower and sleeping. At least Andy still naps. But getting in showers this summer should be very interesting- there are only so many hours in a day. Sleep is another one of those valuable commodities, but I have insomnia on my side. However, if I don't get some sleep, its very hard to deal with Joey screaming the next day... and poor Andy! He's VERY two. That takes some patience to deal with, too. Plus, he imitates his brother- in fact, I often now have to go look to see who is raising the ruckus.  The fun part of all this is that I get to snuggle Joey to sleep. Allan gets to snuggle Andy to sleep (and Andy is now in his Big Bed, and very happy about it, which helps, too). Tonight we sang some songs together (would I have guess a year ago that my Joey would be singing songs now?) after reading some stories, and he settled himself and got to sleep. What a cutie. We're SO lucky that he likes being hugged and squished. I can't imagine the nightmare of having a child who didn't like being touched. Joey is into the hugging. I should probably get him a weighted vest when he gets a little older, but for now, I can hug him, and his teachers can hug him, and he really feels so much better.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/05/bedtime-and-showers.html", "title": "\nBedtime and Showers\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, May 28, 2006", "body": "\n One of my acquaintences sends me regular articles on research being done about autism. Most of it pertains to the thimerasol problem, but today's is about the MMR vaccine. Apparently, some autistic children \"with bowel disorders\" get the virus used in the vaccine stuck in their intestine. The conclusion is that this may cause autism, because they are looking at children who appeared to be developingnormally up to 12-18 months, when the vaccine is given.  Ok, I'll take the possibility, but there are logical problems with the brief report. For one, there is nothing about non-autistic children with bowel disorders- do they get this vaccine stuck in their intestines? Are bowel disorders- or the bowel disorders they are noting- exclusive to autistic children? If they are, then couldn't the disorder being causing the autism? What about children who were not developing normally before 12-18 months? Had you asked me if Joey was normal when he was 18 months old, I might have said yes; but now viewing our home movies, the autism seems pretty obvious to me. What is causing the autism of kids who are autistic before they get the shot? Could those children considered to have \"regressive autism\" actually have just gone undetected, and the autism just started to become more obvious at this age, when the problems of autism start coming into play, because you start expecting things like communication, increased fine motor and gross motor skills, and increased socialization (and these things just don't happen, or start happening in abnormal ways)?  The other conclusion is that this supports a \"causal link\" between MMR and \"painful gut disorders\" in autistic children. This is more logical, and yet still correllational, not causal. Did those disorders exist before the shot, causing the virus to build up? Does the virus cause painful effects of any kind? These things aren't really addressed. Does it cause problems in non-autistic children with these \"gut disorders\"?  As someone still searching for the \"why?\", these types of reports aren't giving me any answers. I hope they are giving SOMEONE answers, because then we can do something for other kids who may really be being impacted by vaccines, but my kid wasn't.

What am I going to do with this child all summer?  I mean, I can do lots of the regular stuff- days at the pool (though how I am going to manage a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old at a public pool is beyond me), mornings at the playground, rainy days with the playdough. Then we'll have our other stuff- Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at speech therapy, Thursday morning at Wee Time. But I feel like other familiaes have the luxury of allowing their kids to languish during the steamy summer days; we can't do that. Joey is too desperately behind in language skills to let any precious bit of them go.  Sometimes I forget how far behind Joey really is, because I am busy rejoicing in what he is doing. The other night I was tucking him in bed and asked 'What song do you want? Do you want 'Wheels on the Bus'?\" and was thrilled to hear the reply: \"No. How about 'Michael Row the Boat Ashore'?\" That's no script. That's not echo. That was a real response!!! And then I see other families in stores and playgrounds, having real conversations with their kids, and finding out the kid is only 3 years old... that's when I remember how much work we have to do, and how much work the poor child is doing just to try to get above the waterline.  So I am working on activities that encourage him to talk. I am hoping to get him interested in stories and creating stories, maybe even making small books. Somewhere I have some books with very simple narratives, I might pull them out for models. Get him thinking about story. He needs to be able to relate to what happened and what he has done during the day, and be able to talk about it. Dealing with conversations, not so sure what to do for that.  Ah, summer.

Basically, I show him the workpage, try to show him what he needs to do, and then use a DTT method of teaching him to communicate the skills he already has. He needs to be able to follow directions and complete worksheets to get through school.  I got him to teh table by enticing him with playdough. It was a good strategy- he wouldn't just come sit, especially when he saw there was going to be work involved, but teh playdough got him right to the table. Then we went through four activities. I thought we did really well. He only melted down twice in a major way, and just a few small frustration incidents. Not too bad.

I'm sure my therapist would say I'm in search connection, understanding, empathy, whatever. That's not the point- is it?  Usually when I read them, I cry. I do that a lot. I've ot some friends who will be surprised; I have other friends who will be thinking \"again? That's not news.\" But there is something about knowing someone else had the sudden, wrenching, horrible moment I had when the word \"autism\" first fell from someone's lips, and they were talking about MY son. MY baby. MY sweet little darling boy who loved to give me a kiss, loved to tickle his baby brother's toes, loved cottage cheese with lima beans, loved knocking over block towers, loved getting raspberries on his tummy. I cannot tell you what a strange, other-worldly experience that is. It takes a while for the shock to wave off, and to realize once again that nothing has really changed, you're getting the help your baby needs instead of gliding about in blissful ignorance. Joey is still Joey. He didn't change. I did. The pain is actually useful for me. Its a reminder that there is work to be done. It can be very easy to slip back into teh habits of ignorance. Before we knew, we could easily \"read\" Joey, and know what he wanted. We could attribute strange behavior to eccentricity of childhood. But then there's that pain, that flash of agony that says \"move your butt, or he won't have a chance at a normal life. Move your butt, and at least he'll have a shot at independence.\"  Joey is considered mildly autistic. I can't imagine what someone with a severely austistic child feels like, or how they cope with that kind of devastation. If my moving my butt is just to give Joey a _shot_ at normal living... and remember, he may not, even as mild as he is, ever live independently. If I stall and don't do what is needful, he won't even have a chance at it- if I do everything right, he still may not ever live an independent life. Every minute counts. It can be very hard to try to get other people to understand that- even people who are supposed to understand and be helping, like school folks, therapists, family.  Every minute counts.

They have some room to run without Mom having to freak about the boys getting lost, snatched, or into serious trouble. They get to see sheep and pigs and cows and horses. I get to sit on a bench for five minutes.  The big discovery for today was walnuts. Wakefield has these huge, lovely walnut trees, and they drop walnuts. To a two-year-old and a four-year-old, large green walnuts look like india-rubber balls. They are apparently great for rolling, knocking together, putting on your head, putting on Mom's head, and tossing high into the air and seeing who can avoid it landing on their head. Wonderful things. Who needs toys? Just get yourself a nnice, shady walnut tree, and you're all set.  Joey has been doing some real conversing lately, and we're thrilled. He tells me he's hungry. \"I'm hungry. I want goldfish.\" He asks what we're doing when we leave him at bedtime (\"Daddy, what ya doin'?\"). We actually have some back-and-forth conversations! (\"I'm hungry.\" \"What do you want to eat?\" \"I want goldfish!\" \"Would you like to have goldfish or mac-and-cheese?\" \"Mac and Cheese, please!\"). It makes me cry just thinking about it!

However, I'm not always the one putting him to bed. We're not sure how to wean him off of us as a comfort object. We can't just close the door and keep him in his room like we used to when he'd have these spells.  Last night, we must have had the TV too loud- we were watching Miss Marple, and it wasn't nearly time for Joey to creep into the room- and yet there he was. Poor thing! He was so tired, and just wanted to lay in bed with us. We finally got him back to his own bed.  But the biggest news around here is Andy pee-ed on the potty!

{"date": "Wednesday, May 24, 2006", "body": "\nWhen your life is whirlwind, sometimes its nice to realize that a little breeze is a normal thing. Sometimes I'm thankful for wierd things, I guess. I often think how lucky I am to have my Joey and my Andy. They are both little sweethearts, with big blue eyes and hugs to share. Sometimes I think how lucky we are with Joey. For all the problems and storms we are living through, Joey is really not too bad off. He's got a real shot at living a normal life in the long run (provided I do the needful now). So many of the other kids in Joey's school won't have that chance. But most often, I am hit with the realization that a problem I am having with Joey is a normal problem- a problem any parent would have, and I find myself grateful for it- for the problem. A normal problem means a normal kid. The more normal problems I have, the better.  So many of Joey's problems are automatically attributed to his disability. Granted, his disability often exacerbates an otherwise normal problem. He melts down faster, he had some sensory issues, but by and large, I feel like many of Joey's specialists and teachers either forget he is disabled, or the over-atrribute to disability. Joey is four years old. Normal four year olds don't like bedtime. They dislike broccoli. They don't want to leave Chuck E. Cheese's. They want the same story read over and over. They want to watch TV all afternoon. These are normal problems. Hallelujah, my child is four! Most four year olds need transition cues. Joey may need more than other kids, but needing cues is normal. Most four-year-olds have foods they dislike, Joey just has more than usual- but wanting to eat M&C every night for a week is a normal toddler/preschooler behavior.  So I often try to keep in mind what Joey's teacher told me last year: it really doesn't matter what's normal and what's the autism, as long as we teach Joey was is appropriate and what is not. Inappropriate behaviors need to go away, even if they are normal for his age; appropriate behaviors need to be encouraged, no matter his disability.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/05/normal-problems.html", "title": "\nNormal problems\n"},

In fact, he loves it so much, I thought I'd take him downtown to the music store, so he could get an idea of where Sylvester lives. It was a huge success. He pointed out guitars, drums, violins, and even ukeleles; and I showed him a cello, which he thought was really cool.

Yes, he tracks. Not much to be done for that, especially since he can be very sneaky about it. OK, he's echolalic. At least he's putting the echoed words into an appropriate context much of the time. He's doing better, but he's clearly not talking at the level of a normal four-year-old. When kids ask him questions, he just stares at them blankly. Is that a social issue, or a communication issue?

We started off with Joey being with Dad and Andy being with Mom. That lasted about ten minutes. Andy loved each and every exhibit- he could have spent hours staring at manta rays, or at a live crab, or at a clown fish in an anemone. Joey had a bit more of a problem.  Imagine you are someone who is used to light, bright places with very few people, and get nervous if you can't see Mom and Dad. Now, imagine you are shoved into a very small, dark room full of strange people and watery, bubbly noises. Sound scary? Place autism on top of that. You can imagine how my day went.  It could have been worse. He loved the escalators. At each level, he would freak out at the beginning, and end up a screaming heap on the floor; I would sit with him a few minutes, maybe get him to look at a fish. Then we'd have to move. Start the process over. Repeat at least twice, when we could finally reach the escalator. Boy instantly transforms into angel. Get off escalator, and enter a cramped, dark room. Repeat for four levels. Now we're at the top of the coral reef. I probably should have taken him into the Rain Forest, where it was lighter; but my brain calculated open spaces with lives things and wild noises, crammed with people, next to a fairly quiet, mostly abandoned coral reef exihibit, and I made my choice. At each level, we had renewed meltdown. Repeat four times.  Fortunately, he liked sitting in the cafe, and he liked the frogs a little better- but he was really tired by then, and in his \"no-no-no\" mode. We did better with teh dolphin show, but it was the worst, most boring dolphin show I had ever seen. We finally got out in one peice.  Andy was sad to go. He had melted down when we first stepped into teh street from the parking garage. He had never been in a city like that before, and the tall buildings were just overwhelming. We let him sit for a minute with some assurances, and he got over it. Joey doesn't get over it.

Then there are days like today, when I think, hey, he's a hard-working, sweet little guy! People like him! He's going to make it!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/09/back-to-school.html", "title": "\nBack to School\n"},

School starting is always interesting, but we've also had a new speech therapist, the return of Joey's ABA therapists. We also had the OT evaluation.  Now, i wasn't that nervous about the OT eval. Everyone at school thinks he's doing so well, and he looks to me like he's doing so well, I just never thought about it. I was way more nervous about the speech eval. However, we've always hit speech hard, because we've always assumed that was his main weakness.  I also often drift into a \"place\" where Joey is looking good, and I'm comfortable with the help he is getting, and he seems to be improving, so I kind of forget he is disabled. You kind of think of him as 3 instead of 4 in the first place, and don't worry so much. The tantrums become just part of life. The screaming is just what Joey does. He's just a little boy.  We got the \"results\" of the eval yesterday. It was a real shock to see him being evaluated as 1% and 2% in things like gross motor and fine motor skills. (50% is normal). Is he really this bad off? Why hasn't anyone at school said anything? Why isn't he getting more therapy? What the HELL?  I've decided I'm going to call Kluge and have him evaluated again there- a second opinion. Ultimately, these people we just took him to is a business, and needs to make money. Kluge would be more impartial. But if this is the real picture, I think \"conniption fit\" is going to be a gentle word to use for what I'm going to have at school.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/09/another-day-another-evaluation.html", "title": "\nAnother Day, Another Evaluation\n"},

Then I found Allan's old blanket, which his mom sent a while ago- before Andy was born. Anyway, I turned and offered it with, \"How about Daddy's blankie?\" He snatched it from my grasp, hugged it, and said \"Yes.\" He napped with Daddy's Blankie, thank goodness. He was very happy to have his own Blankie back for bedtime, though.  OT starts next week.

I understand if she can only handle ADL goals (adaptive life skills), but both these therapists and the guy at Kluge say Joey desperately needs OT for sensory integration problems. DEPERATELY. Yet nothing was said! Is she grossly incompetant (she couldn't see the need for sensory therapy), or grossly negligent (she just was going to let him rot because she doesn't have the equipment/time/inclination/doesn't want school to have to pay for it)? I thought the point of having these therpaists and experts on the IEP committee was to have good-faith opinions of what Joey needs, but apparently they are just one more roadblock- one more person have to fight for appropriate and adequate service.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/09/new-therapies.html", "title": "\nNew Therapies\n"},

Jeanine is a fabulous therapist, and she really likes to sit down and thell me what they did and why they did it.  On the bad news front, we have a lot more spinning, a lot more door slamming, and a lot more grumpiness. Is he sick? Is he stressed? Do we have too many therapies now? Is school going OK? there is no way to know.  On the good news front, we are having more conversations. He can talk about school, what he did, what he ate for lunch, and what he likes and dislikes. He can talk about Little Bear episodes, and pretend to fly, and dance, and sing.  On the bad news front, we are having more tantrums over \"mistakes\" and spills, and he's been saying \"oh, DAMN!\" and \"Godammit!\" when he's upset.  On the good news front, he went to the pumpkin patch and seemed to enjoy himself and the other kids in his class. He;s very bossy! On the bad news front, he's very bossy with Andy, who doesn't want to be bossed.  All in all, its nice to have some \"normal\" problems, but I could do without the increased behavioral issues.  I could also do with some time off. I took Allan out for his birthday. Woo-hoo, we had two hours all to ourselves. We had no idea what to say to each other. We had nothing but the boys to talk about. There was too much food served- we've gotten used to just eating whatever the boys are eating (why haven't I lost any weight???) We each had a drink. Mine cost eight bucks. Wowzers.

They got interested in some toys in Joey's room, so I went to get dressed myself. I heard the water come on, wished I could take a shower, too, and continued dressing. Out Allan came. It was far too quick for him to have taken a shower, and the water was still going...  We found the boys in the bathtub. Joey was stark nekkid (he took off his own shirt! yay!). Andy was fully clothed. They were enjoying their bath very much, thank you.  Joey has a new video he likes, Animusic. The best description of the product is \"surreal\", and Joey loves it. He was snuggling with Grandma watching his music, when one of our therapists arrived. Grandma leaned over and asked, \"are you ready to go play with Miss Kate?\" Joey sighed and said, \"No, I'm tired.\"  We gave him another five minutes, when he stood up and said \"OK, ready,\" and headed downstairs to the therapy room! Andy went to school today. We joined Joey's class to try some \"reverse mainstreaming\" and for me to observe Joey. It was a disaster. He would not sit. He insisted on being everywhere except where the group was, and doing everything excpt what the group was doing. We left after an hour, with me thoroughly shaken by my clear lack of parenting an discipline skills. When we got to the car, he says very quietly, \"You ok, Momma?\"  I was putting the boys down, and I managed to get them both bathed, dressed, calmed, and into their beds- Allan was out. We have to sit with Joey, so I finished singing and sat in the chair. Andy promptly began to fuss. Joey called out, \"Andy, whassa matter?\" I finally got up and determined there was a need for a goodnight drink, supplied it, got Andy calmed, and returned to my chair. Joey piped up: \"All better now. Good night, Momma. I love you.\" What else can you say to that, than, \"I love, you, too\"?

{"date": "Wednesday, December 27, 2006", "body": "\nWell, we survived! Joey has actually one quite well this year with teh activities and festivities. Andy has had a harder time. We managed to get some professional photos taken- despite Andy's best efforts- but we didn't get them onto Santa's lap. Joey saw Santa t school, so that was good enough for this year. I also had some helpful, helpful boys to put up the Christmas tree. We just put on the plastic ornaments and the stuff we had them make this year. That way, i didn't have to worry about breakage (I'm not so much worried about the ornaments, as that it is hard to get these guys to not touch stuff, and I was afraid of cuts).  Santa came and left the guys TONS of stuff. So I thought I'd offer some toy reviews.  T.J. Bearytales is a hit with both guys. The bear catches interest even before it moves, the stories seem to be gentle and fairly simple without being simplistic. It takes 4 D batteries, and there is space in teh backpack for 4 extra cartridges (it comes pre-programmed with a story, no cartridge needed- so strage for up to 5 stories!) and I recommend getting some, because otherwise you're going to hear the same story over and over and over and over again. Great toy. I hope it holds up, I'll keep you all posted.  Hyper-Rides Snake River Raceway was a big hit. I wish it stayed together better, but Joey adores it and Andy will run and fetch the cars to have Joey run it. It was also inexpensive. If you need bang for your buck, this works very well, and was easy to assemble No batteries required.  Fisher-Price Spiral Speedway- another hit. This comes with batteries, and needs its own cars to work well, so keep track of them. Hotwheels cars don't fit well, they are too wide and heavy. However, the guys really love it, and Andy likes to try to hoard it.  MegaBlocks Wizard of Oz Playset- we weren't sure about this one, though I bought it because I thought it too funny. the guys like the music and flashing lights, but the music is not from the movie at all. Also, teh witch is blue, not green. However, the boys like it a lot.  MB Hungry Hungry Hippos. Mom bought this for the guys in some kind of special two-games-for-one-price deal from Hasbro. It is not the game I remember. Its small, only for two players, and the balls don't bounce around well. Not a hit.  Hi-ho Cherry-o is the hit it always is for preschoolers. Joey and I just played it for over an hour, so he practiced counting, taking turns, and following rules. Very fun. Much more fun than I remembered.  TMX Elmo. Well, I must admit, its a cute toy, The guys love it. Its a lot of fun. Why do people try to kill each other for this thing, or pay hundreds of dollars for it? $40 is about right, considering the Bearytales was a little more than that. However, I think $20 is about what these toys ought to be. They are cute. The boys like them, They are not the end-all be-all.  Megablocks truck carrier playset. This toy includes trucks that come apart into smaller \"blocks\". It would have been fun except for the 15 wire ties holding it together. It took my husband and I an hour just to get the toy un-packaged enough for hte boys to play with it.  So it was a fun Christmas morning. The guys are enjoying their new toys, while watching Little Bear and hearing new stories (mostly Little Bear as well).

{"date": "Saturday, November 25, 2006", "body": "\nThere's a funny word that bounces around the autism community: cure.  Its a funny word, because people get very, very upset about it. There is a whole subculture of sites and groups, mostly of parents, who want a cure. They want their children to be cured of their autism.  Then there are the sites from people who are autistic. Guess what? They don't want to be cured.  At first, I thought this was just a semantics game. I am, in part, correct. When I talk about getting Joey services, helping him to communicate, helping him learn to relate to other people, and heloing him exercise dynamic intelligence (the ability to deal with spontaneous and changing situations and environments), I am targeting core deficiencies that make autism disabling. I do not want my son to be disabled. That is my goal. I know we may never reach it, but that is where I am going in managing the condition.  Even \"managing the condition\" ruffles feathers. However, when words like \"cure\", \"managing\", and \"mainstreaming\" become problematic, you are having more of a problem of semantics than anything else. I am trying to help Joey, so he can fully enjoy living and enjoy his talents. I am doing this for Andy, too. That is what parents do.  Then I come across the two extremes of the spectrum on this issue.  On are the parents who really do want to \"cure\" their kid. They want to have a pill or a shot or a diet or a therapy that will make their kid normal. This is based on the idea that autism is a disease, the kid is sick, and if we only knew the right thing to do, it would go away. I certainly understand this feeling. Many of the sites from autistic people seem to completely disregard the effort put forth by parents, the pain they endure, the realization that your child may be disabled forever and unable to fully enjoy life. That will put some of these people off-joint, but there it is. A blind person will never be able to see. They may be perfectly happy, and enjoy their world, and have a useful, independent, joyous life. But I know what a treasure sight is, and would still wish my blind kid could see, and do everything I could to try to share that treasure with them. That is the impulse of most parents I know.  However, there are those parents that simply want a normal kid, rather than the kid they have. I wouldn't have believed this, but I have seen it too often now. So few of the special ed parents get involved, or even try to deal. They toss the kid at teh school at first opportunity, and that's it. They don't want to even look at the child. It's heartbreaking to me. When I compare that attitude to my friend Christina, who has three severely disabled boys and just loves them to peices and does everything she can to help them enjoy living, I just wonder what people are thinking. Those boys bring joy to her life, and she enjoys them, and lets them be who they are, and helps them to enjoy the world around them. We can wish they were not disabled, that they could talk, that they could walk, that they could live healthy, independent lives; but we also love them for who they are. They are not these disabilities.  Joey is not his autism. Joey is Joey. Why he does what he does is only important in that it gives me clues on how to help him, how to teach him, how to communicate with him. It actually gives me information about how he is perceiving the world around him, so that I can help him make sense of the world-- exactly as I am helping Andy make sense of his world.  Which brings me to the other end of the spectrum, the autistic folks who get all fired up and angry about people wanting to cure autism. I can see this side of the coin, too. Who wants to be told all their life that they are doing stuff wrong, that they are less than what was expected, that they can't do, can't be, can't please? The problem here is that by their arguments, we should do nothing. They will vehemently deny this, note that people with autism need support throughout life, that services for autistic adults is woefully absent, and that they are not saying that we shouldn't help. However, they then go to contradict this apologetic. It is very hard to say you don't want to be pushed to act like a normal person, and then wonder why no one will give you any services. Services are intended to help you function in a world of people that are not autistic. I am esepcially offended by autistic adults who say things like \"independence isn;'t all its cracked up to be, I do best in dependent situations.\" Hello. I'd like someone to help me with my self-care skills, too. I'd like a maid to clean my house, a cook to make my food, and someone to hold my hand while I go to the grocery store. However, being an adult means being able to do things for yourself, to be responsible. Being independent is part of being grown-up. My job as a parent is to help my child grow up. Independence is the goal. I understand not everyone with autism will get there, but to harangue parents for having that goal is utterly offensive. It's as offensive as parents who want to make their kids \"normal.\" To say you wished you could stay in some \"magical\" non-verbal world is saying you wish you could remain a child forever.  Hint: No one is \"normal.\" Its OK to be \"quirky\" and \"eccentric\". But it is also a good thing to be able to dress, feed, and bathe yourself, be able to hold a job, and to have friends.  I am not asking Joey ot be a neuro-typical person. I understand that there are parents who do that. I am asking that Joey learn to care for himself, learn to relate to other people, and be able to have that opportunity to share his gifts with the world. For this, he needs help, and more help than Andy needs right now. He needs speech therapy, he needs occupational therapy, he needs intensive training to teach him how to learn and how to relate. He needs to have a connection between himself and the world around him. Its OK to be processing the information differently, but he needs to be processing the information.  Which brings my morning rant around to a another problem I see across the spectrum of the autism community: there is more than one kind of autism. This seems to be blatantly ignored. I have listened to parents of children across the spectrum of ASD, and the picture has become painfully clear to me that there really are at least two types of autism. Some children are born with autism already in play. Joey is this type. Knowing what we know now, we can see that Joey was autistic even in the hospital, when he freaked out over a warm blanket, and could grab and flick the doctor's stethoscope. Yes, as a newborn. Then there are the kids where the autism is triggered. They run into a problem, and they go overnight from being a happy, neuro-typical kid to silence and frustration. The trigger can be any number of things. The MMR vaccine triggered one child. A severe bout of flu triggered another child. I knoew kids who were triggered from stress, from illness, from poisoning by metals or other toxins. It happens. In fact, Joey may have had his trigger right from the get-go, when he went into distress during delivery; perhaps all kids are triggered, and its just a question of when and how. Then again, there are the kids with unusual head growth, which may be more of the at-birth type. At any rate, there are kids who start from the get-go being autistic, and there are kids who are fine, and then become autistic. They all need help to be able to function in the world. We can't just leave them in that magical non-verbal world, because then they never learn not to wander into the street, to dress and care for themselves, to grow into the human community. And after all, we are all humans. As the Dalai Lama once noted, without the human community, one human alone cannot survive.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/11/cure.html", "title": "\n\"Cure\"\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, November 22, 2006", "body": "\nI am working on this as series of posts in reation to some of the \"lists\" I have been seeing about autism and children with autism. Some of the lists are good. Some of them are not. I'm going to start with one that is well-intentioned and useful, but which obscures problems associated with autism and getting services for children with autism.  Part One: Ten Things Your Autistic Child Wishes You Knew This is a list that was posted on an autism support board I was reading.  1. I am a child with autism. I am not \"autistic\". My autism is one aspect of my total character. It does not define me as a person. Are you a person with thoughts, feelings, and many talents, or are you just fat (overweight), myopic (wear glasses), or klutzy?  Commentary: Actually, when providing services or trying to get services, you do describe yourself as fat/obese, myopic, or even clumsy. If I want services for diabetes, I am referred to as diabetic. The problem comes when everything related to my child is blamed on his autism. 'Normal' children(or more properly, 'neuro-typical') have sensory issues, intense interests, and communication problems. Normal is what you are. There is no such thing as a neuro-typical individual; the idea is an ideal, and we all have quirks. The autism is only a problem when it become debilitating, and then we need to disccus Joey as autstic, in order to get him some help for dealing with attributes related to his autism which do not allow him to function in the neuro-typical, non-autistic world- blocks to his independence and happiness.  2. My sensory perceptions are disordered. This means the ordinary sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches of everyday life that you may not even notice can be downright painful for me. The very environment in which I have to live often seems hostile. I may appear withdrawn or belligerent to you, but I am really just trying to defend myself. A \"simple\" trip to the grocery store may be hell for me. My hearing may be hyperacute. Dozens of people are talking at once. The loudspeaker booms today's special. Muzak whines from the sound system. Cash registers beep and cough. A coffee grinder is chugging away. The meat cutter screeches, babies wail, carts creak, the flourescent lighting hums. My brain can't filter all the input and I'm in overload! My sense of smell may be highly sensitive. The fish isn't quite fresh, the guy standing next to us hasn't showered today, the deli is handing out usausage samples, the baby in line ahead of us has a poopy diaper, they're mopping up pickles in Aisle 3 with ammonia... I can't sort it out, I'm too nauseous!  Because I'm visually oriented, this may be my first sense to become overstimulated. The flourescent light is too bright. It makes the room pulsate and hurts my eyes. Sometimes the light bounces off everything and distorts what I'm seeing. The space seems to be constantly changing. There's glare from windows, moving fans on the ceiling, so many bodies in consttant motion, too many items for me to be able to focus, and I may compensate with tunnel vision. All this affects my vestibular sense, and now I can't even tell where my body is in space. I may stumble, bump into things, or simply lay down to try to regroup.  Commentary: This item is useful for people with no background or understanding of autism. However, trips to the store or into the outside world are not \"hell\" for all people with autism. The point is to highlight sensory issues that are possible. Joey loves going to the store (though lately the Walmart has been a bit overwhelming). However, he has vestibular issues. Ever walked down the stairs, miscounted, and thought there was one more step? remember that feeling of your foot suddenly meeting the floor, when you were expecting more time before the shock hit your foot? My child goes through life liek that, with every step.  I also know that Joey does not only tunnel-vision, but tunnel-hears. When there is just too much, he cannot deal, and cannot either see or hear you; or he cannot filter propoerrly, so is seeing and hearing things other than what you think he is hearing or seeing. Neuro-typical people do this as well. Ever be listening intently to music or watching something, and suddenly realize someone is trying to get your attention?  3. Please remember to distinguish between won't (I choose not to) and can't (I'm not able to). Receptive and expressive language are both difficult for me. It isn't that I don't listen to instructions. It's that I can't understand you. When you call to me from across the room, this is what I hear. \"!!%#@%*^, Billy. (*&)^^$%$\" Instead, come speak directly to me in plain words. \"Please put your book in your desk. It's time to go to lunch.\" This tells me what you want me to do, and what is going to happen next. Now it's much easier for me to comply.  4. I am a concrete thinker. I interpret language literally. It's very confusing for me when you say \"Hold your horses cowboy!\" when what you really mean is \"Please Stop running.\" Don't tell me something is a \"piece of cake\" when there's no dessert in sight and what you really mean is\"This will be easy for you to do\". When you say \"It's pouring cats and dogs\", I see pets coming out of a pitcher. Please just tell me \"It's raining very hard\". Idiom, puns, nuance, double entendre, and sarcasm are lost on me.  Commentary on 3 and together: Problem? In dealing with the neuro-typical world, these children need to learn about idioms and complex instruction and speech pattern. You cannot get a regular job and expect everyone around you to accommodate a need for plain English. If the goal is to help these people be independent, we need more services for speech and language. However, no one wants to provide them. The schools provide minimal service only if you have a severe (25% or greater) delay in speech and language skills. Insurance often does not cover speech therapy, as the service is viewed as educational. You get caught in a catch-22 of semantics! 5. Be patient with my limited vocabulary. It's hard for me to tell you what I need when I don't know the words to describe my feelings. I may be hungry, frustrated, frightened, or confused, but right now those words are beyond my ability to express. Be alert for body language, withdrawal, agitation, or other signs that something's wrong.  There's a flip side to this: I may sound like a little professor or a movie star, rattling off words or whole scripts well beyond my developmental age. These are messages that I've memorized from the world around me to compensate for my language deficits, because I know I'm expected to respond when spoken to. They may come from books, television, or speech of other people. It's called echolalia. I don't necessarily understand the context or terminology I'm using, I just know that it gets me off the hook for coming up with a reply. Commentary: this is just more emphasis on the need for proper, appropriate, adequate speech and language instruction and services. To be able to function, an individual needs to handle complex and abstract concepts and thought. We need to do more work on how to teach these skills, just as we teach them how to learn other concepts and skills.  6. Because language is so difficult for me, I am very visually oriented. Show me how to do something rather than just telling me. And please be prepared to show me many times. Lots of patient repetition helps me to learn. A visual schedule is extremely helpful as I move through my day. Like your day planner, it relieves me of the stress of having to remember what comes next, makes for smooth transitions between activities, and helps me manage my time and meet your expectations.  Commentary: This item implies that visual orientation is due to language difficulty; however, I would suggest that the other way around is more likely. Because Joey is so visually oriented, oral communication is more difficult, as it makes less sense. Many autistic individuals (not all) are very proficient readers, and can communicate very well using computers and written language; however, they become like Mrs. Who when it comes to forming their own thoughts and words orally.  I have no problem with raising a Mrs. Who, so long as we can make the quotes all appropriate.  7. Focus and buildon what I can do rather than what I can't do. Like any other human, I can't learn in an environment where I'm constantly made to feel that I'm not good enough or that I need fixing. Trying anything new when I am almost sure to be met with criticism, however constructive, becomes something to be avoided. Look for my strengths and you'll find them. There's more than one right way to do most things.  Commentary: I have been begging Joey's teachers and therapists to do this- let's use the skills he does have, the interests and strengths he displays, to teach him things he has more trouble understanding and skills he has trouble mastering. I am tired of paying money to have him evaluated and programs planned, only to have those programs include teaching him to count, name colors, and recognize letters. He already counts to 120, knows all his colors (and in fact, defaults to this if he doesnt't understand the question you are asking), and can read. Thanks. Can we please use these skills to teach him to ask questions, respond to multiple cues, and other important building-block skills?  8. Help me with social interactions. It may look like I don't want to play with the other kids on the playground, but sometimes it's just that I simply don't know how to start a conversation or enter a play situation. If you can encourage other children to invite me to join them at kickball or shooting baskets, I may be delighted to be included.  Commentary: When I hear about the trouble the parents with elementary-aged kids are having with getting the school to organize social groups, it makes me extremely angry. Other kids get opportunities to build social skills- lunchtimes, parties, class changes, special events- my child deserves a change to build these important skills as well. Social skills are vital life-skills. Without them, you cannot hold a job, participate in human relationships, or function with other people. We all know people with poor social skills, and the stigma they face. Who wants to be around people who are rude, cold, or appear self-centered? People who seem to ignore basic social etiquette? We label them as nerdy, weird, eccentric. We ostracize them. We don't invite them to the Christmas party, to lunch, or even to small conversation. We actively exclude people who are not pleasant to associate and socialize with. Social skills need to be taught, emphasized, and worked on, just as much as any OTHER skill. Yes, social skills are vital to independence and success! 9. Try to identify what triggers my meltdowns. This is termed the 'antecedent'. Meltdowns, blowups, tantrums, or whatever you want to call them are even more horrid for me than they are for you. They occur because one or more of my senses have gone into overload. If you can figure out why my meltdowns occur, they can be prevented.  Commentary: This is a fun one. What situations cannot be avoided? What skills are needed to get Joey through these situations? My school personnel are sayign he cannot tantrum and be in an inclusion setting. This is bullcrap. His classroom may need a paraprofessional to watch for antecedents and help the teacher with teaching coping skills, but these meltdowns are not normal. They are not intentional. They are part of a disibility that should be accomodated, and when he is accomodated properly, THEY WON'T HAPPEN.  10. If you are a family member, please love me unconditionally. Banish thoughts like \"If he would just...\" and \"Why can't she...\" You didn't fulfill every last expectation your parents had for you, and you wouldn't like being constantly reminded of it. I didn't choose to have autism. Remember that it's happening to me, not you. Without your support, my chances of successful, self-reliant adulthood are slim. With your support and guidance, the possibilities are broader than you might think. I promise you that I'm worth it.  Commentary: I thought this was an interesting item when I read it. When I wasn't fulfilling my parents' expectations for me, I bet you they were thinking \"If only she would just...\" and \"Whay can't she...?\" And in fact, when I am askign these questions, I am looking for answers to help Joey learn necessary skills. It also completely discounts a parent's frustration, which occurs even with parents of neuro-typical children. Are parents of neuro-typical children allowed to be upset, disappointed, and frustrated? If they are allowed, why aren't I? Perhaps we need to focus on the outcome instead. Being frustrated, disappointed, or upset does not give a parent permission to have their own temper tantrums. However, it happens. Then what? And what about other \"family members\"? And what about supporting those parents who are trying hard to support their children? Insurance semantics, school manipulation, anything and everything not to get services to my child, and telling me I have to now be a professional child advocate, speech therapist, occupational therapist, school teacher, special education teacher, etc.... Hello. I'm an art historian. If I could suddenly be all of these things, why do I have to pay all these people? Why do they have to go get college degrees in order to practice? What's that all about?  Continuing item #10:  It all comes down to three words: Patience. Patience. Patience.  Commentary: Yes, indeed. Somehow parents of disabled and \"differently abled\" children are supposed to have an extra measure of patience. It would be nice if those who are supposed to be supporting my child- his teachers, his therapists, his administrators, etc- would show that same support and patience... It get very frustrating to have pateince preached at you, when everyone around you is working against you, resulting in stress- that lowers patience.  Continuing item #10:  Work to view my autism as a different ability rather than a disability. Look past what you may see as limitations and see the gifts that autism has given me. I may not be good at eye contact or conversation, but have you noticed that I don't lie, cheat at games, tattle on my classmates, or pass judgment on other people?  Commentary: Well, no. Joey does lie. He does tattle on classmates. He does try to cheat at games. There are people he likes, and people he doesn't like, which is definitely \"passing judgement.\" These are normal things to be doing. However, he does have important talents and abilities. He may not be good at speaking, but he can tell time and read and count and understands concepts of quantity. He may not be able to initiation play with his classmates, but he can ride a bike in figure-8s and is excellent at memory games. This item was simply not stated very well.  Continuing item #10: You are my foundation. Think through some of those societal rules and if they don't make sense for me, let them go. Be my advocate, be my friend, and we'll see just how far I can go.  Commentary: teaching social graces and basic social rules is vital to independence. Why is it necessary to sit in a resteraunt? Because you disturb other people if you stand to eat. If you don't greet people, they may find you rude. If you can't keep your hands to yourself, you could be arrested for assault! Which social rules do you really think can be set aside? How will setting those rules aside help the child become independent?  Continuing itme #10:  I probably won't be the next Michael Jordan, but with my attention to fine detail and capacity for extraordinary focus, I might be the next Einstein. Or Mozart. Or Van Gogh.  They had autism too. Commentary:  We only speculate that these people has an ASD. We don't know. However, I like the inclusion of Einstein on this list. I keep hearing about \"Einstein Syndrome\"... but from everything I read about it, it sounds like ASD to me! High-functioning people with autism still have autism. They still need to be taught to learn and to socialize. They need to be taught skills to encourage independence. They need to have their sensory issues addressed. They still need services. They have the same right to the opportunity to live independent, functional lives as any neuro-typical child.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2006/11/commentary-10-things-your-autistic.html", "title": "\nCommentary: 10 things Your Autistic Child Wishes You Knew\n"},

There is a classroom that is kind of halfway between the self-contained classroom and the full inclusion classroom. It is run by a special ed teacher, has a kind of aide (but not a paraprofessional), and has only 8 students in it. The inclusion class sometimes comes in for lessons, like social studies; and they join the inclusion room for \"specials\" like art and music. It seems like a good idea, but they are still doing things Joey can't do, like sit in large groups on the floor and pay attention to a book. I go see Joey's program tomorrow, so I'll get to talk to Kaila then.

{"date": "Saturday, November 25, 2006", "body": "\nOnce again, I am here to rant about another Autism List that I see bouncing about a lot, and which I find problematic. Here it is:  Dispelling Myths of Autism Indianapolis Star Begin to help autistic children by dispelling myths By Julie Krasnow The word \u201cautism\u201d has become a more common term recently, due in large part to the Autism Society of America reporting that autism now affects one in 166 children. If you don\u2019t know someone with autism, you probably will someday. April is National Autism Awareness Month. As the autism/behavior specialist for the Carmel Clay Schools, my job is to educate others about this disability. Without proper knowledge, many people afflicted with autism often are misunderstood. I would like to share and resolve some misconceptions and myths to help raise awareness in our community. Myth No. 1: Autism is caused by \u201crefrigerator mothers.\u201d Many years ago, Dr. Bruno Bettelheim claimed that autism had a psychological causation: that the mothers of these children, intentionally or otherwise, did not love their children. The term \u201crefrigerator mother\u201d was born, referring to the fact that the mother was cold toward her child. Today we know that autism is a bioneurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain. Some theories suggest that it may be genetic, viral or caused by chemical exposure. Commentary:  This idea is still more common than I would like. However, I would also like to file under this kind of ignorance the people who walk up to me in stores and tell me to discipline my child (and Joey isn't too bad in store, he likes them), people who ask us to leave resteraunts, and people who seem to blame us for Joey's quirks by proclaiming us \"bad parents\" either overtly or covertly.  I also would like to point out that many autistic adults seem to have a similar view of parents, by ignoring the sacrifices made by parents in trying to help them become independent, socially accepted (or acceptable) adults. You may not agree with how your parents raised you- but that just makes you human. To discount the effort to care for an autistic child and to raise an autistic child, we stand accused of being selfish and uncaring. Just wait until you have kids- which you wouldn't, if we didn't put forth extraordinary effort to help you learn to form and maintain relationships.  Myth No. 2: Autistic children show no emotion. A common misconception is that children with autism are unloving and do not have any emotional feelings. On the surface, this may seem to be the case because they don\u2019t always express their emotions in a way that you and I recognize. But for those of us who know a child with autism, we are aware of the ways that they show love and affection. Commentary: My doctor was shocked when we first came back with a diagnosis of autism. The reaction? \"But he's such a happy, loving child!\" Yes, he is. I'd like to keep him happy and loving, thanks. (Our doctor has been extremely supportive, and interested in learning from Joey's case, by the way- and we're all for that!) Myth No. 3: Children just need a good spanking We\u2019ve all been out to a grocery store or running errands when we come across a child throwing a temper tantrum, including screaming, throwing and hitting. We may wonder why parents are letting their child do this without any discipline or reprimands. If this is a child with autism, he most likely has lost control because of sensory overload. The sounds and visual stimulation and the overwhelming crowds are just too much for this child to take in, which results in a meltdown. Parents are unrightfully blamed for not disciplining their children. Commentary: Yes, and we're awful parents, so what's our problem? Returning to those people who come up to me in the store and tell me about my kid: who the hell are you?  At the same time, I would like to take a moment to mention the folks who come up to me in that same store and tell me what beautiful children I have, even though Andy turns his head away and Joey giggles and asks them something strange. Thank you. Its lovely to know we're giving someone else pleasure, and I hope you enjoy my children as they are.  Myth No. 4: You\u2019re born with autism. On average, autism is diagnosed at 44 months of age. Commentary: Joey was born with autism. The time of diagnosis is not the moment you start being autistic. However, autism can be triggered. This note seems to say children are not born with autism; they are. However, there are also children who were neuro-typical, and then have autism triggered by an event- and not always a clear, overnight event.  Myth No. 5: Vaccines do not cause autism. The jury is still out on this one. Although a recent Institute of Medicine report appears to refute an association between vaccines and autism, the major autism organizations all agree that more research needs to be conducted. A recent study suggests that children receiving vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal are many times more likely to develop autism than those who receive thimerosal-free vaccines. Commetnary: Joey received thimerosal-free vaccines. He's still autistic. However, I cannot discount that vaccines can be triggers. Vaccines place the body under stress, and stress can trigger autism. However, mumps, measles, rubella, whooping cough, hepatitis, chicken pox, pneumonia, flu, diptheria, tetanus, etc. also put the body under stress, and can trigger autism. On top of that, they can kill you. I recommend vaccination, though we put off the MMR a bit to make sure Joey and Andy had strong immune systems to handle it. I think the MMR is usually 18 months, we waited until 24. Andy is fine. Joey was already not fine.  Myth No. 6: Dustin Hoffman\u2019s character in \u201cRain Man\u201d is typical of a person with autism. The character in \u201cRain Man\u201d was a high-functioning person with autism and also was a savant. In reality, only 2 percent of those diagnosed exhibit such savant capabilities. Commentary: If \"Rain Man\" is a high-functioning autistic person, then I can't really blame people who want to \"cure\" it. I would consider \"Rain Man\" to be a medium-functioning person, not a high-functioning person. His savant abilities were not typical. Unfortunately, his social skill and functioning level is pretty middle-of-the-road. He was verbal, but unable to live independently or function in society. With the current understanding of autism and therapies for helping these children learn, we are all hoping to have people with autism be able to be less disabled than Rain Man.  Myth No. 7: The increase in the rate of autism is due to better diagnosing. Ten years ago, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000 births. Today it is 1 in 166. This is a 5,000 percent increase in 10 years. If this astonishing increase is due to better diagnosing, where are the thousands of autistic adults who should have received a diagnosis 10, 20 or 30 years ago? Commentary: There is better diagnosing. There is also better treatment. However, I have the same question. I know autistic adults. But I know far more autistic children. Where are the ASD adults? Where is even the rumor of them? In my neighborhood, there are 3 autistic kids that I know of. However, in my wide range of contacts, friends, acquaintences, etc., I have only one person I know has an ASD, and not even a whisper of anyone, a sibling, a cousin, an aunt, uncle, etc., with ASD, Einstein Syndrome, or other problems that could indicate ASD. Why? So I don;t think it is all better diagnosing. There really is a problem here, and it would be nice to figure out why were are seeing such a dramatic increase in ASD people.   Myth No. 8: Autism is a rare disorder. With 1 in 166 children being diagnosed with autism, it can no longer be called rare. We have an epidemic on our hands. Every 16 minutes, another child is diagnosed with autism. For all of us who have had the privilege of knowing, loving or working with a child with autism, we are able to see their abilities through the disability and appreciate the child within. I am pleased to report to the community that my Carmel Clay colleagues and I are working very hard to provide the best education we can for students who have been diagnosed with autism. Commentary: Autism was rare. Now it is not. There is a .5% chance that your next baby will be autistic.  About 2.2% of children 0-2 are disabled.        The chances of infant mortality is 7 in 1000 births, or .07%.        The chances of a preterm baby is 1 in 8, or 12%.       The chances of a multiple birth is about 3.4%.        The chances of Down Syndrome is 1 in 733. That's a .013% chance.

{"date": "Friday, January 19, 2007", "body": "\nI have added a link to the list, to an article called \"Welome to Holland.\" It's been circulaing enough that some folks might find it trite. I noticed some autistic adults are upset by it, by I want to note that it is about being a PARENT of a disabled child, not actually BEING a disabled person (though I'm not sure why it wouldn't apply- it's about thinking life is going to be one way, and having it turn out another way- not better, or worse, but different than expected or intended).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-have-added-link-to-list-to-article.html", "title": ""},
{"date": "Saturday, January 27, 2007", "body": "\nThere was once a Peanuts cartoon that said, \"A bumper sticker is not a philosophy.\" However, there are an awful lot of autism bumper stickers swirling around now. I thought I'd share some thoughts about them.  1. The Puzzle Ribbon. The Puzzle ribbon is starting to be problematic. Many autistic adults are asserting that they do not want to be a \"puzzle to be solved.\" That seems to miss the point, but perhaps that's just my own interpretation of the puzzle peice motif. We are all puzzles. The Autistic Puzzle is multi-colored because of the idea of \"spectrum.\" However, as most know, puzzles with peices that are so different can either be a peice of cake to put together- or terribly, terribly hard. Getting life to come together for an autistic person can be far more of a challenge than with a \"neurotypical\" person. It is also extremely recognizable, so I hope we keep it.  2. \"This is a cat. It is not a defective dog. It is very happy being a cat.\" I like this idea, but it is a little off. The point is that an autistic person is not a defective neurotypical person. I'm good with that. However, we live in a world run by dogs, designed for dogs, and where the primary way of getting what one needs is by wagging your tail when you are happy, and growling when you are upset. If you wag when you are upset, and growl/purr when you are happy, you probably are not going to get any milk in this world. I like the idea of not needing to be \"cured\" or made into a dog, though.  3. \"Autism: It's not like you think.\" Love it. Have one to put on my bumper as soon as spring arrives.  4. \"If at first you don't succeed, perserverate.\" Although I understand the humor in this, I am not sure the giggle at one of real issues of autism is something I want spread around. This is only good for meetings with ASD people and parents. Ditto for \"It's a Stimmy Day.\"  5. \"I'm not a brat. I have autism!\" Joey's original preschool teacher, Miss Angie, once noted about Joey's unusual behaviors: \" It really doesn't matter why he is doing these things. IF a behavior is unacceptable, it;s unacceptable, and needs to be changed.\" I will return to the story of the Mom Afraid of the Mouse, where she's standing, screaming int eh kitchen, waving a knife around. The story was told on the blog I got it from to demonstrate how behaviors seen as \"unacceptable\" in autistic people are seen as \"acceptable\" with neurotypical people. However, I must say that I disagree. The mom screaming over a mouse in the kitchen is still unacceptable behavior. That's why we find it funny. Here is a normally acceptable human being acting in a strange and unacceptable way. She really needs to learn not to freak out when a mouse scampers over her floor.     On the other hand, I do get weary of people coming up to me in stores and telling me to discipline my kid, or give me dirty looks if he happens to squeal, or get excited, or perserverate. Its like asking a parent to tell their wheel-chair bound kid to just get up and walk already. I can't imagine being a parent of a child who really loses it in stores, and dealing with people while trying to deal with a real meltdown. Sheesh, people, mind your own business. Even parents of brats are probably doing the best they can.  6. \"Yes, my son has autism. No, he's not like Rainman.\" I'd like to have a set od business-size cards that say this. It would save time.  7. \"Always Unique Totally Interesting Sometimes Mysterious.\" I know some autistic adults don't like the \"mysterious\" part of this, but I think I'd like to wear this t-shirt without the first letters lined up. Its perfect.  8. \"Fair is not everyone getting the same thing, or what they want. Fair is when each student gets what they need.\" I wish every single person who worked in education really understood this. Our school OT effectively denied us summer services last year by saying that the school system couldn't do more for Joey than for the normal kids. I'm cool with that. But I thought that teh point was the school was giving each kid a fair shot at being an independant, socially responsible human being. They don't all make it. So... why doesn't my kid get to have this opportunity?  9. \"What? Is my autism showing?\" See #4 and #5.  10. \"I'm just like everyone else... only different.\" We should all have this on our bumpers.  11. \"If 1 in 166 children in this country were being kidnapped, we;d have a national emergency. We do. Autism.\" Ok, this one kinda gets my craw. I don't like the idea of comparing Joey to a child who has been kidnapped. Now, I'll say that when we started, we were definitely \"losing\" Joey. On the other hand, autism is not being \"kidnapped.\" Joey is Joey. He has autism. We can manage to teach him to get along in a non-autistic world, but he is who he is. However, I think the point of the emergency is very much pertinent. Kids who need to get along in the world need services, they need help, they need attention. Most of them are not getting it, and many are beign actively denied due to ignorance and inaction. It is shameful. If 1 in 166 kids were being born with cerebral palsy, you bet someone would be getting off their butt and making things move and shake.  12. \"Welcome to Holland. Come on, I'll show you around.\" This is great for therapists and parents who know the ropes and have moved past the grieving and the shock and come to the realization that this isn't the end of the world. Just the end of the world as you thought it ought to have been.  13. \"Autism is a difference, not a disease.\" Dont show this one to your insurance company.  14.\" My communication skills are fine. It's not my fault you don't speak my language.\" Excuse me? We're not trying to speak English while in Holland here. These kids need to be supported and communicate functionally. Discouraging services is not the answer.  15. \"Stop trying to fix me. I'm not broken.\" Then you don't need a personal assistant. I understand this one should be filed under the \"this is a cat\" and other anti-cure slogans, but this one really rubs me wrong. Its one of those suggestions that these people do not need help and support, do not need therapy, do not need special education. I know it is probably intended to move away from looking for a pill or a shot or a diet to \"cure\" the autism, but the tone comes across really, really wrong to me. Joey is not currently able to function in a regular environment at an independent level. Therefore, I need to do something.  16. \"The next person who says autism is like a trip to Holland gets a mouthful of wooden shoe.\" Excuse me, but whoever wote this did not read the peice. It is not about being autistic. It is about being a parent of a disabled child, when all your friends have normal kids. It's about sitting in a room full of moms talking about how they just had a sleepover with 15 kids at their house, when my kid hasn't yet made a friend. Its about parents telling you about their kids' first word when your kid is deaf, or their first step when your kid is confined to a wheelchair. It's about the playdates you aren't invited to, the schools your kid can't go to, the life events your kid may never have. It's also about the miracle of Joey's first time coming up the stairs from having ABA and calling me \"Mommy.\" The joy of watching Joey touch a drum. The absolute shock of having him turn to me and say, \"I like the music!\" It's about moving beyond shock, anger, fear, disappointment, and grief, and living the life you have rather than the one you thought you ought to have had, or the one everyone else seems to be having. It's about supporting the child and accepting the child as s/he is, and not trying to get that child to be a person you thought s/he should have been. It's about coming to terms with what society deems \"normal\", and what you actually have, and realizing that you have a treasure, too.     So I hate this sticker. It just communicates to me people who are too wrapped up int themselves to understand that raising an autistic child (or any disabled child) is not like raising a \"typical\" one, and it can be frustrating, isolating, and frightening, and parents need some support and understanding, too. It looks to me like the reaction of a spoiled rotten brat to something that doesn't even pertain to them. It dismisses the sacrifices parents make to raise and care for their autistic children- often well into adulthood.  17. \"My kid has autism, alright? Now get out of my way!\" I don't get this one. Somehow, not understanding this makes me feel better. Obviously this is a problem I have not had to face.  18. \"Spock was not Vulcan. He was autistic, with pointy ears.\" I always remember the beginning of the Star Trek movie where the re-generated Spock is regaining memories and the computer is testing him. He is answering questions at a frantic pace without breaking a sweat, when it asks him, \"How do you feel?\" He can't answer the question. His human mother has to explain to him that the computer knows he is half-human, and so has emotions, even though he has been trained in the Vulcan way. This is important. Don't just train your autistic children to respond to academic skills. They also need social skills, need to be able to understnad emotion, need to be able to connect to the world. Education professionals often forget this, since their screening paperwork doesn't account for it.  19. \"We all have challeneges. What makes you 'special'\"? Another one that should be on every bumper.  20. \"Autism is a disorder, not a disease.\" I like this one because it concedes that autism is not normal, and requires services and support, while turning aside the \"cure\" thing. My child is not just \"different.\" Joey is currently disabled. He cannot be cured, but he can be helped.  21. \"Inclusion works when teachers believe all children can learn.\" Teaching is a tough job- when it is done right. Keeping track of all those learning styles and needs- wow! Unfortunately, most classrooms are not set up for inclusion. Either you get it the way the teacher hands it out today, or you're screwed.  22. \"My kid was poisoed by mercury in vaccines, but everyone calls it autism.\" I'd like to make a sticker that reads, \"My kid was NOT poisoned by vaccines. He's still autistic. Now what?\"  23. \"Oops. Wrong Planet.\" I giggle at this one, because it's another one I think I ought to be wearing myself.  24. \"When life gives you lemons... you'd better not be talking about your kid that way.\" I am sure this is a reference to some essay on accepting being a parent of a disabled child, but I have no idea what essay. However, I definitely have to agree- my life may not be \"as expected\", but Joey ain't a lemon.  25. \"I am not a puzzle, I am a person.\" We're all puzzles. We're all people, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/01/commentary-bumper-stickers.html", "title": "\nCommentary: Bumper Stickers\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 27, 2007", "body": "\nJoey loves music. Mom got him some drumsticks, and he's been going crazy (in a good way). He seems to have an OK sense of beat and time. I took him over to the church this evening. They have a casual contemporary service on Saturday nights, with a little band. When I took him last week to be baptized (long story), he really loved the music. He danced in the aisles, strumming his tummy liek a guitar or pretending to drum, and impressed everyone when they stopped and he'd say \"Very good!\" Then the band leader started ending songs with \"Amen!\" so Joey started saying \"Amen!\" as soon as a song ended. Everyone thought that was incredibly cute. Well, its a church after all. What's cuter than a four-year-old enjoying being at church and joining into \"Amen\" at the end of a song?  Anyway, he loved it so much I took him tonight. We sat up in the front pew so he could get a good long look at the instruments, and one of the percussionists came over and started handing him instruments to play, like shakers and spoonsets. Joey was THRILLED. He did a really nice job, especially with the spoons. I haven't seen him that happy in ages!  So often when people interact with Joey, and start to get the clue that something is not-quite-right, we get a curious reaction- usually something akin to a dirty look, or a scowl, or a pushing-away that is really very hurtful. It was just nice to see people react to Joey in a way that appreciated who he is, and welcomed him. Nobody there wanted to try to change him, or ask him to be quiet, or stop him from being a four-year-old in love with music. Yes, that band has a new #1 fan.

{"date": "Saturday, March 17, 2007", "body": "\nWell, I spent today in Richmond, getting a tour of the Faison School. Thought I'd share.  The Faison School has taken over an old hospital building. The younger kids have space downstairs, including the wide, still-clinical halls where they park their ride-ons and hang their bookbags. Wandering about this lower level are a variety of students, not just the younger ones, all with a one-on-one aide or therapist. There are trampolines, bean-bag chairs, train sets, and sit-and-spins. It is an ABA paradise of small rooms divided roughly into cubbies by bookshelves and cubicle-like walls and desks. In other words, if you are looking for a 12-month, full-day, $57,000 DTT program, I have found the perfect thing for your kid. And I am convinced there are people who need this, and kids who do very well with it. I am very happy for them.  However, I was very concerned about it as a program for Joey. For one, the person giving me the tour seemed amazed that Joey could ride a bicycle through a hall at high speed, and manouver through that hall without hitting any object or any person. She also seemed very impressed when he said \"hello\" to her on cue (I prompted him with \"Say hello to Ms. Shirley, Joey!\" and he said \"hello\" without even looking a her- something he only does with strangers). I had hoped this would not be such an impressive accomplishment for a child going into kindergarden. Not one of the children we saw there was even close to being \"as functional\" as Joey- the behaviors were far more random and severe. The programs we were shown were far below Joey's level. When I asked about socialization and generalization, I was told there was an hour each day when teh children worked in groups (great- with other autistic kids), and that there as plenty of opportunity for \"natural interaction\" and generalization in the halls. Um... the hals that still look remarkably like a hospital (or other institution). In other words, they had nothing to offer Joey but more drill. Isn;t there supposed to be more to ABA than DTT?  If you have a kid who is having a lot of trouble responding, who needs to learn how to learn and how to play, I would definitely look into Faison. The people there were very nice and polite, they seemed to care a lot about their charges, and they showed an interest in both Joey and Andy. However, if you have a kid who has moved on and needs more attention to social skills, interacting with peers, and sensory issues, well... I'm still looking. I'll keep you posted.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/03/review-faison-school.html", "title": "\nA Review: The Faison School\n"},

Nope. She's serious.  And so the big battle is scheduled for Feb 28: the IEP meeting.  I tried to get this settled before the IEP, but apparently she had better things to do and everyone else's kid was more important than mine, and she just couldn't fit me into her schedule. So instead of quietly settling the matter, we're going to settle it loud and clear, and in front of her colleagues. Yuck.  The discussion between her and my private OT has been terrifyingly illuminating. She really does think putting fingers to a child's throat is \"more subtle\" than giving them a peice of chewing gum. Really. She didn't understand the importance of sensory integration interventions to an autistic child. In fact, for a women outing herself as a professional OT and advertising her work with the new autism resource room- one of the reasons she couldn't meet- you'd think she'd have some inkling about the sensory integration issues of autistic children, and approparite, functional interventions and accommodations. Every time I think about her in there with other autistic children, I get more and more concerned. They need someone in there supporting them- especially an OT- not someone torturing them!

These folks are not special ed trained, and the teachers aren't even education trained- they're Sunday School teachers, and have been for a while. Autism is not something they usually deal with. To them, he needs to act like everybody else, or at least do what everyone else does. The director was very helpful, having been in teh Stafford schools and having at least some exposure to the challenges and accommodations of autistic children. She could translate. ;)  I let them know I would have something of an answer by the time Sunday rolled around again. So the next Sunday I walked in, and told them about teh gum, and brought his vibrator. Before I even got the pack of gum out of my pocket, the one teacher had a peice in his mouth, and the other was thanking me. I was shoo-ed away. I returned to find he had earned a lollipop like everyone else. They had someone put a hand on his shoulder during storytime, and had also given him a stuffed animal to hold, so that they had the vibrator in reserve. Bingo. Earned a lollipop.

We talk all the time about giving Joey language to use. I think we forget that, not having raised kids before, we need language, too. Here is a wealth of language- talking about making things, and emotions, and people, and all sorts of stuff that is important to kids just Joey's age.  One thing about faddy books, they don't work for kids with autism. Fad \"discipline\" and the latest modes for getting kids to do what the parents want them to do just aren't very helpful for a child who is on the edge of not even hearing you. Timeouts make no sense. Bargains have no meaning. With Mr. Rogers, you have positive and proactive ways of helping a child, because Mr. Rogers always keeps in mind that children are people. Behaviors have reasons. A child isn't screaming or crying just to annoy you. Here is a whole daily program about considering what a child's world looks like, feels like, how it works and doesn' work, and how to talk about what is happening- in simple, clear language, just like you need for an autistic child, or any child.

This is a program where the child listens to specially modulated sound, stimulating brain development. His first session was today.  The whole experience was overwhelming. He was in a new room, with a new person, and then she wanted to put headphones on him! Yikes! Insta-meltdown! Then she started noticing other things, and finally turned to me and said, \"He really desperately needs this; but you know he has other issues, right?\" Riiiiiiight. Just what I want to hear on a Monday morning.  So we decided to just try to get him to put the earphones on this week, instead of having him listen to anything. Coming down teh road, I put them on, so he would see me wearing them; and he wanted them. So I handed then back to him... and he put them right on, and cheerfully wore them until naptime.  Riiiiiiight.  So the question is... how to control the overload? The earphones do not muffle outside sound, but I wonder if they control it some for him- so that it hits his ear at a certain angle, and if that would make a difference. I wonder if putting sound directly into his ear like this might not hurt. Yet, I can't send him to school like he is- there is no way he can focus on anythng in a classroom full of chaotic noise! Maybe sending him to a Montessori, where its usually quiet, would work better fo him than a public school.

It was the first beautiful Friday we've had in a while, and the kids didn't have Wee Time, so I thought ti would be good to take them somewhere. Joey wasn't feeling good Thursday, but he seemed to be recovered, so I thought Richmond and goat-petting would be an excellent destination.  We were delayed by ome phone calls- the most damaging being one of the lawyers calling to say she wasn't taking new cases, and perhaps I ought to spend my energies making sure his next IEP is \"airtight.\" TO which I could only think, I canput all the OT goals and time in there I want, if its done by a person with an attitude and lack of skill, what good is it? But anyway...  So I packed up the guys and headed out to get some gas. I was about to right-turn-on-red when a little truck cut me off, and I had to brake. I didn't hit him. The person behind me, however, didn't stop in time, and we were bumped. It was more of an annoyance than anything else; there's a dent in my tailgate, but it still works, and no one was hurt. Andy freaked because of teh bang, but soon was giggling with his brother. WE had to wait for a policeman to show up, who was very nice, but it ate our morning.  So instead of heading down to Richmond right away, we went ot World Market and picked up a set of CHinese paints and brushes. I want to show my students how difficult Chinese ink painting really is, and there is no better way than handing them a brush, a stone, and some dry ink, and saying \"go for it!\" The store was a disaster waiting to happen- little kiosks of grabbables every where. Fortunately, my guys were more interested in each other, and they were perfect little angels. I was so proud of them! We decided to go get Grandma and go on to petting goats, they were so good.  Goat petting is fun. Feeding them is even better. There were peacocks on top of the chicken coop, and Joey found them all by himself- it is such a miracle to have him noticing his environment, but to really explore it to find peacocks way over his head... wow! And when they got tired, they said goodbye to the animals and came along to the car without a lick of trouble. Incredible.  So home we went, and rested for a bit while I made some spaghetti for dinner, and returned more phone calls (Kennedy Krieger, the director fo student services, another possible professional advocate, a couple of law offices). We had a nice dinner, some nice baths, and an OK bedtime (Andy was a bit of a fuss, the time change is a little bit of a mess still). My husband and I setled in for the night with our work.  About 11:30, we heard tow quick barks from Joey's room. Oh no, I thought, croup! And he came in barking, sure enough, so I got the humidifier going in the bathroom, and got settled into the steam with him whil Allan ran to get some meds for him. He had been gone... five minutes? Not ten... and Joey started to scream with every breath, \"I'm broken! I'm broken!\" OK, the mist isn't working, I thought, I'll get his shoes on and take him over to emergency when Allan gets back. I carried him down the stairs. I foudn the shoes. I took up Joey's foot in my hand. It was cold.  It was blue.  I ran to the door. No Allan.  I called 9-1-1. The dispatcher was very professional, and I rubbed Joey's hands and talked to him until we could hear the ambulance. He asked for Daddy, he asked for Grandma. Broken-broken-broken- all gone. He said he could hear the ambulance, and I told him they wer coming to help, help was coming, the doctor was coming. Allan arrived just as the ambulance and the fire truck did. THey put an oxygen mask on him, and he was better within a minute. The blue faded. He smiled at me, at the paramedic, and he looked for his Daddy. We told him he would get to ride in the ambulance, and he seemed happy about that, sitting up on the stretcher like a big, big boy and letting them strap him in.  I got into teh ambulance with him. He was turning slowly pink again. We were waiting for him to stabilize, and they switched to blow-by. He was giving high-fives to one ofthe paramedics. They asked him some questions, and he was answering and responding to them pretty well. Then he said, \"All fixed now. Thank you. I feel better.\"  The ride was fun for him. He liked getting the x-rays taken. He didn't like the medicine much, but he did OK with teh mask and the all. We finally went home about 3 am. On the way home, Allan said, \"Hey, Joey, Did you have fun? Want to do this again tomorrow?\"  To which that silly boy replied, \"oh, YES!

This is supposed to encourage his brain to improve his sensory integration.  The three different parts of this I have seen elsewhere. The light has to do with visual integration, but I haven't seen it in any \"regular\" or mainstream therapies... I hope someone will comment if they have. The table movement is for vestibular stuff, like the swings and stuff Joey does for OT. The sound is similar to therapeutic listening, which Andy starts tomorrow, and both our OT and out speech therapy folks were very happy about.  A sample session was part of the visit. He hated the table. He had to lay on his back and look at the light, but I think it made him nauseous. He preferred to sit up, but of course, that wouldn't do. But far worse, the lights had to be out. I know most autistic people prefer less light, or even dark, but Joey is really freaked by it, unless he's in his own bedroom. He hates dark. The lady tried to use the light switch as a reinforcer to encourage him to lay on his back and be still, but that made me all the more skeptical. \"Do this and I'll stop torturing you\" is just not what I would consider good therapy. However, he definitely was speaking better and clearer while this was all happening than I've heard from him in a while.  It costs $3000, plus the costs of being in Charlottesville for 12 days, since he would need to be there every day, twice a day.  So I would say, if you have a kid with sensory issues, and you start checking this out, I can't really say there is nothing to it at all.

The houe next to us has several grown children, an apartment, and two couples living there, and everyone has at least one car. We have three vehicles (two we use regularly, one is a Jeep that we have retained in case of snow and use as a truck). The other three buildings around us are all rentals- a duplex, a house, and three aparments. Guess what? they all have cars. We have a driveway. The people next door have converted their yard to a 3-space parking lot, and they have two lengths of street frontage (they are the corner lot). Yet we still have troubles.  My driveway actually parks two cars, and we used to park the Jeep in the end of it, since it wasn't used much. BUt the folks next door insisted on parking a car in front of our house. Usually, there are two spaces in front of our house, but they inisisted on parking in the middle, so that my husband had no-where to park but across the street, which seemed to us to be rude, to park in front of someone else's house all night long (it was annoying us, after all...) so we learned to park the Jeep out front. Then we had the second space that was just right for my husband's car, and we weren't being complete nuisances by blocking up the street all night long. We didn't leave nasty notes and we didn't call the police, we just parked our car. After all, it is public parking.  Now, what this means is there is no place for mom to park when she comes to help watch my little guy while I drive the other one around to therapy. And there is no-where to park for my therapists who come. They cannot park in the driveway, because I also cannot be blocked in when I have to go to teach; and my mom has a lo of trouble getting in and out of o driveway, since all of these people have large SUVs they park on the street. Besides, I would block her in when I came home, or have to park on teh streetmyself. So to the street she goes. After all, it is public parking.

What a great idea... not.  Fortunately, Joey performed beautifully. There were too many people in the service, so we set up camp in the vestibule. Fortunately, the nursery was open, so Andy got an extra few minutes to play. There was NO WAY he would be able to deal with that many people all at once. Joey wanted to go up and see the instruments, so we ran up the side aisle. Our service has a deaf couple with an interpreter in teh front row; Joey reached the front and the intepreter was there signing, and stopped, fascinated. He had me hold him for a while to hear and bounce to the music, and watch the signing, and he was such a happy little child. When we ran back to the vestibule, it was packed with people; no longer a quiet escape from the crowd. Yet, Joey did not meltdown; instead, he started barking like a dog and tracking the lines in the floor. We got some funny looks, but since he was managing to control himself and make himself comfy, I was prety proud of him.  So Children's Time came at last, and up we went. We sat towards the back of the crowd of children, in front of our deaf friends. The children's pastor had the kids sing a song; I wasn't familiar with it, but JOey was trying hard to sing along, so they must have been teaching it in Sunday School. Of course, his procesing problems meant he remained a verse and half behind, and he was getting frustrated; he knew the others were ahead of him. He sat in my lap and tried, though; I am SO proud of him! And then the amazing thing happened.  The deaf lady caught his attention, and was signing the song to him; and he tried to sign back, and sang along.  The whole visual thing just struck me, then and there. I know Joey is highly visual, and learns best with visual cues and aids. TV is a great boon for us. He just loves the idea of reading. He's a very visual person. But to see him able to process the visual cues so much faster, and actually keep up... I am going to spend some time this afternoon looking for signing classes. It would be such a simple way to help him keep up with the conversation, to be able to give him those visual cues. I know he'll need to get on in the world without signs, but he also will need to keep up with work and lessons, and having a way to help him not lose that ground has to be worth something.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RhlBIvLlUmI/AAAAAAAAABA/kPCkbE3KtgM/s1600-h/03_andy.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RhlBCPLlUlI/AAAAAAAAAA4/A6mPEh51A2s/s1600-h/03_joey.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/04/easter.html", "title": "\nEaster\n"},

He wants us to work on social skills. The OT wants us to try brushing. The PT wants him able to climb into a sling-swing. The SLP says he's progressed in receptive language a full standard of deviation, so now he's just breaking into two standards of deviation, instead of being a full 3 standards of deviation behind. So he's made up some ground. We didn't test expressive, but he's about to get a full eval from our private OT anyway. We were just testing the waters. Why, I don't know. I keep calling them saying I want a full eval to get a sense of where he is, and when we get there, they're all just consult appointments. But at least I''l have some letters with \"Kluge\" in the letterhead saying he needs services. They'll promptly be ignored, but there you are.  We'll probably wait on teh brushing until summer. If I can't get this school OT to even give him gum, I can't see expecting her to do brushing in a supportive, appropriate way. After all, when it was mentioned before, she blew it off as \"too difficult, too time-consuming.\" If it works, what's a little time?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/04/long-day.html", "title": "\nA Long Day\n"},

However, today was an Andy Day, and there are clouds on the horizon.  We have Andy doing something called Therapeutic Listening. Its one of those therapies that sounds like a duck, but it can't hurt him, so why not try it? Andy, like me, is highly sensitive to sound, and appears to have some other sensory issues going on that make him dislike crowds, avoid too many people at once (even familiar ones), and get very, very grumpy. He also has been doign a lot more toe-walking. He doesn't appear to be autistic, but appearances? What would I know? We've got an appointment for Dr. Blakcman to give him a look-see in May. In the meantime, we have the Listening. He listens to modulated music for 30 minutes, twice a day. It actually seems to be helping, as he will now listen ot the music on a normal volume (at first, I couldn't even hear it and he would pitch a fit), and will do a single activity for the half-hour, such as playing with playdough or doing puzzles. Who knew?  My private OT.  Anyway, we're also trying to do a general eval, and that is much harder. Andy has a lot of trouble following instructions, espceially from strangers (he does just OK at home). He seems to be doing something very strange- his skills set is all over the place, making the test nearly impossible to score. The joys of standardization. In the meantime, the speech therapist took a look at him. He's having some trouble with articulation. His language use seems to be ok, but understanding what he's saying can be next to impossible. We're going to see if the insurance will cover an eval and therapy for him. Then we shall see what we shall see.  I really don't want him in teh hands of the special ed folks. That's just won't do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/04/andy.html", "title": "\nAndy\n"},

So he got up this morning, and started rummaging through the clean clothes (which tend to sit in the hall with the washer and dryer, rather than being folded and put away in a timely manner). When I asked him what he needed, he said \"Red one! I want a red shirt!\"  Allow me to stop and pick up my teeth from the floor. He responded to me... in a sentence... expressing a preference. My Joey! What a great birthday present!!!  After a good deal of rummaging, we did finally find a red shirt. I was surprised he didn't have several, usually we have a variety of long-sleeve t-shirts from teh Lands' End Overstocks, but apparently they are all size 6, and have been passed down to Andy, and got mostly replaced by blue and orange shirts (the red ones must not have been on sale). But I finally found one that fit him, and all was groovy. I got him dressed, and started on Andy, who wanted his favorite dinosaur shirt this morning.  Joey started down teh stairs.  Last night, I prepared for the Birthday Morning by setting up a playtent in teh livingroom, and arranging his presents. So as I am dressing Andy, Joey starts down the stairs, and sees teh tent, and says, \"Oh! Nice surprise!\"  I could have cried.  This burst of verbal-ness is actually something of a shock. It started when he was put on the oxygen during our Croup Crisis a couple weeks ago. He's been using sentences ever since. We know Joey does these burst-breakthroughs, but to have it coincide so perfectly with the oxygen and steroids (he was put on steroids for the croup) is just strange. It was so dramatic, I'm going to have him checked again for allergies, since this steroid helps stem allergic reactions.  Tomorrow is Kluge Day.

I've always had trouble with TVs and being tired- if I'm tired, and you want to talk to me, turn the TV off, or I can't even hear you. But now its like I can't do it at all. If I'm in a room and there are other conversations going, I can't even hear the person speaking to me, and often find I have looked away- even when I know I am being spoken to. It happened today. Miss Carrie, one of our speech therapists, was giving me the latest results from an evaluation she had just completed. I know she was talking to me. I can even tell you some of the words that emerged from her mouth. But all I could hear were the boys, and suddenly I realized I missed the conversation, perhaps she had asked me a question? She was now asking me if I was nervous. About what? Whether Joey was apraxic? About the possibility that even this diagnosis wouldn't get the medical insurance to kick in something? I don;t think it was connected to what I hadn't heard, though. I think she had just noticed I wasn't there anymore. I feel terrible about it, too, because I'm sure it seems rude for me not to focus on her when she's telling me important stuff, and has lengthened her day by an hour to test him for us, and all. I need to do something really nice to thank this person, she really is bending over backwards to help us, and not many people are doing that these days.  But in the meantime, I am definitely seeing an increase in this kind of occurance. One part of me wonders if this is what happens to Joey when he can't focus on a task- because I can't even really tell you where my mind was, I just snapped back and realized it wasn't focusing on what it should have been focusing on. Another part worries if there is something changing, or if this is just a sympathetic sort of response- I am either noticing these things more because I know more about the problems Joey may be facing and autism generally, or they are occuring more as a psychosomatic response to Joey being autistic, and the stress of fighting with the very people who are supposed to be helping us, the \"school folk.\" Or am I just getting old, and this is part of that? Or am I suffering some form of exhaustion, and need to see somebody? Because it really needs to stop. And if this is what its like to be Joey, then I definitely need to help.

{"date": "Thursday, April 26, 2007", "body": "\nI don't get much sleep in the week before an IEP meeting. Even with one like this, where I have a plan, I get insomnia. When I get insomnia, I often end up with bad analogies and t-shirt slogans. Then I torture you with them. ;)  This one is \"what its like to wok with our school OT.\u201d I know disease references might seem offensive to some folks, but they do get across the sense of importance of the situation.  You're sick, and you suspect there may be something wrong with your endocrine system. There is only one endocrinologist covered by your insurance, so off you go. He does some tests, and tells you that you have diabetes. When you look at the results of the tests, they look bad, and you start some treatment for diabetes.  After a year, your test results come back with slightly better sugar numbers- let's say, 250, when you now know you're supposed to be under 90; but its better than the 300 you were. After a small lecture on how painful needles can be and the risks of insulin, you start a little insulin. In the meantime, another doctor you're seeing for a skin rash looks at your records and suggests you see an out-of-network endocrinologist who specializes in diabetes (note- for those of you unfamiliar with diabetes, you can get a skin rash if your sugar gets too high). Doubtful that there is much else to be done, because the doctor has been telling you that everything necessary is being done, you decide it can't hurt to have a second opinion.  To your shock, you are told that yes, you have diabetes... and pancreatic cancer. As you look over the tests, including one that most endocrinologists consider standard, but your other doctor didn't even do, it is practically staring you in the face.  Your other doctor remains skeptical, so you decide to get a third opinion. That also comes back screaming \"pancreatic cancer!\" (which would, of course, explain why you're diabetic). You take these reports back to your doctor, and note that both of the other endocrinologists recommend cancer treatments. Your doctor replies with bringing you some literature about cancer treatments, while telling you that these treatments are all extremely painful and risky, and you *could* try them, but why bother? Your sugar is improving with the treatment you are getting, and its the diabetes that needs to be controlled. You insist on at least some treatment for some of your other symptoms that have been revealed by the other testing, and to get your sugars under control. The doctor reluctantly gives you an increase in insulin.  In the meantime, not being an idiot, you begin cancer treatment with one of the other doctors. In trying to get your sugars under control, the new doctor suggests you might want to eat certain kinds of foods that are low in sugar. You take this to your first doctor. They freak out. They tell you that you need carbohydrates in your diet. They scream something about Atkins and South Beach diets. They tell you the cafeteria can't handle this particular request because of dietary rules. You note that the new diet seems to be helping to control your sugar, so they contact your second doctor and ask them to change their recommendation. Needless to say, doctor #2 is highly offended, and responds that dietary control of diabetes is extremely common, and her first duty is to her client, not convenience. The first doctor permits the diet, but still tells you they don't like it and you should eat plenty of carbs. You go to their boss. That boss tells you no one has ever complained about the endocrinologist, and he has to be able to treat pancreatic cancer, because the law says so, and when the boss talked to the doc, the doc seemed very enthusiatic about the new diet. He won't pay for the treatment you've been receiving from the other doctor, period.  It has now been another six months, trying to get this all in place. You first doctor does some tests without your knowledge. At your next appointment, he presents the results, saying, \"You're are now doing so well on the insulin... wow, 100! You may not need that insulin anymore! And look! Your cancer has been cured!\" And I'm supposed to have confidence in this person?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/04/life-is-like-bowl-of-cherries.html", "title": "\nLife is like a bowl of cherries\n"},

He had a pretty good day, but when he got back to his own school, he walked into a pole, then got upset that his sticker got torn. then he was upset about sing the bathroom (not his favorite thing to do in the first place), and ended up not eating much lunch, but was apparently able to join the class at the table for milk.  I replied to this narration of events with a bit of surprise that they were surprised. They turned his schedule upside down, with practically no notice. Fortunately, it was ABA and OT day, and I got him mostly reigned in, but I know he was upset because he wouldn't talk about it at all, not even with yes/no questions. The therapies headed off the brunt of the repercussions by immiedately providing familiar structure and specialized sensory input. He's had a pretty good week, just still not talking about his \"adventure\" and a little persnickety, nothing I would consider major.  The teacher's response was that it coudn't have been the change in schedule, because he was so happy during the day in the new school: \"So in my view the trip and change in schedule were not the causes for the breakdown because he seemed happy and flexible the entire time we were on the bus and at Hugh Mercer.\" Doesn't this person realize that when she makes these changes, it impacts us here at home?

Is he just stressed because his brain is moving forward and doing new things, or is there a real concern- like something going on at school we should know about?  While we investigate, I will say it has given us an interesting opportunity to see what supports he needs to channel these needs for stimulation. We have discovered that he will focus on video games, een if he will focus on NOTHING else. He loves Pinky DInky Doo and Oobi games through the Noggin site, the coloring pages on Mr. Roger's Neighborhood's site, and some of the counting-based games on Sesame Street. Counting and numbers are very comforting for him. WE also noticed that putting him in a rocking chair makes a difference, and having something in his hands makes a difference. IF he can sit with some playdough in his hands, he can do more. I think having the trackball mouse for the video games gives him that same kind of input, and heps him focus. And, of course, the gum...  I wouldn't really worry about him not being able to focus fully except that full-day kindergarten is coming. He won't have a choice- he has to perform the activitiy when it is presented. So we need strategies for helping him perform those tasks, and perform them on time. He'll have aenough trouble keeping up because of the processing delays, but if we can find those strategies that help him process- instead of zone out completely and process nothing- the happier he will be, because his frustration will be less.

The rain poured all the same, and we had to go home. Mom and Andy were waiting. We waited for the worst to pass through, took a deep breath, and ran. Joey like getting his feet in teh water as it flowed like a river over the parking lot and under the car. He loves water. He would have stood there all evening if I had let him. But into teh car we go, and home through the storm. JOey chats a little about the weather. \"It's RAINing. Look at the water. Water, mommy. Rain... sun... rainbow! It's RAINing.\" I try to think of rain songs, and I hit one he knows from Little Bear (It's raining, it's pouring, the man in the moon is snoring, he went to bed with a cold in his head, and he won't get up 'til morning...) We sing it a few times. HE goes back to the perseveration. It's practically over when we get home.  But there has been a fatal error. Joey's toy shopping cart, that he has been using for the last couple of weeks to track through the house, has been left accidentally outside (where he was tracking on the deck). It's wet, and can't come in teh house like that. Disaster. Now its twenty minutes of \"Cart! I want cart! I want cart NOW!\" and screaming, as he can se the cart outside, through teh window, but is not permitted to fetch the beloved possession. When the rain stops, I run out and fetch it in, and dry it (and its contents) carefully. But disaster has struck already, and we are off-kilter for the rest of the night.  We'll see what tomorrow looks like, when we rise in the morning.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/rain.html", "title": "\nRain\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 10, 2007", "body": "\nI've been having some interesting conversations with some other friends who either have very young children, or very typical children. The complaint of the day appears to be Summer. School is out. What to do with the bairns? Ah, the stress of having to spend time with your little ones, while the days are warm and the sun is up early and to bed late.  From what I have gathered, the typical summer day for \"normal\" kids goes kind of like this:  Rise: Somewhere in the region of 9 am. If the kids are early risers, then they get up earlier, or know to play quietly until Mom gets out of bed. The 6:30-7 am rise for a school day is clearly relaxed. For preschoolers, the 8 am rise is relaxed to 9.  Breakfast. Most of the mom I know actually cook breakfast, or at least do more than tell their kids to get their own cereal. However, I understand that this may actually be unusual. At any rate, breakfast is served.  Hanging out. Perhaps they will go to the park today. Maybe a ride somewhere. Perhaps there's a special event in town. A trip to Grandma's is always good for an outing. If all else fails, that's what the TV and DVD player are for, or that video game console. ' Lunch. This apparenly can happen anywhere from 11 am to 1 pm, depending on when your bairns rise in the first place. Buy stock in peanut butter, jelly, and chips. Apple orchards are a good bet, too.  Hanging out. Going to the pool is a popular afternoon activity, as Mom gets a chance to chat with other moms while the little ones get cool and wet. Rainy afternoons- well, that's what that TV and DVD player or video game console are for.  Snack. Sometime during the afternoon, the hanging out is disturbed for consumption of sugary and/or salty comestibles, washed down by juice. (Yes, I know many of my readers will be offering actual healthy snacks to their kids. Most of my friends with normal kids don't read this blog.) More hanging out. If one cannot remain at the pool until dinner, another activity is usually offered, involving the TV and DVD player, or the game console. (I think some of these people need to get that \" no electronics until after 5 \" rule and get some creativity going for engaging these kids.) Dinner. Mac and cheese, hotdogs, maybe something from the grill. Buy stock in Oscar Meyer. It's going to be BIG. Dinner being consumed somewhere between 6 and 8 pm, with no regularity to when exactly- eat when the mood hits you and the grill is warm enough.  More hanging out. TV and DVD or game console again. No surprise there.  Bedtime. This begins sometime when the kids feel sleepy, anywhere from 9 to 11 pm. Bath, stories, songs, tucked in, and off to dreamland, until tomorrow...  OR:  6 am: drop child at daycare.  6pm: pick up child from daycare.  Take, for contrast, what my summer is going to look like:  Rise: Between 7 and 8 am. No later than 8 am, but I would like to sleep in that long. Dressing ritual commences.  Breakfast: Eaten by 8:30 am.  9 am: OT camp for Joey. This will bein town, so about 10 minutes in the car. Take activities to entertain Andy while waiting for Joey.  10 am- consult with the OT.  10:30-11:30- playground. If it is raining, basement activities: blocks, trains, coloring, painting, something of that sort.  11:45- make lunch. Lunch must be ready by 12 noon. Lunch must be consumed by 12:30, because we have to be in the car promptly at 12:30.  12:30- drive to Speech camp.  1-2:15 Speech Camp for Joey. Activities packed for Andy.  2:15- consult with the speech therapist.      Tuesdays: More speech, 2:45-3:30pm.      Wednesdays: OT 4-5 pm.      Thursdays: OT 3-4 pm. Drum lesson, 5-5:30 pm.      Yet to be Scheduled: OT for Andy and Speech for Andy, once per week each. OT might be 11 am on Mondays, eliminating morning playground on Mondays.  1/2 drive back home.  Also yet to be scheduled: ABA sessions, probably 3 hours per week, to teach safety and communication.  Any spare time in the afternoon will be spent in the back yard or the basement, depending on weather and scheduling of presently unscheduled activities.  Dinner: Promptly at 6 pm.  6pm-7pm: Wind down. Yes, I will probably get out the TV and DVD player, or have them play games from Noggin and Sesame Street.  7 pm- bedtime. Bath, story, song together. story and song each seperate. Lights out. Joey will play in his window until the light fades. Andy will play until he passes out.  On weekends, each and every Saturday I am not working (I don't get a lot of work in the summer) will be taken up by a \"field trip.\" Sundays will have Sunday school and a ride to a closer destination or visit to Grandma.  There will be no room for variation, unless someone gets physically ill.  When the conversation turns to \"summer woes,\" I realy have nothing to say. What they are talking about sounds like a wonderful, relaxing life to me. If I mention what my days look like, they glaze over and start talking about the pool. I can't take my kids to the pool by myself.  My friends and I share one thing: we both are holding on for Fall, when kids go back to school. In their view, they will get their lives \"back\". In my view, I will get two hours twice per week to clean, vacuum, do laundry, cut the lawn, try to get caught up on repairs, and at Christmas, clean and decorate and bake cookies (mmmm... cookies...) At least I will get lots of time to play with Andy. I am already putting together a otebook of ideas for portable projects and activities that can be done in waiting rooms and office playrooms. :)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://whitterer-autism.blogspot.com/2007/04/back-in-jiffy.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/summertime-nears.html", "title": "\nSummertime Nears\n"},

These are then ceremonious taken home, and left to dry out in their little plastic pots. Sometimes I get them in the ground and revived. But it sure is fun picking them out.  This year I had the boys pulling the wagon for me. Its one of those moments that hits me oddly. When joey was Andy's age, he did not pull the wagon. He did not try to pull the wagon. I spent most of the time chasing him among the flower-tables, but he never even saw the flowers. He had been in school most of a year, and had about 25 words. If I bothered to move about two feet, I could pick up his baby book and tell you what the 25 words were. \"Flower\" was not one of them.  This year, Andy was all about the flowers, the wagon, and the brothers wanted Mommy to pull, then Andy wanted to pull Brother (Mom had to help), then Joey wanted to pull, then they both wanted to pull the flowers for me, and they both wanted Grandma to watch. Andy did a lot of hard pulling. We could discuss it as a sensory issue., all the heavy work, but what fun is that? Andy wanted a plant, he got his own grape tomato plant, he LOVES grape tomatoes. I hope we get a chance to plant it together tomorrow. Joey wanted a blue flower. I found some purple verbena, and that seems to do. I also got some geraniums for the front, and some dahlias, and some thyme to spread on the little paths- they'll smell good as boy feet crush them. I may try to track down some more to edge the yard. I have a lot of mint already growing. They didn't have any lemon thyme or pineapple sage, so I'll have to go elsewhere. Before I had boys, we'd get herbs at the Cathedral, but I doubt I'll get up there- again.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 15, 2007", "body": "\nThe latest on my craw's radar: people who (appear to?) object to early intervention. Remember that my son is five. He is a product of early intervention. I believe in making sure that ALL people get the services and supports they need- that is, early intervention is not about telling other people it is \"too late\" or an alternative to providing service to older children or adults. Early intervention is identifying children who need services and support as early as possible and providing he service and support they need. It is about trying hard to get kids learning the skills other \"normal\" kids pick up on their own, and helping them learn to function, to play, to learn about their world and communicate with their fellow human beings.  Although this attitude may not be shared by all folks who believe in early intervention, I can only speak to the attitudes I know. Maybe there are folsk who believe they are curing their kid. I have no such allusions. I am teaching my autistic child to live in a world designed for people who are not autistic.  But the objections to early intervention seem to be something I can't put my finger on. I sometimes have this trouble between when my critical thinking alarm goes off (\"there's something wrong with this argument...\") and when I actuallyhave time to process what the other person is arguing to be able to pinpoint the problem (\"Oh! I see. You think the sky is yellow. Well, that doesn't work.\") At this stage in my processing, I can only say that when people scream very loudly and get very upset and start attacking other people because of their parenting choices and semantics of their goal, there is usually something wrong i the argument- especially when they suddenly seem to be in my face.  Sometimes there is something wrong with my own thinking. I'm learning all this too, after all. I am not a perfect savant about autism or even about Joey. I'm no mindreader, and I have to learn what he's thinking and feeling the same way other people do- I'm just better at understanding him than most other people. I understand that I don't know everything. But usually by the time I have ideas that get out here, they've been pretty thought through, so that they are at least  reasonable , even if not always  right . There is no need for shouting, or getting surly. Present me with new information.  But usually when I have someone surly and sharp telling me what an idiot I am, there is something wrong with that side of things. The assumption of stupidity is a huge red flag. The assumption of lack of research is another red flag. It makes me start to look very carefully at what is being said- and what is being implied.  Back to the case in point: early intervention. So far, there seems to be an anti-early-intervention segment, and they are very, very angry. So far, the objections to early intervention seem to be:  1. You shouldn't medicalize child development.  2. It is impossible to diagnose autism before age 2.  3. Children before age 2 often seem to be autistic.  4. Early intervention is intended to \"cure\" autistic children.  5. Early intervention services deny services to older children and adults (apparently because the services are intended to \"cure\" autism.) Child development is already medicalized. That's why we go to a pediatrician for well-baby appointments every 6 months.  If we had been knowledgeable about autism, we could hav diagnosed Joey before the age of 2- closer to 18 months. He was showing signs while we were still in the hospital, but diagnosing based on sensory problems would probably be very tricky.  My non-autistic child is VERY different from Joey- even with the sensory problems my other child has. With them side-by-side, there is no mistaking that Joey was autistic from birth. I have not met a normal child who \"seemed\" autistic the way autistic children do before age 2. I have met children with other disabilities who present very similarly to autism. And for the record, Joey did have things like eye contact, smiles, and interest in people as a baby. No one sign is going to give you a diagnosis of anything, much less autism.  Early intervention helps children learn valuable skills and gain functional skills and education that other children \"pick up\" through imitation and normal processing. It helps autistic children learn how to learn. It does not cure autism.  Early intervention does not eliminate the need for future service, and does nothing at all for people who currently require support and service. It lessens the needs for specific types of service for children who are able to benefit from early intervention.  In Joey's case, the smiles were disappearing. The ability to communicate was not developing. He was becoming increasingly frustrated and upset. WE WERE LOSING HIM. That may be hard for some people to understand. It seems particularly difficult for some autistic adults I have met. From this point of view, I was watching a happy, healthy, loving child turn into a sullen, frustrated, angry child. As a parent, that means something must be done. Now. If I had not moved my butt and gotten him into some kind of intervention, what would have happened to him? I can tell you this: he would not be speaking. He would have remained rustrated and angry. He would have had less and less access to the world around him. I understand that some people think that this is what I should have done- allowed him to \"be autistic\" and do nothing. I can't please everyone.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/objections-to-early-intervention.html", "title": "\nObjections to Early Intervention\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, May 17, 2007", "body": "\nWhat does a proper ABA program do?  Part of the goal of this blog is to share what I have learned about autism and services. One of the lines of investigation I have been drowned in is ABA.  First and foremost, I am not an ABA fanatic. I think it is very useful for very specific types of skills, and needed for certain kinds of children. Not all of those children are autistic. The goal of most ABA providers is to change behavior. The question becomes, which behavior, when, and why?  For us, the point of ABA is to teach Joey to learn, and to provide him with skills he will need to cope with living. ABA is very good for teaching Joey skills he can imitate, repeat, and incorporate. For example, he has learned to respond to questions using discrete trial training. He is currently learning to sit and focus while another person reads a story. He learned to use the potty this way. We reinforce positive accomplishments, and he gets the idea of what he is doing  right , as opposed to what he is doing wrong.  Joey needs about five hours a week of this one-on-one engagement that is emphasizing learning and imitation to gain skills. He actually only gets about three hours a week, because as is mentioned elsewhere, it is very, very expensive to have ABA done by a real ABA specialist, as opposed to some college kid who has the same weekend workshop training that I do.  ABA done wrong is dangerous. We had a program in here a couple years ago. They insisted on a very set program of skills, most of which Joey had already acquired, so he was going to be very, very bored. Asking a kid who can count to 100 to count to 5 over and over again is not helpful. You are not teaching that child anything, nor are you reinforcing anything but basic obedience. Joey is not a trained seal. Such a program was not helpful; it was harmful, as it provided no rewards for learning- including learning itself.  Yes, Joey needs to learn that while in a classroom, he needs to be able to sit and focus on a task. However, there is no need to completely eliminate his \u201cautistic\u201d behaviors. This is something our Sunday school teachers are learning. I observed him in class last week, because they are saying he is still having a lot of trouble with group singing and storytime. What I discovered is he\u2019s doing just fine. About half the class lost interest in this loosely structured activity set. However, instead of whispering and giggling to other children, finding toys, or crawling off to sit in another part of the room and ignore the teacher, Joey chose to track. He was displaying the same boredom as the other students, just in his own way. The movement was perceived by his non-autistic teachers as more disruptive (than giggling, mind you). So I told them basically to suck it up and either provide more interest, or leave him alone (only politer, because they have been very helpful and have been very glad to learn to accept and accommodate Joey, and to help his classmates to do so).  Perhaps a point I will always have differences with some others is whether or not the word \u201cintervention\u201d is appropriate. The word does indeed imply crisis. Autism itself is not a crisis, and I am concerned that it is being perceived as a crisis. Autism is not a crisis- the lack of preparation and available support and service is definitely a crisis. But are families who need early services in need of intervention? Are they, in short, having an emergency?  I cannot speak for other families. I can only speak for my own, and specifically in our situation with Joey: we had an emergency. When we began this adventure, we were at the brink of a severe problem. We didn\u2019t just need service- we needed  intervention , and we needed it yesterday. We had a child that had been happy and healthy turning into a child who was frustrated and angry. I am not sure how to explain this, standing in my position as a parent, knowing that I am trying to explain this to people who were experiencing developmental first-hand. Perhaps I need to point out the basic difference in the two roles. Children grow up whether you parent them or not.  It is a parent\u2019s role to teach  and guide the child how to cope with living, and basic skills such as healthy diet, healthy habits, and functional living. It is the child\u2019s role to learn these skills, practice them in a safe environment provided by parents, and incorporate these skills into a hopefully healthy life. What they do with life from there is up to them (unless you have parents who dictate what you are going to be when you grow up). We end up with many conversations like I had with Andy today:  \u201cAndy, what would like for lunch? Would you like peanut butter and jelly, or grilled cheese sandwich?\u201d  \u201cI-keem.\u201d \u201cWe can have ice cream after we eat lunch. Would you like peanut butter and jelly, or a grilled cheese sandwich?\u201d \u201cI-keem.\u201d  \u201cYou need to pick a sandwich first.  Would you like peanut buter and jelly, or grilled cheese?\u201d  \u201cSees.\u201d  \u201cGreat, we\u2019ll have grilled cheese, with carrots. Do you want apples or pears with your cheese sandwich?\u201d  \u201cI-keem.\u201d  \u201cWe can have ice cream for dessert. Would you also like apples, or pears?\u201d \u201cBer.\u201d \u201cGood choosing! We can have grilled cheese with carrots, and pears, then we\u2019ll have ice cream. Does that sound like a good lunch?\u201d \u201cYeth!\u201d So when I have a child who is frustrated, screaming, and knocking their head on the floor from the frustration, then it is my job to step in- to intervene- an help this child learn skills to cope. What skills are needed? For Joey, he needed to learn to communicate his needs, and skills for venting frustrating that were not harmful to himself or to others. ABA is one method for teaching such skills. In fact, many methods use the basic framework of discrete trials. Speech therapy allows for communication. Occupational therapy helps him learn to regulate his own body and sensory input. ABA teaches him how to learn. Being in school helps him learn to negotiate social situations, group situations, focus, and specific academic tasks. Most \u201cnormal\u201d kids do not have speech therapy, occupational therapy, ABA, or preschool at the age of 2 (or don\u2019t need school at the age of 2, though the parents may want it.)  Compare this even to my other child- he will be getting speech therapy because he has some motor planning issues that result in articulation problems. He has some OT to help him cope with sensory issues and motor planning. I\u2019ll start him in school two days a week in the fall- not because he needs it, but because I want him to have some exposure to other children and other adults, so it won\u2019t be completely new when he goes to kindergarden. We do not have an emergency, we\u2019re just shoring up some perceived deficits to make his life easier.  As a parent, watching Joey spiral into frustration, anger, and depression at the tender age of 2 is not only heartbreaking, it is my job to act, and to intervene. This wasn\u2019t just about him drifting off into a world of his own- this was about a child who was becoming increasingly unhappy and aggressive out of aggravation with his inability to communicate and control his own body.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/did-i-open-can-of-worms-or-what.html", "title": "\nDid I open a can of worms, or what?\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, May 22, 2007", "body": "\nWhen I was little, we lived in Prince Georges' County, and I went to an elementary school there called Tanglewood. I have some very strange memories of Tanglewood, and being little. The school sat slightly off the road to allow for buses to come up in a half-circle drop off. If you went in the front doors, the cafeteria/auditorium/cafeteria was right in front of you, across a hall. The rest of the school lay to the right. The principal's office was right in that front hall; turning right to go down it, the office was on the right. Straight ahead at teh end of the hall was my kindergarten room on the left. My first grade room was down that same hall, to the right; I remember it as directly across from teh kindergarten room, but it may have been closer to the front door. There were also at least two second-grade rooms in that hall. Before reaching it, there was a hall that split off to the left. I remember the school as this sort of L, but there may have been more halls. If we turned down the left hall (instead of going on the the kindergarden and first grade rooms), my second grade room was on the left. The special ed room was on the right along that hall, but it was not the first room. My brother's fourth grade room was also on this hall to the left, further down. The school went through fifth grade, so there must have been more rooms down that hall; I never ventured there. If we return to the gym/auditorium/cafeteria, entering form teh front door, you could walk straight through to an asphalted area that may have once been a parking lot, but no cars were ever there. Beyond that, enclosed to the right by that left-hand hall, was the playground. The swings, a set of monkey bars, and a tether-ball lay straight ahead, bounded beyond by trees. Slight to left beyond the swings was a large playing field for games like soccer, also bounded by trees, like a wood. directly to teh left of the asphalt was another monkey-bars, some trees, a balance beam, and I think there was some other equipment there that I didn't use. Going through this little area to the wood, there was a little path through the wood and down some steps to a lower playground. This included a merry-go-round, swings, and more monkey bars, and a teer-totter, but there was a lot more trees here. It was a special treat to be permitted to go to the lower playground.  When I was little, and going to school, my favorite thing to do- much to the annoyance of the school personnel- was to wander around the edge of the far soccer field, by myself, and pick quaker ladies and little orangy flower that I don't know the name of, and sometimes there were daisies towards the end of the year. By the end of second grade, this occupation was banned (I assume now because I was too far away for them to feel safe, since the other children were all on the equipment). I have some odd, disconnected memories of two little girls- Staphanie and Terry- who were best friends, and decided I was OK to play with, too. I think about those little girls a lot. I never felt actually connected to them- they were a little pair, and I was the permited third wheel- but I never felt they were purposely leaving me out, like almost everyone else did. Stephanie had light hair she kept in double pony-tails, long ones, and sometimes in two braids. Terry was dark, with curly hair she was emmensely proud of. They were both tall like me, which may have been the original attraction. They liked to play house and walk on the balance beam. I liked the beam, too. I could pretend to be graceful, dipping a toe as I walked like the gym teacher was always telling us to do- and I could do it by myself.  I've been thinking about these things a lot lately, especially while observing Joey's play and social skills, and Andy's. Andy has been making friends on the playground. I can do what he does now- just jump in and assume everyone will play or talk- but when I was his age, I wasn't so hot at it. Other children were just that- Other. The disconnection lingers. I watch Joey trying to connect. He doesn't know what to say to other kids. I can't answer them when they speak to him. Given the chance to simply act, he's right in there, but if there is speaking involved- his difference becomes immediately apparent, and he is locked out. My problem was that I simply didn't relate to what other children found interesting. Joey's gets locked out because he can't bring words into play to express that interest.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/being-social.html", "title": "\nBeing social\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2007", "body": "\nBecause I just love  abfh , and we seem to be having a conversation going... but I've been reminded of this question a lot lately. Note that I said \"reminded of\", not \"thinking about.\"  But why go traight to the point? That wouldn't be any fun.  We were back at Kluge today- not for Joey, but for Andy. Andy has been doing some things that are very unusual and worrisome- like sudden meltdowns and violent temper bursts, echoing, and toe-walking. He's having trouble with articulation and sensory integration. I have him signed up for speech therapy and he's in therapeutic listening and some OT each week. We wanted to be sure this was all he needed.  The conclusion is that the articulation, motor planning, and sensory problems are all resulting in frustration. He's interacting well and has solid language, if you can understand him. IN other words, he's neurotypical. I just suck as a parent.  On the way home, there is a store that I frequent- when I was living in Charlottesville, I was there WAY too much, and got to know some of the salespeople very well, including my friend Mary. We stopped on our way home to say hi, and I told her about the trip.  Mary is very dear to me. She is a breast cancer survivor, and even in the worst of it, had time to listen about my dissertation, then my kids. She's a very sweet, caring person, and I love her to peices. However, she did say something- and says it most times I see her- that always makes me blink: \"I'm sure God has a special place for you in Heaven!\"  My first thought is always, \"Why?\"  My second thought is the reminding of that immortal question, \"Why did God make Joey autistic?\" It is a question that hung in the air when I was tracking down a Sunday School for Joey, and bounces about when I talk to religious friends. I have no answer for it. I have no idea. I haven't been reading God's mind lately, sorry. He's been sending some hints, but nothing simple seems to be in store.  That's a good thing. I would like to think part of the reason he is autistic is what  abfh  says she is here for: \"to kick our society's prejudiced ass.\" As important as this is, I certainly hope he is here for so very much more. What I have learned from Joey seems to be just a bonus along the way; I am honored to have been blessed with Joey and Andy, and may I be blessed with more.  Perhaps more interesting to me is the question, \"Why did God make Andy NOT autistic?\" I have no more answer for this than I have for the former question, and for the same reason. I talk to God a lot, but He doesn't tell me everything, and nothing straight out in words. Words are, after all, a very human invention, and convention. A wonderful, useful invention; but human all the same, with human limitations. Trying to use words to talk about God with a literal-minded person is often futile, because they can't understand language used on the slant. Personally, I hope Andy is also here to kick prejudice in the shorts. But that's just me.  God made Joey autistic. That is the way he is. God made Andy neurotypical. That is the way he is.  Thank God.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/why-god-made-joey-autistic.html", "title": "\nWhy God Made Joey Autistic\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 19, 2007", "body": "\nI didn't have to work today- a rare Saturday treat that marks the beginning of summer, when fewer people take standardized tests, and thus there is less work to be had. So I packed up my boys, hijacking Grandma, and off we went to the Great Big City and the Museum of Really Old Stuff. Specifically, we were off to see the dinosaurs! Andy is currently a dinosaur  FREAK . Everything is dinosaurs. If you want to reinforce behavior, use dinosaurs. Want to reward him? Cajol him? Comfort him? Try a dinosaur. We got a coupon from the Toys-R-Us Birthday Club. What did he pick out? More dinosaurs. Joey never really gets into anything in particular for any length of time. We've gone through a Cars phase, and he still likes to go to bed with the Mr. Guinea Pig I made for him. He likes a little Pooh Bear that he pretends is Little Bear, and of course there is Octopus. But no real interest has taken hold of him the way Andy loves dinosaurs. Joey's interests are more kinetic than topical.  Anyway, we headed off into the sunrise to go see Dinosaurs. We made some plans on the way up to deal with meltdowns, tracking, lost children, lost Grandma. We figured we'd need to eat in the cafeteria, and discussed the needs for a quiet corner table. I had packed extra pull-ups for Andy, and extra clothes for everybody. We were off on our road trip, prepared for a day with an autistic child in a crowded, new place! The Smithsonian on a Saturday! (Anybody cringing yet?) I was exceedingly proud of both of my guys. We had no meltdowns. No... wait.. let me repeat that for you! We had  no meltdowns.  None. Zero. Zip.  We managed to get a parking spot practically in front of the museum on the street- a feat unheard of in the modern world. We were obviously meant to be there today. So we park, feed the meter, and head inside. We head straight for the dinosaurs- which requires a ride up an escalator, This is an excellent start, because Joey loves escalators. Up we go, and since we have no camera (I rarely have a camera if I don't have a third set of hands to carry one), Grandma runs ahead of us (literally- I was shocked. Bad knees and all, off she sprinted!) so she can see Andy's face as he comes around the corner and sees his very first, real, live, in-person Dinosaur. I wish I had been able to see that face straight-on, too; but the squeal of delight (\"T-RECTH!\") will have to do for a mom. Joey was happy about it, too. After all, its big, and in a room full of nice handrails to track. He managed to get through the droves of tourists by tracking, without us losing sight of him before reigning him in on occasion. He even looked at some of the dinosaurs. But Andy... here was a child in Heaven. Had I left him there to live his life in that room, he would have exploded with joy. T-Rex, triceratops, allosaurus, stegasaurus, pteradons, even hadrosaurs. Mommy had to be taken by the hand and shown each wonder, then Grandma found for the same tour.  We tried to have lunch in the Fossil Cafe, but there was no room, so we finally gave up and went to the big cafeteria. They were only taking cash, so I had to locate an ATM, but all was well. We found a fairly out-of-the-way table where I could contain children, and they ate like champs. Both had two chicken strips, some fruit, and fries, and Andy even had a bite of my chicken curry sandwich, and declared it delicious.  We then decided to go up to see the mammals. I was disappointed. The old exhibit were diaramas, so you got a sense of the animals in their habitat. Besides, my great-uncle Watson made those diaramas. Now, they have the animals stuck in cases, most very high over your head, with no context at all. They already have a zoo, so I didn't see the point. Joey wanted to track the handrails, and ran ahead, and into someone. Not good.  Fortunately, the Discovery Room is not as popular as it was when I was little, no tickets needed, we just walked right in. It's very nicely set up, at least for us. There were some risers up to some windows and books, and then shelves with the hands-on stuff in them. Mom and I sat at the shelves, and when the boys wanted to engage, they came over to see what we had; when they wanted a break, they went over to teh window away from everything. They got to hold seasheels and starfish, play a drum, looks at things through a microscope, and even touch a crocodile's head! Fabulous stuff.  While the remodeling is on, the back corner by the Discovery Room is more dimly lit, and has a bench, but no people, since there's nothing there to see right now. Afte the excitement, we sat for a few minutes. All the other rooms were brightly lit, which helped Joey immensely; now the oasis of quiet let everyone regroup before being packed back up and heading home. Mom decided to stop and buy t-shirts, so we chased pigeons for a few minutes, then made it back, with our new shirts on, to the car just as the meter ran out. Perfecto.  It's a bit of work to take these guys out like this, but man, what a success. Can't beat that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/dinosaurs.html", "title": "\nDinosaurs!!!\n"},

We wrote it ourselves. The party lasted about five hours before moving to the motel, where it lasted another four hours. My grandfather walked me down the isle. My other grandfather actually had some cake for the occasion. Both are now gone. It was the last time I ever danced with my brother. For our \"first dance\" as husband and wife, we chose \"Touch Me\" by the Doors. The shot of us dancing is still my favorite picture of us.  Nine years ago, on this day, I was opening boxes and trying to get the kitchen settled in our new house. This house. Two years later, we could not have been able to buy it. The torn-up mess of a yard is now landscaped and full of roses, and usually happy boys. The kitchen cabinets and counter desperately need replacing. Kitties still twine furry bodies around the spindles in the dining room.  Five years ago today, I was nursing my firstborn, my Joey, often while watching  Ground Force  or  Changing Rooms  on BBC America, sitting in my grandfather's chair. My grandfathers never met Joey. Neither has my brother.  Four years ago today, I was at Ocean City with my husband, eating Thrasher's French Fries, Fisher's Popcorn, and Dolle's taffy, while playing so much at Marty's Playland that I actually won a big prize: a Christmas Goose. It was teh only time we have been together overnight, just Allan and I, since Joey was born. He stayed with Mom, and they had a lot of fun having a weekend slumber party.  Three years ago today, I came home from the hospital with my Andy. I was a new PhD, only a week and a half before. Again, we were nursing, but this time with less TV- I had Joey to keep my eyes on. I managed to do a lot of needlepoint. Two years ago today, Joey had 25 words. Andy had been walking for two days.  One year ago today, Joey was singing \"Waltzing Mathilda\" (if you could make out the words at all), spelling his name, and dreaming of the Beach. Andy started speaking in sentences.

{"date": "Thursday, May 24, 2007", "body": "\n Welcome to my garden. We hope you enjoy the scent of spring roses!   When we moved into this house, there was no garden. The people before us had two large dogs, and when you have two large dogs in a fenced yard, there's usually not much left. The garden actually blooms in waves. It starts with crocus and early daffodils, then opens out with forsythia, later daffodils, and tulips that fade into lilacs. The roses are next, with my Sarah Bernhardt peony and the mockorange. The yard is filled with wafting perfumes. I chose most of the roses because they have a mass effect now, but also continue throughout most of the summer with \"pops\"- that is, a few flowers all the time. The lilacs become a green backdrop to highlight the rose blooms. I have some iris that come out just before now (to fill the gap betwen lilac and rose), but I need more. I lost several across the back of the yard when my fence was damaged in Isabel. I've also put some poppies in, but they don't last long. I used to have blackberries to line the side, but last year I lost them- I think the folks next door used weedkiller (the blackberries are thornless, but the raspberries are not, and they probably got a few vines on their side of the fence.) Next will be a spirea, and the raspberries will be blooming- not as well as usual, because of the strange and suspicious \"blight\" from last summer, but the raspberries are at least tryign to come up. Considering the price of raspberries, you'd think free ones would be welcome, but... no accounting for tastes. Anyhoo, the bee balm will be out about then, too. then the daylillies should start, and the finally the dahlias and morning glory. Fall should have another round of mass effect from some of the roses, too. For winter, I have the hollies and winterberries.  The garden is also designed for other scents, textures. I keep thyme and mint throughout, so it will smell good as the boys run about. I have some other shurbs not famous for bloom, but for foliage; my purpe dragon plant, a verigata, sedum. the poppies have added an interesting texture, I wish they bloomed longer.  Lately I haven't been able to get things done in the garden like I would like. I have a lot of mulching to do. More weeding than I could ever do. The virginia creeper is taking over the fence. At least the boys like dandelions and clover!  I used to like to pictures of Joey in the garden. I still like to take pics of the boys in the garden, but when Joey was little, he seemed like a little flower fairy. His little fingers would pluck at the roses and the grasses. He sat up by himself and squealed himself silly while his daddy made faces and funny noises. He loved to crawl through the grass, exploring this new little world full of life and springtime. He never liked to look up. The sky is a big thing- the world is a huge space.  Andy was afraid of the garden itself. He didn't want Mom and Dad to leave him in the grass, The world, even in the garden, was too big. But he soon discovered that outside was someplace full of wonders- especially birds. He looked up at them and pointed to them like Joey never did. He discovered bee-chasing. He discovered ants. The world around him was full of living things!  It always strikes me that they were noth attracted to the life around them, even if different ways and forms.    \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZVqyN60WI/AAAAAAAAABg/lI-_9YS3CjM/s1600-h/blaze4.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZVrCN60XI/AAAAAAAAABo/3FwyIVRoBeA/s1600-h/garden.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZVrSN60YI/AAAAAAAAABw/p2wxfAJ5EMU/s1600-h/armada2.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWhyN60gI/AAAAAAAAACw/r0sBukxWhQ8/s1600-h/armada.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWiiN60jI/AAAAAAAAADI/Eru3jDyJCCc/s1600-h/peony.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZVriN60ZI/AAAAAAAAAB4/cZowgTPNYXw/s1600-h/blaze.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZVriN60aI/AAAAAAAAACA/DG43v3BX-1c/s1600-h/blaze4.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWESN60bI/AAAAAAAAACI/0TpyIKB1aNI/s1600-h/heritage.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWEiN60cI/AAAAAAAAACQ/Qi2MQmW_PcI/s1600-h/grandmothers.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWEyN60dI/AAAAAAAAACY/Wgg_aJRgeJc/s1600-h/bibimazoon.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWFCN60eI/AAAAAAAAACg/svTgznKsfb0/s1600-h/reinedeviolet.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWFSN60fI/AAAAAAAAACo/FzOghRImCAI/s1600-h/pinkrose.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWiSN60iI/AAAAAAAAADA/sXflfrR_UpM/s1600-h/mockorange.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RlZWjCN60kI/AAAAAAAAADQ/37fOCDIUfzw/s1600-h/blaze2.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/views-of-my-garden.html", "title": "\nViews of my garden\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 01, 2007", "body": "\nI write today thinking about the increasingly... spirited?... discussion on other Autism Hub blogs about neurodiversity as a movement. United we stand. Divided... not so much fun.  I was not invited to join the Hub- I tracked down who owned it and asked to join. I am glad to be here, though I doubt I'll be nominated anytime soon for any \"thinking awards\" or that anyone will track me down to ask me to write a book. Well, not about Autism, at any rate, nor anything based on this blog. I'm not the best writer on the planet. Call me a selfish little piggie if you like, but I joined for me- because the blogs I liked to read all had that noble mark of the Autism Hub. Because I wanted to be part of the community that seems to be centered here.  Perhaps because I \"grew up\" playing MUDs and connecting through text on a screen, the whole online thing come to me as a sense of spaces, cozy little wizard domains where we set up shop according to our own gifts and use our workroom-blogs to try to share a little of our favorite talents and thoughts with those we have invited in- in this case, everyone. I like visiting you all. I sometimes wish I had some of the wonderful talents you all seem to have. It feels like meandering over to different people's houses to hang out with a cup of something yummy on a very comfy couch, and seeing what everyone is up to today. It's like going down to the Hay when I was college, getting some strawberries with z-cream (or fresh carrot cake! Yum!), finding the best couch by the window (since I was the only one who didn't smoke, I needed a window), maybe flipping through the nearest shelf of used books to see if there wa anything new and interesting, and seeing who showed up today. There was a basic core crowd that usually showed up, and then the drifters who sometimes showed up, and the fringes who you remembered when they did show up, but they usually had other lives that kept them too busy to come much. I was always glad to see everyone. They all had such interesting stories and lives and thoughts and dramas. I still wonder what happened to those people. They don't let people smoke at the Hay anymore. It has a grill now, new premises, a juice bar thing; I don't think they sell books anymore. Gone are the comfy couches that drew us together and gave us a livingroom- or was it a family room? away from home.  Being the mom just starting the adventure of supporting an autistic son, I spend most of my Hub time following the blogs and lives of others with autistic children. There is a comfort in reading the speech patterns of  Whitterer's  kids, who seem so very verbal to me, and seem so close to Joey's. There is hope for more communication from my own baby when I read about these guys. Besides, who else knows that \"goldfish\" is a food group? There is also comfort at  Club166 , who has been there, done that with the IEP nightmare.  Kristina  is always offering great information and solid advice.  Big White Hat  provides an air of southern charm and gentility to the whole thing. I could go on. You probably get the picture.  That's right: I am one of those \"parents.\" Ignored and even actively disenfranchised by the school system that is supposed to be helping my child, taunted by many of the parents around me because I don't declare thimerosal to be the Work of the Beast and chelation to be the Salvation of Us All, and bounced between therapists and specialists who can't seem to agree on what exactly Joey may or may not need, the Hub is a place where I can pull myself together on a Screamy Day and remember I'm not the only person doing this. That I'm not crazy thinking my kid is, first and foremost, a kid, and should be treated with respect and dignity- the same treatment other children seem to get from people as a matter of course. Here is a place to access what others are thinking and feeling, especially adults who face the challenges of autism directly, and with courage, strength, and even pride, so that they can enjoy their talents- like everyone else. Here are people, autistic or otherwise, whom I hope my children (both of them) can and will look up to and try to emulate, learn from, and remember all of their lives.  Yep. Plenty of comfy couches here. There's food in the fridge. You know where the drinks are.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2007", "body": "\nWell, the day came we were hoping wouldn't.  Over the weekend, Joey and I went for a walk. We were sort of heading for the Memorial Day Illumination, but instead we met some of teh kids across the street and had some impromptu social interaction. Joey really enjoyed himself, and the trucks, and the bikes, and the kids, and can't wait until we \"go for a walk\" again. I also had fun, because I actually got to talk to other moms and dads, some of which have been int eh neighborhood a while, and I've never spoken to. Crossing the street is a big deal with two small kids, and we don't do it very much.  Today, he kept talking about a blue truck. He has lots of trucks and cars, and every time we found one that was blue, it was offered, and turned down. After speech, I took the baby upstairs for a nap, and mom took Joey outside for a ride on the tricycle, where I joined them, and yet another round of \"want blue truck.\" He opened the back door and went into the house. \"Are you getting your truck?\" I asked casually. \"Yes,\" he replied, and into the house he went.  Mom and I chatted abotu some local news, friends not doing so well, the allergist appointment tomorrow. The doorbell rang.  Not expecting anyone, I looked up. I can se right through the house from where I was sitting, back door to front- it is one of the reasons I habitually sit there. The door was open. A woman was coming into the house, following Joey. It was an odd sight, and about fifteen things raced through my mind- how did Joey get the door open? Who is this? Did we have therapy today and I forgot? No, its Tuesday. And why did they come to the door? Is Joey letting a stranger into the house? Does she need help?  I was to the door when my brain turned on and recognized my across-the-street neighbor, and the words emerging from her mouth. You guessed it, didn't you?  \"He was in the middle of the street...\"  Heading across the street, to get the blue truck he had played with days ago, which actually belonged to the little boy whose mother was telling me that she asked Joey where his mommy was, and he had said, \"outside\" but she didn't see me, so she brought him back across the street...  He was in the middle of the street.  My street is not a hustle-bustle big city disaster, but it is a bit of an artery across town, often taken slightly too fast by us townies. He could have very easily have been hit.  We lock our doors out of habit mostly, from living in places liek Charlottesville, where people were known to walk into homes while people were home and steal stuff or attack them. With Joey's new and unpredictable fondness for wandering off, we have taken this habit to heart. Usually we keep the key to the front door on a high hook. He can work keys, but since he can't reach the key, this has been our current compromise of keeping him locked down, while not being a major fire hazard. However, my mom had left her keys in the lock while she watched Andy (while Joey and I went to therapy). Those keys remained in the lock when I came home. Joey wanted to go across the street to get the truck, so he just turned the key and was gone.  The main problem now is that the back door does not have the double-key bolt, and he can work all the locks and latches I added to it now. Worse, he has actual motivation to leave the house, and determination to do so= we'll hear about this truck for days, maybe weeks. He has a reason to go across the street, and no concept of improper hour of night, danger of the street, and despite our best efforts and lectures, no concept of the reasons he can't just go across the street, walk into someone's house, and get what he thinks is his.  The locksmith comes on Friday. Until then, we have barricaded the back door. We're also seriously looking into alarms. At least we'd know if he opened a door.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/lockdown.html", "title": "\nLockdown\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 31, 2007", "body": "\nNext week we do another turn on the IEP dance floor. This is a biggie. We change fromt eh world of preschool to that looming unknown of kindergarden. Real school. SOLs. Full day education.  This was the fall I was supposed to put my little boy on a big yellow school bus for the first time. Instead, it will be our fourth year- old hat. It will just happen earlier in the morning. I actually remember the first time I got on a school bus. The morning was cool and dewy, and I had on a jumper and red checked shirt that I dearly loved, it was really comfortable, and shoes that weren't so much. I can still smell it, the metallic damp of the bus and the plastic seats that were too hard to really get comfortable on. Joey loves riding the bus. It will be a comfort as we send him off into a new world.  It won't be completely new, though. We're probably going to go ahead and put him in the summer program the schol cooked up on the fly; it will give him a chance to get used to the new building, and provide him a very regular schedule or most of the summer. The point is to not have him freak out for months and waste more time at school than absolutely necessary. Maximize the learning, that sort of thing.  We decide the setting Joey will be in. Will we put him in the self-contained classroom, with the spectacular teacher, lower student: faculty ratio, but not as much exposure to non-disabled peers? Or do we try to press for LRE, despite the teacher being lukewarm and no aide available? The school personnel find his \"behaviors\" disruptive, so they want him in self-contained; but how much of it discrimination against his way of expressing himself, and how much is really of concern? So what if he tracks instead of giggling with his classmates when he's bored? Shouldn't it be the BOREDOM that is addressed, not my son's way of expressing it? Its not like he's hurting anyone.  My private OT is coming to the meeting. She's as unhappy as I am with the OT situation at school. The OT is the only person that holds over from the preschool; she's the only OT in the system. With all the kids they now know need OT services, you'd think that they'd start hiring OTs, just like they now have several SLPs. But no- we're stuck. So I'll bring an actual professional to help us determine goals.  I also have located a few online resources for determining \"kindergarden readiness.\" Why these weren't pulled out when I was asking about what skills he needed for kindergarden back in September, I have no idea- they are right off the VDOE website- but that's all water under the bridge now. I have these tools now, to take with me and ask about. \"He can't sit and listen to a story for ten minutes. He can't tell you his first and last name. He can't button his own clothes. These are skills VDOE says are signs of kindergarden readiness. How will you be addressing these issues?\"  As usual, they will probably try to fluster everything and say they are being addressed in goals that sound vaguely connected to these skills, while missing the point. Then they'll tell me they know best, since they are professionals, and have been working with him for three years now. And it will all be so that they only provide what they absolutely must, and at their own convenience.  It's going to be a long week.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/kindergarden-readiness.html", "title": "\nKindergarden Readiness\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 02, 2007", "body": "\nI always kind of thought that my role in the Hub is not as a leader of a movement, but as a parent. I am learning how to teach my own autistic child- still very, very young- to be able to function and advocate for himself. I can't do that unless I start discussing autism with actual autistic people, so I get a sense of what issues Joey will face, and start thinking about how he might cope with the special needs he has. It is also easier if I have other parents to speak with who understand the concept of acceptance, so that I can prepare for possible problems I will have in teaching Joey, in raising him to be an independent, socially responsible adult.  To what I am doing, it seems I have to fight everyone around me. Now, apparently, that includes autistic adults. That is highly discouraging- even depressing. I was already fighting the ones who clamor for a cure, but also the ones who say they are fighting for rights- including the right to be autistic?  Perhaps it should be considered that the Hub has lots of parents because we are also on that front line of advocating, and we want to get a better idea of what to advocate  for . Once Joey turns 23, my rights to help him are greatly curtailed- especially if I am successful in teaching him.  I've got enough people trying to fight me and fight my child. I really didn't need more.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/06/or-in-more-direct-words.html", "title": "\nOr, in more direct words...\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 02, 2007", "body": "\nThis is one of my favorite pictures of my Joey.  The image is one that I draw up when things get especially hard. When we've had a screamy day and the school people are blowing me off and ETS isn't giving me enough work to pay the bills and friends are in troubled waters and the world seems to be spinning a little faster than usual. I've mentioned this picture elsewhere, on occasional comments on other blogs, it seems to be getting mentioned a lot lately. So here it is. The Image.  The large, round one is me. That's me, writing my dissertation. And that's my baby boy, fast asleep on me. He loved to sleep on me. He still likes a good snuggle.  When I was writing that dissertation, my world was very different. I knew where I was going and how I was going to get there, more or less. I had trained hard to be an academic. I would spend lovely jaunts in India looking at wonderful sites and objects, gain an understanding of how people lived, communicated, understood the world around them and expressed that understanding to each other. I would bring back presents that would make my little guy laugh and wonder about people who were different from him, who saw the world differently, who valued diferent things and dreamed different dreams. I would teach my little boy that there was more than one way to think about a problem, a pleasure, an experience; that there was more than one solution, more than one explanation, and these different ways of thinking, feeling, understanding could be tools for making his own sense of the cosmos. I would write wonderful books about people and the objects they made, the survivals of time and weather and cultural storm. I would stand in classrooms and share these visions and ideas with other young minds, and see where they could take thee ideas, what new thoughts could arise just by thinking in a new way, or from a new point of view. Yes, I was going somewhere. I was young. I'm still young for a PhD. I was ready. I had my dream in my pocket, and needed only for time to open out and unfold the events, so they could be savored, shared, and then committed to fond memory.  Academia is a funny place, especially if you're fool enough to take up an obscure field. The whole publish or perish thing is just one facet of the trouble. Children are a big no-no in most departments. Having a family is something reserved for folks in areas more popular with students (and therefore the faculty are in higher demand, and more allowances are made). Teaching experience can actually count against you; it only counts for you if you are also a prolific publisher. What prestige and funds will you bring to the college? That is the question. How many butts will you put into seats? How many donors are at your beck and call? Good teaching be damned, its all about the research. You don't have to be a good writer, you just have to be a published one. Quantity is far more important than quality.  I have a friend who is faculty over at the college while raising an Asperger's child. She's got the full-time gig. Her husband is also a prof. They both do an elaborate juggling act to be sure the children are supervised while they do their research, write their articles, teach their classes. It helps to be in subjects where travel is not a big deal. You can study English quite well without ever setting foot in England. Being full-time gives you more control over the schedule. I often stop to admire how well that family works together as a team to be sure things happen. The flexibility of the schedule is key- there is no way to maneuver through schedules of buses and therapists and hold a full-time, regular-hour job here. Respite and childcare that can handle an ASD child (or even WILL handle one) is practically non-existant without a medicaid waiver. I admire her greatly. She finds time to do her job, expand her work, and advocate for her son. That's a true wonder.  I hadn't secured a full-time gig before I had my guys. I'm an adjunct, when the local schools have money. I grade standardized tests, too, which is the best-paying gig I've got. There's been no time for much research, with running the guys to their appointments. I'm lucky if I get to shower. Trips to India? That's a laugh.  Back to the photo. A dissertation to nowhere. Such is the world I lost when I decided to be an advocate for my son. Not all parents make the choice I made. In fact, I find it disconcerting how few take up the challenge to support and advocate, and instead toss their kid at the school and say \"fix it\" then disappear. The ones that take up the challenge are always people of strength, fortitude, and often, attitude. Fighting everyone around you all the time is not for the faint-of-heart or weak-of-stomach. All the parents I know who are actually in there pitching are absolutely amazing people. I do my best to be like them. Such is the world I gained.  So this is also an image of what I gained in my life. I have a beautiful son. I hug him close whenever I get the chance. Boys tend to reach a point when they don't want hugs and kisses from Mommy anymore, so I get them in now while I can. Here is an image of the joys of being alive, the comforts of having my baby with me, my little buddy through thick and thin. Even on screamy days, he's my baby.  If I hold really still and think of this image, I can still feel the warm weight of him on my chest and belly, the little hand pulling on my shirt as it clutches at a button, the curve of a diapered bottom in my palm, the soft fuzz of hair, the even breathing sweet with milk. I could tip my head and kiss the top of his, lay my cheek against that little forehead and be instantly in heaven. One little nuzzle and the thoughts would untangle, the words arrange themselves according to thoughts, and sometimes the hand could keep up.  Did I give up my life? I admit there are some moments I wonder if I did. I certainly turned away from the world that was, and entered a whole differnt way of existing, and began to evolve a whole new way of thinking about the world, the cosmos, and my own place in it. Perhaps that is why  Welcome to Holland  speaks so well to me. I still have moments when I wonder what could-have-been. That old Two Roads in the Wood thing. Don't you ever wonder what was down that well-traveled lane? Even while you appreciate the wonders of the road you have actually taken?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RmIo84kx4nI/AAAAAAAAADg/ohb8A996nZo/s1600-h/dissert_joey.jpg", "http://www.journeyofhearts.org/kirstimd/holland.htm"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/06/depression.html", "title": "\nDepression\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, June 05, 2007", "body": "\nJoey had a good speech session today. He's learning sign language. This will give him visual cues, to use when he cannot find words, or for us to use to better communicate with him. HIs favorite sign is  \"fox.\"  Today, he and Nikki were doing some other things, including looking at some Richard Scary books. He turned to her and signed about what he saw on the page: \"The fox ate and ate until he was full!\" When Nikki said these words he said, \"Yes! That's right!\" and laughed, and then repeated them.    I still think most of Joey's speech is scripted or echoed. I usually use \"scripted\" to mean that he knows what the words mean, and is trying to use previously-heard strings of words to convey meaning, sometimes quite successfully. \"Echoed\" means the words are empty, repeated because he has learned they are a proper response, but doesn't know what the exchange means; or he just likes the words and says them, perseverating on the sounds; or he is too upset to be able to recall the words he needs, so he repeats back anything his brain clings to, regardless of meaning. He is clever enough to sometimes mix strings, so that one half of the sentence is pulled from Little Bear while the second half is from Pinky Dinky Doo, but they are still just blocks and strings of words he has heard before.  The signs seem to be doing several things for Joey. They give him a visual cue, so that slow sound and language processing can be slightly bypassed. He understands what you are asking of him or telling him. They are also providing him a way to communicate spontaneously, without having to come up with spoken words. He gets very happy about this, like talking about the fox in the picture. He doesn't have to come up with scripted words for a new situation; he can go with signs, movements that he can apparently access better and faster.  So when Nikki was having a hard time getting him to sit an attend, she finally signed her request:  sit   please ! He saw the signs, suddenly lit up, said, \"Oh! Sit, please!\" and sat down.  Sign language will probably never be Joey's primary form of communication. He speaks very well, and he's well on his way to reading. However, he seems to like it, and seems to be helping him catch on to concepts, and we;re going to try to focus on giving him signs he can use to talk to us, instead of a bunch of signs for us to boss him around with. He's so funny, sitting in front of a mirror, signing \"fox\" to himself and giggling.

Appropriate language, appropriate play. And he's figured out that if he does this, the world stops and Mommy gets onto the floor and plays cars, even if she was cooking or working or doing some other thing Joey prefers I didn't do. Andy grabs a car, and there are the three of us, crashing cars together, or racing them, or just driving them around and getting our arms all tangled.  Sometimes the cars even talk to each other.

Joey likes spraying his own hair and shampoos his own head, and will even now brush his own teeth (we do this in the bathtub, because I introduced the new spinning toothbrushes there when I thought sure they would be a flop- but they are a hit, and now toothbrushing is part of a bath. As long as the teeth get brushed, what harm is there?). He usually complains that the water is too hot, but otherwise happily splashes away Joey loves water. The other one screams about any water touching his head, likes the head rub as mommy shampoos the head, then screams again for the rinse. He then does his best to drink as much bathwater as he can before being removed from teh tub to complain about being wet. Andy likes water, as long as he doesn't notice any on him. (Remember, Andy is supposed to be my NT one...) We then get into pajamas with much help from mom (remember trying to put on pajamas while damp?) and have a story. We managed, barely, to get through Charlotte's Web chapter-by-chapter; usually we just do a picture book. Then a rousing rendition of our favorite bedtime songs, including Old MacDonald's Dinosaur Farm (how may dinosaurs can  you  name and provide a sound effect for?), and then we separate to our rooms for bed.  Unless we declare Slumber Party.  Slumber party is declared when Joey, who usually insists someone (meaning me) remain seated in the chair in his room until he falls asleep, dismisses said parental unit with a firm \"Mommy go away now.\" Then I am stared down until I get up and leave. Joey then starts his CD player, and the fun begins!  First, Andy must be released from his room. Then there is a jolly time of squealing and flopping into bean-bag chairs and joyous jumping on beds. usualy a tickle-fight is included, a well as occasionally checking on the parental units in their room (to be sure they are still safely installed at their laptops.)  Sometimes we get surprise kisses, or a boy coming in to \"scare\" us, or other fun games.  When it gets dark, it is finally time to settle in and go to sleep- the slumber party is over.

Recently, we have decided to just feed him at 5 and put him in bed instead of trying to get a screaming mass into his room for a nap after lunch. He needs this because if he gets grumpy, he tends to hit first and ask questions later. I would work on a 2pm nap, which would work very well, except that I am rarely in the house at 2 o'clock because of Joey's therapies, and will not be in the house at 2 o'clock all summer long.  Taking him up at 5 includes his bath, where he misses his brother, then stories. IF he is still awake at 7 when we bring up Joey, he gets another story. They usually involve dinosaurs or Karma Wilson. I also have some fabric books I've sewn up, which he often uses as pillows.  As part of the dinosaur fascination (infatuation?) I have pinned up some pictures of dinosaurs on Andy's room. A good friend sent them to us a while ago. Andy was absolutely thrilled when he saw them. He likes to point at them and tell me what they all are- and since I have learned what they are, I can decipher his attempts at articulation. Practice makes perfect, right?  Yesterday I put Andy upstairs with some stories, but all was not well. Andy started to really lose it, so back up the stairs I went. What was wrong? All I could decipher was \"Edmontonia!\"  For those of you who may be dinosaur=challenged, and edmontonia is a type of ankylosaur- a tankish, armoured thing with shoulder spikes and a clubby tail. It happens to be one of Andy's favorites. He held out the fabric book I made, based on postage stamps of dinosaurs, open to the edmontonia page. He was inconsolable.  I went into the room and sat with him as he tried to explain the problem, in sentences that were completely unintelligible despite beautiful and meaningful inflection. Edmontonia... t-rex... allosaurus... diplodocus...  Then I realize he's pointing, not just waving his arm. I look down at the book. Then I look up at the wall, where he is pointing at the pictures. Though the backgrounds are different, the actual dinosaur is the same- the pictures are probably the stamps, and the book takes the dinosaur, and photoshops it into a brighter jungle backdrop. However, not all of the dinosaurs on the wall are in teh book- and vice versa. Edmontonia is in the book, so he is looking for it on the wall- and it isn't there.  Good news: Andy is matching! Bad news: I have no idea where to get a picture of an edmontonia, much less the exact one in his book, to put on the wall.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/06/dinosaur-matching.html", "title": "\nDinosaur Matching\n"},

She managed to put her name on something so she can be put down as a consult, but that's probably just because she'll be in teh classroom anyway; I suspect she has to clock her time or something, so the more \"consult\" she has, the less actual work she has to do. But perhaps I am being ungenerous.  Anyway, we got some goals, mostly social interaction and language stuff, and we've got the good teacher. I'm going to chat with my private OT, who went to the meeting, abotu the OT situation before I sign this thing. I'm not crazy abotu having the school OT messing with my child, but I'm also worried about having direct OT off the books, and maybe he needs some goals that got swept under the rug?  The new administrator is a no-nonsense, get it done kind of lady. This made the meeting go at lightning speed. Another reason to not sign anything- what didn't get discussed, because we were distracted by pre-drafted goals and the march to signatures? We're in no hurry. The teacher I already know is the best our system has, and we seem to communicate OK. The new SLP seemed OK, and friendly enough. So this might be OK. That would be nice. We'll see.  The new team was very interested in a powerpoint I put together about Joey. It's a little too detailed to be posting on a public blog, but mostly I used  Kristina's (Autism Vox)  suggestions to put it together, so that we could communicate how we view Joey, the role of the school in his education, and highlight his strengths and abilities instead of the deficits- since most of these meetings dwell on goals for thigns he isn't doing so great with. The preschool staff would see my computer and roll their eyes. These new people wanted printouts to distribute to the staff who would be working with Joey- all of it. There's an interesting change in pace.  One thing that kind of bugs me is the whole system made manifest by the meeting was clearly geared to absent parents. It was like a great machine, and you either said yes or no. I wonder how much of the smoothness is because someone has told people to back off, or if they've just figured out ways to keep me at bay, so I have to go home an dthink about what actually happened and whether it is worth hiring a lawyer and checking everything top to bottom. Or maybe they know I'm likely going to do that anyway, and just aren't going to put out more energy than needful. Or are these new people more efficient, being used to having lots of kids show up at kindergarten with no intervention and disinterested (or overbooked) parents? Or did someone put a fire under someone's butt and tell these folks to start at least  appearing  to obey the law and quit making fusses? We've had so much trouble, I am still inclined to be suspicious. I want to know what is going on for there to be such a dramatic (apparent) attitude shift. But for now, I'm jus going to go over the IEP with the proverbial fine-tooth comb and start from there.

This is a little peice of plastic that looks like a do-not-disturb doorknob sign, and it allows us to park in disability parking spots when we have Joey with us. I've been putting off getting it. Joey doesn't have trouble with actual mechanics of walking- at least, not enough to prevent him from crossing a parking lot. With the increase in bolting, the doctor thought we should go ahead and get one, though, because some places around here only have off-street parking for disabled persons. Getting Joey in and out of a car in a lot, instead of on the street, is far, far safer, especially if the place is unknown or not well-known.  We used it for the first time yesterday. We took the bairns to the mountains. It's a nice ride, and Skyline Drive is so pretty. Joey was a little overwhelmed by the views, but Andy liked it, especially if a bird flew out over the valley. We stopped for lunch, and the lot was full- except the disabled spots. We added up our situation: strange place with busy parking lot, lots of people, no other spots available anyway, spot available almost at door. We whipped out our new placard and parked.  It was amazing.  Normally in such a situation, getting out of the car would have been a carefully orchestrated set of events intended to keep Joey tethered to one of us while the other wrestled Andy out of his harness. We then do a careful hand-in-hand dance across the tarmac hoping that wriggling fingers don't break free and suddenly have a boy in front of a moving vehicle, or worse, have a child melt down.  Not this time. We pulled into the spot, and herded the boys almost directly onto the sidewalk, away from cars. Then we went smoothly into the building. Coming out was even better. Out the door and into the car. No tarmac-crossing necessary. No danger of stepping in front of cars. No worries about getting halfway to the car and losing a child to wriggling or melting. No problemo.  Today I took them to Maymont. I used the magic of disabled parking again. The disabled spots are right in front of a little path enclosed by shrubbery right down to the door. No steps to trip on. No crossing in front of traffic. I can't  BELIEVE  how much safer this is. I'm just flabbergasted.  I won't need it in common places like the grocery store, because I park next to the carts, since Joey prefers to ride safely enclosed in a cart.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 13, 2007", "body": "\nThe topic of \"theory of mind' has been popping up in all sorts of odd places for me- particularly the idea that autistic people don't have it. Either I don't get what \"theory of mind\" is, or the idea that autistics don't have it is a lot of rot.  In a basic simplification, I understood that the \"theory of mind\" means that one person can understand that another person has a mind. It is being used as a shorthand for the ability to pick up and react to other people's emotions, because you understand that they HAVE emotions, thoughts, feelings, beliefs, etc., and that these emotions, thoughts, etc. might be different from yours.  Setting aside that I know a lot of  non-autistic  people who have a lot of trouble with the second part of that, I haven't yet met an autistic person who didn't have these abilities. They might not be able to react  appropriately  to other other people, but that seems to be more a problem of processing and accessing proper response. Kind of like Joey having a hard time accessing words spontaneously, and so he has a great deal of trouble with communication and expressive language. He copes with this by scripting, or quoting like  Mrs. Who . Sometimes he accesses something other than what was intended, resulting in words that make no sense; or he can access nothing at all, resulting in either silence or frustrated squealing (or other noise).  In other words, Joey seems to have no trouble understanding that other people are, in fact, people. He is very sensitive to emotional states- especially mine. He certainly understands that other people do not feel and think the same way he does. And he's only 5, and I've had evidence of this for a while.  People who are not autistic seem to come up with the odd ideas when they just can't get the fact that there are people in the world who cannot communicate orally- or even verbally. They seem to have their own problems with \"theory of mind\" in that they can't understand that there are other ways to communicate. Joey's private speech therapist has been very apologetic since she started Joey on ASL, because it became immediately apparent that Joey understood a lot more of what was being said- and what he wanted to say- than she had been giving him credit for. With teh visual cues, Joey can circumvent some of the auditory processing and instead use his visual processing- and so can better understand what is expected of him and what is being said to him. He can also access his words better and faster.  Before Joey had use of words, even signs, we knew what he wanted and needed much of the time. We could certainly tell if he was happy or unhappy, if he liked anothe person or not, that sort of thing. We had communication with him, and he understood to communicate with us- just not in the \"usual\" ways.  Theory of Mind seems to be just another way of trying to depict autistic people as something less than human. Of taking away their sense of humanity by taking away their sense of community. It is easier to make an object of a person you believe is making an object of you.  Joey gets the idea of people. When Andy hurts himself, he's quick with that hug and kiss- always was. When Mom is nervous abotu an IEP meeting, he gets upset, too, and lots more cuddly (and clingy). When we're all happy, he's all smiles. He wants to make people around him feel happy. When he laughs inappropriately, he's still reacting, and even usually seems to know that laughter isn't what he intended. He's got the idea that other people have minds.  I have no idea yet if he knows those minds aren't like his.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lunaea.com/words/lengle/wrinkle.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/06/theory-of-mind-what-is-this-rot.html", "title": "\nTheory of Mind: What is this rot?\n"},

Rachel Coleman, whose children are the inspiration for creating the series, also wrote several interesting songs about having disabled children and thoughts about those children, which are often played (and signed) at the ends of the episodes. In one of the songs,  Shine , she talks about lists of things she was told her daughter Lucy would never do- and now does. Over the three years we have had a diagnosis for Joey, we have been told by a variety of people that there are things Joey \"will never do\" because of autism. Mostly, these lists do more to reveal the ignorance other people have of disability generally and autism specifically, than provide any useful advice or information.  Joey may never be able to feel empathy, or recognize emotion. He may never recognize people. He may never generalize skills. He may never talk. He may never read. He may never write. He may never be able to handle change. He may never be toilet trained.  He may never point, or have joint attention. He may never make friends. He may never be able to maintain relationships. He may never show emotion. He may never react appropriately to situations or emotions. He may never jump. He may never be able to focus on a task. He may never be able to self-regulate.  All of these things he either does, or is well on his way to mastering.  Sure, there are lots of \"nevers\" yet to be tested. He may never drive. He may never have a girlfriend. He may never get a job, or keep a job. He may never have the opportunity to go to college. He may never live independently or leave home.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2007", "body": "\nIt is amazing that people expect parents to be perfect. Infallible. Paragons of virtue, wisdom, and grace.  Parents are not people. They are... moms and dads.  Joey did not have a name or word for me until he was well into being three years old. Until then, I simply  was . And then, I was  mom . This is perfectly fine. Joey is only five years old. But it gets old to see adults who still don't get it. You don't stop being a person when you become a parent. In some ways, you become more of one, because you gain so many new social and cultural roles.  The day you realize and understand your parents are real people- with thoughts, dreams, feelings, and and life completely seperate from your own (which existed before you!)- you stop being a child. You become an adult, with new roles.  I have a hard time describing what it is like to be a parent to people who have no children. I was the first of my circle to have children, and most of my friends, upon discovering their own pregnancies, called and asked, \"What is it like to be a mom?\" These same friends who had been giving me parenting advice for years suddenly looked parenthood in the face and realized they were in alien territory. People who advised me on how to get Joey or Andy to eat, stop wandering about a room during a library reading, go to bed, brush their teeth, or go to the bathroom suddenly got the epiphany that they had no idea what they were talking about. Oops.  All of these people have dreams for their children. Ideas of how to raise their children. Beliefs of how children should behave, what is socially appropriate for them, what skills they need to survive, and how those skills should be taught, practiced, and communicated. That is what parents do.  I love the essay  Welcome to Holland.  It is a glimpse at what it feels like to have life not go the way you thought it should, the way you were taught it would, the way things are planned, dreamed, hoped for. The best part of the essay is at the end- when you appreciate the wonders of life as it is. And yet the essay acknowledges the pain. It is not swept away in some righteous, virtuous, Stoic ideal of saying \"so it is.\" When life takes unexpected turns, you are effected- as is everyone around you. When Joey was born, life changed. When the words \"He is either profoundly deaf, profoundly autistic, or both\" fell from the lips of the SLP at Mary Wash, my life was changed. My life. Why do I not have the right to mourn for that life?  My life changed. Joey's life changed. My mother's life changed. Andy's life changed. Allan's life changed. In a single moment, we entered a new world. The plane landed.  Before the plane landed, life looked like everyone else's life- we didn't know we were already on course for somewhere other than Italy. No one on that plane did. We were all busy chatting in Italian. So the shock of the change is when the plane lands.  Personally, I have never really been sad about the \"might have been\" for Joey. He didn't really change; I did. He is still Joey, just Joey with a lot more help than I would have otherwise known to get for him. I do wish his challenges were not so great. I wish people who are supposed to be helping him would actually do so. I don't remember what dreams I had for Joey before we realized autism was a part of our lives. I hope they were what they are now- a drive to help him develop his talents, enjoy his life, and be happy. Right now, i'm not sure entirely what that will entail, because I have to listen close and watch close to see what he wants for himself, and to see what develops. Same for Andy. Actually, what they want right now is to have cookies for dinner and chocolate on immediate stand-by, 24 hours a day. It is my job to guide them to more appropriate joys and talents. In order to do that, I have to have some idea what those  are .  I have been sad for the \"where I was going.\" My life. Remember me? I'm still a human being. I would very much have liked to spend my life with my boys lounging at the Ganges View with lemon Mirindas all-round, pondering the mysteries of ancient India while enjoying the laughter of little boys. But folks, the liklihood of me landing the career path that would have allowed this is now exactly Nil. That is the reality. I have to change course, think up new dreams. But I still think about that one. I'll get these boys to India, but I doubt they'll be very young when I do so. Or that it will happen very often. Economics remains a major factor in reality.  And while I'm here in an insomniac ramble, I want to go back pick up the thread of the word \"understand.\" Knowing something is very different from understanding it. Most kids know that their parents are people. They don't understand that parents are people. Joey and Andy are learning ASL. We often make a game of quizzing each other on the signs, and they are both pretty good at it. They can tell me the meaning of almost every sign I throw at them (which is admittedly limited to the signs we have covered on our DVDs). Joey's favorite sign is fox. Andy's favorite sign is candy.  Andy knows the sign for candy. He thinks its funny to twist his finger on his cheek It tickles. If I say, \"show me 'candy'!\" he will make the sign. When I show him teh sign he pipes up, \"candy!\" But today he  understood  the sign. Joey came out of therapy with a lollipop. Andy wanted one. So I asked him to sign what he wanted. He looked at me lie i was a crazy person. I asked him if he wanted candy, and he automatically said yes... and then I held up a lollipop, unwrapped it, held it out to him, and signed and said, \"candy.\" You could see the little lights switch on. He popped it in his mouth. He squealed, pulled it out, signed and squealed \"Candy!\" and got excited. He got it. He understood. He knew the sign and what it meant before- but now, with the candy in his mouth, he understood. Candy!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.journeyofhearts.org/kirstimd/holland.htm"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/06/dreams-of-joey-and-andy.html", "title": "\nDreams of Joey and Andy\n"},

The idea of something happening first, then the next thing happening, and then there being a result or conclusion is something he finds either uninteresting or challenging. Unless...  I had to go to the big IEP for Kindergarten a bit ago. Grandma watched the boys. Joey has been having a lot of trouble with me leaving the house without him, so this was a Big Deal for Grandma to have to watch them. There was nothing else for it. Off I went, and home I came.  Joey spent the couple of hours plotting. When I left, he screamed his head off for 45 minutes. Grandma explained to Joey that I had gone to school to talk with his teacher about kindergarten, and that I would be home soon. The screaming gave way to the plotting. There was a black truck parked across the street; he could see it through his favorite window.  \"We get in the black car. We go to school and see Miss Kaila and Mommy.\"  There we go. Three-step sequencing.  Joey can escape from the house if the key is in reach, and has done it. This requires going to the door, turning the key, then walking out of the house. Three-step sequencing.  But he cannot tell you what he did yesterday, or what will happen tomorrow. Taking three related pictures and put them in order? Forget it. He can pick up random things in a story, but cannot retell it.  He can recite the entire  Silly Pizza Song  and gets upset if you get the foods out of order, but has trouble completing simple \"obstacle courses\" for his OT (though he is improving!) How does one communicate the concept of first- second- third?  Sequencing may not appear to be a \"critical life skill.\" After all, who cares if you know the order of a story, the teacher can read it to you? But sequencing is about learning conclusions and consequences. I get hungry. I eat food. I am not hungry anymore (or, I have energy to go play.) Doesn't seem like a big deal unless the sequencing is a problem, and then connecting eating to staying alive and having energy gets missed. Or how about, I want something across the road, I run out into the road, I get hit by a car?  At our next IEP meeting, I am again going to have goals flagged as \"critical life skills.\" It makes it easier to get ESY if flagged goals are not mastered, and it lets the school folks know what skills I find important. The sequencing goal is definitely getting flagged.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.signingtime.com/activities/ST_Lyrics_1-3.pdf"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/06/sequencing.html", "title": "\nSequencing\n"},

I teach college-level courses. I shall take a break from my usual autism topic to just say; here's some tips on how to really rankle a professor... How to Really Get Your Professor In A Bad Mood:  1. Don't show up or complete a midterm. Show up afterwards or better yet, email, saying \"Oops, I forgot to take the midterm. Will this affect my grade?\" Yes. Yes it will. 2. Write a long, whiney email about how much work the class is. Explain that you are working a full-time job, raising kids, and trying to do a full courseload. You'll get bonus grumpiness if the prof is an adjunct, since it is likely that they are doing the euqivalent of all this while trying to hold down three or four jobs to your one- and being paid less.   3. Ask lots and lots of questions that are clearly answered in the syllabus. For example, \"When is the midterm due?\" or \"do we have to participate in discussions this week?\" or a perennial favorite, \"What chapter are we on?\" 4. Write rambling, tangential posts on discussion forums in poor English, then complain when you are asked to clarify the post. Ditto for in-classroom comments. Do this a lot for lots of extra grumpiness. For extra, extra bonus, complain to the Dean about your grade.  5. MIs-spell important terms and/or names in non-timed assignments. Complain when you don't get a perfect score. More extra bonus points for complaining to the Dean.  6. \"Forget\" to complete the first three weeks' worth of assignments. Complain loudly about how the professor wasted your money when they advise that you withdraw from the course. More bonus points for contacting the Dean.  7. Post unprofessional, \"humorous\" posts on discussion forums, or make inappropriate, off-topic jokes in class. Complain when the professor points out that the post or joke is inappropriate. Complain more when the professor deletes such posts or stops calling on you. LOTS of bonus points for whining to the Dean. Even the Dean will give you bonus grumpiness. 8. Turn in a paper that is 13 pages when the assignment was 20-25 pages. Or don't cite sources or examples when the directions clearly state you need to do so. Complain that you need the course to graduate- and you need at least a C. Guess what happens if you protest to the Dean (or Department Chair)...  9. Stop coming to class. Comlain about failing same class when you return the next semester. Bonus points for having sent emails about how you needed a certain grade in the same class to transfer/get off academic probation/graduate. 10. Sign up for class with long waiting list. Drop class. Sign up for it again. Drop it. Sign up for it again. Withdraw from it. Sign up for it again. Drop it again. Sign up for it again. Fail it... 11. Complain about other students getting accomodations... when you have no disabilities. Lots and lots of extra ire for complaining to the Dean about \"favoritism.\" More bonus grumpiness for going onto public websites like \"ratemyprofessors.com\" and making nasty comments about the professor being an unfair grader (and yes, there are ways to know who send those comments, people... especially if you are  registered .) Students who flunk classes because they couldn't be bothered to do the work or follow directions always makes me grumpy.

I mentioned a few things, like the ASL and that if he's having trouble, I need to know, and I was happy to answer questions or help. She seems like a very nice lady. She's training to be the future autism teacher in the lower elementary.  I joined a gym. Partly because for the price of preschool, I get the opportunity to hae 2 hours of childcare twice per day. That's four hours, whenever i want (and can use it). They also have a nice kid's pool with sprinklers and stuff. And Mom is buying it for me, because she's a cool Grandma like that. It's been a big hit. Joey and Andy have been having a ball while I get some exercise in, and then splashing the pool together. Since I go in the morning, and they have lots of adults to help with the kids, the kid room has kind of \"assigned\" a staff member to stick with and shadow Joey, and that has worked out beautifully- and wthout me really requesting it (I just warned them that he is autistic.) He's been loving it there. But I had to tel them that he was going back to school, and they at least acted very sad.  That is one of Joey's great strengths- he charms the people who work with him. As my Mom always says, \"Joey loves the world and the world loves Joey!\" I have rarely met children who exude that whole outlook the way Joey does. Joey loves living, being with people, doing and being and laughing. Everyone is his friend, and it is hard to prove otherwise. I know that eventually this may be a problem, but right now, it is a whole way of being that makes people want to help him, want to know him, want to listen to what he has to say and share and be.

I have requested the school evaluate Joey using ABLLS (Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills). It is a test designed to check on skills needed for 5-7 year-olds to function. It is commonly used to test preschoolers, to give educators a gauge of the skills needed for elementary school, including kindergarden. It also is often used to design ABA programs. It is not a comprehensive test, but it does test skills that are not covered in other common gauges, such as the LAP-D, and is designed specifically for kids (like Joey) who have language problems or delays. Back in September, I kept asking what skills Joey would need for kindergarden, and was basically told \"we'll take care of it.\" So I am already annoyed to discover there was a test they could have given him to find the gaps in his skills and address some of them. However, I am far more annoyed at the email I got from the %&$^#*! OT today. It basically says \"well, he doesn't need to do all this stuff for kindergarden. It won't tell us anything his teachers don't already know. It won't give us an age equivalency or standard score. This is usually given to low-functioning kids.\" In other words, \"What are you having us do this for? I don't want to bother.\"  Of course he doesn;t need it all for kindergarden. But he needs some of it, and this will tell us some of things he may be lacking. It will tell us some of his strengths as well as some of his deficits. It is a yes/no sort of thing- either he can do the skill listed, or he can't. Its not about age equivalency, it is about tracking actual mastery of actual, functional skills.  These teachers that know him so well had to be fought to get him goals for bilateral co-ordination, social conversation, and visual motor skills. They were shocked that he needs sensory accomodations. Joey is just a barrel FULL of surprises! I asked for the test. They do it in the fall (why bother? The IEP is being written NOW). I asked for it by NAME.  The proper response is \"Yes, Ma'm.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/04/battles.html", "title": "\nBattles\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2007", "body": "\nWow, I got tagged! I get to do a meme! You know, someday, I may not be excited about this... but today, woo-hoo!  The rules: 1. Let others know who tagged you. 2. Players start with 8 random facts about themselves. 3. Those who are tagged should post these rules and their 8 random facts. 4. Players should tag 8 other people and notify them they have been tagged. I was tagged by  McEwen , the Goldfish Queen.  Now, for some random facts: 8 things that most people don\u2019t know about me:  1. My grandmother was a pretty popular wildlife (\"Duck Art\") painter in the 1960's-1980's, Marie Conway. I have her paintings all over the house. The random fact is actually that I wish I could paint.  2. I have an ushnisha. An ushnisha is a cranial pertrubance on a Buddha. Originally in art, Buddhas were shown with their hair in a bun or tied up, to reference his life as prince. However, it later became simply an enlargement of his head. I have a very small one. I was born with it. My mom was told it was an \"old wound.\" No, she did not have an amnio. I expect to be a Buddha in about 15 lifetimes. See you then! 3. My favorite beverage is Fresca. I really liked the fancy cherry Fresca, too, but they don't sell it around here anymore. My other favorite drink is Almond Smash. I don't think they make that anymore, either.  4. I can snap my toes. 5. I do not like dogs. I do not know why.  6. I like to do ballroom dancing. I was pretty good at it when I was in grad school. My brother taught me to waltz when we were young, and I was fascinated ever since, then finally took classes. The problem is, the only guy I really want to dance with doesn't like ballroom dancing.  7. I have a PhD in South Asian art history. Even I forget sometimes. One of the school admin people calls me \"Dr.\" and I always turn and look around to see who else he is talking to. I think he finds this amusing. I actually have two master's degrees. I do some adjuncting, but I've been doing it for so long, that's not much of a reminder (you don't need a PhD to adjunct). I prefer teaching in person to online, but most of my classes are online because of the therapy schedule.  8. I am a Tolkien affectionada. Yes, we have the full set of the books Christopher Tolkien put out of Tolkien's notes and unfinished work. I like the  Silmarillon  better than the  Lord of the Rings  proper, though I usually just think of all of the books as a single narrative cycle. I like the movies, but hate what they did with Faramir, and the part where Frodo sends Sam away- both completely miss the point of the storylines. I could go on... and on... and on... I'd start a blog, but I'm sure there are plenty of Tolkien blogs out there already, and I already blog too much.  Who would I like to have 8 random facts about? Hmmmm... abfh  is a fascinating person who always comes up with observations about her own life and experience that give me some insights into possibilities for Joey's view of the world. I'd like to know more about her.  Club166 . I know he's busy, but I'm sure he'll get to it when he gets a minute.  Evan.  I always want to know more things about Evan. Besides, he'll come up with super-fascinating facts, even if he doesn't think they are.  Zoomy  needs more to do while we mourn for the Bridge. Besides, he's such a sweetie!  Niksmom  is a very interesting lady, and she has such a wonderful blog. I could just hug the stuffing out of Nik, he is so cute! (Edited because I just realized I mis-spelled \"Nik\". :P ) Stimey  leaves lots of nice comments, so I want to know more about her, too.  Vab (Autista)  also leaves lots of nice comments that have piqued my interest. Another nice blog, too.  Kristina (Autism Vox) , as if she doesn't have enough to do and doesn't blog constantly (gotta love a blog that often has several posts every day to read! Thank you!).  I didn't hit up  MonkeyGirl  because she just did this one not that long ago. But I always find her interesting, too. ;)  And I should mention that I don't mind if people I tagged don't feel like doing this and don't. But do know you're being thought of. :)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-iGHVqCo8dqWx_Pp8365EaSV3Yiw-?cq=1", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/", "http://club166.blogspot.com/", "http://evanbittner.com/blog/", "http://zoomy.blogspot.com/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/", "http://stimeyland.blogspot.com/", "http://aoskoli.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismvox.com/", "http://highlytrainedmonkey.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/tagged.html", "title": "\nTagged!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 11, 2007", "body": "\nMy best friend is a lady who lives down the street with three hydrocephalic boys. I\u2019ve mentioned her before. And whenever I am feeling particularly beat up, my butt usually ends up on her couch. Needless to say, we had a long talk this morning- about yesterday. Being a \u201cspecial needs parent\u201d is not like being another kind of parent. Apparently there are people here who don\u2019t know that, or don\u2019t want it to be a reality. But it is. Parents who do not have special needs kids really and truly have no idea what it is like to have a special needs kid, or what it is like to be a special needs parent. Most parents are living it up in Italy, and we\u2019re over here in Holland- or, probably more properly, India.  I love India. No, the real India, I mean. I spent three months there, and a separate three-week trip before that. I wish I had been there longer. I\u2019ve never been to the real Holland, but I\u2019ve been to Belgium and Germany, both of which are spotlessly clean, at least in the tourist districts. They are beautiful, wonderful places\u2026 but clean. Very, very clean. And in many ways, very like places in the US.  India is a whole new world. There is dirt, grime, heat, poverty, cows, beggars\u2026 the whole crunch of human life. Clean water comes in bottles. The hotel room uses a geyser for hot water, and it only will heat a couple gallons at a time, and then you use a bucket and cup to actually take the shower. Air conditioning is a rarity- as is refrigeration. In the villages, you\u2019re lucky to have running water, and you have electricity for only a few hours a day (and not consecutive hours). Paved roads are a city \u201cthing,\u201d motor-rickshaw is the transport of choice, and cows have the right-of-way. Living in India when you expect the standards of US living is a really big challenge.  If you spend your entire trip in India focusing on these challenges and wishing you were in an international hotel, you really miss the wonders that are India. You would miss sitting on the far side of  Sanchi  Stupa 2, in the breeze, with the scent of ashoka blossoms and the plateau stretched out below you. You would never see a shrine in the middle of road, draped in orange and yellow garlands and filled with carnations, while incense and the ringing of bells fill the air. No one would be able to run up to you from the local temple and offer you prasad, or ask you to hold their baby while they take a photo. You would never see the lights of navaratri or the colors of a fruit market, stacked high in the morning. You\u2019ll never share lunch with a troop of monkeys. If you don\u2019t go into that cave that smells of bat dung, you will never see the paintings of  Ajanta.   At the same time, what\u2019s so wrong about sometimes wishing you could stay at an international hotel and have a nice, gourmet dinner? Or just be homesick, wishing we were in a comfy living room with a TV, wearing our favorite pajamas? Our problem is whenever someone here mentions being homesick, we\u2019re told that India is a beautiful place, it\u2019s where we are, and we shouldn\u2019t \u201cbe that way.\u201c The Dutch and Indians often have no idea why Italy is such a big deal, and get insulted when someone wishes they had seen the Sistine Ceiling. Did these people never wish they had won the lottery? Never wonder what life would be like if they lived in a different house? Have they never seen the Monty Python skit about the accountant who wants to tame lions? But we, as parents, are not permitted to be homesick. We aren\u2019t allowed to wonder about dreams we once had, or mourn their loss. After all, we\u2019re moms and dads. We\u2019re not supposed to be human\u2026 Meanwhile, my long talk with my friend\u2026 We \u201cforget\u201d that our kids are \u201cdisabled.\u201d This is just who they are. When you live in India, India is normal, and you spend weeks on end not even thinking about Italy. Our kids wouldn\u2019t be who they are if they were not disabled. On the other hand, they wouldn\u2019t need the help and support for the rest of their lives, either. Joey could play with the other kids instead of spending whole days in therapy-- basically, in school. For those of you who have forgotten, most kids like vacation a LOT better than school. But then, most kids don\u2019t scream bloody murder when they are served their spaghetti in a blue bowl instead of a red one, or when they have to go to the park instead of the pool. They can swallow their food without being taught to do so.  My friend is sometimes sad when she sees kids walking down the street, hand in hand with their mom. Her kids will never walk down the street. She will probably never know the feeling of having her children tell her \u201cI love you.\u201d She doesn\u2019t dwell on it. Her children are not a burden to her, she takes pride in every little accomplishment they achieve, she loves them and supports them. We trade phone calls: \u201cMax sat up by himself today!\u201d \u201cGreat! Joey answered a question today!\u201d \u201cHOORAY!\u201d They are our children. But there are those moments when we are reminded that life was going to be so different. We were going to have jobs, spend afternoons in the park, go for spontaneous trips to the zoo or the grocery store. It would be nice to be able to join the other parents down at the local eatery for a beer now and again. Just now and again. According to many folks who emailed me, having such thoughts and moments make us anything from mean, horrible parents to outright evil people who should give up our kids to the State for foster care. Our lives are not as scrubbed and tidy as Holland. Should I wish it were?  The real world really has dirt, and poverty, and heat, and irritation, and inconvenience. It is beautiful, anyway.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RpVsZaOIPRI/AAAAAAAAAEo/6kDJBx4ERDc/s1600-h/Eluralaksmi.jpg", "http://www.shunya.net/Pictures/NorthIndia/Sanchi/Sanchi.htm", "http://www.devi.org/ajcave17.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/long-long-talk-with-another-mom.html", "title": "\nA long, long talk with another mom\n"},

On the other hand, he ate meatloaf for me yesterday, and ate a PB&J-  without taking it apart - today. What's up with  that ?  The way Joey moves forward, sometimes the move ahead in one area leaves him overloaded somewhere else. We're hoping that the reason the meltdowns result is because I am doing something wrong in not picking up on the processing and overload. After all, I can fix a problem with  me .  The meltdown today was over a doorknob. The knob to the basement, which is Joey's therapy room, sometimes comes off, because I'm an idiot and can't figure out how to keep the screws tight. No other doorknob does this, so I'm a bit at a loss over it. Anyway, it came off, and I couldn't take care of it right that instant. That would not do. The minute I was able to secure his safety, run down the stairs, get the knob, and put the contraption back together- like a light switch, it was over. The world righted itself.

{"date": "Thursday, July 12, 2007", "body": "\nThe word \"meltdown\" has become a commonly batted about term in the parenting world, yet with widely divergent meanings. A meltdown can be anything from a very loud whine at an inopportune moment to a screeching ball of violent nerves quivering on the floor. Things that other parents consider to be \"meltdowns\" I don't even hear anymore- or more precisely, I see the causes quicker, and thus can move to diffuse the situation rather than just assuming the kid is a freak and escalating it.  Now, I can't say that I am some master of diffusion. Meltdowns, by their nature, tend to escalate. If we as parents think meltdowns are scary and nerve-wracking, try  having  one. But what most people label as \"meltdown\" isn't even close to what I would consider one. Disappointed children who pout when they don't get their way aren't melting down. A tired child who starts to cry when you want to do just one more errand is not melting down. A child throwing a little temper tantrum over not getting the latest Transformer toy is (usually) not melting down.  For our house, \"melt down\" is a term that is reserved for a situation that involves a great deal of screaming. They are almost always connected with frustration. One is not \"melting down\" until one is no longer functional. A Level One meltdown is when a frustrated child gets into my face and empties his lungs (sorry, all boys here), so that he is unable to complete the current task. Nothing elseis happening, just the screaming, that very loud alarm of \"I cannot do this right now, I don't know why.\" A Level 10 involves injury to all and sundry within crashing distance of the child's body. This is the very loud alarm of \"I cannot deal with existance as it is right now, leave me alone.\" All meltdowns require a great deal of patience. The child cannot seem to end them himself; there are a whole bag of methods to help de-escalate and calm the child, and you may need every single one to restore calm enough for the child to re-engage their own coping and equilibrium mechanisms.  This time last year, we were still in almost-daily meltdown, usually Levels 1-3. Summer has always been particularly bad since he started school. We never had them before he started school, because we just adjusted the whole world to him without even thinking much about it. Sensory overload was rare, and when Joey did make a peep, we jumped. I could take him almost anywhere when he was a baby. Joey tended to be under-sensitive rather than over-sensitive. HIgh pain tolerance. Hates dark rooms, loves super-bright ones. That sort of thing. Also, the lack of communication skills meant that I often understood and adjusted to/for him, but he really couldn't tell people around him what was going on. Anyway, summer is bad news for the ears and the nerves. The wild changes of routine, the long daylight, the heat... all big no-nos for sanity around here. We've mostly headed off the worst of it this summer by having him in programs, getting him into routines, and now with school. He's stayed pretty focused and been able to really enjoy activities and be able to talk about what is going on around him. Celebration times! I need more champagne. :)  There are still times he melts down, but for the most part, I can track what the antecedents were, and can see them coming, so can brace for intervention.  Joey had a Level 8 today. I am in the middle of tracking down what exacly happened. I mean, I can tell you the immediate trigger, and I've tracked down a good many of the small events that fed into the situation, but bigger meltdowns can sometimes be tricky, and are almost always a shock. Was this just an accumulation of small irritants, or did something happen that I need to know, say, at school? Did all the shifts and changes just overwhelm him, or was there a sensory issue with the heat that took him over an edge, or is there a bigger problem that needs to be addressed? My jaw would like to know.  Fortunately, this occured at the therapists' office. For one, that meant the moms who were there were interested in helping, and understood what was going on. None of them had ever seen Joey go into meltdown before, so they were taken aback, but all the moms had kids that melt down more readily than Joey, so they knew what it was. For two, the OT could intervene immediately. Once the worst was over, we got Joey some deep pressure and other input that was calming, with the good equipment (bug hugs and big exercise balls are good things).  Now that it's over, the detective work goes into full swing. What happened? How can I help him pull out of the spiral? What did I do wrong that resulted in such explosive escalation? But this work gets easier- or at least faster- with practice. You start knowing hat questions to ask, what clues to consider, which people to talk to. You become an expert, like any other endeavor, and thus make more headway in less time. With good luck, I will find all the peices and be able to sort out the bigger picture, so that I can intervene and help before the child goes into overload and explodes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/level-10.html", "title": "\nLevel 10\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 13, 2007", "body": "\n NIksmom from  Maternal Instincts  has bestowed upon me the Blogger Reflection Award. The award \u201cshould make you reflect on five bloggers who have been an encouragement, a source of love, impacted you in some way, and have been a Godly example to you. Five Bloggers who when you reflect on them you get a sense of pride and joy\u2026 of knowing them and being blessed by them.\u201d Knowing that I would make anyone feel like that is humbling, but also makes me happy. It was why i started blogging- to help other parents understand they are not alone, it's not just them, and it is OK to be human while raising your kids, especially kids with special needs, and specifically autism. I was taken aback by how many of our local families were so completely emotionally overwhelmed, physically overwhelmed, and feeling like they were people unworthy of help and support. It doesn't take too many people walking up to you and telling you what a rotten parent you are because your kid is {insert coping behavior here} before you wonder- how many other people think this? Are they right? Am I doing this all wrong? After all, I don't see anybody else's kid {insert coping behavior here.} Here are the rules for this one: 1. Copy this post (meaning the rules).  2. Reflect on five bloggers and write a least a paragraph about each one. 3. Make sure you link this post so others can read it and the rules. 4. Go leave your chosen bloggers a comment and let them know they\u2019ve been given the award. 5. Put the award icon on your site. Hmmmmmm...  This is hard, because I just hit up eight people for another meme. The idea behind this one is basically \"five sites that make you feel supported and encouraged and why.\"  That would be the entire Autism Hub. That is, after all, why I joined. But I seriously doubt everyone on the Hub would be very happy with me if I tagged everybody on the Hub- though I certainly would be interested in knowing which blogs other people found helpful and supportive. We could all use a back-patting break, too. It can be lots of fun to let others know how much you like them. Try it, you'll see what I mean. Never miss an opportunity.  So I'll take these as the top five blogs I read when I am feeling down, and need that little lift in life (kind of like Christina's couch):  McEwen's  Whitterer on Autism . There is nothing quite like knowing your house isn't the only one where \"goldfish crackers\" is a food group. Knowing that we're not the only ones blessed with reverse grammar, and understand it, or that phrases echoed may be only hints at what is being said. Her boys seem so much like my Joey, an I pray he is doing that well when he gets to be their age. Additionally, I get a glimpse of the world of \"special needs sibling\" and the issues Andy may face as he also grows and becomes more aware. Grace, dignity, and humor infuse the world of raising children, especially children with autism, and the quirks and questions which come with the territory. I read her blog first thing in the morning. I read it last thing at night. And if the day is hard, I've been known to open it up and read it if I get any moment during the day to do so.  Monkeygirl at  Musings of a Highly Trained Monkey.  Monkeygirl is an ER nurse, and her blog is mostly about life in the ER. I started reading her because Dr. Flea recommended the site. Dr. Flea's blog is sadly no more, but he had great taste in blogs. Monkeygirl's commentary is a reminder to remain sane in the face of insanity, a reminder to buck up and do the needful, and no matter what happens to me today, at least I'm not a complete idiot. Land whale, yes. Idiot, not yet. I promise, Monkeygirl, I am not allergic to NSAIDs. Stimey at  Stimeyland . OK, I admit it- I started reading Stimey's blog because she started leaving kind comments here, and then I discovered she is my age, and has a child named \"Quinn.\" Seriously. I love that name. But the blog is a series of glimpses into living with kids- and a good reminder that kids are kids, no matter their \"issues.\" Besides, she's funny. ;)  Evan at  Kiribako . Evan and I have been friends for a very, very long time. His worldand he sees it is definitely worth reading about. It always reminds me that I'm not the only one who sees things on a different slant from the norm, and that sometimes \"normality\" is completely nonsensical. Also, Evan tends to see and be interested in details of existance that I find fascinating, and wish I knew more about. He also reads interesting books I never get time to read. And finally,  Club 166 . Sorry, Joe, but there it is. Club 166 is another parent slogging through the school system, with some realy good advice for getting through IEP meetings and practical problems. If you want some solid, grounded, clearly written views on raising kids and maneuvering through the joys of special ed, go read Club 166. This is a guy who puts some thought into how to be a good parent to and advocate for his children. Let us go and do likewise.  I skipped Niksmom because she tagged me in the first place. I could definitely list more, but then we'd run outof people to tag. I know this is a parent-blog heavy list, which may irk some people, but when you're in the trenches of parenting, often it is knowing you're not alone that means the most, and gets you out of the rut.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RprQnt51XtI/AAAAAAAAAEw/4htDzxXnWfE/s1600-h/awards_thumbnail.jpg", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/", "http://whitterer-autism.blogspot.com/", "http://highlytrainedmonkey.blogspot.com/", "http://stimeyland.blogspot.com/", "http://evanbittner.com/blog/", "http://club166.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/reflections.html", "title": "\nReflections\n"},

It was really, really good, important, pertinent to other conversations floating around the blogosphere. Now I have a minute at the computer.  I cannot remember what I was going to blog about.  I'm fairly new at the joys of memory loss and brain hiccups. When I was young, \"steel trap\" was an understatement.

At his age, they never figured out how many I could do, because no matter how many they gave me, I could recite them back. I could recite exact conversations I had with people years before, and in my head could even see the faces of participants and the setting around us, and sometimes even the exact floor layout of where=ever we were. I would have made a fabulous witness, but fortunately, I didn't witness much that was that important. I have retained snatches of these memories, but like most people, the majority of my life is now lost to the sands of time. Sand on the brain.  This began in earnest when I became pregnant wih Joey; and then the pregnancy with Andy excelerated it alarmingly. I understand this is normal, especially for women- the hormones of pregnancy actually cause brain damage. I just find it incredibly annoying to walk into a room and have no idea why I am there- or even how I got there. I've taken to hooking my keys on the curtain rod on the door, otherwise I'd take an hour every morning to find them. This time of year I stock up on 10-cent spiral notebooks, because I use them everywhere- whenever I have a thought, if I don't write it down, I risk losing it forever to the sand in the brain. I started using the engagment calendar in my computer. If changes don't make it long enough to be recorded there, I get into trouble- miss appointments, show up for one that were cancelled or moved, etc.  Growing up really sucks.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/strolling-down-memory-lane-without-ding.html", "title": "\nStrolling down Memory Lane (without a ding-dong thing on my mind)\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 17, 2007", "body": "\nYou know it's time to stop trying to discuss and just smile and nod when these words escape the lips of your conversation partner:  1.  Yeah, normal kids do that, too.   Or it's variant, \"Yeah, my [normal] kid does that, too.\" Perhaps to a far lesser degree than my kid does whatever we were talking about. Usually I get this about meltdowns. \"Yeah, my kid melts down in the grocery line, too. She hates to wait. She always wants a candy bar.\"        What I want to reply: \"Really? Can she still speak well enough to press for that candybar she wanted? Yes? You have no clue what a meltdown  is .\"        What I usually say instead: \"Really? Must be tough to get her through the candy line. They need to keep that 'no candy/no tabloids' line open more.\"  2.  You know, I'm a little autistic myself.  This line is usually followed by some minor problem that vaguely suggests a desire for order, or habit. Such as \"I don't like florescent lights\" or \"I like having my coffee with two and a quarter creamers.\" Small sensory issues are not autism, people. What really gets me is this usually forebodes some comment about autistic adults not needing services (see #3).           What I want to say: \"Grow up.\"          What I usually say instead: \"I have my foiables, too. If we didn't, life would be really, really dull.\" 3.  S/he doesn't need {insert service here}, s/he just needs to grow up and learn to do things for him/herself. I wish I had someone to {provide specific service} for me!\"  OK, folks, I have mild executive dysfunction, some sensory issues, and an occasional stutter. These things don't get int eh way of functioning for me. As an adult, I am expected to clean my own house, keep my own records, shop for my own needs, etc. and I am able to do so, even if I need a little extra push with systems, ideas, and tools. It may not always happen, but I an  able  to make those compensations. Some people require extra  people  or extra equipment to make those kinds of compensations- such as an aide, or a communication board.         What I want to say: \"So, you're saying a paraplegic shouldn't use a wheelchair, because he's got legs?\"         What I usually say instead: \"If you're having trouble with {specific service mentioned above}, maybe you should {hire someone to provide that service/buy equipment to help complete task.} [Since the most common one is about having an aide to do things like help with grocery shopping or household tasks, I am usually recommending a maid service or a good mop.] 4.  Your child isn't autistic. He just needs a little discipline!  This is usually followed by suggestions of violence.          What I want to say: \"And where di you get your degree in child development or neurology? With a specialization in autism? And on what basis are you making your diagnosis? How would you like it if someone smacked you for wanting coffee in the morning?\"         What I usually say instead: \"Yes, we're really lucky, Joey's a good kid, working hard. However, his doctors all agree, he's definitely ASD. I see he's bothering you with his {unusual behavior- usually tracking}, so I'll let you get on with whatever you're doing- we need to go home.\"  5.  Oh, he'll be fine. My cousin's friend's great-aunt's brother twice removed didn't talk 'til they were four!  I got this a lot more when Joey was non-verbal, but it still pops up when people notice he's not speaking the way other five-year-olds speak.          What I want to say: \"Did they say \"momma\" and \"daddy\"? Did they point to objects? Yes? Joey didn't.\"         What I usually say instead: \"How interesting. Speech delays are fascinating. Anyone else in your family have speech delays?\" 6.  All children have eccentricities.  This is another one of those red-flag phrases that means the conversation is about to bend in the direction of \"Your kid's not really autistic\" or the person has little experience with sensory dysfunction, ritualistic behavior, perseveration, or echolalia. Yes, some little kids like to repeat words. Few repeat entire episodes of television shows. Yes, some little kids like to jump around and crash into things. Few will want to do this for hours on end, and to the point of bruising themselves. Lots of little kids don't like sudden, loud noises. Some will even scream in response. Few will have hour-long meltdowns or have to track lines in the carpet for the next half-hour. And few would think the closing of a car door qualified as a \"sudden, loud noise.\"          What I want to say: \"Stuff it in your ear.\"          What I usually say: \"Yes, that's how personalities are made. My guys sure are characters- didn't have much of a chance not to be, with me as their mother.\"  Sometimes trying to explain the difference between raising a normal kid and raising an autistic one is just not worth the effort There slittle point in trying to talk to someone who is telling you they have no intention of listening to a word you say. Tiem is at a premium here; I have better things to do. When you get that cue of \"shut up- I don't want to talk about you or your kid\" with the further implication of \"I just want to talk about myself\" sometimes the best thing to do is to oblige, and get out of the conversation pronto.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/non-listening.html", "title": "\nNon-listening\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 26, 2007", "body": "\n As an art historian, part of what I am studying and analyzing is how people communicate. You have an idea (or your patron has an idea) and it must be communicated. How will you acheive this? What will need to be shown? How much of that message should be overt, and how much covert? What images and techniques will be used to convey meaning?  One thing I have notived is that when communicating a new idea to a culture, it is often communicated using images and ideas the culture is already familiar with to get the new idea across. For example, in early Christian art, much of the early imagery is taken from pre-Christian art. These images had meaning for early Christians because before they were Christians, they had been non-Christians; their culrue had been non-Christian.  Images of Apollo, with the connotations of light, power, and protection made excellent early Christ figures. The bearded Zeus, with the connotations of kingship, power, and maturity became a later favorite, particularly the image of Zeus at Olympia, where he sits enthroned (the image of Lincoln at teh Lincoln Memorial is also based on the Olympia Zeus). The Good Shepherd, with its roots in images of sacrificers and devotees combined with teh idea of the shepherd who protects his flock was another great favorite (usually in the youthful Apollo guise). Early Christians quickly and clearly got the idea of who Christ was and what Christianity was about by viewing these images.  This is a useful strategy for speaking to people about things they don't understand: put it into terms and ideas that they  do  understand, and go from there. Images and words are metaphors and analogies; re-presentations of ideas and experiences that another person may not have. How close can you come to the original, when the original is beyond reach of the viewer?  From this idea, we get the use of rainbow spectrums for autism. Puzzle peices. Trips to Holland. Are these analogies, symbols, metaphors good ones, or not? It depends on how they are used, really; but no analogy is perfect, and some of them are downright off-base; but can they still be used to communicate? I don't care for the way the puzzle peice has been used, but it is very useful in starting a conversation about autism, because it is so recognizable. The spectrum thing, taken from the diagnosis \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\" has its usefulness, but also its difficulties. Even the trip to Holland has its problems as an analogy, but when trying to explain the experience of parenting to a clueless person with no special needs kids, it can be really useful. Trying to explain parenting generally? Probably not. The image has its limitations, and those must be recognized; but don't toss the baby with the bathwater.  Trying to find new ways to discussing autism and being human with people who have more ignorance than sense is a great challenge.  How does one communicate to people who have no idea what you are talking about? Have never experienced what you are talking about? And do so in a way that makes not only the experiecne itself a little clearer, but also communicates what you want to say about that experience? What should we emphasize?  I've been putting together a variety of t-shirt designs as alternatives to the ubiqitous puzzle peice, because I think the puzzle peice misses some of the point. The way it is used implies that only autistic children are \"puzzles\"- but any parent can tell you that isn't true. All children have that mystery, all children have needs, we are learning about all of them. We are all puzzles.  The misuse of the symbol has lead to it being used not to refer to kids, but to autism itself, as a puzzle that needs to be solved (and thus reradicated) rather than as a symbol of unacheived understanding. Bleah.  During the Renaissance, a person's uniqueness was valued. Genius was something to pay an artist extra for. Being in control of your own destiny, educating yourself, creating your own life was valued. Today this individuality seems to be more of a subculture, an alternative lifestyle, rather than the mainstream. The lessons of the Renaissance may need to be re-taught.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RqiRjVj_WQI/AAAAAAAAAFA/CmFEvSRF_Fg/s1600-h/snow_flake_autism.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RqiRj1j_WRI/AAAAAAAAAFI/XwLxKWRfVnM/s1600-h/beach_autism.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RqiRlFj_WUI/AAAAAAAAAFg/R_060ni29wQ/s1600-h/ducks.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Rqi5flj_WVI/AAAAAAAAAFo/icDiNqmUsSw/s1600-h/clouds2_autism_mug.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RqiRkFj_WSI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/WbZJSQ5b-iU/s1600-h/rose1_autism.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RqiRklj_WTI/AAAAAAAAAFY/IJ-Du0WKLAY/s1600-h/dandelion_autism.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/communicating.html", "title": "\nCommunicating\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 26, 2007", "body": "\nTaking up the thread from  Mom-NOS , here are ten ways Joey and I are alike:  1. Neither of us like hot water on our hands or feet. Water than my mom thought cold used to send me screaming when I was a kid. Joey hates hot stuff, too.  2. Neither of us like to wear shoes. Bare feet are best.  3. We both love numbers. Onceupon a time, I was the top math student in my high school. Counting is comforting.  4. We both collapse when tickled. As in, lose all motor control, heap on the floor.  5. We both love Christmas, and sparkly Christmas ornaments. We both love nothing better than to spend an afternoon at Valley View.  6. We both love to cuddle. Even when Joey was teeny tiny, he loved nothing better than to be in bed with Mom and Dad, getting squished. :)  7. We both love the ocean. We could just stand at the surf and watch the undulation of the sea forever.  8. When in doubt, we both smile. Joey excudes positiveness. I have often been asked, \"do you  always  smile?\" I wish I could honestly reply \"yes.\"  9. We both have little patience for eating. It takes me a lot of effort and energy to sit until everyone at the dinner table is finished- as soon as I have eaten, I'm ready to move on. Ditto for him. Sitting still is not something either of us do well.  10. We both have scattered interests. I know the common idea of autistics is a hyper-focus on a narrow range of topics, but for us, we tend to scatter and not hold too much interest in a single topic for too long. I'll watch one movie over and over for a few days straight, but then my brain moves on to hyper-focus on the next topic. Joey does this- he hones in for a few days, then moves on.  Ten ways I am like Andy:  1. We both love strawberry stuff. Yum! 2. We both like to look at packages in the graocery store. Some labels are really interesting!  3. We both like animals. I wanted to be a vet once upon a time and another life ago. Andy just adores anything furry. Or scaly. Or breathing.  4. We both have the devil in us. And that's a good thing.  5. We both like to look at books in bed. Usually together. :)  6. We both like flowers. I like looking at them and smelling them. He likes pulling them apart and finding out how they grow.  7. We both find car rides relaxing. He still gets to take a nap.  8. Neither of us like cacophony. We both find it highly disorienting and irritating. Andy will actually scream, then pace and track like Joey after being exposed to sudden loud noise, like when the band starts up at church.  9. Neither of us like cheese goldfish. I prefer plain. He likes pretzel.  10. We both like to make things. Andy loves little art projects, even if he likes keeping his fingers clean.

{"date": "Sunday, July 29, 2007", "body": "\nWe headed north again today, and spent the afternoon with the dinosaurs in the Museum of Natural History. I was kind of expecting them to hot-foot it in to the big dinosaur hall and spend most of the time there. I was surprised by side halls.  If you have never been to DC, and never seen the dinosaur exhibit (or not recently), then you're probably saying \"Wha?\" so let me take a little detour for you. The Museum of Natural History has changed dramatically from when I was young and wandering along the halls. For one, most of the exhibits have been scrubbed to unmerciful and character-less sterility, or tossed altogether. All of the exhibits my great-uncle Watson set up are gone, so that none of the animals in the mammal hall have any sense of habitat or context, the stuffed examples are stuck on glass shelves in glass cases. Being in the art business, this is exactly what most art and cultural museums are trying  NOT  to do. Why it has become fashionable in the curating of natural history, I haven't the slightest clue. Anyway, the dinosaurs have been partly spared this catastrophe, and whomever was in charge of scrubbing at least, for the most part, understood the idea of context and why it is important. The old hall retains interest. It is split into four main sections, three halls backed by a fourth. The three halls have ancient oceans and ancient forests flanking the main dinosaur hall, and then in teh back are the ancient mammals. A new cafe has been set at the far end of the dinosaur hall. The big fossil bone collection- things like brachiosaurs, tyrannosaurus rex, triceratops, stegasaurus, etc.- are in that middle main hall, will a very high ceiling (and a loft area for pterosaurs). The Oceans and Forests halls flank this main exihibit, but are seperated by walls, and have lower ceilings; so you can sometimes glimpse into the great dinosaurs from the side halls, but mostly, they are seperate exihibits with more carpetting and fewer echoes.  Another difference from when I was a kid is the sheer crush of people. When I was young, you could walk into the museum on a Sunday afternoon and have the place almost to yourself. Just not a popular day to go museum-hopping. Now, there is never a dull moment there. The crush of humanity is incredible. With the crush of human life comes the noise. Now add the echoes. It is enough to make  me  frantic. You can imagine what this is like for my guys.  The side halls, however, do not have the echo, or the draw. It still is crowded, but not the great, noisy, echo-y crush of the main dinosaur hall. To my surprise, despite the draw of t-rex and allosaurs, the boys made for the side halls. Quieter. Softer surroundings. Movies about fish mouths being made for sucking in worms. This is where they chose to spend the majority of their visit.  Yes, we did go out and say hello to the bones I consider old friends. My brother used to love the pteradactyls, hovering overhead, running up the stairs and reaching to as if we could touch them. Brachosaurus arching over the walkway, so it towered over you, the empty sockets gazing into space as if back to its flesh, long lost to time. But we spent most of the time exploring the world of the ammonites, the mosasaurs, and ancient mudpuppies.  These boys have a talent for finding what makes them comfortable. This is a good thing.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/07/dinosaurs-act-ii.html", "title": "\nDinosaurs (Act II)\n"},

I have been, as you may suspect from my absence, using every spare moment of any point of my day to read Harry Potter. That is now complete. I refuse to give anything away. However, this has also cut into that most valuable commodity, sleep. No sleep=grumpy mommy. Silly mommy, she needs to go to bed, but she's readignHary Poter instead. Silly,silly mommy. Sleep is a waste of time.  So naturally with me grumping about the house this morning, and Joey grumping about the house this morning, when the milk got spilled, all hell broke loose. Level 8. Just what mommy wanted this morning. Worse, he was still in the middle of it when the bus arrived. The bus aide actually came into the house and got him- the idea being that the bus is very calming for him, so we wanted to get him on it. But I felt really, really bad, because I'm sure he was picking up on my grumpiness, which was my own fault in teh first place, because I didn't go to bed, because I was reading...  Meanwhile, someone bit Andy. I took him to the gym, and then took him swimming, and there are nasty bite marks on his shoulder- too small to be Joey, but Joey doesn't bite anyway. So we made sure to reort that to the gym people, so they can be on the lookout for a biter. Andy didn't complain about it until the gym people started fussing over it. I didn't intervene on that point, because I want him to understand he needs to tell somebody if he's bitten.  So when the boy camehome from school, I scooped everybody up an took them to Arby's for lunch.

It has to be done occasionally, mind you. Otherwise the weight pulls it out, and at my age, hair loss can be permanent.

{"date": "Sunday, August 05, 2007", "body": "\nJoey isn't feeling very well. I got the hint this afternoon after church, when we went to buy shoes.  This weekend is Virginia's \"tax-free weekend.\" That means we instantly save 5% on everything we buy for school- supplies, clothes, shoes, etc. That may not seem like a lot of money, but around here, every little bit helps. And when shoes cost $50 a pair (holy frijoles!), and you've got two of them who are going to need shoes, that's a quick $5, before we start on anything else they need. So off to the shoe store we go.  Both boys have extra-wide feet, so the selection is limited where-ever we go. Walmart shoes don't fit them at all. Nope. We have to go to the $50 shoe store to get shoes on these feet. Great. And we still have all of two pairs to choose from. Fortunately, both are velcro. Joey picks out a pair that have those flashy lights in the heels. Good- those are the cheaper of the two pairs. Andy picks dark ones over light ones. Fine- we won't see them get dirty as quickly. Done. Let's get out of this madhouse of running, screeching children before I have two meltdowns on my hands.  Then Joey decides he wants to wear his new shoes out of the store. Nevermind that they are for regular school- a month away- and have already been boxed back up and bagged. He wants those shoes. Now.  Of course, it's really a problem of the noise, the heat, the change of schedule, the heat, the unfamiliar store, the heat, being tired, and of course, the heat. This is not about shoes at all. The store folks are very nice, and they know Joey, and they know about the autism, so as he begins the spiral into meltdown, they do their best to hurry things along to get me out the door... but it's too late. In his frustration, Joey bit me.  The biting is new- at least the biting of other people. He's picked it up from Andy, and I have no clue where Andy got it. Andy will do it if he feels in immediate danger or extreme annoyance, such as another child trying to snatch something from him. Joey does it with deliberation and thought. You can see the wheels turn and the decision being made, that half a beat of deliberate-ness that makes the whole mess seem that much more not a failure on his part, but a failure on mine. Somehow, I have permitted, and reinforced, this as an appropriate tool to get what he wants, or make himself \"feel better\" (I doubt he actually feels better for doing this, but before the action is done, it seems like a good idea to try it, if you know what I mean. Kind of like on a sunny day, it may seem like a great idea to go to the beach, until you realize the sand is burning your feet, the sun is burning your skin, and you forgot to bring sunglasses.) What's worse is I feel I have never tolerated this behavior. This is an instant-reprocussion situation. The full shop of parents glare at me as I pick up my 70-odd pound screaming child, toss him over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes, take his smaller brother by the hand, and march out of the store to the van.  I'm sure I'll get lots of wonderful critiques about that. Did picking him up and/or removing him reinforce the behavior? Should I have allowed him to melt down right there in front of the door? Is a time-out in a van really going to help? How does one correct such behavior, and what behavior can one expect of an overwhelmed 5-year-old?  And here is how I saw it: I made the mistake of trying to get the shoes on a day the store was crowded, the five bucks be damned. Once the mistake was made and the consequence in full swing, the appropriate course of action was to remove the child so that he could regain control and calm. Strapped into a car seat with the A/C going was the only option I really had available. There was no way, once Joey realized he had actually bitten me, that he was going to walk out of that store on his own two feet- the next action was going to be complete puddle of child, because meltdown was complete- about a level 4, if you leave the bite out of the calculation. But definitely meltdown- he was no longer functional. All my fault. I'm the stupid person who tried to take him into the crowded store to buy shoes, remember. On the hottest day of the year, no less.  I'd go into what one should expect from an overwhelmed five-year-old, but I didn't like the hate mail I got last time, so I won't. (I got the gambit from \"How dare you think/wish this child should behave any differently than he does?\" to \"How dare you let him behave that way?\") I will say that these are the realities here. Five dollars may not seem a lot, but it is a week's worth of breakfasts. Five dollars is an extra t-shirt for school. Five dollars is 10 minutes of speech therapy (thank you, insurance, for finally kicking in!) Five dollars is a trip to the pumpkin patch. Five dollars is milk for the week. How many crowded stores have we been in, and out of, and not had a single whine from Joey? Hindsight is 20/20- better, when you find yourself constantly judged and found wanting.  Which brings me back to the beginning of this ramble, which is that Joey is not feeling well, and I know this because our trip to the shoe store ended in meltdown. We've been having more of those than usual, but not more than usual for summer, does that make sense? Anyway, they still can be those first little inklings of trouble. I wouldn't say he was grumpy the rest of the day, no more than usual on long car rides (we went to pet goats in Madison), but he wasn't right. Sure enough, we put him to bed early with a little fever. Poor little guy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RraQjVj_WWI/AAAAAAAAAFw/blSD4J9SuZM/s1600-h/02_boys_yoders.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/08/new-shoes.html", "title": "\nNew Shoes\n"},

Not new as in \"new to autism\"- new as in \"baby is nine days old.\" Her older child was in therapy, but she had teh brand-new baby with her. Andy likes babies. Joey  LOVES  babies. And this was a teeny-tiny, brand-new baby with big eyes and headfuzz, and mom still very round and new-mom looking.  The boys were very good. They washed their hands, and only touched the baby on her head to feel the soft babyhair. They smiled and giggled and made faces at the baby, and didn't get in her face. Joey talked about the baby being little, the baby was awake, the baby was soft, and said he liked babies. He turned to Mom, and talked to her about the baby. Very nice social moment.  Then he reached out with one finger an proclaimed, \"I want to touch the booby!\" and gave her very round breast a stroke with his finger. Then he was off to another point of interest in the room, leaving me, the Mom, the office manager, and a couple other moms in a moment of speechless awe.  I must say, the Mom was an absolute sport about it, very gracefully not saying anything. The office manager just abotu died on the spot trying not to laugh. I initially thought he intended to say \"baby\" and only touched the Mom because he remember he wasn't supposed to touch the baby, but apparently everybody else thought it was quite clear.  I wonder where he's picked that up. He often likes to touch peole, especially on exposed lower arms, but I've never had him do this before. I've been trying to teach him to ask before touching someone, and I honestly think he was trying to do just that by making the announcement that split second before acting. Now we just need to go back to just arms, please.

Last night, that sweet little guy asked if he could \"go swimming, go to beach, go swim with the cousins\" meaning my cousin's twins and a trip to my aunt and uncle's to swim in their pool. I called them immediately to ask to come, and they were all for it. Yay, the part of the family that  gets it !  A good time was had by all.  Then we got the usual signal that it was time to go. Joey began to perseverate.  We had been there all afternoon. The little guy was tired. His brother was exhausted. They were having fun. My aunt has one of those wooden German calendars on her wall, and one of the little wooden peices is, of course, a number 12. This is Joey's favorite number.  I am not sure why 12 is the number of choice. I could theorize on the subject, discuss the patterning and the sequential allure of the number 1 next to the number 2 to create the number 12, or a whole gambit of other associations possible, many of which would seem completely random to most people, and incomprensible to anyone not intimate with autism generally and Joey specifically. Whatever the reason, perseverating the number 12 means bedtime. Tired. Done. When he starts going on abotu the number 12, it's time to check for tiredness, exhaustion, or (if in the middle of the day for no apparent reason) fever. This is one of those ways Joey communicates that is hard to explain to people who expect other people to simply state what they need, or use words and language in direct ways. These are the kinds of little signals we've always picked up on with Joey.  12. {I'm tired.} I was 12. Give me 12. Look, a 12. I am 12. Where's the 12? 12. 12.  Fortunately, this is the part of the family that  gets it , because they raised the daughter of another cousin, who was special needs ( epilepsy  and probable  FAS ). So when I suddenly announced it was time to go, and hustled everyone out the door and to the car, no offense was, I believe, taken. I think the sudden change in demeanor was a cue for them, too.  He's right now 12-ing on Allan's recliner.

Then we have two weeks of basically nothing- an abyss- before school begins.  We're not the only family to sign up for eight weeks of speech camp this summer. Or summer school. While maintaining our regular therapies. And then add a social skills camp to these last two weeks. Andy has patiently sat in the therapists office from 1 o'clock on, sometimes to 6 o'clock... all summer long. He has also not been alone.  There is a little girl who has sat in the office most of the summer while her brother is in speech camp. Is she seven? Eight? Old enough to like to do cartwheels across the waiting room and spruce up her pretty little face with Hello Kitty lipgloss. There are two preteen girls who come less often, but armed with DVDs and drawing pads, also waiting for speech camp siblings. There are two little girls and their baby brother awaiting a child in OT, who like to play with the plastic dolls' house in the speech room. The baby likes to climb the stairs and look down at his Dad through the rails. He also happens to have Down's Syndrome. There are some other siblings that come less often, or who I have seen less of at any rate. One is only eleven days old.  Whenever I think its been a long summer, I think of these kids. It's been a long summer for them, too. They didn't go to day camp, or cheerleading camp, or sports camp, or any of the things other non-special-needs kids seem to be doing. They didn't get to do lots of enrichment programs, or spend lots of lazy days by the pool. They didn't go to the beach. They stayed mostly right here, supporting their brothers and sisters as best they could by letting mom or dad or grandma or grandpa drag them to the therapy office day after day, and thus allow their siblings to have their therapies.  Next summer (and yes, I fully expect to be doing this again next summer), I'll probably ask the therapists if they mind if we have a Sibling Camp. Something to offer these kids besides sitting in the waiting room doing... well, not much. It could be free. I've got enough art supplies laying around here to put something together. A sprinkler in the parking lot would be OK for a brief activity when it wasn't absolutely boiling. Singing new songs and maybe even playing some  Signing Time   or other activity-related DVDs wouldn't cost anything. It would even be easy enough to have stuff that kids could easily walk-in/walk-out from; stations or quickie crafts so that anyone can join in, or opt out, as appointments allow. Just something so these kids don't feel like they spent the summer sitting around a waiting room. Something to get them through these last dog days of the summer, before the Abyss.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/08/dog-days.html", "title": "\nThe Dog Days\n"},

He is looking for a specific object, but the words he is using to label the object make no sense. The game of 20 questions trying to discover what the object might be is rarely useful, because he does not answer questions accurately. Let's take this evening for an example.  \"Can I have my keem?\" I have no idea what a \"keem\" is. Twenty Questions begins. What is it? A keem. You may have it; go get it. I want my keem. Where is it? It's there (accompanied by pointing in random directions). OK, show me. I want my keem! So now we get off our butt and start looking for what this object might be. He was playing with some matchbox cars and  Cars  is playing on the tv. Maybe the object is a car. Is it \"The King?\"  I find The King, but this is not the object, and is rejected.  What color is it? It's green. He shakes his hand to sign green. OK, I am looking for a green object. I find a green car he was playing with earlier. This is not the object. It is immediately rejected.  Does it have wheels? No. Ok, not a car. What else could \"keem\" be?  Joey is now spiraling into tears because I'm an idiot who doesn't know what a \"keem\" is.  How about \"game\"? He's been perseverating on a little electronic thing that does math. Does he want his game? No. Green car.  So it's a car. Without wheels. That does not compute.  And unfortunately, though the game is \"Twenty Questions\", we've actually maxxed out on the number of questions he'll attempt to answer on the subject without complete meltdown. Any more inquiries are either ignored or meet the same response: a wail and gnashing of child, screaming \"My KEEEEEEEEEEEEM!\" I give up and send him up to his bath. I may never find out what a keem is. I hope he will sleep without it, but one can never tell. This may re-blow-up after bathtime, or it could be transitioned and done.

I eat in the restaurant! I am going in the restaurant!\" He got to order his food himself (\"I want the french fries and the chicken!\") and pick out his food from the salad bar (he wanted mashed potatoes, cottage cheese, and watermelon), and even got his ownself-serve ice cream for dessert. But most amazing of all, he tried new food! He ate Grandma's cabbage (with and without cheese), and baked potato!  Who is this child, and where did they take Joey?

{"date": "Friday, August 24, 2007", "body": "\nI am thinking of trying to have a camping adventure with my guys, hopefully before school starts. Oobi has a camping episode, and Little Bear goes camping with Father Bear, and one of our Signing Time videos mentions camping, so there has been some interest in tents and things.  The question is how to do it. Camping even with non-autistic young children requires planning. First- inside or really outisde? To have this adventure inside requires clearing floorspace for the tent, but the plus is controlling the temperature and immediate access to such things as bathrooms, comfort objects, and the television. Not exactly camping, is it.  What is the point of this adventure? Exposure to new things, discussing the night-time, learning about nature. Ideally, we'd go out to Grandma's and camp in the woods, with a real campfire, seeing if Joey could deal with roasting marshmallows. Ther would be owls and wood ducks and deer and wild turkeys, as well as rabbits, squirrels, and plenty of trees and bushes.We could wade inteh river and look for crawdads and mussels and minnows. However, what about Joey wandering? If he got really uncomfortable, would Grandma's house be enough of a comfort? Or would he wander into the trees? What if he heard something that interested him? How would I find him? What if the river was a draw?  An alternative plan would be our own back yard. The yard is fenced. i'd need to get a chain and lock for the gate. But we'd be in the town. I suppose that's OK for a first adventure. Backyard it is.  I actually have a tent. Amazon had them cheap for a while. We could use the BBQ as a firepit for marshmallows. It would be kinda Oobi-ish. Now, what activities to keep the attention of small children until they pass out?  telling stories isn't really advisable, as they don't hold attention. Joey's tenuous grasp of narrative, sequencing, and language means he has a very difficult time following stories. Maybe soem kind of craft would be good early on, then marshmallows, and see if we can entice them with songs.  How would they deal with discovering that we are actually sleeping outside all night? That the bedtime routine will be altered?  Willthis lead to meltdown, or controllable excitement? Do I have enough ASL to keep Joey focused and able to understand? Should I try to dig out the Oobi episode and talk about this? How far ahead?  It's not really the questions that are out of the ordinary- it's the answers.

My friend Christina is a great inspiration. She keeps on chuckin', and then calls me with her bright, cheery voice to shine some sunshine on my day. Gotta love that!  My friend Sue, whom I don't often blog about, is anther one of those tethers to reality and cheerfulness. She has an NT son who is just a dollface, and sometimes its nice to hear about some normality.  Maddy  must be included on this list. Maddy was the first person to comment here, letting em know I wasn't all by myself after all. There are other places where \"goldfish\" is a food group.  Whenever I think about nice people, and what \"nice\" means, I think of Howard and  Kimberlee . When my cat Puma was very very sick in the last stages of feline leukemia, she needed an emergency blood transfusion. They were the only people we knew who had healthy cats, and though we didn't really know them that well, we asked them to help us with one of their beloved babies. They never even hesitated, asked questions, nothing- they grabbed their young, healthy cat Pepin and came to the rescue. Their kindness gave us another week with our Puma, and I will never forget it. There are real, courageous, nice people in the world.  Another great inspiration is my friend St. Anne. Her little boy has been a great companion, classmate, and buddy for my Joey this summer, and she's just another epitomy of a nice person, with supportive comments and advice for everybody (especially me!). Thanks for the Diet Cokes on my rough afternoons.  I'd also like to mention Joey's first preschool teacher. Even when she moved off to another distrcit, she has stayed interested in Joey, and helped us learn how to advocate for him. Shes the kind of teacher I wish everyone had- interested in her students, willing to go the extra mile and do the extra research to make sure she is doing the best she can to help her kids and their parents.

{"date": "Thursday, September 06, 2007", "body": "\n My mom lost her cat to cancer this week. Chelsea Marmalade Blanche DuBois was a good companion and friend to my mom for fourteen years. We miss her very much.  When Blanche was brought to my mom, she had already been a mom, and traveled across the US. Aunt Ginny (who, incidentally, also gave us Luna and Ellora) had saved her from an animal shelter with the promise that \"Chelsea\" would be an indoor cat. All of Blanche's kittens had already been adopted, and she was being threatened with euthanasia- so that nine life thing may hav some truth to it after all.  Aunt Ginny travels with her animals, so Blanche joined the travelling family. However, she soon proved unfit for such a life. She would escape and hide on roofs and in closets, and provided ample evidence of neurosis. She hated the other animals. It just wasn't working. Aunt Ginny knew my mom had a nice, quiet house. We had lost our former long-time pet, Hubert Magic Mitten (\"Kit Kat\", or more usually, \"Cat\") in the spring. He was 17, and had a series of strokes. So Aunt Ginny brought the slender, long-haired beauty to the country, and my mother, for Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mom! Her long orange hair and status as a mother lead my mom to initially dub her \"Marmie\" (Marmalade for the orange, and marmie after  Little Women ). However, it soon became apparent that the cat was absolutely nutso. She would hide for days in mom's closet, without food or water. If you made eye contact too soon, she would hide somewhere else and emerger several more days later, emaciated and exhausted. Mom learned to locate her without making eye contact, and leaving water. Then she would hide in the basement for weeks. If you called her, she would only answer if she thought you could see her (even if you couldn't). Again, callingtoo soon meant several more days of hiding. This was no Marmie. This was Blanche DuBois- depending on the kindness of strangers! But as the calm of my mother and her home settled on Blanche, and she calmed down. She hid less and less, and finally stopped such insanity. Instead, she preferred ot sleep near my mother's face, one paw upon her cheek. Even when Mom was ill, sleeping out on the couch instead of bed, she would come and see where Mom was, and sit with her. They talked. Marmie (Blanche and Marmie became interchangeable names for her, depending on her mood) would want to know who was on the phone, demand her breakfast, demand that Mom come to bed. Blanche or Marmie, she and my mom were companions through thick and thin.  Six days ago, Marmie was eating a full can of food at each meal, being her usual bossy self. Then she stopped eating. She was otherwise acting fine, but she was losing weight. Two days ago, as she started looking thin, Mom took her to the vet and they took x-rays. Yesterday, the vet sat us down and explained that all that white we see in the abdominal cavity and chest cavity? That's cancer. Non-operable cancer, and chemo would buy her maybe three months- and not happy months. She was starting to have trouble breathing. She was at least 16 years old. It was time.  We lost our Blanche at 10:22 am on Sept 5, 2007.  Thank you for being our friend, Marmie. We love you. We miss you. Blessed be.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RuCn7_aabsI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/N7Y9RSnUNmg/s1600-h/marmie2.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/09/in-memoriam-marmie-cat.html", "title": "\nIn Memoriam: Marmie Cat\n"},

Not on a sixth-grade level or anything, but definitely reading- three-letter words no problem, some longer ones. We think this is pretty darn cool. I was reading pretty good by his age, and so was my husband, but neither of us had any language issues.  This evening, I pulled out a new book for him to look at. It was about  Cars , to catch his interest, but not one he had seen much of. I  had  read it to them once, but bedtime storytime is not an activity that usually including paying attention to teh mom reading a story, so I wasn't too concerned about him memorizing the thing from one reading.  I am not a teacher, and I know very little about how young children read or learn to read. I know there are two ways to read, sight reading (recognizing words on sight, rather than sounding them out) and phonetic reading (sounding out the words). In reading our new book together, Joey clearly has some words by sight (like \"the\" and \"and\" and \"car\"). Words he didn't know by sight, we worked on sounding out, and he tried sounding out. As far as I know, this is a normal way to read. What I found interesting was the attempts at sounding out. Joey is very familiar with letters and the sounds they make, However, he often made the sound for a similar letter, rather than the letter he was looking at. For example, looking at the word \"slowly\", he would try it as \"slooty\" or \"stewly\" or even \"stowly\". The inconsistancy of it, and the use of similar letters, was kind of odd to me.  But he got through! We read the whole book, and he was SO PROUD, and I was so proud of him! It was the coolest thing  ever ! When he really catches on to this, we'll have a another visual avenue of communication with Joey- and he'll have a new avenue for communicating with us!

When I picked him up, he hadn't gone to the potty because they aren't allowed to go in with him, even if he needs a little encouragement.  Still, he seemed very happy and excited with his morning. He made a little handprint project, and called his teacher by name. Exciting stuff! He made himself right at home. No crying, no clinging- and since he's been clingy all lat week, that was a bit of a surprise. He found himself some plastic bugs and settled right in.  They did send him home with homework. A preschooler. There are a lot of non-academic things to learn in the world.  It's also interesting to note what the school expects from parents. I know far less of what Andy is doing during the day. I got a note, but it didn't say much. Once a month, one parent has to send in play-doh of a certain color. They send home a recipe. i signed up for September- get it done. My color was yellow. The photo here shows you the results. The neon orange was following the recipe. The pumpkin yellow is using only a quarter of the dye the recipe calls for. You will note that neither batch is yellow.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 18, 2007", "body": "\nAndy is on the verge of being tossed out of preschool.  Andy loves preschool. He has no trouble seperating from me. He's very interested in the activities. He loves having friends. He has some usual 3-year-old troubles of sharing and paying attention. He's eager to learn and to be at school.  So what is the problem? Anyone else who has dealt with a \"normal\" preschool probably guessed it- toileting.  Many boys do not fully toilet independantly until they are four years old. Preschools don't care. Normal preschools now expect three year old children to be able to communicate effectively when they need the bathroom even during busy and interesting activities, walk into a bathroom stall by themselves, pull down their own clothes, completely void, wipe themselves effectively, pull up all clothing themselves, walk out of the stall to the sink, wash their hands, and return to the teacher waiting in the doorway, all independently- no prompts. None.  This means a child can be developmentally appropriate, even gifted, and have no where to attend school. Here, unless you can demonstrate a child has a 25% delay in something, the child cannot get into the special ed program. At age 3, 25% is a serious delay. However, even within a normal toilet-training timeline, a child is denied a \"regular\" program, because children must be \"fully toilet-trained\" as defined above. Verbal prompting through the steps of toileting is not an option. Visual prompts are not an option. The person cannot walk in and help the child unless there is another adult also in the bathroom (state law), so if the child, say, has trouble pulling up their underwear, they are not \"fully toilet trained.\" If they have trouble focusing on tasks or pulling themselves away from tasks independently (if they need the prompt \"Time for the potty!\"), they are \"not fully toilet trained.\" You can count to ten, ID all your colors, and know three letters, but you need a prompt for the potty? Sucks to be you. Get out.  Now, had I known this was the definition when I enrolled him last spring, I would have spent more OT time and more home time on these skills, instead of letting him \"take his own time.\" All this literature about not pressuring kids to toilet train? Throw it OUT THE WINDOW. If they can't go to preschool with their peers solely due to this one weak skill, then more focus needs to be placed there, because it seems to be the one and only weakness that precludes participation in preschool absolutely. You can't wait, because you can't hold the child into an extra year of preschool. You can't place a normal 5-year-old into the 4-year-old class. You can't just stick your 3-year-old with the twos. All of the other kids have two years of preschool, some of them three, and your kid has one, guess who gets left behind? Guess who doesn't have the socialization skills and experience? Classroom skills? Andyes, there are kids who show up to kindergarden with no preschool at all, for various reasons. I've seen what becomes of them. It isn't pretty. When all the other kids are in reading group, writing their names, and standing in line, your kid gets labeled real quick- and its not a label you want the kid going through school with.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/09/snag-in-plan.html", "title": "\nThe Snag in the Plan\n"},

I would really like Andy to go there, because the glimpse I had of the facility was really promising, it comes highly recommended from both parents and previous students (who are often the same people), and Montessori does emphasize skills and ideas I would like Andy to have. Self-discipline. Wonder. Interest in learning. Being able to read the map, rather than just know the route to specific destinations.  Andy is three years old. He does not currently possess these skills. We just left a school that seemed to assume kids possessed skills I thought were the goal of preschool- things like sharing, following instructions, self-care. A big worry is the idea that if we go with this school, we are obligated to the full tuition. In other words, if something goes wrong, we're out a lot of money and probably cant afford to try another school. What if the environment turns out to be over-stimulating, so that he can't focus? How common is it for kids to get so interested in new things that they forget the bathroom? I thought it was pretty common, but apparently not. What about the impact on his personality of spending so much of his life in waiting rooms, of having a brother with a disability? The impact of his own weaknesses in sensory integration and communication? What if he melts down? Will they throw him out? Do other kids sometimes melt down in school? What if he becomes aggressive with his frustration? Will they help, or just tell me to come get him? Are these \"normal\" problems to have?  Having Andy tossed from preschool (well, technically, I pulled him out, but he was clearly unwelcome) has been a real shock. He is so very ready, and yet he has issues. I thought all kids had issues.

If one says \"Down Syndrome\" or \"Autism\" or \"Cerebral Palsy\" or any number of labels tossed about special ed and medical facilities today, there is an implication of disability already implied- whether the condition is disabiling for the person or not. There is an automatic search for accommodation. The local school district may have to be sued, but they are legally obligated to provide service. These are recognized disability labels. SID/SPD is not. A child who cannot sit still is considered a problem, not a child in need of accommodation because of sensory issues. A child who needs help pulling up underwear is considered stupid or unfit for school, not a child with potential motor issues or sensory issues that may need accommodation. There is no \"25% delay\" to pinpoint and document. You can't take \"covers ears in large, noisy rooms\" to a committee and get your child into ECSE.  At the same time, no other school or daycare will take that child, either.  Our interview at the Montessori lasted 15 minutes, maybe 20. Everything I actually saw them ask him to do- letter puzzles, sorting small objects, etc., he did it. We were very frank about Andy's strengths, and just as frank about his weaknesses, and what we needed for him: a positive, supportive environment with somebody who could occasionally step in and remind him to pull his underwear over his bottom. You know... a preschool. For a three-year-old. They're all the rage this year, honest. It was probably telling when we left and my Mom asked Andy, \"Would you like to go to school here?\" he replied, \"no, thank you.\" But the excuse for not accepting him when they called today was also telling: \"We cannot accommodate him in our program at this time.\"  So many schools talk the big talk. They had a whole classroom section about \"children of the world.\" There were smiling children in traditional costumes, like an Eskimo child wearing a fur-lined hood, a Chinese child in yellow silk, and African child in bright fabric and beads, watching the classroom from their poster dutifully.

{"date": "Thursday, October 11, 2007", "body": "\nTalked with Joey's teacher today. I really have a lot of confidence in both of Joey's teachers. He is having a fabulous time at school and clearly coming along. But I have to say, testing is a crock.  It would be one thing if the goal of testing was to understand what a child knows and understands, and what requires more work. When I give a test, this is what I am doing. Testing is a tool. But most testing in the schools is not geared to understanding what children know. It is geared to finding out what non-disabled children can recall within a certain format.  The Commonwealth of Virginia has implemented something called the Standards of Learning. I sure there are many excellent blogs on the subject, pros, cons, and everything in-between. I will say that having looked over the SOL goals with some care, there are pros and cons. The main pro is that kids have definite things they are learning throughout the year, following set \"guidelines\" so that I as a parent can determine what my child is learning in school in any given month, and can support those lessons at home. And they are good lessons, like learning about the senses and the world and the basics of academics. The con comes from a lack of flexibility, overwhelming children with material, and the measurments used to determine whether the children are learning the lessons. Testing my child with a verbal-heavy test where he has to carefully fill in little \"bubbles\" isn't going to help much, other than to tell me he's not very good at that kind of a test because of the auditory processing and the question processing. I already know he's autistic, thanks. What I want to know is does he know the material? And do we have an effective way for him to communicate that information and use that information? Another con is that the standards are so set and inflexible, Joey ends up having to do what to him is busy-work. He already knows his shapes, colors, numbers and letters. Yet here they are again. Is he not answering these questions about community helpers because he is bored? Or because he can't process the question format? Or because he genuinely has no clue what a fireman does? It is impossible to tell.  We do have some basic accommodations in his IEP, like one-on-one testing, visual prompts, and flex-testing (if he's clearly not going to test well, or gets tired, the teacher can stop testing for that day and try again later.) I think I'd feel better if more signing was used and permitting during testing, but I don't think the teachers are trained and know enough sign to do that. I just fear people who are not special ed folks- ie, most of the school teachers and admin- are going to dismiss him as stupid because of state-mandated tests which are poorly designed (at best) for students with special needs. This child is not stupid, and assuming he is will only frustrate him.  I think what I like most about this teacher (the one I spoke with today), though, is her assumption of competence. She expects Joey to do what she knows he can do, and she knows he can do this work and understand what is going on. Now we just have to figure out how to communicate effectively- both ways.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/10/testing.html", "title": "\nTesting\n"},

{"date": "Friday, October 12, 2007", "body": "\n The Supreme Court split on a court case in New York.  The focus of the case was, in brief, are parents required to try out a demonstrably inappropriate IEP before challenging it?  Note the words:  demonstrably inappropriate. And the court split.  I am so angry I could spit.  It's not just a matter of not giving the public school a chance. This is about the school offering an  inappropriate  program, and then telling you if you don't like it, sue us. The point of the IDEA is to provide free and  appropriate  education. As in, knowing that your program is  inappropriate  means you need to make some changes and adjustments or even create a new program so the child can get an  appropriate  education. As in, not offering appropriate service means a child will  not  have a chance to be properly educated and have a shot at independent living.  When a school offers an IEP, it is supposed to take the parent as an equal member of the forming committee. It is far more comon that they present what services they want to offer your kid, and you have to decide to take it, leave it, or threaten to sue (which can lead to actually suing). Often, parents are not told about services that would be appropriate for their child (even if the services are being provided to other students!)  The problem is the school is given both the responsibility for providing services AND the responsibility to remain within small budgets. Everyone who has the power to provide the service also has the pressure of the purse strings. And folks, those people know who signs the paychecks, and parents are not that person. We can scream \"taxpayer, paying your salary!\" all we want, but ultimately, it is not our name on that check, but the name of a person pressured to spend as little money as possible. Speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, ABA, floor time, one-on-one instruction and testing... and anything else you can think of... costs money. It is far cheaper to not offer these things, and to get away with not offering them if you can. The chances of that parent suing, and winning, are so not good that it is worth a chance to offer services known to be inappropriate, inadequate... and cheap.  When you can  demonstrate  that an IEP is inappropriate, why should your child be subjected to that  known  inappropriate placement? I don't care if the kid has \"time to waste\" or not (does ANY child have \"time to waste\" in education??? Life is short!). Our money pays for that  inappropriate  service and placement- and therefore wastes our money! It wastes time of the teachers, the service providers, the admin, the lawyers, the parents... it wastes resources that could be appropriate for another child.  How on earth can anoyone be split on this?? How can you think it is in any way the right thing to subject a child to inappropriate program and service? How can anyone possibly think the law is intended to force kids to \"try out\" a  demonstrably  inappropriate placement?  That, folks, is how kids get abused.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=our_schools&id=5700712#"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/10/split-court.html", "title": "\nSplit Court\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 14, 2007", "body": "\nI began this blog under siege.  The world of special education, the world of autism parents, the world of therapy offices is a strange, labyrinthine place. There is ashes and dust and pits pits pits. But there is also eleanor and ents and elves. I still sometimes feel I am fighting the Long Defeat.  As a parent of a newly diagnosed autistic child, trying desperately to find the best ways to support him, I was stunned by the quagmire of information, misinformation, bullying, exploitation, abuse, and manipulation. I've been trained to research, to think critically, to sift through fact and fancy and analyze the findings. Yet I found myself with snippets of information, impassioned beliefs, and little I could assign as \"fact.\"  I was in a sea of ABA Fascists who insisted that every autistic child receive 40 hours of ABA therapy. I was surrounded by parents subjecting their children to shots, diets, creams, medicines, herbals, and therapies for which I could find no substance or reason. I was judged a bad mom for protecting my children against diseases that not only kill, but had killed children in our very own neighborhood, one not a year before Joey was born. I was publicly judged a bad mom for not subjecting my child to hours and hours of repetitive, unindividualized and static methods of teaching by poorly trained college kids. I was judged a bad mom for taking my kids out in public, teaching them hands-on like any other kids. Other parents stopped speaking to me because I wasn't approaching Joey and autism the way they did, using the methods they employed for their own children, advocating for the services they wanted for their own kids. I was given a book by the doctor that proclaimed 70% of children with autism are mentally retarded. Joey would never be independent. He would never understand other people as anything but objects. He would never be able to read emotions. He may never speak, or communicate at all. He would never form relationships.  I can only speak for the truths I have discovered about my own children. I am still discovering; but there are some facts I can present without doubt or hesitation. My children are not metal-poisoned. Not lead, not mercury, not aluminum, not cadmium, not arsenic, I could go on. My children have \"theory of mind.\" Joey knows Andy likes dinosaurs, for example. When he was picking out a treat for himself today, he insisted on picking out a dinosaur for Andy, because he knew- and communicated to us- that Andy would like it. My children are not mentally retarded. My children have friends, and are very attached to them. Joey and Andy both not only communicate, but want to communicate and relate to other people. ABA has helped Joey. He does not need 40 hours of discrete trial training per week. My children are is not allergic to gluten, casein, or chocolate. Joey was already autistic when he was born. Joey is a beautiful, wonderful, joyful, intelligent, squishable little boy. I love Joey. Andy is not autistic. He is a handsome, loving, fantastic, smoochable little boy. I love Andy, too.  There I stand.  I started this blog in hopes of communicating with other parents who may feel lost in the quagmire. In a community that desperately needs parents who are united, networked, and supportive of the diversity of approaches and coping strategies, we are instead often isolated by other parents who think they have the one and only answer. I wanted fewer parents to feel desperate, alone, and forever separated from the gifts God has given them- their children. As they are. Start from here. I wanted to dispel a little of the fear, the uncertainly, the isolation, the dark.  What I found was that I am not alone. There is nothing to fear. And you'll separate me from my children when you pry them from my cold, dead fingers, thank you very much.  Thank you, Kev.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/10/in-light-of-recent-events.html", "title": "\nIn light of recent events\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 04, 2007", "body": "\nI was supposed to have some time this fall. To be exact, about three hours, twice a week.  I had plans for that time.  I was going to make Halloween costumes. I was going to make Christma decorations. I was going to clean things, organize things, and drink a lot more chai with Christina.  Once again, we have not landed the plane in Italy. Andy is not in school. The only places that will take him are places I can't afford. Daycares will only do full-time slots, even if you don't ant a full-time slot. Preschools want teh kids \"fully potty trained\", meaning fully independant in the bathroom. They also apparently want kids to already have school social skills, like sharing, taking turns, and standing in lines or sitting in circles. So no school this year. I signed Andy up at the rec center, most of which starts in November now, and all is Mommy-and-me style. He'll be the oldest kid in most of it.  The few friends I have with \"normal\" kids are going out for coffee. They are comparing school experiences. They are showing off the crafts their kids make at school. I bet their houses are clean. I run into them here and there, and they tell me all about it. Some of them were even in school last year. They are learning their ABCs and their numbers and colors and how to play with playdoh and color pictures and use the scissors and glue. And moms are going shopping, and making crafts for the craft fair, and baking and cleaning and calling their friends and going to yoga classes and aerobics classes and pottery classes and knitting classes. I am definitely not in Italy.  And while they are going on, and clucking sympathetically when I say Andy is not in school anymore, I am thinking: Guess what I did Tuesday, instead of sending Andy to school? (Note: they never ask.) I took Andy to the gym, where he played with other boys and girls (so what if most of them weren't his age? Not Andy). Then we went to the pumpkin patch and played with the chickens and llamas and horses and saw baby calves and picked pumpkins. Then we went to lunch at a resteraunt. Andy ordered his lunch and we talked about all the posters on the walls, and practiced using a fork to eat the ketchup (well, at least he ate something...) Then we rested at home a little until we had to go get Joey for speech therapy and OT. We got home tired, but we had FUN!!! And today we went to the park- the kids were all younger again, but Andy didn't mind- and we played ball and collected acorns and Andy went down the slides. There was a spider there, and we talked about spiders and living things and how green and pretty he (she?) was. Then we had McDonald's for lunch, and Andy had speech. He made a spider. He's mastered his first goal (labials)! Now we're resting a little, before I pull out another art project- maybe we'll make a book about fall!  And there is the trade-off. I'll figure out how to make Joey's costume, and the house cleaning will wait for me (it always does).   I'll call Christina. Maybe she can come over here one morning to have chai. I may not be in Italy- but Greece is nice, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/10/changing-plan.html", "title": "\nChanging the plan\n"},

We had our quarterly Special Education Parent's Advisory Committee meeting last night. One of our brave school folks used the evening to put forth a new \"Where are the parents?\" campaign. Precious minutes that could have been spent at the bar where instead wasted with school personnel dragging us into \"what can we do to attract parents?\" I suppose moving the meeting each time to a different school, so parents would be more comfortable, is a good idea. The rest have been tried. Fliers? Done that each year. Phone calls? Been there, done that. Online links? How many times have I been reminded the majority of parents don\u2019t have computers? Yet it remains the same half-dozen folks sitting here at the table. Yes, we'll put out a flier, and I'll spend hours on the phone and we'll send out emails and take out ads in the paper and put ads into the newsletters. We might get a few new faces for a meeting. But at the end of the day- I'm putting my money on having the same half-dozen faces here.  But why I get really annoyed with these campaigns is because there has also been another round of new policies- all of which discourage parent participation. Parents are not permitted at school parties. Functions that were \"parents welcome 'before are now closed. And best of all- this year, siblings are not welcome- not at parties, not at functions, not on field trips, not at meetings. No siblings allowed.  When I was little, younger children often accompanied parent chaperones. Children who are not in daycare have nowhere to go when Mom or Dad is accompanying the older child on a field trip or helping organize the class party. We enjoyed meeting younger siblings (and a few times, I  was  that younger sibling, who got to meet Big Brother's friends!) It was part of the fun, part of the special moment, part of that community-building and socializing that school is supposed to be fostering. Remember \"family values\"?  Now that I'm a mom, who {gasp} has more than one child, the impact of this new policy is more sinister. It is isolating. I get no chance to meet other parents, see how my child does in unusual situations, participate and support his school experience. I have no idea who the other families are. As a special needs parent, I'm already pretty separated from the other families. Now I can't come at all.  Want to know where the parents are? We're raising our kids. And clearly, people who are busy raising kids are not welcome at school, anyway.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/10/no-siblings-allowed.html", "title": "\n\"No Siblings Allowed\"\n"},

{"date": "Monday, October 29, 2007", "body": "\nJoey had a field trip today to a fancier pumpkin patch than the one we go to. I like ours better, but that's for a different day. The point is, he went. Then he came home.  Another incident occurred between field trip and home. The bus had to take a child back to school. Due to increased press about kids being left strange places by buses around here, such as poor  Stimey  experienced, instead of returning to school at the end of the route, the bus drivers now must take the child IMMEDIATELY back to school, then go back on their route. When the bus arrived back at school, apparently Joey got himself out of his seat and started to get off the bus, and had to be re-settled.  When Joey arrived home ten minutes late, he got off the bus and practically ran to the house. I thought it a bit strange, but said goodbye to the driver and followed him. I found him in the living room, his face buried in the couch cushions, absolutely inconsolable.  Thus begins a game of Twenty Questions that breaks the heart. Joey is not good at questions, but without them, I have no way of getting any information. Unfortunately, even if he answers a question, the answer may or may not be accurate, relevant, or even make any sense. It becomes a very strange game of Sherlock Holmes, sifting through the words I get to come up with some clues to what occurred with the child over the day, and to see if any of those occurrences might explain the current behavior. To make things more complicated, any incident he describes or offers may or may not have actually happened to  him ... he can get just as upset about something that happened to a classmate in his presence as something that happens to himself.  The clues I have are that he does not want to be hugged (HIGHLY unusual), something about Andy is not here (Andy was sitting right next to him) and Where is Andy? Something about Mrs. S and Mrs. H (his teachers), the bus, and someone asking him \"Do you understand me?\", a possibility that he almost missed the bus, and he refuses absolutely to discuss the field trip or look at the pumpkin he brought home. He also says he will miss recess, and will miss \"first.\"  My current theory is that he did not get on the bus like he was supposed to, probably to come back from the field trip, and was threatened with either not having recess or some other threat if he did not get on the bus. He did not respond (probably process what was being said to him); perhaps he was asked to get on, then escalated to telling him his teachers were on the bus, to that inane question (\"Do you understand me?\"), to threats of punishment. If he was already upset, such a scene would certainly be traumatizing.  However, I have NO IDEA. I emailed the teachers, but have yet to have a response, so I sit here with no way to untangle these threads, and to try to talk to him about what happened- or didn't happen.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://stimeyland.blogspot.com/2007/09/shaking-with-fury.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/10/tears.html", "title": "\nTears\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 26, 2007", "body": "\n On Wednesday, I introduced you to this image: Joey wearing the hood to the Halloween costume I made for him.  My mom always made our costumes when we were little, and they were things of wonder. I was Bo Beep with apron and calico dress, fluffy with eyelet lace. I was Tinker Bell, in green velvet complete with little zig-zag hem, a re-make from my brother's Peter Pan costume, complete with little Robin Hood style hat. I was a witch with a lined, zig-zag edged cape and dress and little broom. There was the spotted cat costume. There was the ghost costume with two veils, so that I seemed to drift over the night. There was teh Charlie Brown Ghost costume- complete with a drawing of Snoopy as the Red Baron on the back, and all the eyeholes on the front. There was the caterpillar costume that became the flea in teh flea circus (the school has a circus theme one year). My mom could make costumes. I remember them. They were, to me at the very least, works of art; and I still have that little witch cape to prove it.  When we bought the fabric for the Little Bear costume, my life was looking a little different from now. I have no idea where my mom got time to make my costumes, but I do have some memory of her at the sewing machine. My guys see the sewing machine and their whole goal in life is to touch the needle and work the pedal and steal the thread. But it was OK- it was Andy's first day of school, and I would have a few hours a week to myself, and could spare some to make a costume. It turned out to be cheaper to buy one (and I'm sure my mom made ours when we were little partly because it was far cheaper to do so), but I persevered; I would make my child's Halloween costume. As it should be.  There are some images that the American public hold as icons of normalcy. Norman Rockwell life come home to our own peaceful existance, testiments to tranquility, to liberty, to the American Dream. Moms bake cookies. Kids play on bicycles. Dads take out the trash and mow the lawn. Making Halloween costumes is one of those images. There is nothing that says \"peace in life\" than a home=made Halloween costume. Yes, I know most of us don't do it. Like I said, these days, its so much cheaper to buy one. But it's just one of those things. Besides, I come from a long history of a search for normalcy- I grew up with the gifted kids. I actually wrote papers in college about how kids labeled \"gifted\" create subculture based on a search for normalcy- with a skewed sense of what \"normal\" means. I'll blog about that sometime. Back to the topic at hand...  Even with Andy pulled from school, the loss of those few hours (which we have filled with a grand old time, I must say), and the chaos of life as usual, I have persevered yet again, and the costume is made. Its not as beautiful as the costumes my mom made. The front tummy patch is askew. the legs are not of equal length, nor are the sleeves. But it is done, it zips up, and the hood is made.  So I gave Joey the hood the other day, so he would see he was really going to be Little Bear for Halloween. He promptly put it on. When it was time for bed, he melted down when I told him he had to take it off. He \"wanted his Halloween.\" That nightly complaint has changed to \"I want to be Little Bear!\" In the morning, he comes down the stairs and puts it on. He quietly takes it off to go to school. He comes home from school, goes the table, fetches the hood, and puts it on. He wears it all afternoon, and cries when bedtime comes, and it is time to take it off.  When Joey is in his hood, he  is  Little Bear. He loves being Little Bear. It makes him so happy to be Little Bear, and have his brother T-Rex, and relax in his house and have Mom bake him cookies. Before, he just was Little Bear, reminded everyone he was Little Bear, and Andy was T-Rex, and I was Mother Bear, and Janene was Big Bear, and Miss Megan was Medium Bear, and Grandma became Grandmother Bear, and sometimes Andy was Duck. But now... now he has a hood, brown and furry and with ears.  He is Little Bear.  The transformation is complete.  I wonder what he will do when he realizes there is a whole body costume and mittens to go with the hat.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RyHOKhBP1AI/AAAAAAAAANI/JGI1uk9GtJU/s1600-h/joeybear.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/10/hood-mommy-made.html", "title": "\nThe Hood Mommy Made\n"},

But we got the pumpkins carved, and the boys went Trick or Treating pretty early so I could see them in their costumes. I think they were pretty excited. Andy practically ran house-to-house. Joey was just happy to be Little Bear.    Carving the pumpkins is something of an adventure. Andy doesn't like his hands to be icky, but once Joey got home to do his pumpkins, Andy was all about it. Andy preferred the carving. We did a new thing this year, with cookie-cutter like things. You put the cutters on the pumpkin, then beat the crap out of them until they punch through. Needless to say, Andy was in heaven. Joey wasn't so sure, but he loves getting his hands into the pumpkin stuff. Since he usually likes clean hands, too, this love of goo is a real mystery.  Of course, Joey had to wear his Little Bear hood. I think he was pretty pleased to see a whole costume went with it. He even insisted on wearing it during most of the carving festivities. He was pretty pleased with himself.  He insisted on his second pumpkin being a face like a \"real jack-o-lantern!\" so I had him draw out a face, and then he sat and instructed me as to the carving of his jack-o-lantern... triangle eyes, and a round nose, and a mouth just like a plastic light-up jack-o-lantern the boys were playing with. I usually use a lot of stencils to do pumpkins- simple ones. The complicated ones just never turn out nice for me. Simple ones do fabulous.  I wonder what to do now... do I pack the hood away, hoping to wear the costume next year (I had to pin up the legs)? Or do i let him have his Little Bear hood that makes him so happy, and hope it survives a year of use (and abuse)? Or do I race out to the shop, and try to get another round of fabric to make a new hood for next year? I have the feeling I will be in the fabric store in the morning... Just as Joey got to be Little Bear, Andy got to be T-Rex. Anything Andy thinks is scary or unknown, especially things with bones, is a \"dinosaur\" right now. There were some scary decorations up at the gym, and he was fine with them, as long as they were dinosaurs. I didn't disillusion him.  Yes, one Little Bear and one T-Rex.

Each week is a different theme. They do crafts, read stories, sing songs, and talk about the different topics. This week was dinosaurs- so Andy was in seventh heaven. He got a new cardboard dinosaur mask, so he's a very happy boy.  It was also interesting for me. For one, I got to see a few more parents who have kids who are not in preschool- at least not on Thursdays. For two, I got to see Andy in action with other kids his age. He did perfectly. He wasn't the best kid, but he did just fine- he sat on the tape line when asked. He talked about his dinosaurs when asked to. He waited as well as everybody else (which, granted, wasn't perfect- but then, they were 3 and 4 years old!) He only had a little trouble when he asked for a T-Rex and got a Pteradactyl instead; but someone who wanted the pteradactyl traded, so that worked out. The teacher kept the lights down, which I think helped a lot. He didn't get flustered with all the kids, he did the coloring and rubbings, and otherwise had a fabulous time- like all the other kids. It was fantastic! Joey would have loved it, too. He can do all of those things- sit in a circle, listen to a story, color... maybe not perfectly, but then, no one was doing it perfectly. He might not be able to answer questions about his dinosaur, but he would have grinned and charmed everyone anyway- and had a great time. I knw he has fun at school, but I do miss that boy.  Today is Friday- Joey's afternoon off. I'm considering all the things I could do with him. Theymight all be for naught, because my car is in the shop and I might have to disturb the afternoon to go get it, but still... a few hours with both my boys! Should we make playdough? Or pumpkin bread? Or maybe go to Chuck E. Cheese? Or perhaps head out to Wakefield for a little fall stroll? We've been out to Snead's alot, so perhaps something different. Maybe make turkey decorations? Or go to Grandma's and have a nature walk? I could make a fire in teh fireplace, and have them toast marshmallows? Or we could wander over to Aunt Christina's and visit Max and Charlie and Jack? Or go to the playground? We could get out the paints and markers and glue and have an art show. We cold go outside and relax in the sandbox. Perhaps we should start getting into the holiday swing and make a gingerbread house? Maybe we could go shopping and look a the Christimas stuff that's (already!) out? Perhaps we should stick to making pilgrim puppets and cornucopia pictures?  What is the best way to hug my boys and smooch on them and let them have a fabulous time?  Another afternoon where cleaning the house is put off for more important things...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/11/missing-boy.html", "title": "\nMissing the Boy\n"},

The stuff in teh front of the house- built in 1929- gives us little trouble. Stuff in teh addition- circa 1983 downstairs and circa 1994 upstairs- is a mess. I mean a  mess . This week its the shower. I think they must have tried to do the tiling themselves. Now we're trying to decide whether to just get a liner and seal the trashwork in, with the assumption that we will be ripping out most of this part of the house in about three to five years, or to do real repairs.  In anticipation of the grand event, we need to shut down teh use of our shower, and use the boy's bathroom. The caulk around the tub was cracking, so if it was about to be heavily used for showers instead of baths, it was time to re-caulk- or face another fun-filled bathroom problem. So I got out my handy-dandy scraper, got the old caulk off, put some fresh caulk down (new caulk is really wild stuff- far less conspicuous than the old stuff. Or I'm doing something really, really wrong.) The new caulk requires 36 hours to cure before exposing to moisture.  It went on so beautifully that it is (clearly) making me a little uncomfortable. So I checked it again this morning, and redid any spots that looked like they might be dodgy. We already had one night of no bathing the boys- two in a row won't do. We need a bathing solution.  That appears to be taking Indian-style showers in our bathroom. You know, the one we're supposed to be shutting down. :P  Now imagine this: two boys. Water in a bucket. Soap.  Am I the only one who foresees two small, naked, wet, soapy bodies hurtling through the upstairs with squeals of glee?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/11/caulk.html", "title": "\nCaulk\n"},

JOey came home from school today absolutely exhausted. I don't know what they di dto the child, but he is  tired . Oh, and he had four worksheets to do. Oh, and an assignment to look for things that begin with C. Oh, and we have to do tomorrow;s homework tonight, because tomorrow we have double therapies, one in the Stafford clinic. And we had the drum lesson tonight.  Something was amiss with the toy he decided to play with, and we could  not  get him distracted from it. Meltdown city. Then we had to do that homework and go to music lesson... yes indeed. One tired boy + way too much to do= not a good thing.  He banged on the drums pretty good. Mr. Shelby wanted him to tap the high hat with his right hand on eighth note counts and the snare with the left on alternate counts. OK, for those of you not familiar with drumming, this would require him to cross his hands, and do two different rhythms with each hand. That lasted all of about two seconds. For one, Joey hates crossing his hands, and dislikes crossing midline. Then trying to get those hand to do two different things? At the same time? Riiiiiiiiiiight.  Of course, that's why I have him in drum lessons. Bilateral coordination and processing and all that. But remember, he was tired before we even got there.  And I had no gum with me, becuase I am an  idiot. These are the kinds of afternoons that remind me not to take good days for granted. Don't forget the emergency sensory support kit. Stay on my toes, because you never know, and trying to get clues about what is going on from Joey when he's having a crazy day is like trying to get a cat to read braille.

The most common form of systemic poison ivy is when you breathe in smoke from a brush fire, the oil gets into the bloodstream, and you have a major breakout EVERYWHERE. I had a firend when i was little actually get poisin ivy INSIDE his mouth and throat, and they think it was even in his stomach. I don't get this kind. You can also get it from being allergic to the substances your body makes in the reaction. My mom gets this- her poison ivy can get so bad that you can jus sit and watch the patches bubble and ooze before your eyes, like some Martian landscape. I don't get that, either (thank GOD).  I get the kind that once I start seeing it anywhere, it starts to pop up as a bubble here, a bubble there, all over my body for the next few months. It is highly annoying.  My yearly poison ivy has begun. I get it this time of year because I am hacking down the autumn clematis, and invariably the ivy gets in it, and somewhere I have an inch of skin uncovered. Only this year I was particularly stupid, and didn't put on my gloves to take down the clematis. So naturally I got angry red welts across the back of my hand. Now it's startd the spreading stage. Its moving up my fingers, and I have single bubbles here... there... yep. The itching has begun.  Too much of my life is like that. Consequences you can do nothing about now, popping up here. There. It all becomes systemic, in a delicate system. But then, sometimes I think, at least I don't get poison ivy like Steve used to. Or my mom. Just an annoyig bubble or two, here and there.

When Joey came home and Andy awakened from his nap (wow... he took a nap!), we (Grandma and I) loaded them both into the car, and headed for the shop. We spent some time explaining about going Christmas shopping and that sort of thing, the usual banter to prepare Joey for an unexpected outing, especially on a Friday (his afternoon off, when he prefers to stretch out on the livingroom floor and watch something preferred, such as  Little Bear  or  Cars .) We've been having some trouble with Joey. He's been eching some phrases that have resulted in us emailing the teachers several times to ask what's happening at school- phreases like, \"Stop talking now!\" and \"Eat your breakfast and leave!\" and \"You're going to Mrs. T!\" [this is a reference to being sent to the principal's office]. This week, he's been parroting these things at the bus aide, who was rather upset this morning, to the point I had to remind Joey to be respectful and behave himself on the bus. Joey loves the bus. What's going on? Anyway, theres been a lot of echoing, a lot of motor-mouth lately, and now we're disturbing his schedule again to get 20% off of a bunch of stuff we don't need and possibly polish off my Christmas shopping list.  From the back seat, a musical little voice wafted:  \"Where are we going?\"  I automatically replied, \"Down to the shop, hon.\"  Fortunately, we stopped at a stop sign. I looked at Grandma. Grandma looked a me.  Joey asked us a question.  There was no prompts, no cajoling, no setting up. It was a question, like any other five-year-old suddenly whisked from his house into the car and heading down the street. Where are we going? Perfectly natural question, especially if you weren;t really paying attention to teh jabber of your mom, talking about Christmas and stuff. Oh, we're going to the shop. OK. He was satisfied.

{"date": "Wednesday, November 14, 2007", "body": "\nAs the bus pulled off this morning, I had myself a nice little cry.  I've been sending Joey to school now for three years, this is his fourth. Oct 12, 2004. that was his first day of school. My little two-year-old baby, placed on a big yellow bus to whisk him off into the unknown. Without me.  Folks who read  Tibetan Star's Aspie Home-Education  know that I am a supporter of schooling. Actually, I'd like to correct that. I believe in individualized education. For  everyone . And I believe that education occurs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so most parents need to remember to be vigilant about educating their child, and what thir child is learning, all of the time. Most of the parents who communicate with me through this blog seem to be doig a  very  fine job with this. Some folks send their kids to residential schools. Some keep them home. Most mix the school- public or private- and home schooling, with a generous peppering of therapies and activities. We've become experts at individualized education. After all, the laws for our kids require it. We know they have a right to it, and it is our responsibility to preserve their rights.  One of the main advantages I see to school is that Joey learns independence. When at home, if Mom will do it for him and he knows it, he wont do it. Note the period. If I want him to learn to do something independently at home, I put Allan in charge of it. Allan is good at not letting Joey get away with letting others do things for him.  You can pull up your own pants, Boy; let's see you do it! [pause] Good job! Allan taught him to drink from a cup. Allan taught him to dress himself. Allan is teaching him to bathe himself, and take a shower. He's a good teacher.  I miss my Joey. I miss having that little face with me, wandering through Tuesday Morning, leaning close together. I miss taking him to the farm, to the zoo, having him all to myself to show him the world at his own pace.  Don't get me wrong, I love my Andy. He's a good little buddy, and he's growing up with lightning speed. He loves seeing the world, too. He loves leaning against Mom while riding in the cart. He loves to look at the fish at Walmart. He loves to chase the chickens at Snead's. He loves to point to things and let me know what is around him. I'm more and more glad that we pulled him out of that preschool every day, because he's so much fun.  But I miss my Joey. We don't have a lot of minutes together, just us. In fact, we go to church for half an hour on Saturday evenings- and otherwise, I always have Andy, too. Andy's pace is so different from Joey's that we can't just slow down and let Joey process and look and do what he needs to do. I have to keep them together.  When Andy does finally go to preschool (and he will, because he has to have some experience at school to be successful in kindergarten these days), I may pull Joey for a couple of mornings. I'm planning little wanderings together. I trip to the farm. A wandering over to the park. Maybe a morning, just us, baking cookies or making playdoh or doing a craft. It won't be as easy as doing these things with Andy, but that would be part of the fun. Seeing Joey take things in his own way, at his own pace.

I got the shower re-caulked and a new showerhead, but the showerhead isn't installed. Andy is hoarding again. But it's okay. Evan is coming.  Families are funny things. Families usually have two parts- the part that you were born with, and the part that appears over time. Folks who don't get the whole humanity thing forget about the second part of the family (often while complaining bitterly about the first part). They see them as outsiders, keep them at arm's length, forget to let them in and enjoy them. More and more and more people I meet are like that- there is an isolation of humanity in today's culture. We have become so focused on nuclear \"family\" that the rest of it drops into a grey abyss, our children not given the skills and understanding to expand their families and relish them. After all, all families are strange. They are full of people. People are here to be loved. Too many folks now expect people to meet certain ideas and expectations before they will even acknowledge the other person's existence, much less refer to the person as a \"friend.\" Instead of taking people as they are, and start from there, and see what happens, they automatically exclude everyone until proven otherwise. Safer? Maybe. But you miss out on a lot of family.  Joey loves the world and the world loves Joey. People like to be accepted, no strings attached. Joey has a knack for that. \"Hi, Friend!\" he cheerfully calls to all and sundry. You're invited- you\u2019re a friend until proven otherwise. Andy doesn't have this talent. He's far more of a question first, be friends if the answers are OK kind of guy.  Anyway, Thanksgiving is one of those family holiday things. People's families get together and celebrate being on the earth and get to have some time to just hang out and enjoy each other. We can appreciate Aunt Susie's love of carrot cake, the lopsided way Cousin Johnnie smiles, take joy in Grandpa's old war stories and Grandma's taste in clothes. We can pick up on the little clues that speak to who we are.  When we grow up, and go out to make our own little nuclear units, holidays are great times to remember the rest of our families. Those brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and cousins who may not share our bloodlines, but remain our families. Those connections to humanity that remind us that we're all in this together, we might as well enjoy each other for this brief shining moment.  Evan is coming. Christmas is upon us.

{"date": "Sunday, November 18, 2007", "body": "\n One of the other parents in our school district wrote an  editorial  in our local paper, and I thought I'd comment here, maybe a first draft of a response.  First, I'd like to be clear that I have mixed feelings about the author of the editorial, and I do know her son, but have not seen him in over a year. My feelings are mixed because I have great admiration for her ability and energy to fight for her son. However, this is a case where this lady got what she wanted at everyone else's expense; her battle casualities included the best preschool teaher I have met, and being on the preschool circuit for three years, I met quite a few- and certainly this lady was the best teacher we had in that preschool. On top of that, clearly we disagree about how to deal with autism. She has a clear agenda for what to do; I, as usual, believe in individualization.  I'll start at the beginning.. the scenario of devastation as the screening comes back \"on the spectrum.\" I am all about fighting this right here. I understand the feeling of devastation. I also know the root of that pain is ignorance. When a child is diagnosed autistic, arents are caught unprepared. It may be the first time they had ever heard the word \"autism.\" They know nothing about it. Until you are in the world of special ed, you have no idea what it is, or who is in it. Our culture values the \"beautiful people\", and anyone not fitting this mainstream idea of \"normal\" is cast aside one way or another. Your child is diagnosed with autism, and all you know is you have a long road ahead of you, and have no idea where that road is going.  I started this blog to chip away from the panic. I think the editorial was Gleibys' way of trying to chip away at the panic. There should not be any reason to panic. At least for once, we have the same goal in mind. Get past fear by making it something not completely unknown.  And the next step is, I believe worthy. You are doctor just informing a parent that Little Johnny is autistic. When this happened for us, the doctor gave us a book that we discovered was well out of date, the phone number for his nurse, and advice to call the school. Needless to say, this was woefully inadequate.  So here is my Quick Guide for Parents for the Day After Diagnosis:  (The Day Of Diagnosis, just go home and enjoy your child. Maybe put a fresh pot of coffee on, or take up drinking coffee.) 1. Here are the people to call:         Local Autism clinic , if you didn't get get the diagnosis there. Here, that would both Kluge Children's Rehab and Kennedy Krieger. Some centers, like Kennedy Krieger, take a year to get an appointment for anything. Kluge takes a couple of months. A year is a little long, but a couple of months is OK. This is urgent, but not an emergency. Besides, you have other folks to call and get going.          The local school district . Many of teh supports your child needs are the responsibility of your local school district. You want to get a feel for the place, have an eval, get into the system- even if you decide to homeschool.          Your insurance . KNow what they will cover, and what they will not. Many insurances will cover OT without batting an eye, but will not cover speech therapy because it is \"educational.\" Some insurance see \"autism\" and cover NOTHING. Some see it and cover EVERYTHING. Some therapies are considered educational and not medical- and this can be different from insurance to insurance, state to state. You may choose interventions that are not covered, and you need to know what you will be paying for, how much it will be, and what you will need to do to cover it.          The speech pathologist . Some centers have them, some local hospitals have them, and there are lots of private practice ones. Be sure they are going to work on communication, not just speech. Do they do sign language, switches, PECS? How do they use these as tools for communication, and not just learning to speak? How do they use them to encourage- but not force- speech? Do they also work with reading and other visual communication?          The physical therapist.  Many autistic kids have gross motor problems that need to be addressed. Many don't need a PT (Joey doesn't need a PT).          The occupational therapist.  Ask specifically about sensory integration therapies. Most autistic kids have some form of SPD (though not all!). You don't want just a buttons and zippers OT, you want one that will take an integrated approach and can address the needs of your child.         Your pediatrician.  Be sure they are immediately aware. Ask questions. What will they do for you? What do they know abotu autism? Are they willing to do some research or attend a conference or workshop about autism? If you have a doctor who seems ignorant of autism- and many are-  and  is unwiling to beome educated, then you will be needing a new ped.          Psychologist.  You may need some testing done in ways the school doesn't accomodate, some understanding of your child's mental health, and yes, you may need medications. Be prepared.          Your local Disability Resource Center.  These types of organizations can help you navigate local resources, prepare for things like Medicaid Waivers, even help you understand disability law and rights. They can also help you network with other parents of disabled children.           State agencies for the disabled.  Many states have offices specifically geared to helping people with disabilities and protect their rights. Its a good idea to be familiar with these offices and what they actually do in your state or locality.          A Lawyer.   You're about to become an expert in disability law. School districts and insurance agencies can be not fun to work with. Be prepared. Find a lawyer and advocate who deal in disability and educational law. BE prepared in case you run into problems- its a lot easier to prepare for a fight if you already have your champion lined up, rather than waiting until you have a problem. I haven't met a parent yet who didn't have a problem.  I know that is a lot of phone calls. Prepare ahead of time- get a big loose-leaf notebook to keep paperwork, evaluations, even phone messages in. Just keep it by date; when you make a call, note it on a sheet with the date and a summary of what was discussed, and put it in the notebook. When the evals come, just put them in the notebook. Bills. Letters. IEPs. Anything. I even have Joey's birth certificate at the front. I'm on our second 3\" binder.  2. Here are things you need to do:        Relax.  Your child hasn't changed. You just have a new label to point you to resources you might need.       Read.   The books I recommend are:  From Emotions to Advocacy  by Pete Wright.                         1001 Great Ideas For Teaching and Raising Children with Autism  by Zysk and Notbohm.  That will give you a start. I encourage folks to include their favorite resources in the comments.         Read some more.  You will need to research different methods and strategies used with autistic children. Some I can think off the top of my head are ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis), PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System), Floor Time, Sensory Integration, Therapeutic Listening, GFCF (Gluten free/Casein free diets) {and other possible allergies and diets- if your kid has sensory issues, allergies can drive them crazy!], ABLLS (Asessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills), TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication-disabled[or handicapped] Children).         Get online.  Check out the links I have in the sidebar. I've developed a handout for new parents here in Virginia, I'll be happy to email it to you. Also, you can network with more great folks like us. :)         Go out and have some fun!  Remember, your child hasn't changed! Go out and do the stuff your child likes to do! Try to introduce your child to new experiences- as you would any child! These outings may take more preparation(and work) than for non-autistic families, but it's worth it. Keeping kids locked in the house will drive you crazy, too, and deny them living. Yes, some folks will stare. You may get unkind comments, or offensive comments. But you know what? You would have gotten them even if you didn't know about autism. Now you know how to support your child in the face of these people- \"My kid's doing a great job with this new experience. What's  your  problem?\" Summary? You now know your child is autistic. Now you have a better plan for moving ahead and educating your child- which now makes your life better, not worse. Yes, now that you know the kinds of resources you need, you now have work to do to tap those resources- but now you have narrowed the field to the resources you may need! See? Not scary. Just needs a little information!.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R0GY0pvFU-I/AAAAAAAAAQI/Ojf62MYivXU/s1600-h/DP.jpg", "http://www.fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2007/112007/11182007/331511/index_html?page=1", "http://www.amazon.com/Wrightslaw-Emotions-Advocacy-Education-Survival/dp/1892320096/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195479511&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Raising-Children-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/1932565191/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195479580&sr=1-2"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/11/other-parents.html", "title": "\nOther parents\n"},

He has several friends who help with this. Snail is one of Franklin's best friends, and often share in interesting adventures.  Why Snail? Because Snail needs help with some things. He's slow, so he needs a ride to the bus stop or home. He can't be a hider in hide and seek because he'd take too long to hide. He cheers at teh soccer games because he doesn't have feet and can't run.  But best of all, he is never referred to as disabled, handicapped, or otherwise labeled. It's simply part of who he is- he's Snail. He's a snail. It's just the way it is.  I liked best how it was discussed in the episode \"Nature Walk\"- snail just has his own snail way of doing things. He's been a snail all his life- he's pretty good at it by now.  May that someday be the attitude towards all people. They are the way they are.

{"date": "Sunday, December 09, 2007", "body": "\n I have a special fondness for Saint Lucia. I know that according to the canonical calendar, her feast day is December 13, but the old tradition places her on Solstice. She lights the way through the world's midnight to bring us into spring.  Advent candles are something I have less affinity for, more because I am unfamiliar with them than anything else. They are a new-fangled event in the Methodist world, brought in to appeal to folks more familiar with other sects and a heavier dose of ritual than I was brought up with. However, light is light. When we were asked to light the advent candle this week, I didn't pass on the opportunity to bring some light into the world. I never miss a chance to think of Saint Lucy.  Some folks are probably irked to find pagan ritual, symbol, and tradition in Christian traditions. It never bothers me a bit. In fact, it speaks to me of some of the basics of my faith: God made everything. Because God made everything, I like to try to represent everything in my celebrations of the life God has given to me. That certainly includes Christmas. Christmas at my house just bursts with the world God has gifted us, no strings attached. You don't even have to believe in Him. Here it is. Enjoy.  So the connection with Saint Lucia to pagan ideas of Brigit, to the Solstice, to traditions of light far older than the Christ, doesn't bother me one wit. God made them, too. Besides, God made me on Solstice, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R1yPMlx0ttI/AAAAAAAAASA/Dl9EhTPW4F0/s1600-h/02_joey_lighting2.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R1yPM1x0tuI/AAAAAAAAASI/b5ceASFVRwA/s1600-h/02_andy_lighting3.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R1yPM1x0tvI/AAAAAAAAASQ/-31htyUOx1U/s1600-h/02_joey_reading2.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/12/lighting-way.html", "title": "\nLighting the Way\n"},

I know people who can clean their house in about an hour, complete with scrubbing the bathrooms. In about an hour, i can often (but not always) clear a path from my front door to the kitchen. It seems very strange to have tables, buffets, servers, and other assorted surfaces cleared and cleaned. I'll feel better when the decorations clutter everything up again.  Joey decided today he wants Santa to bring him a bike. With training wheels. Thanks, Franklin. He saw some in the toy store, and when we told him he would have to ask Santa for it, he demanded to see Santa that instant. Of course, the toy store did not have a Santa there. I have no idea where he would ride said bike. I have no idea how I would afford said bike. But I think I need to go bike shopping.  Andy wanted to have a slumber party with Mommy and Daddy this evening. He would have let me sing Christmas carols to him all night if I wanted. Then he came in to snuggle in our room for a while. Then he wanted more songs. Anything not to sleep.  The excitment is also partly the blame of the trains. We took them to see the trains at Watson's and Stebbins, an dtoday we went to a local show. The local show was not nearly as good, and cost money to get in, but they were excited anyway. Joey almost had a meltdown because we wouldn't let him touch the tracks or the little buildings or the cars or the trains, and there were lots of people and some kids had balloons and it was just very exciting.

Here's the meme:  1) Link to the person that tagged you, and post the rules on your blog. 2) Share 7 facts about yourself. 3) Tag 7 random people at the end of your post, and include links to their blogs. 4) Let each person know that they have been tagged by leaving a comment on their blog. So here it is:  1. Once upon a time when I was young, I played the baritone. Actually, I played the  euphonium , but most folks don't know what that is. In fact, an awful lot of folks have no idea what a baritone is, either. But I loved it, and wish I still played it. I also played the flute and the valve trombone (that not the one with the slide; it looks kinda like an oversized trumpet, and is used for some marching bands, so you don't whack folks in the head with a slide).  2. I collect Christmas ornaments. I have both a silver collection and a blown glass collection, seperate from the rest of the tree ornaments. I display them in garlands over the doors. Keeps little finger and little kitty paws off them.  3. I like bleu cheese, sauerkraut, and winter squash. I liked none of these things when I was young. My parents still do not believe I eat them.  4. My ideal evening right now would be to curl up on the couch with a fire in teh fireplace, and with a fresca, a bowl of mint ice cream, and three boys, watching five different versions of  A Christmas Carol . Usually, I would want to be watching either  Buckaroo Bonzai Across the Eighth Dimension, Time Bandits , and  Life With Father  followed by the entire extended- version  Lord of the Rings.  I dislike watching new movies, especially in theaters. I tedn to get very high fevers. My favorite version of  A Christmas Carol  is the 1934  Scrooge  with Sir Seymour Hicks, closely followed by Patrick Stewart (1999), George C. Scott (1984) and the Muppets (1992). I strongly dislike the Alastair Sim versions, which will get me hatemail, but you wanted facts.  5. I adore  Jane Eyre . I dislike  Wuthering Heights . This will also win me hatemail, but I just don't get a \"love\" story where a bitch and a bastard can't get it together and destroy all the lives around them in the process. That's not love, people. That's being selfish jerks. (Did I mention that I'm feeling grumpy?) Jane sticks to her principles of right and wrong and creates her own happiness. Much more satisfactory. 6. When I was little, I always wanted my own goat. So when I got a little older, my folks got me goats. I miss my goats, though I have no idea how I would find time to care for one now. When I went to college, my poor mom had to take care of them for me. She's really good with animals.  7. I taught myself to knit in three hours. I arrived for my GD test for Andy with a kit and instruction sheet, and left with five inches of scarf. The nurses were in hysterics when they realized what I was doing. But hey, when youre going to be sitting somewhere for three hours, what would  you  do? With Joey, I did needlepoint kits. I had to do two three-hour tests with him. The nurses at the lab thought that was funny, too (who's ever heard of having to take TWO?) I'd tag, but this time of the year, who has time? So if you'd like to join in the fun, please do; or store it for later, when you're not in the midst of holiday craziness.  I hear Andy stirring.

Then he discovered what he wanted was a  bike . A real two-wheeler, with training wheels, please. Yes, that's what he wants. A bike.  My baby is growing up.  But anyway, in order for Santa to bring said bike, Mommy had to go out and purchase said bike. Fortunately, Toys R Us is openuntil midnight this weekend. I'm not a big fan of Toys R Us. When I was young, it was great- a warehouse deal of toys that were cheap and simple, the haven of  Star Wars  figures. Now its an expensive place to get toys, and all they have are toys where the company I believe pays them to basically rent the space to display their merchandise- the higher fee you pay, the more prominent spot your toy gets. Variety? Gone. Everything marketed, splashed with TV characters or packaged more for Mom and Dad than for little Johnny or Janey. And service? what's that?  So I wasn't really surprised when I waited half an hour just to get someone to come help me with choosing the correct size for the bike. I've picked out a nice red one. There was a beautiful green Schwinn, but too pricey. He's probably going to need a new one next Christmas, anyway, so no point shelling out the big bucks just to get it green. Red is good for a first Christmas bike. A shiny, red bike. With training wheels.  So I pay for it, and pay for them to assemble it. See, that's the advantage of Toys R Us. Our Walmart don't assemble.  The cashier takes my name and number, and says someone will call when it's ready, but be sure to pick it up tomorrow or it goes off hold. (That would be today). OK, no problem.  Except that no-one called.  So I call and ask what is going on, if there is a hold up or a problem or something, and I get told that they don't take names and numbers unless there is a problem, and he doesn't see a bike with my name on it back there anywhere... and he finally got snippy with me and told me (in that snap-snap sort of way) that if I showed up with my receipt, he's find my bike. Click.  I don't like being hung up on.  So off to teh toy store I go, and present the receipt with a brief explanation of the snap-snap attitude problem.

{"date": "Friday, December 28, 2007", "body": "\nWith two boys in tow, one must find new adventures- or old reliable ones. So after lunch today, we drove out to  Wakefield - mostly on a lark, just to drive somewhere. Nice, comfortable adventure, to see sheep and geese. Yes, indeed.  The sheep were out when we walked up the path, even the ram. I worried about the ram being out, so I didn't let the kids get too close to the sheep; they sat right down and giggled at them from a few paces distance. Then over by the Blacksmith building, I could make out a big tom turkey! The fox problem must be solved- new coops! The turkey was in the usual circuit to the pig pens, through the gate to the tobacco garden, then another gate back into the walnut trees and back to the center. Well, he was just off it, so I warned the guys to keep distance, and we were on our way to gobble at the turkey.  Never gobble at a free-ranging turkey.  Suddenly four turkey hens came racing out of the blacksmith shop towards us (the ranger later said they probably thought we had food). We stopped where we were, because turkeys are pretty big, and I didn't want the kids to be bitten. But suddenly, the tom came running- right at Andy! We turned to run, and the turkey leapt up on poor Andy!  You know, if a turkey comes running at us, I really don't mind turning and moving away, which is what we started to do. But jumping on my kid with big talons is  not cool. I think he chose Andy because Andy was wearing a santa hat, and he may have mistaken it him for another turkey. I swept the hat from the child's head, and told him to run as the turkey turned and leapt upon Joey. Mind you, that damn bird was as big as Joey when his wings came out. Joey backed off and I got between the boys and the turkey, and they kept coming at us, finally getting around me to jump on poor Andy again. I smacked the turkey with the hat to get him to back off. I finally told the guys to \"keep moving\", and off towards the gate and the pigpens they trotted.  I fended the thing off, and caught up to the guys in front of the pens; everybody was OK. Then... from behind came the harrowing sound of gobble-gobble-gobble, and the turkeys were charging again! I got the guys through the gate, and beat off the birds, then turned to catch up with the guys, who were halfway to the second gate and the walnut trees.  Turning around is apparently a bad idea when one is battling turkeys. Here they came, making a ruckus. I turned back around fast and smacked him with the hat again, and gave my own battle cry. The tom backed down and strutted towards teh first gate with his harem milling around him. The guys had stopped to watch; I called to them to keep moving. They got through the gate, and I had to run to try to keep them in sight. I looked around and realized another family had been watching our battle from across the fields. We called to them to stay away from the turkeys.  But those turkeys weren't done. I got the guys gathered and hugged... they wanted to go back and look at the sheep, but I wasn't about to run the turkey gauntlet again- when here those damn birds came  again . The boys ran. I fended them off with the hat, then chased them into a little side lane, and I guess they finally decided I meant business. I managed to get the boys turkey-free to the center. We recounted our adventure to the ranger, who promised to lock the monster up. So you guys can have fun imaging me slashing through the air, wielding a santa hat like a red fluffy sword, fending off the ugly blue mug of a tom turkey, gobbling his fiercest.  Merry Christmas.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R3WFOf42nvI/AAAAAAAAAVw/TQlhnqZFP1Q/s1600-h/turkeys.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R3WFOP42nuI/AAAAAAAAAVo/e1geqLuMKUs/s1600-h/turkey.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/12/big-turkey-adventure.html", "title": "\nThe Big Turkey Adventure\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, December 30, 2007", "body": "\nJoey has been having a few rough days. I suppose i ought to put quotes around \"rough\" because it is sometimes hard to tell if he thinks the day is going fine or not. Perhaps it would be more accurate to just say he's been spending a lot of time spinning, watching things spin, asking for fans to be turned on, tracking, and clearing his usual circuits so he can follow them systematically. He's also enamoured with the pin ball games witht eh flashing lights and flippers and music that Santa brought him. On the other hand, he's been playing happily, smiling, laughing, and playing with his brother. Being as unique as everybody else, trying to decipher Joey's actions and communication can sometimes be... well, unique.  Anyway, he's spinny-tracky. Perfectly understandable- no real schedule, the house stuffed full of strange sparkly things, new toys, and unusual foods. And this week, we do it all again. I'm getting off track again. The point is, I can understand him having some stimmy days in the midst of chaos. Today was particularly stimmy. Spin, spin, spin. Took him out to Grandma;s, and he carefully removed all the furniture and rubbish and whatnot from his usual circuit along her persian carpet, then tracked it for a good ten minutes striaght, then kept returning to it. We gave up and took the boys out to eat.  Where he promptly pulled himself together perfectly, and had a perfectly normal conversation with the waitress. Her: Did you have a nice Christmas?  Joey: Yes.  Her: What did Santa bring you? What did you get? What was your favorite present? [In quick succession... folks need to remember to give any child an extra heartbeat to answer; and she didn't know Joey is autistic] Joey: (pause.) A bike. Ride a bike.  Her: Wow, a bike! Joey: How was your Christmas?  At this point, Grandma and I start search for the teeth that bropped out of our mouths when our jaws hit the floor.  In the meantime, Andy is also having a bad stretch, and I can definitely say that these are \"bad days.\" Cranky, whiney, can't-sit-still days. So while this conversation is unfolding, we have a T-Rex growling and stomping around the other side of the table- the only reason he's not doing this all over the restaurant is because Mommy and Grandma and Waitress are corraling him whilst bribing him with dinosaur coloring sheets and red crayons. Grandma noticed that he can't seem to articulate what is bothering him- and being who we are, now we're worried. Even if its sensory, we'd think he's have some kind of language to sommunicate the problem, even if its \"hurts\" or \"feels weird.\" But all he can say is \"yes\" when we ask (in several different formats) if there is something wrong that is keeping him from sitting down. Ack! Ack! Ack!  The waitress got very confused when she returned to find us in tears and hugging both boys, so we of course had to explain that Joey doesn't ask questions and have conversations, especially with strangers; and the other one needed more deep pressure to try to calm him down. I think the waitress felt honored to have been graced with Joey's attention, which continued in starts and stops for teh rest of the meal.  And hey, they both ate.  Victories and challenges, all at once. That's my life. How's yours?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/12/day-and-night.html", "title": "\nDay and Night\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 06, 2008", "body": "\nAs I prepare to take my kids out to lunch with my aunt and uncle and cousins, I have noticed the internet seems very chattery about the place of children in public, particularly in eating establishments.  Disney's Victoria and Albert's has decided to ban children  to much applause from folks who do not have children.  An English pub chain is limiting parent drinks - alcoholic or otherwise- to limit the time children are in the facility. Where is it appropriate to bring children? How does one teach a child how to behave in public if they are not welcome in public?  I will admit these seem to me to be two different issues. Disney World is a park designed for children, and marketed to adults for childhood nostalgia. It seems a perfect opportunity to help train children how to behave in an upscale environment (after all, if you don't want kids, there is a whole section of DisneyWorld reserved for adults only). English pubs, from what I remember of being in them, are a bit different. Many are more like local bars, others are more comparable to an American Ruby Tuesday or Outback Steakhouse; where it is a restaurant with a bar area.  But the sticky issue is really what to do about children in public, and the various parenting styles we may not agree with. I certainly don't let my kids run wild through restaurants, but they do stand and wiggle, and I remember as a young child going on \"adventures\" where my brother and I would wander around the room and look at things like fish tanks, wall decorations, and cozy corners behind my mom's chair. People who think children should sit quietly in the chair for an hour and say nothing are just fooling themselves. But should they ban my child from the restaurant? I see no reason to limit non-alcoholic drinks served to a parent, no matter where they are. If families are not welcome in your pub, put out the \"adults only\" sign and be done. And if my business is too important to do that, why insult me by saying I can't have another drink if I want it?  I find screaming children running wild as annoying as anyone else, but how will children learn to behave in a restaurant if they are banned from them? Sounds like we're asking for more of those annoying, rude adults we see who can't use inside voices to speak to their companions, chat on their cellphones, are rude to waitstaff, and otherwise can't seem to behave in public.  On the other hand, there is value to a quiet dining experience. Funny, when I want to go out without kids, I wait until the kids are in bed to go out. But why should people who have chosen to not have children have to plan their lives around children?  So I'm all for adult-only establishments, as long as they understand they will not be getting my money. If you don't want kids in your pub, say \"no children.\" If you don't want kids in your restaurant, don't build it in the middle of a kids' theme park.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/World/2008/01/06/4755066-sun.html", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7170939.stm"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/01/children-in-restaurants.html", "title": "\nChildren in restaurants\n"},

For those of you who like \"Cracker Barrel\", please note we do not. I don't know if this was a national problem, but around here there was a mighty scandal about how the local restaurants fired people if there was even a  rumour  of them being gay, and we are just not happy with giving a place like that money. They also have a bad track record around here of serving anyone who is not white and of... you guessed it... throwing children out. Sorry, I just don't see \"Cracker Barrel\" as an \"adult\" establishment, especially when they have signs all over the place proclaiming themselves to be \"family-friendly\" (and that's the excuse they gave for their blatant discrimination: We're a family place!\") That's right- shock of shocks. Places that call themselves \"family\" restaurants are places where I believe people should  expect  to find children eating. Never forget: Disney advertises itself as a  family  destination- even it's posh hotel. So be prepared to go there and find  families .  Back to our adventure. So we cheerfully left the Cracker Barrel under the scowls of the hostess taking names after telling her not to bother putting down ours (lady, you just told us that these four kids would have to wait an  hour  to eat lunch, and then were shocked we didn't stay when this town is  full  of restaurants? You've got to be  kidding  me. But now we have \"rudeness and poor attitude\" to add to our litany of reasons not to go there), and took them instead to one of our favorite places, George's Pizza.  And it was a delightful time had by all.  The kids grabbed a table by the window, and Joey and Andy were having such a good time with their cousins that I didn't have to actually sit at that table, we happily and comfortably sat with the adults at the next table- though admittedly, I selected the chair next to the boys, because you never know when supervision needs to be tightened. No one ran around. There were no screams, no throwing of items, nothing that disturbed anyone. The one other party who was there left without incident or disturbance about halfway through our meal, having enjoyed theirs- even with our kids giggling together and eating their meals. Joey had a mouthful of pizza, but still doesn't like tomato. Andy actually sat on his chair to eat his salad and some pizza. The cousins enjoyed the fresh audience for their latest jokes. Both of my guys laughed themselves silly.  A big difference from Joey being told to \"go away\" by his classmates, or the idea of limiting the time a family can be in a \"family\" establishment.

We notice it more because he is talking more- and talking more is good. Relevant words are good. And the salad is because he is not echoing those words, but trying to construct his own speech. He has an easier time with it when he's calm and focused- more salad when he's excited or frustrated or tired- but the words are out there.  Joey greets his classmates by name. He even tries to greet his Sunday School classmates by name- before they greet him. Initiation is good (shame it isn't often positively reinforced by other kids).  Joey is answering questions. Not always correctly, or even willingly, but the answers come out. He was especially frustrated today because he was working on sequencing a set of story cards, and then narrating the story. He got the cards sequenced (YAY!) but then got frustrated with the narrative. It was like, \"I got the things in the right order, what more do you want?\" he was done and wanted to move on to something else, instead of finishing up the details. He knew what the story was and what it was about, and didn't want to expend energy telling us what he knew we already could plainly see. But he got through it. He did it.  He's reading on a first-grade level. We know from the software the school uses for special ed and ESL language teaching that his receptive auditory processing seems to be quite good- he can differentiate sounds and match them and that sort of thing. His receptive language is really coming along. Now, we just need that expressive language... apraxia, hie thyself to the hills!  Katie McCarron would have been in school today. She probably would have been able to circle the \"pl\"s in the poem Mrs. H read. Perhaps, like my Joey, she would have gotten frustrated with the card sequencing- perhaps the sequencing itself would have been a problem? Or the narrating? Then, like my Joey, she may have turned to a computer software game or a favorite activity for her break. Had she lived here, she would have lunched early, because the Russian ballet was coming for an afternoon assembly- I bet she would have liked to try to dance, in a pink dress and a flower in her hair, just like the pretty ballerinas did at school. After all, Katie would be a kindergardener this year.  Thinking of you, Katie.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R5GPoP42n9I/AAAAAAAAAXg/5GAe1a9Qhro/s1600-h/katie2.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/01/more-school.html", "title": "\nMore school\n"},

Joey's school has been sending around lots of booklets and stuff about Martin Luther King, Jr. and his Dream: specifically, that children of all colors can play together.  I know that's what the words of that speech say: that the color of your skin will no longer matter. But I'd like to think that dream goes far beyond that. I'd like to think that the point was equality- that people would be seen for their strengths and talents and gifts, that they would be considered based on them selves , not on what we see. That the Dream is for an appreciation of true diversity of all kinds, not just a diversity of skin tone.  In other words, I think this literature ought to be talking about diversity, acceptance, and freedom for all people. Not just about what color peoples' skins might be. Even the special ed stuff is all about children of all colors, people of all races. What about accepting people with disabilities? What about actually looking at those differing cultures, not just the skintone? What about accepting people of different ages? Shouldn't this little booklet say \"He dreamed of a world where all children could play together\" not just \"a world where children of all skin colors could play together\"?  The here and now for Dr. King was focused on race, and thus his words were focused on race. But I'd like to think his intention went far beyond his moment. The point of the Dream was for people to discover that judging others on superficialities was not appropriate, not useful, and just plain ignorant.  And if it wasn't, well, then here's the new Dream. Cheers.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/01/mlk.html", "title": "\nMLK\n"},

There is a yard, but also plantings. The fence needs replacing. The gates need replacing. I wish the boys went out more, but is it safe?  See, the original plan was to spend more time at Grandma's, who lives in the house I grew up in. I spent endless hours out in the woods by the river, rushing through the trees, dipping fingers and toes in the water, pretending to be fabulous creatures and people on wonderful adventures. I climbed trees, ate blackberries, and napped on the goatshed roof. We dug up old glass from a long-burned and gone homesite and pretended to be archaeologists. We swung on vines (poison ivy vines, by the way, and never got a bump until I was in college) and pretended to be Princess Leia being saved by Luke Skywalker. We dripped soft sand through our fingers and pretended to be overlooking new realms and mountain ranges- mostly inhabited by unfortunate frogs that fell to our grasp.  When Mom rang the big shipbell mounted on our porch, it was time to come in. Without a second thought, we stopped what we were doing and trudged back from the green banks of the river and up to the house, to reality again.  If I set Joey loose in the woods, would he return with the sounding of the bell?  I am hoping that there will be a day when he will be able to handle this idea, and return safely to my waiting arms. But that day is not today. Today we still need fenced yards and set limits. We need defined spaces. It was a huge deal the first time I let the boys into the back yard and remained in the kitchen. I watched through the glass door as the boys played. I noted the need for a lockable gate.  I see other children Joey's age wandering the sidewalks, or roaming the connected back yards. We have taken to seeing Joey's schoolmate, Dexter, and that street is full of children who think nothing of roaming between yards all up and down the street. They are free, because they are also reigned. When Mom sticks her head out the door and calls \"Dinner!\" down the street, her children come. The first time I saw this, especially with the age of the children, I was awestruck with fascination: to watch those little darlings come popping out from yards and- by themselves- safely cross the street and return home, motivated only by the promise of food and prompted by a single call. It was the most incredible thing I had ever seen.  One thing I fervently hope for Joey is- if not independence- at least freedom. I want him to be able to walk down a street and come home safe. I want him to be able to visit neighborhood friends, without even giving it a second thought. He should be able to walk to Dexter's house- all of two blocks- and play there all he wants, then bring Dexter back to our house for some more fun.  But first I need to replace the fence. And the gates. And get these boys outside, so they have their roots there.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/01/different-plans.html", "title": "\nDifferent plans\n"},

Long story of how I was told \"obvious\" cases don't require a triennial). Ours is scheduled for Feb 22. I plan on coming fully armed, just in case.  We have been really happy with Joey's teachers this year, but our past history of meetings in this system has been less than satisfactory. I have no clue whether this is going to be a pat on the head or an ambush. I alerted our private SLP and OT.  Should I call Kluge and get a new letter? Are there private educational consultants I should be consulting? Should I try to drag something in writing from our ABA therapist?  Because the facts we are facing is that Joey could not go into a classroom without support. He can't communicate effectively. He can't socialize effectively. He'd drown.  When we started the school thing- three and a half years ago now- we thought he'd be going into an inclusion room by now. Now our goal is for third grade. And we're wondering if we won't be sliding it to sixth grade. We know so much more about autism and about Joey about the pervasive nature of his disabilities (and his abilities!). We're gearing for what we expect to be the next big battle: what to do with a child who is both special needs and gifted? How do you deal with a kid who academically is leaving everyone in the dust, but who needs the support to get through the labyrinth of simple social interaction and specialized testing? The special ed systems around here are all set up for mental retardation, for kids who need social supports and academic remediation. It is definitely not set up for Joey. Kids are supposed to be reading by the end of kindergarden, not the beginning... and not in special ed.  One good sign is that this teacher is asking whether we think Joey is going to need ESY (summer service). Although we know this may just be a way of feeling us out in order to try to put together a rebuttal, but these teachers seem more interested in Joey's progress than that. You just don't know. In the past, it was used to block us as much as possible, so we have to be prepared.

And lots of other details I don't usually discuss here anyway. You know, school stuff. Educating the child. Keeping him engaged and challenged. He wants to read on the second-grade level next year? No problem. Needs more help in science and social studies? No problem.  Sitting with Joey in circle time, he pulled my head over to him and played with my hair. Playing with my hair is new. He really needs something to do with his hands while in circle. He is doing lots of first-grade reading activities and writing. It sure is nice to be included in his little world, pulled in voluntarily and see his grin when he knows I am there with him; to be pulled nose to nose to that grinning face by little hands, and told, \"Hi, Mrs. Guyton!\" with such love and pride.

But the eye recovered.  I was glad to get him to the bus not because he left my hands, but because the vibration and movement of the bus is so soothing to him. Im not sure telling the bus driver about the problem was necessary, but if he's scratched his eye, it might be sensitive, and I didn't want them in the middle of a renewed meltdown without warning. Also, I thought the aide might help him keep his eye closed a little longer.  Thus begins my day. May it only get better from here for all of us.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2008", "body": "\nI've been getting a lot of questions about Joey and Andy from people and email lately. Probably that \"Yes! You Can Ask Me About Autism\" bumper sticker on my car... but anyway, for those folks bouncing around, here's the scoop, in no particular order:  What is Joey's diagnosis?  Joey is autistic.  Does Andy have a diagnosis?  Andy has sensory integration dysfunction or sensory processing disorder, which are terms often used interchangeably, and are definitely used interchangeably by his therapists. Andy is not autistic.  What is Joey's functioning level?  Joey is considered \"high functioning.\" Which tells you exactly nothing. His main issues are expressive communication and perseveration/ritualistic behaviors. Joey is currently unable to function in a normal classroom environment without support.  Is Joey's autism regressive or non-regressive?  Non-regressive. Joey was born autistic. He did not lose skills, and displayed autistic traits from Day One (possibly earlier).  Is Joey verbal or non-verbal?  Although Joey has very severe expressive communication disabilities, we consider Joey to be verbal.  Did vaccines cause Joey's autism?  Do you believe vaccines caused Joey's autism?  No.  Does Joey receive ABA?  Yes. He presently has one two-hour session of ABA to work on skill generalization and communication.  What other interventions have you implemented for Joey? J oey is in public special education. He also receives private speech therapy, private occupational therapy, and takes music lessons.  Is Andy in therapy?  Yes. Andy had private speech therapy and currently has occupational therapy.  Why isn't Andy in public special education?  Andy is not disabled. He has issues with sensory integration, but is able to function in a normal classroom environment.  Are you autistic ? No.  Is your husband autistic? Is anyone else in your family autistic?  No.  How did you know Joey was autistic?  At age two, Joey did not point and did not speak. By two and a half, still without pointing or speaking, we took him to a speech pathologist, who informed us that he was either profoundly autistic or profoundly deaf or both. He was proven to not be profoundly deaf, so we went to  Kluge  and saw Dr. Blackman, who diagnosed him as autistic.  How did you get Joey to speak?  I wish I could hand folks an answer to getting children to communicate, because I am pretty sure folks who ask me this are looking for that magic bullet. I get asked this a  lot . So I just want to put on the disclaimer that this might not work for everybody. However, our breakthrough came through sign language. When the SLP handed us the \"deaf or autistic\" verdict, we decided any communication would be better than the nothing we had. We bought  Baby Babble , a dvd intended to help kids learn to talk. What he learned with the sign for  \"more.\"  Armed with this new way of getting cookies, bubbles, and anything else, Joey discovered there were ways of getting needs met that involved making sounds or gestures... language. Clever little thing that he is, and the great lover of cookies, bubbles, and getting Mom and Dad to do stuff, he started trying out these new things called \"words.\" Six months later, he had about 25 of them to use. A couple years later, we became fans of  Signing Time , which gives him lots more signs to use and to help him understand what others are saying to him (as well as giving us signs to use with him!) Yes, we recommend trying this visual and kinetic means of communication if your child is having trouble with expressive speech.  I'm sure I'll get lots of new questions and feel the need to do this again, but I hope this helps folks in the meantime!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/pediatrics/patients/KCRCFAM.cfm", "http://www.talkingchild.com/", "http://commtechlab.msu.edu/SITES/ASLWEB/M/W2392.htm", "http://www.signingtime.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/02/faq.html", "title": "\nFAQ\n"},

On paper, Joey has a moderate-to-severe communication disability. It's never fun to see it laid bare.  Something happened at school today, and we don't know what.

He wanted to ride his bike, but he wanted to ride it off the deck- as in, down the stairs. I don't think so. So he then tried to run over his brother. He was asked to stop riding the bike. Instant meltdown ensued... for an  hour . What the...? On the good news front, Grandma arrived and I got to go out to dinner with my husband. The last time we got to go out was... neither of us can remember. We've been wrangling about \"when did we last go out?\" for a few minutes now. Was it my birthday, 2006? Surely we managed to go out over the summer once? But it is lost to the mists of time. Aren't we supposed to be having weekly dates? Or monthly? Or at least  annual ? The food was good this time. The company was fabulous. I hope he asks me out again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/02/up-down-all-around.html", "title": "\nUp, Down, All Around\n"},

Not such a big deal to drive an hour and forty to specifically visit. If you're headed to Monticello, and the kids look bored, reward them with a stop in.  It has lots to do in a small space. There are train tables, machine to explore, dress-up stages, art rooms, a log cabin, and even a guinea pig. There is a special room just for toddlers with climbing equipment and lots of small exhibits for hands-on exploring. In the back there is an exhibit that changes; right now it is about Native Americans. And all the way back is a rel bee hive, the kind you can look for the queen bee.  It is all really exciting, and noisy, and lots of kids having fun. Everything seemed well-maintained, which is to be expected for $4 a head. The noise was a bit much for the guys, but we found the quiet spots- the loft in the log cabin was a favorite, because there was a window up there, so JOey could get into the light. The back room was quieter, too. Everything was interactive, so kids at several different levels could learn something from everything, without it being boring for parents. The space a bit small, though.  Joey resorted to tracking as he wore out, which was a little disconcerting. trying to talk about Native Americans or native Virginia plants or anything proved fruitless. Once he starts tracking, he's done. Maybe the next time we go for a Kluge day, we'll stop in again and bite off another small piece of learning...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R7hkiszlnqI/AAAAAAAAAbw/I04ZCKgll7A/s1600-h/02_boys_loft.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R7hkiMzlnpI/AAAAAAAAAbo/iA9aAzHd-5o/s1600-h/02_andy_fish2.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R7hki8zlnrI/AAAAAAAAAb4/TVNeG1Yv-_A/s1600-h/02_joey_tracking.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/02/museum-day.html", "title": "\nMuseum Day\n"},

I followed the doctor's recommendations for use to the letter, complete with saran wrap.  Unfortunately, it didn't work. I know the cream was good, because my fingertips were slightly numbed just getting it on him. But then they came at him with eleven hypodermic needles, and he let us know he was unhappy with each and every one. remember, Joey usually has a very high pain tolerance. Yikers.  He bled, but nothing swelled, so no allergies. The best we can figure, it is some kind of contact allergy, probably something found in the cleaner they use on the school carpets, or something in the carpet itself. We may never know, but the doctor was still unhappy with his rash- the one he has all the time, that doesn't itch, so she wants us back in three months.  He was such a little trooper- he didn't like those needles, but didn't move or scream or anything, just squinched his face and said, \"Ouch! Hurts!\" So I took him to the toy store and got him a new truck. He was so upset that his teacher let him hold on to the new truck when I took him to school. His ABA session was a disaster. He's now in bed after plenty of hugs and kisses, with his new truck. I thought the routine of school might be comforting for him.

{"date": "Friday, February 29, 2008", "body": "\nSo off I slogged to school this morning, to talk with Joey's teachers. Here in the Old Dominion, special ed kids are sent home report cards like everyone else- and based on the \"norm\" of a regular classroom performance. Kind of. So although Joey is reading on a first grade level, writing sentences, and doing simple subtraction, he is not assigned a grade of \"successful\", but instead a line of \"progressing with effort.\" The other choice is \"needs improvement.\" Why is he not considered \"successful\"? Because he cannot answer questions consistently.  Remember that my kid has a serious expressive communication disability.  This is kind of like giving a blind child a poor report in reading because the child cannot see the page, even though they can read braille fluently. Give the kid in the wheelchair a poor report for phys ed, because the child cannot walk, even though they have a wickedly good throwing arm. No, I have a better one. Give the deaf child a poor report in language arts because, although they can both sign and speak, they cannot maintain consistent pitch or always pronounce a sound clearly and at consistent volume.  In other words, this piece of paper is, for us, trash. Wasted pulp. Someone call in the police, we have murdered a tree with malice aforethought. All it tells me is that Joey cannot perform at the same consistent level of a non-disabled peer in areas where he must use spoken language to prove his understanding of the material. Nuh.  But that's not why I'm blogging about this.  In the middle of this discussion, and the discussion of how to explain to Joey's family that this piece of paper tells us exactly nothing, another school employee wanders in, and notes that if Joey does too well on this piece of paper, they will start talking about taking him out of the self-contained setting.  Now, that is likely very true. And if he was getting really great grades, maybe it is something that ought to be considered. We are certainly thinking about giving him more time in an inclusion setting. However, it was not the bare statement that's really the problem- its the way this person says these kinds of things. It's like she's saying we shouldn't be striving to help and support Joey, because then \"they\" are going to yank service. The only person who has tried to yank service based on a piece of paper has been... well, her. There is a tone of \"if your kid does too well, then he's going to get tossed.\" Excuse me? Because support is working, you're going to try to yank it?  If that's a warning, thank you.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 04, 2008", "body": "\nIf you haven't read the latest article from  Wired , go have a peek. It has its ups and downs, but its always good to know where the ups and downs are.  One comment (of several) that struck me was attributed to Fred Volkmar: \"[he] likens [the idea of autism as a difference instead of a disorder] to telling a physically disabled person: 'You don't need a wheelchair. Walk!' \" This struck me because it has nothing to do with the idea of difference at all. None. Zero. Zip.  Nothing in the neurodiversity movement or the \"difference model\" says autistic people may not need supports. What seems to be said is that, just as a person who may need a wheelchair to be mobile is still human, so are autistic people. An inability to communicate does not mean a person is stupid. I know lots of people with Ph.D.s who are stupid, who speak for a living. It's not about telling the person in the wheelchair to walk. It's about making sure they have a fabulous wheelchair and ramps and that the doors are wide enough to get the chair through. It is understanding that a person in a wheelchair  is mobile , they go out to lunch, go to the library, may need to go to the hospital.  It's about not expecting autistic kids to take SOL tests without appropriate supports. We don't ask the blind child to take a test without providing the test either orally, or in braille- and if in braille, we make sure they have been  taught  braille. We help them to be  independent . Why should I ask any less for my child?  Either  child?  In a related blog entry in the  NY Times , one of the commenters thought it was a \"stretch\" to have an autistic pride movement because \"Disabilities are obstacles to anyone who wishes both to be a part of society and to function as an autonomous, independent adult, and the cognitive and communicative dysfunction that typifies autism is severe.\"  First, I take issue with the idea that there is severe cognitive dysfunction. This goes with the idea at 70% of autistics are mentally retarded... which we are learning is just not the case. I suspect mental retardation is no more prevalent in autistic populations than in the general population. However, this may be a problem to determine, as anyone with a communicative dysfunction or disorder is often labeled \"mentally retarded\" in our society. Heck, my Andy's articulation problems would at one time have slapped him with a label of being cognitively deficient or impaired! A person with a stutter may need speech therapy, but does that mean they are intellectually challenged?  Moving on to the point; what's wrong with it being a \"pride\" movement?  So much of the literature on autism is negative. That is part of the point of the  Wired  article- all this negativity ignores what autistic people  can  do, in favor of what they  can't  do. Funding is not for understanding, it is only for fixing. I still have no idea how you can even try to fix something if you can't see if or how it is broken, so I would think there would be more money trying to figure out how brains work, and how the autistic brain is different. But there isn't. Very strange.  I have wandered off the point again: pride. I certainly hope when Joey grows older and starts to explore himself and his identity, he can find pride in being Joey. Pride movements are not about fitting into society. They are about identity politics. It is about being able to seize control of labels and being who you are, and creating your identity based on who you are. There is nothing inherently evil in being autistic, it is an inherent part of who Joey is. Why not be proud of being who he is?  As Rachel says at  Signing Time :  It doesn't matter what you look like  The things you can and cannot do Just be a boy or be a girl Feel proud that you are you! What's wrong with that?  Joey has just as much right to be proud to be Joey as  you  have the right to be proud of being  you . May he seize the labels and take control of his own identity with the same strength of character and joy of living as anyone else. People who love Starbucks. People who are Americans. We have a Welsh Society here, those people couldn't help being born Welsh. We have a fabulous deaf community here, and those folks didn't choose to be deaf. But there is power in seizing who you are, just as you seize the things you do control- just like the Mommy Club, the Bowling League, or the Western Line Dancing Society. We create pride movements and identities every day. Don't deny that to someone just because they don't share your identity.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-03/ff_autism?currentPage=all", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/the-language-of-autism/index.html?ex=1361941200&en=539b83f6c8994672&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss", "http://www.signingtime.com"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/03/proud-to-be-me.html", "title": "\nProud to be me\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, March 08, 2008", "body": "\nAnd here I take my own small stand in the Poling \"debate.\"  In the Poling case, it was determined that vaccines exacerbated a mitochondrial condition in one child. That catalyst resulted in problems for that child that looked like autism. Is the child autistic? I'm wondering if that is more of a political question than a medical one. So here my politics: yes, the child should be considered autistic. I'm not convinced that what we term \"autism\" is any one condition- it appears to be a group of behaviors, sensory problems, and communication issues that we group under the umbrella of \"autism\" just as all the religious traditions of India are umbrella-ed under \"Hinduism.\"  Does this mean vaccines cause autism? Well, no. It means that a child with a mitochondrial condition may have been negatively impacted by vaccines... which has not actually been proven, by the way. What we have is circumstantial appearance, which is enough to get money for her treatment from the government. That is what this vaccine fund was set up for, and so yes, I think they are entitled to the money, and good luck to them. May they come through this with acceptance of their daughter- a beautiful girl- just as she is, and get her the support she needs.  This decision changes no facts about my own child, though I may do some research on mitochondrial disorders, to make sure he doesn't have one. If I found he had something like that, and there were other (legitimate) treatments, that would be important. I have already emailed Joey's doctors about it. I'm not the kind of mom that dismisses things out of hand- I check it out. After all, I suspect this mitochondrial thing would have \"autism-like symptoms\" even without the dreaded vaccines, right? Because it just \"aggravated\" the condition? So I'll let you all know what the doctors say. Gotta love email.  So there it is. Good luck to the Polings. Sorry this didn't prove anything. Sorry this whipped up the anti-vaccine crowd as if it  had  proven something. Ultimately, I suspect that this will only lead to more folks not vaccinating, increasingly the chances of my own kids getting these dangerous diseases. This should have been a quiet case, settled and moved on, nothing more to see here. >>UPDATE: The email our developmental pediatrician sent back: \"No.\" So there it is.

{"date": "Saturday, March 15, 2008", "body": "\nIn a room full of school personnel, discussing Joey's strengths and weaknesses, it is much like a sea of fog with oases of insights into what Joey can and cannot do. His expressive language deficits are severe, yet he seems to speak because he scripts so well. This is not getting through to them, you can see it in the blank eyes and confused frowns. \"Have you ever read  A Wrinkle In Time ?\" I offer. \"He's like  Mrs. Who .\" Faces light up. Understanding is gained. We are all on the same page. How often does  that  happen?  I race over to the door of Andy's classroom- it is already open. I am late. Not much, but enough. He is left waiting. His teacher spots me, calls into the room. Out tumbles a small yellow thing, who pounces into my arms. The teacher gives me a double thumbs-up. Good day. No time-outs. The little yellow-clad child chatters at me, something about green, birds, and dinosaurs. The dinosaurs part may just be his inclination to add the word \"dinosaurs\" to the ends of sentences (kind of like King George in  Blackadder  adding the word \"penguin.\") He could very well have said \"The trees are green and full of birds dinosaurs.\" In fact, he is saying something like that, as there is a shrub on the way to the car that is full of birds and newly popped buds of leaves, and he is drawn to it like pins to a magnet. If it's alive, Andy is all over it. He dances around the shrub for a minute or two before I get him to the car. He starts to yell, \"No Grandma! Don't want Grandma!\" until he notices that her usual seat is unoccupied. He stops. He stares. He turns to me. \"Where is Grandma?\" he demands sternly. \"She's not here today, honey,\" I explain patiently. \"We're going over to the office to see if she took her trip to Baltimore.\" He begins to melt down. No! No Grandma! Where is Grandma? (Grandma, never forget, you are loved...) \"Hard day.\" These are two words that strike fear and concern into my heart, especially when they are at the start of the conversation with Joey's classroom aide. I get to talk to her when I pick him up for therapy. Joey is not usually violent, but today he came for a classmate like a crazed thing as gym was ending. They had been sharing a ball, bouncing it between them in some kind of game. When it came time to put it away, the other child was putting it away when Joey came for him, and hit him. He also had been sassing the aide, also unusual. There had been an assembly, could that have set him off? I take him to the car, tell Grandma the news. There is nothing for it- we have to ask, even during after-school mood. \"How was school today?\" Grandma asks cheerfully, and we make ground right away (he's just been listening to Mrs. Shaw talk about his day, after all). \"D. keeps taking the ball!\" We want to cheer, he answered with relevant information, but we want more information. Grandma comes up with a usually calming question, as this response has upset him, \"What color was the ball?\" \"Blue.\" Ah, the color of the week. All explained. The boys bounce in, still in pajamas, having granted us the luxury of a lie-in to 8 am. I have spent another night in the recliner to accommodate our regular nightly boy visit. They happily pile on, a great heap of boys. Joey snuggles into my space, kicking me aside again. \"Momma! Move!\" he demands, \"Not enough room! Get in the chair!\" Ah, cast aside like an old shoe. We decide to go researching some home repair materials, including a new bike shed for the bikes. Off to Lowe's! We pull around the corner in sight of the store, and Joey triumphantly reads, \"Garden Center!\" \"Good reading!\" we praise him and clap. Then Andy announces, just as triumphantly, \"Dinosaur Center!\" Laughing that hard while driving is very dangerous.  The pizza place is familiar, but crowded, so Joey takes in the toy  du jour , a Leapfrog Phonics writing desk. Several other customers give us the hard looks of the unappreciative as the toy beeps and talks, announcing the letter and playing its little tune as it demonstrates how to write the letter. \"G!\" Joey announces, \"My last name!\" All well and good. I look over at what my kindergartener has written to see a perfectly done  cursive  \"G\". Ah yes, the toy has a cursive setting. I better send a warning email to his teachers when I get home.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Wrinkle-Time-Madeleine-LEngle/dp/0440498058", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wrinkle_in_Time#Mrs_Who", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/03/random-moments-ii.html", "title": "\nRandom moments II\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 11, 2008", "body": "\nYesterday was MidWinter Field Day at school- a field trip to the Field House to play field games inside on fake grass- complete with fake dirt. Yes, fake dirt. Apparently it is good for cushioning. The kids get just as dirty, by the way the \"fake dirt\" rubs into little hands and smudges across little faces and clothes. But they don't get wet or cold, so there's a plus.  The whole kindergarden went. I got to go as a chaperone. I had to meet them there, because there was no room on the bus (I noticed I was the only parent waiting for the buses in the parking lot. I was also the only special ed parent. Go figure.) We had five adults for six kids. Other classrooms had four to five adults for twenty to thirty, except the inclusion room- they only had 18 kids.  Our kids had a great time. We modified the games a little, so the instructions were easier to follow and expectations more in line with success. For example, we had a relay race that required our kids to jump, gallop, and skip. We all looked at one another in dismay- none of our kids can skip. So we kept the jumping, had them try the galloping, and then had them run. Also, our group was eerily quiet. The other groups were running around, screaming, squealing, laughing, yelling to each other. Quite a din. But ours? Well, we had laughing and some squealing, one kid with several (expected) meltdowns, but really, quiet. Most of them don;t speak well.  In some ways, the day was startling. Seeing Joey next to his non-disabled peers always highlights his disabilities. I just don't think of Joey as disabled most of the time. He's Joey, he has special needs, I have to pay attention to the supports he needs- but I just don't think about him as disabled. He's Joey. Next to the general uproar, it is always a bit of a shock to see what other kids can do, and Joey clearly cannot. He's so close... so close... yet so far, so separated. It was also a little disturbing to see kids that clearly needed to be in special ed who were not. Like Joey, you could see the isolation. Left in the swarm, they were left out, ridiculed, pestered, nagged. Adults were too taken up with supervising so many kids that there was no possibility of supporting those kids properly. One kid toe-walked and flapped all the way from the bus into the building, and every time I saw him, he was sitting against a wall, instead of participating. That was sad.  But in some ways, it was great. Joey does so much more than he used to. He can follow instructions, he can catch a bean bag, he can run and jump. He even did some crab walking, though he got frustrated with it and finally gave up and just crawled. He did the limbo with his friends. They did a whole game of pretending- pretend to paint pictures, pretend to catch balloons, pretend to ice skate- and he could do these things. And he was so happy, playing among friends. He was happy his mom was there. He was happy to eat a peanut butter sandwich. He was happy to play games. Everybody wanted to be with him, sit next to him, play with him. He was having a fabulous time. He enjoys life.  He was, of course, a mess the rest of the day. That's OK. I just had to hug him more, and smooch on him more, after a morning of lots of extra hugs and kisses.  Life is good. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["rtsp://v5.cache5.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQm_gSwQqO1uBxMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/03/field-day.html", "title": "\nA Field Day\n"},

So I printed out some good pictures of him in various places and with various people, places he likes to go and things he likes to do, his toys and his brother and all that kind of stuff, all our \"greatest hits\". Then we went through them and I told him to pick out his \"favorites\" for his project, in which he would talk about himself with his friends. (He's going to have to get up in front of the class and present this!) It was really interesting what photos he picked out, and what he had to say about them. I didn't limit him at all- he kept picking, we kept talking and writing. I had him write sentences about the pictures on his usual paper, and we'll cut the whole mess out and glue it to the posterboard in the morning.  So what did he pick?  We were required to have him include \"I was born April 10\" and \"I live in Fredericksburg.\" To accompany these two very boring sentences, he selected a picture of his Grandma holding him in the hospital. Granted, I gave him a limited selection to go with these, but they were an array of very early pictures of him. Did he pick the one of mom holding him? No. Grandma. It's a lovely picture, though.  Then from the throng he selected a picture at the beach. I love the pic, though I would have picked the one with him looking out over the ocean. The one he picked is from the fall. Probably remember it better. Anyway, he wrote that he liked to go to the beach \"because I like the water and the sand.\" All by himself.  He picked himself playing the snow, riding his bike, and playing in the shark mouth at DinosaurLand. He also wanted the pic from Halloween. The sentence I was trying for was \"I live with my mom, my dad, and my brother, Andy.\" What I got was \"I live mom, my brother Andy, and Joey Little Bear, and T-Rex.\" Poor JoeyAndyDad. But this was the photo he wanted- and notice Dad is there. I think he got a little excited and forgot words in the sentence. I thought I'd toss in a picture of me when we glued things together tomorrow.  All weekend he's been saying he doesn't like cats, and been shying away from our cats. i know he has a love-fear relationship with dogs, but he's usually OK with our cats. After all, they've been here longer than he has. But I was surprised when he pulled  out a picture of the cats (especially since I didn't mean for it to be in the stack of pictures. Surprise!) His sentence? \"I have 2 cats at home. They are Luna and Ellora.\" I had to remind him of the names, but he could pick them out in the picture. Later, when Ellora came in to remind me she needed dinner, he triumphantly chimed, \"Hello, Ellora!\" I think she was confused, since he's been stand-off-ish, and suddenly he wanted to touch her. She's not into being touched.  And speaking of Grandma, he wanted her to have a sentence all her own. With no help at all (and not even facing me... he starting writing with his back to me): \"My Grandma is Grandmother Bear. I love her.\" A voluntary, spontaneous, and appropriate pronoun. Wow.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R93aEAljhGI/AAAAAAAAAjU/fW2hFqNb5UE/s1600-h/grandma_baby1.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R93ZQQljhFI/AAAAAAAAAjM/Jxwout7-Nos/s1600-h/04_joey_inwaves.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R93anQljhHI/AAAAAAAAAjc/zRM-XSkGHqY/s1600-h/07_boys_trickortreat.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R93cDwljhII/AAAAAAAAAjk/dEPoInLwfEo/s1600-h/cats.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/R93dSwljhJI/AAAAAAAAAjs/3voGOOKFFt0/s1600-h/04_joey_cookies.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/03/homework-project.html", "title": "\nHomework Project\n"},

No more backseat blogging for me, such as the suggestion that she post the 'Dinosaur Center' comment from Andy. Joey was in one of his totally locked-in and focused moods today, which means that he was on his Leappad doohickey all day. Now, we have learned that when he appears to be off in lala-land, he actually is only devoting 80% of his attention to one thing. There's still 20% left for other things, which occasionally includes hearing, which is always nice. He was so focused on learning cursive writing that it appeared to everyone at dinner that he was off in his own little world. Which is basically the perception of autistic people- that they are oblivious to their surroundings. Not interested in other people. Humorless automatons. Well, five minutes with Joey will destroy that perception. In this case, Andy was tired and telling everyone \"no\" and to leave him alone, when Joey piped up, \"Leaf me alawwwnn\", without even looking up from his toy, and began to giggle.

His teacher is very very pleased with him- Andy loves school, and is adapting well. He's ahead taller than everyone else, even though he's one of the youngest in there. He sits to eat his snack and everything. It was fun to watch him go with the flow, follow instructions, and look at books with his friends. It's a little strange, too, since Joey didn't do these things at this age; he didn't talk with other children, tell me or show me things, insist on things. On the other hand, its also fun to see how they are/were the same- still wanting to hug on Mom because she came to school, still wanting to be the one who holds the book and trn the pages when the teacher is reading. She also mentioned another similarity- Andy is considerate of his classmates' feelings. He does his best to help them, share with them, and does his share in cleaning up.   The class is a little more cliquish than I was expecting of 3-year-olds; the boys tend to leave Andy alone and bunch together without him. He's getting along fine with the girls, though.

The boys were fond of the cat, despite her rather grumpy disposition. Today, Joey bounced into the room where mom and I were discussing Easter baskets, and asked, \"Where is the cat?\"  I recovered fairly quickly- we are getting used to Joey asking questions- and this one even had a referent. Mom wasn't so quick. \"What cat?\" she asked- remember, the cat has been gone some months, and the children are often at her house, and this is the first time he has asked since we explained that the cat was gone.  \"The orange cat,\" he replied as if he had been answering questions all his life. Amazing. But... what to say?  \"Remember when the kitty was sick, and we took her to the doctor?\" I tried to explain gently. \"Remember, the doctor couldn't help her?\" He looked right at me for a moment, then away, his fingers playing with something else. Most folks might take this as disinterest, or that the conversation was over, or that he had moved on- but he hadn't. He's Joey. He's thinking. What to say? What to say?

One, if you own a house, no matter the mortgage, you are at the mercy of your medical insurance. If you are lucky like us, your medical insurance will pitch in for occupational therapy, and (less often) speech therapy. But educational tutoring and \"therapy\"? You are on your own- or stuck with what the school gives you. Which means when the economy goes down, folks that are not being helped already by social services, the schools, and community services due to low income have to choose between therapy for the child and paying the mortgage/rent. Therapy or food? And what about the second mortgages we already had to take out to pay for therapies? What happens when home values crash, and those equity lines and second mortgages are \"called in\"?  Which brings us to the question we have on our minds here: continue ABA, or not?  Joey gets two hours of ABA per week. For folks who have heard kids need 40 hours per week, we're a little farther along in the program. We're not working on discrete trials for responses; we're working on supporting the school program and generalizing skills. We've moved beyond having some college kid sitting at a table with flashcards and M&Ms. Besides, at $65 an hour, who can afford it? Private pay, we get a 30% discount. That's $78 a week, or $314-$390 per month.  Imagine if we could put that money towards the mortgage, instead of taking it from the mortgage.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 02, 2008", "body": "\n I've been getting a lot of emails and calls lately to the effect of \"I'm reading your blog, and you have got it  so good!!!  Everything is going so  perfect  for you! Your boys are so smiley all the time, I am  so  jealous! No tantrums, no problems, everything there is just sunshine and roses!  So get off your butt and go do some work or something! Quit complaining like a brat when I call/email/see you! \"  So, for those avid readers who have noticed that my blog emphasizes the good times and achievements of my wonderful, beautiful, smiling boys, I would just like to say: you are absolutely correct. We have come a long way, and we continue to make strides. I am very proud of the work both of my little guys do- they are two of hardest working little guys I have ever known.  We have gone from a non-verbal child to a child who can have a basic conversation about his day and his life and his needs and wants. Just in this blog alone, we have gone from  utter shock at a sentence  to cheering on a whole presentation complete with question-and-answer session. We have gone from s creaming frustration all day long  to the whine and occasional meltdown. Joey is growing up, learning to regulate himself, learning to communicate. The frustration is ebbing. On the other front, we have gone from \"normal\" to sensory dysfunctional, and are now well on our way back to fully functioning in regular environments. We are through a food strike, back into normal \"picky eating.\" We have stood at the brink of a real problem with speech and behavior, and found a path away (called \"therapy and school\"). Andy is also growing up, and the energy is getting some real guidance.  So is my life all sunshine and roses? Well, in some ways, yes it is. Two beautiful boys, lots of hugs and kisses, sunshine in the back yard and food in the fridge actually being consumed.  And in some ways, it's not. We still have our finger-biting and  smack-on-the-chin problem , for example... and Andy imitating it. And the latest crazes in my house? Loud choruses of \"Weave me  AWONE !\" racing through the house, especially if I have just asked a child to perform a non-preferred task or stop a dangerous activity. The word \"No\" bounces around here a lot, too. Sound like normal pressing of limits? Come around sometime. You're not getting the full effect. Joey tends to flail more than he used to, incorporating the behavior of some of his classmates. Trying t share new experiences with Joey is always a challenge- to pull his interest to something new, to focus on something new, to explain it when he has neither the ability to focus, nor the language control to make what you are saying relevant to him, can be very frustrating. Getting that joint attention, crucial to being able to teach and learn, is a real challenge- and all the more so because you forget he has trouble with it. He's not off in his own little world, he has pretty good eye contact (not great... but passable and reasonable), he certainly expresses interest in videos and in things around him, just never in a way you expect. For example, he likes tractors and animals, so we took him to the Oxon Hill farm. In the museum part is a display about butter. Talking to Andy about how milk comes from a cow and is churned to make butter- in most elementary terms- no problem. Wow, milk comes from a cow, now let's go look at a cow. Connections made. But Joey? He can't focus on the churn, the words you are throwing at him seem to be a jumble. He caught the sign for \"milk\" and \"cow\" but then wandered off, too uncomfortable in the unfamiliar setting to pull himself away from tracking the floor tiles. The cow was mildly interesting, as it was alive and moved. But somehow I failed to teach him the lesson I intended, connecting cows and milk, to start building understanding of food, consequences, sequences, cycles, etc. This is very frustrating. Remember, I'm a teacher by trade.  Besides, I want so much to share the world with him. Living is so wonderful! It is so full of everything! I don't so much mind following his lead, as I get frustrated trying to constantly figure out what that is, and being unable to provide proper guidance for my child, when part of the job of a parent is to guide, to introduce, to share. I am sure this feeling turns to fear, anger, and despair in others I see trying to raise autistic children. What shall I do with it? It's not a sunshine and roses question, though the resulting answer could very well be, and usually is.  And on our other front? Well, he's almost four, and just now emerging from the Terrible Threes. We've had them pretty easy, because Andy's a sweet kid by nature, and had Joey to guide him. He still wakes up grumpy, he still prefers to stand to eat (or just jump around instead of eating at all), still gets into bickering and fighting with his brother, still is testing his limits and boundaries.

That came with a nasty fever that broke early this morning. Now I just have two sniffle-heads. OK, we really have all four of us sniffling, but I'm the mom, and poor Allan had to go to work. :P  So I have two sniffleheads. They feel OK enough to want to play, but they get tired out easy and that makes them grumpy. So instead of getting them up and down the stairs, I have left them in their pajamas, and brought breakfast upstairs.  Now, I am not a gadget woman, nor a big TV viewer. My husband, however, is all over it. When he got his nice, big bonus this year (because he is an awesome worker and got awesome reviews), we got ourselves our anniversary present: an  Apple TV . I was unsure how this gadget would be any better than the other gadgets we have, but it made him happy, and that was the important thing. But now, I would just like to say, thank you, JoeyAndyDad, for our AppleTV. We have spent a deliciously restful morning in the bedroom, tucked into Mommy and Daddy's bed, watching  Oobi  on the fancy TV. The boys are getting much-needed rest, we've only had one whining spell, and everybody is happy. We are sipping our juice boxes, no one has waxed, and we have smiling faces, despite still having fevers and sniffles. Now I just need to find a couple pairs of google-eyes for two boys who want to play Oobi...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.apple.com/appletv/features.html", "http://www.noggin.com/shows/oobi.php"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/04/sick-day.html", "title": "\nSick day\n"},

Communication devices seem to be particularly difficult to lay hands on. Just as people tend to assume that kids who cannot speak (or worse, cannot speak properly) are stupid, they assume all communication devices are alike, and just grab whatever and go. Can't you just pick a button and push it?  It is enough to tear one's hair out.  It's worse when the person showing this ignorance is your insurance company liaison. Why? Because they will block the money you need to get the right device your kid needs, and get it ASAP so the poor child can start  proving they aren't an idiot  communicating.  I have placed the suggestion several places that we should have a bake sale and buy these things ourselves. We know where to get them. we know how much they are. We're just broke. Don't know how that happened, with school and therapy and other equipment and whatnot. I fear some folks thought I was/am being facetious.  I am not.  We should get together and have a big, world-wide bake sale. We should advertise it. We should all news outlets and tell them what we are doing and why we are doing it. And we should then publish a big cookbook to continue the project and keep some cash rolling in.  This government thinks little of funding wars, bailing out companies, \"fixing\" messes others have made with money, but heaven forbid we be trying to make our kids independent, support our kids in their needs and goals. Many of these friends would love to even have a clue what those self-goals  are , but the kid can't communicate- because they need the %^#@  device  the insurance person says is \"not necessary\" or not from the vendor they like.  Having me sit here and cuss isn't getting those devices to those people. A bake sale might.

You'd never guess this from watching him rollick on the floor with his brother just now, causing Joey to erupt in cackles and giggles. But two hours ago, Andy was zonked out on the couch. So there is my three year old, curled up on the sofa with Blankie and  Mr. Guinea Pig  when Joey decides the funny thing to do is to imitate the dryer sound (a loud, long buzz) at top volume. As intended, this noise woke Andy. But then he started to scream and cry- the poor kid couldn't believe anyone would mess with him when he was feeling so bad. So, amidst the wails, Joey laughs. I order him to his room for a timeout- both to punish him and more importantly, restore some quiet to the room. I get \"No, I don't think so.\" This was not Joey's first trip to his room this afternoon. On our first trip, we talked about apologizing and what it meant. I modeled that when you apologize you mean that you're sorry, that you wish you hadn't done or said whatever you'd done or said, and that you'll try not to do it again. So we went up for the second time and Joey was already scripting the usual \"I'm sorry\". Why? \"Because Daddy's mad.\" Right. The previous lesson clearly had not sunk in. The time out rules this time were pretty strict- stay in your room, no toys, and most importantly, be quiet. He was never really going to follow the third instruction, but I did want him to stop screeching at the top of his lungs, since we were right above where Andy was attempting to sleep. I went downstairs, and after about fifteen minutes of sniffling and wailing from above, returned to see what he'd learned. After he calmed down, Joey said, \"I'm sorry for Andy. I won't make dryer noise anymore.\" Wow. We walked through what happened again, focusing first on how Joey's noise made Andy feel, and then about how Joey was upset because he got punished and also that Andy was sad. Andy's still at the age where he thinks simply saying he's sorry makes it all better.  It seems like Joey is outgrowing that stage, and part of it is that he understands others' feelings more completely.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/04/discipline-and-getting-older.html", "title": "\nDiscipline and Getting Older\n"},

Family members who are curious. Friends who haven't moved beyond that. Other parents who like to toss around old questions. They all want to know: what caused Joey's autism? (Sometimes I think they are really asking, \"Did  you  cause Joey's autism?\", but perhaps that is for another blog post...) We have no idea why Joey is autistic.  Vaccines did not cause Joey's autism. He was autistic before he was ever vaccinated. He was autistic from birth. None of his vaccinations contained thimerasol (did I really have to just type that  again ?) He did not show any adverse reaction to the MMR vaccine.  We have no family history of autism or anything that would now be diagnosed as autism or asperger's syndrome, so far as we know or understand. We do have family history of what is now called sensory integration dysfunction.  We did  not  have a \"normal pregnancy.\" I went gestational diabetic with both pregnancies. I only had insulin with Andy, not Joey. Joey did briefly go into \"distress\" and was born by emergency c-section. Both babies has jaundice (Andy's was far worse than Joey's). I also lost 40 pounds over the course of each pregnancy (never fear, I found them all again).  Joey's head grew normally.  Joey does not have any signs, nor has tested positive for, PST deficiency.  Joey has testing negative for any heavy metal poisoning.  Joey has tested negative for food allergies and respiratory allergies. He does have some kind of contact allergy, most probably to floor or carpet cleaner and related products.  Joey was not sick a day until he was two years old. He then had a mild stomach bug, for which no medicine was required. He did not have so much as sniffle before then. The only medication he received before he went to school- including aspirin, ibuprophen, tylenol, antibiotics, cold meds, etc.- were any drops placed in his eyes at the hospital, numbing gel for his teething, and neosporin for minor cuts. He was autistic before receiving any of these medications. He did not have ear infections until he started school. We did have two days of a yeast issue in breastfeeding, but no yeast infections on his part (just on my part).  Joey shows no sign of seizures.  I have never smoked, nor does anyone living in my home. I did not drink during my pregnancies.  So I have no idea why my son is autistic. He is. I'm sure there are plenty of other theories popping around. Ultimately, God made him this way. God made me to help him learn to cope, survive, thrive, flourish, and enjoy life. Then He made Andy. He did not make Andy autistic. He made me to help Andy learn to cope, survive, thrive, flourish, and enjoy life.

When I was a child racing about trying to figure out who I was, I had a way of connecting meaning to quotes, attaching ideas and emotions to them, weaving them into webs of understanding. Snippets of things would bounce about my head making connections, and those connections would knit into the fabric of thinking. I think Joey does this, which is why echoing is so much easier for him than coming up with his own words. It's a shorthand for what would take him a ton of energy to create himself with his own words. He has other things to do and to think about, and I really do think language is tiring for him. Anyway, things bounce about and make the warp and weft of memory and being. What to do with them?  So here's what's been bouncing about my head lately. It becomes something of an odd mantra of meanings and connections, and flavors the way I think about other things.  Do you know who I am?  Do I know who you are?  See we one another clearly?  Do we know who we are?    \u201cLike I always say, keep an open mind, and you never know who might walk in!\u201d  Why should I cry for you?  Why would you want me to?

After being assured that there were no  turkeys  loose today, we were handed these new little booklets for kids to fill out, and they can earn a badge. Very nice little books, too. The first few pages are geared to the 5-8 crowd. Joey just turned 6, and loves to read. Fabulous.  So we wandered out, sauntering in our usual way, then we got up to the house site where the benches are, and I called Joey over to look at the new book.  Did I mention that sometimes I forget that Joey is disabled?  To me, Joey is just... Joey. And he's a smart kid on top of it. Reads like a dream. Interested in the world, in his way. He likes living things and taking walks and that kind of thing. And he's a cutie-pie, with very kissable cheeks and a big grin. That's my boy.  But there are some things Joey simply cannot do. One is to wander out to a place he doesn't see very often, stop at a point where he doesn't usually stop, and focus joint attention upon a book. On top of that, he was being asked questions about the book, which was giving him new information, and being asked to write the answers down.  Oh dear. No no no. This will  not  do. That child would have rather pulled out his own fingernails than sit with me and look at that book, or read a word from the page, and let me know in no uncertain terms.

{"date": "Sunday, April 13, 2008", "body": "\nAs the semester draws to a close, I stand at the brink of that horrific time of the year when students begin to realize they are about the face the grade music for the work they didn't do. I get an amazing array of excuses, pleas, and prayers about this problem every year. Sometimes people get creative, but then, usually if they have the wherewithall to get creative, they've done the work in the first place. And this isn't just a \"those damn kids\" issue. I teach at community colleges- I have all ages and stages in there.  As a note, many of my students have their grades- often on a weekly basis- throughout the semester. My syllabus includes the formula I use to calculate their final grade, and it is extremely simple- each test is worth 25%, participation in class is 25%, and then either a paper or a set of weekly quizzes is 25% (I stopped doing it with appropriate weights and things because too many students complained they couldn't work the equation.) So at any moment, they can calculate \"how they are doing.\"  Just in case some poor student of mine stumbles across this blog after googling me, sees some excuse they gave, and starts getting all \"she's doggin' me!\" about it, please note that the semester does not actually end for another three weeks. This entry is anticipatory, based on past experience. If you use one of these excuses, I can only assure you that I do not possess a time machine, and so cannot go back in time to rag you about your given excuse or plea before you provide said excuse or plea. And at this point, you have not emailed me about why you  absolutely must  get that \"C\" or \"B\" or \"A\".  So here is my totally snarky responses to common excuses and pleas that appear on my voice mail and in my email boxes  after the semester is already closed . I have no intention of actually responding to any students with these retorts. They just tend to bounce around and cause me a lot of sleepless nights after the semester closes.  Remember to read the excuses with a properly comedic whiny tone, or it loses its effect.  I need a grade of X to get off of academic probation, or they'll kick me out of school!  If school is so important to you, why didn't you bother to complete your work and study for your exams? (Now, after your final exam is turned in, ain't the time to make an appointment for tutoring, sweetie.) But I get A's in all the rest of my classes!  Obviously not in math. Or are you suggesting your other professors do not expect you to complete your reading and assignments, complete them with at least 60% of the answers correct, and complete them on time?  I got sick/pregnant/in an accident/lost a relative during the last two weeks of the semester, cut me a break!  Where were you the rest of the semester? {Folks who have real problems during the last two weeks can apply for an \"incomplete\"  IF  they were not already failing the class} I couldn't get time from work/my work schedule got too hectic!  Welcome to the real world. You're taking a class. You have to complete the coursework to get credit for it. Were you too busy to drop me an email when your schedule got posted?

We have some big disruptions on the horizon.  The big campaign for Joey is \"staying in bed.\" This will involve returning him to his own bed at night instead of letting him curl up with us. With summer coming, it will be more comfortable for everyone; and besides, the child is now six years old. Time to stay in your own bed. I am making several adjustments to Joey's room in anticipation of the campaign- but then, those changes are, in and of themselves, disruptions.

We started by running up to Lorton and picking up a pair paintings done by my grandmother- absolutely fabulous ones, the paintings look good, though reframed. Andy was a charming little angel at the gallery. Kept his hands to himself, asked cute questions, and spread that grin around generously. What a sugar-pie!  Joey had a great day at school. His afternoon teacher, Mrs. S, even came out when I picked up to tell me how great he did, paying attention and listening, and being able to answer questions about what was read. Another charming gentleman.  So of course they turned into wild freaks for the afternoon.  Actually, I am partly to blame, not keeping good techniques for motivation in mind, being tired myself, and over-scheduling. Joey had speech therapy, and then we had the art show at Andy's school. The boys like nothing better than to run wild while I am trying to talk to Ms. Nikki, and today was no exception. However, \"sit down!\" is not really a great way to get compliance. I think waiting to give out prizes until AFTER the discussion may be better, or having the prize box handy, until I can get them to calm down themselves. (It's not bribery. It's positive reinforcement.)  Andy did some lovely pieces for the show. The show is a fundraiser for the school, so you pay $15 to get the two pieces your kid made, but they do it up right. He made a bear sculpture, and a sand painting of a spider for the 2-D. They added a little picture of him posing as a French artiste, complete with tam and palette, to the corner of the painting- very cute. Tey also had a silent auction for some photos and scrapbooks of the kids, I put in a bid on a photo of the class that was cute. We'll see- the folks at this school are for the better part that \"in-crowd\" of wealthy folk, its a popular school and a good one. I'm sure shelling out $50 for a pic of the kid is nothing to a good many of these people. So we'll just see.  Anyhoo, there was a bit of chaos as people crammed in to the classroom to find their kids' work, and it got overwhelming fast. Then we had the grand idea to take them out to pizza for dinner, after they were overwhelmed and wound up. They did OK under the circumstances, though the waitress was clearly eager for us to eat and leave.  I was glad to get my Ms. Frizzles to bed where they can take a breath and get some rest.

{"date": "Monday, April 21, 2008", "body": "\nYou might recall from last year that we are having a  bit of a problem  with the school OT  understanding  the whole area of sensory integration dysfunction. This year, the school has invested in sensory profile kits or something of the sort, so his teacher suggested we have one done for Joey by us, by both his teachers, and hopefully by our private OT. However, this all has to be done under the auspices of the school OT. It's her province, after all. Her turf. Her kingdom. Lack of training or experience be damned.  So we get it all set up, except the OT needs to be tracked down to sign the paperwork. So of course, instead of just sending the profile home, she has decided she needs to \"discuss\" it over the phone. At least, that was what the first message said- she wanted to discuss the profiles, and it would take about 15 minutes.  That sounds OK. A profile is an evaluation, and I can understand requirements to explain to parents what the evaluation is and is intended to discover, even if said parent has been through the evaluation process before. I know what a sensory profile is and what it is for, but there are procedures to be followed. Fine.  Communication issues have scuttled the attempts to make phone contact, but I am really, really worried about the phone message today. According to the message, this phone interview will now take 20 minutes, and will consist of yes/no questions. Am I going nuts, or does that sound to anybody else like this lady is going to try to do this  over the phone ?   I was concerned enough to email her about my confusion, which was probably a mistake, but I don't want to do this over the phone. I want the questionnaire in hand, so my husband and I can properly discuss the questions and provide the most accurate information we have about Joey's reactions and behaviors, and try to get an honest assessment of his sensory needs. I'm not talking about agonizing over every little detail, but certainly a \"yes/no\" over the phone doesn't seem accurate or appropriate. Or am I just getting the dander up? Perhaps she has other yes/no questions to ask? Besides, the other profiles I did were gradients, not yes/no. Did anybody do one that was yes/no?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogger.com/posts.g?blogID=27817243&label=&searchType=ALL&txtKeywords=gum&numPosts=100"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/04/assessment-by-phone.html", "title": "\nAssessment-By-Phone?\n"},

This is an activity recommended by one of the boys' favorite shows, Oobi. We used Oobi references to orient the boys and get them in the door.  They were SO excited. We chose a restaurant we used to go to all the time, and still order from a lot. Joey was so excited he jumped on the booth and flipped the seat! Yikes! It took us a few minutes to recover from that, then we were settled and trying to order.  The boys got paper fans and paper umbrellas and orange juices. They tried potstickers, pork, duck, and crab wontons. We got them sweet and sour chicken, so they had a kind of \"chicken nuggets\" to be familiar, but they were really good at at least trying all the new foods. Joey liked rice the best, but had a good bit of the broccoli and pork and the potstickers, and he liked the baby corn from our duck dish. Andy was OK with the corn, but preferred the chicken and crab wontons. Not too shabby for boys who this time last year were eating what? two dozen foods? Between them?  Another great attraction of the evening was the fancy drink Grandma and Mommy ordered- a volcano, which comes with a a real flaming volcano at the center. The boys have been very into volcanos because of the Magic School Bus (and Andy's interest in dinosaurs!), so to have one brought to the table was an adventure! The drink comes with very long straws, and Andy kept trying to sneak sips of \"Grandma's juice.\" She gave him the fruit, and he apparently really, really liked it.  the other attraction for the evening was Joey's loose teeth. HIs new teeth are already peeping through behind his baby teeth, and now the two bottom teeth are very loose. He thinks its funny to wiggle them! I was a little freaked by the shark's teeth, but apparently that can happen.

{"date": "Thursday, May 08, 2008", "body": "\nIn all the bumbling and fumbling these last two weeks, our special ed director decided to change the date of the next Parent Advisory Committee meeting. The problem was that he needed us to look over the upcoming budget before presenting it to the school board, and the board meeting was this coming Tuesday, and our next scheduled meeting was this coming Thursday. Apparently he emailed me a couple weeks ago about this, and I missed that message; then I emailed folks to ask when our meeting was scheduled, since I had forgotten to write it down, and was trying not to change the date on everybody. It finally got changed to today, 7pm.  Of course, today was a very bad day. That's why we didn't schedule it originally for today. Allan is out of town, so my attendance was a no-go. People had soccer games. Final exams. Doctor appointments. Child-care arrangements. There was a reason we didn't schedule it for today.  I live in the south. Not the deep south, but I am south of the Rappahannock, so it counts. For those of you unfamiliar with the ways of southern life and ladies, there is a tradition of being slightly vague in our language. Instead of saying \"no,\" we say, \"I'd rather not\" or \"wouldn't this be better?\" Instead of saying \"I am going to bring a tape recorder to this meeting,\" we say \"Do mind if I bring a recorder to the meeting?\" So \"I probably can't come, honey\" is the polite way of saying \"Do not expect me to come.\" More directly, for you real northerners or literal-minded folks, the translation is, \"I am not coming.\"  When I sent around messages about the meeting, I made sure to include my polite notice that I was unable to attend on such short notice. Now, I probably could have gotten my mom to watch the boys, that wasn't really the issue; my real issue was just coming off of grading and two weeks of no husband and a variety of other stressors, and I just couldn't deal with the stress of dealing with folks who haven't bothered to show up for meetings all year suddenly asking/demanding that one be rescheduled, knowing there would be complaints about short notice from parents and about lack of attendance from the people who hadn't been attending. But almost all of my messages included something to the effect of \"I probably can't come.\"  At 7:15pm, I had two small boys in the bathtub reciting their new favorite chant (neeeee....kid.... BwuUTS!!!) covered in bubble beards and bubble \"snow\", while I tracked down appropriate sleep clothes and underwear. The phone rings. Without looking or answering, I just  knew  who it was. Yep. You guessed it.  \"We're waiting for you to start the meeting!\" came the pleading voice from the other end of the line. Waiting for someone who is probably not coming? Why? Even if taken literally, I would think such a phrase would deter you from awaiting a person who is  probably  not coming.  I now have an email from a parent who went to go to the meeting, and couldn't find it. Another parent who didn't go at all. Two of the other parents couldn't go from the get-go. And I was out of action. That leaves three regulars, and I have no idea if they went or not. Looking into my crystal ball, I foresee more long, whiny diatribes about how parents don't participate enough.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/missed.html", "title": "\nMissed\n"},

The run-off is far worse than before- al the new asphalt and house seed- but hopefully some of it will get to the aquafers. One can hope.  So a week after an exciting beach weekend, the boys spend Mom's Day Weekend stuck in the house. It's been chilly rain, so going out in it is a definite no. Besides, there are echoes of coughs haunting the night here. Just what we'd need is full-blown spring colds.  We are also entering IEP season here. Well, when it rains, it pours, right? I ran into school to have a quick \"pre-IEP meeting\" with Joey's teacher, so that she's be aware of things we are concerned about. I think she's learned quick that I do not like surprises at IEP meetings. It was an interesting chat, partly because we were trying to figure out what the school OT could possibly do given her limited skills set, and partly because I got another glimpse of the kinds of things he does at school that he doesn't do for me. Like get his shoes and socks on. Make choices. Voice favorites.  I am looking forward to Joey spending more time in an inclusion room, even for just the more focused activities like reading groups and math circles. We're going to start him in there with the reading group, and then add the math around Christmas. I think we're looking for lots of expressive speech goals, attending goals, social skills, and sensory self-regulation. Things to make him successful in school, and in getting on in the world.  In the meantime, a house has come available down the street that has a basement apartment and a mother-in-law house. Its a bit out of range for us right now, but I thought I might take a peek anyway.

{"date": "Wednesday, May 14, 2008", "body": "\nOne thing about being a special needs parent is the constant attention it requires. I mentioned last time about not being able to just put the kids outside and fix dinner; in fact, not only an you not do that, but if you put the child outside, often you have to be out there engaging them. Children like Joey have few tools for entertaining himself. He cannot just think up something to do. Activities must be structured and organized for him to be able to participate. What will he do if I don't pay constant attention? Well, I found him in the middle of the street once. Screaming is popular. Tracking is a great favorite. That may be all fine and dandy, except that he gets frustrated with not being able to engage himself. Boredom is a terrible thing.  Another thing is the decided lack of sleep. I am not alone; most of the special needs parents I know suffer from the lack of sleep. I can't tell you the last time I slept four hours straight through. Children need covers adjusted. They need to crawl into bed with you. For other families, there are seizures to worry about, real sleep issues to deal with, medical procedures and medications to administer and all sorts of fun things in the night.  I've been seeing a lot of the doctor recently. Before Christmas, I had an episode of severe  costochondritis , and it has persisted ever since. My asthma has returned with a vengeance. I have a bug bite that won't go away. I tried to lose some weight, and ended up gaining some instead (and I cannot afford to gain a single ounce!). Now I apparently have picked up  PVCs .

With all likelihood, I will stare at the bottle for a few days while my mom quizzes me twice a day about whether I've started them yet, I actually have an excuse to delay, because she also put me on allergy meds, and I have to make sure those won't have side effects before I can start the pills.

{"date": "Friday, May 23, 2008", "body": "\nIn our runs and reruns up and down the road between here and Baltimore (yes, I know Stimey, all those miles and I haven't stopped in to meet you. Bad Joeymom. Bad. No doughnut.) my mom and I have been getting in some good chat-time. We talk about Joey a lot. We talk about autism. We have slightly different views of autism, but I think both perspectives are good for helping Joey.  One thing we've been talking about is the fine distinctions in our experience of autism. Where is that line between social construct and \"real\" disability? At one point does one take stock of limitations and deal with them?  I know that there are people- including several of you all- who believe that all disability is social construct. I find that view interesting, and sometimes helpful. However, it isn't jiving with my experience. If Joey was perfectly happy and fulfilled not speaking, not being able to interact with his peers, not being able to self-regulate, well, maybe I would think differently. But I see the frustration. I see the struggle. I see the work he puts in, the enthusiasm, the desire; and the (very upsetting to him) fail. And the increasingly rarer Epic Fail.  For us, Joey is Joey. He's my son. I want to help him learn to be happy, help him succeed, help him be the person he wants to be. He's only six years old. Helping him become that person is part of my job as a Mom. Choosing who that person will be is Joey's job. If he wants to be a marine biologist and swim with dolphins, then by God, I am going to do everything I can to help him succeed in becoming a marine biologist and swim with dolphins. What will he need to succeed? How can I help?  I have navigated the world of academia. We can argue about how social skills should or shouldn't be necessary, but they are. Speaking shouldn't be a requirement, but effective communication is a must. Melting down because he can't have a blue folder is not going to be acceptable behavior when he reaches college or grad school. He is going to have to communicate to his professors that he understands what they are trying to teach him.  Enter occupational therapy and speech therapy. OT helps him self-regulate, helps him learn to interact with others, learn how to control his own body and perform important tasks for daily living, such as following instructions and coping with overload. Speech therapy should never be just about speaking- it is about communicating. For us, it is more about speaking because Joey now speaks, but I'm firmly in the camp of it being about communication first and foremost. A speech therapist who can't use AT isn't very helpful for an awful lot of kids who need it to communicate, or even springboard into speech.  When we start talking about the need to teach Joey to speak and interact, remember most kids learn these things by natural imitation and assimilation. Most kids do not have lessons in how to ask another child to play on the playground. They figure it out by walking up to other kids and testing some strategies they saw other kids or adults use. They figure out which ones work best for them, and go for it. Joey has lessons, practicing carefully with other children in staged and controlled situations. He never figured out how to do it on his own (though he tried hard- he just loves other kids!) As Joey's communication skills and social skills increase, his ability to imitate and assimilate also increases- he can figure out more things on his own, because he gathers tools for figuring things out on his own. Just as he learned to speak initially by imitating Oobi- then shifting the words or inserting words to fit what he saw around him (making the scripting nearly transparent to those not familiar with Joey and Oobi)- Joey incorporates the rehearsed interactions and alters them to fit the situation at hand. Slowly, the rehearsing will become transparent, as it does for us all.  So where is the fine line? Is Joey disabled, or is here a social construct that results in his own frustration? Is apraxia a real disability, or just a label we slap on him to keep him in special ed? If it is just a social construct, should I be able to break down that construct and have him be happy- or is it instead a real disability, that needs to be addressed (usually by therapy) and supported (via accommodations and educational strategies)? If I tore down the construct, would Joey be happy? Or would he remain frustrated with his struggle to communicate?  Perhaps I should take up the issue of how many different ways we can view a single person, how many facets we can juggle, how we can use a variety of lenses and perspectives, and still be considering the same person. Joey is Joey. When I walk into an IEP meeting, what does that mean? When he crawls into my bed at night? When I take him to the zoo? When I take him to the store? When I visit him in school? When he sits down to eat his dinner? Yes, he remains the same Joey, but I have to consider different aspects, different needs, different roles.  After all, I'm a mom, a wife, a daughter, a blonde, a niece, a sister, a Virginian, a professor, a student, a woman, a rater, a score leader, a Caucasian, a chairperson, a PhD, a researcher, a genealogist, a citizen, an American, a patient, a customer, a client... what is real? what is a construct?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/fine-lines.html", "title": "\nFine lines\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, May 24, 2008", "body": "\n Holy crap . What does the Florida state attorney's office consider emotional child abuse???  Not only was Alex Barton emotionally abused, but so was his entire class.  There's alot of buzz about how this child may have autism, and that autism caused behavioral issues, and this incident stems from those issue and behaviors.  I don't give a flying flip  if he was from Mars and spit on the grave of the teacher's grandmother. You don't use a classroom of children to publicly humiliate a child. If having every peer a child has stand in front of him and tell him that he is not liked for various specific reasons and then vote him out of the class isn't emotional child abuse, folks,  what the hell is ??? It isn't like he wasn't just in the principal's office, for pete's sake! Don't you think he was already appropriately reprimanded? Do you have rub his nose into the dirt, too?  We always know when there has been a problematic incident at school; Joey comes home very upset, often repeating phrases such as \"You're going to Ms. T!\" or \"Do you need to see Ms. T?\" or \"Ms. T... room 44.\" Ms. T is our principal (whom he actually calls Ms. T- I'm not hiding her name for FERPA. That is Joey's name for her.) We had a pretty long stretch after Christmas when it was so bad, and he was so perseverative on this, that I called and asked if he had been sent to Ms. T for something. He hadn't.  But other students in the class had. Some of them go quite regularly, even when in self-contained situations. If the strategies for dealing with behavior run out, that is where a student must go, so everyone is safe and the situation can be addressed. However, it doesn't just impact the student in distress; it also distresses the classmates- including Joey.  All of those students were part of beating up on a classmate. How many of them now live in fear that they may be next?  So I don't even see this as one count of child abuse. This was an assault on an entire classroom of children, with Alex Barton as the focus. If our current information is correct, and the teacher  confirmed  that this incident occurred, I have no idea why she remains employed. Even if the police do not know abuse when they see it, surely the school administration can clearly see a case of intentional causing of emotional distress in a child? Surely immediate suspension for a investigation is warranted? And if our information is, in fact, correct, a speedy dismissal?  Why aren't all the parents- not just Alex Barton's- up at arms about this, calling for this teacher's immediate dismissal? If this was either of my kids, they would not be returned to that class for any reason. And if immediate action wasn't taken, I'd be thinking \"lawsuit\" too. ***************** Since Google seems to have picked up on this post (thus channeling a good bit of new traffic to this post), allow me to direct folks to some other excellent posts on the subject.

She got up and made us breakfast every day. She made dinners. Every day, the floors were vacuumed and mopped, the furniture dusted, and often the bathrooms scrubbed. I remember being sick from school, watching her work. On top of that, she did other jobs during the day, running errands, fixing things, needful projects. And she volunteered for school. As I got older, she volunteered elsewhere, too. She took us to the Smithsonian on weekends (when I was very little, we lived in PG County. When we got older, we kept going, just not as often.) She had watercolor paints, or playdough, or clay, or other projects for us to do. We spent a lot of time in the kitchen when I was the age of my boys. When we got older, we spent a lot of time out in the woods.  I wish I was more like my mom. My kids eat an awful lot of hot dogs and not enough pot roast (even with my crockpot, which my mom didn't have). My house? Disaster city. I have lots of materials for projects. They spend a lot of time in boxes or plastic bins. I have a \"to do\" of needful projects a mile long. My vacuum cleaner spends weeks in silence in the back hall (not even the closet where it belongs).  But I do my best. And one thing my mom taught me is that if you have the opportunity to try something new, try it. If an elephant presents itself, climb on its back. I think Joey is picking up on the lesson quite well- and trying new things is a great strength to have.

{"date": "Thursday, May 29, 2008", "body": "\nYes, IEPs are upon us. Thank GOD ours is over, and went smooth as glass. We'll keep our eyes open and be our usual little IEP-Meeting-Calling owls all year, but for now, the Big One is done. For a lot of folks, it is about to begin.  And so I offer here my Helpful Guide to IEP Season. Please just add your own tips in the comments- what helped you?  1. Know your child. Most years, we have actually put together a Powerpoint presentation outlining who Joey is, our big picture long-term goals, strengths, weaknesses, and our suggestions for goals. We stud it with pictures and movie clips, so that Joey is not just a name on a piece of paper being shuffled around a table. He becomes a real person, and the focus remains on his needs and success. Yes, the staff will groan when you show up with your laptop and presentation. Show it. Do it first.  2. Read  From Emotions to Advocacy . If you haven't done that, and you have an IEP coming, go do that now. Really. Step away from the computer and go read it.  3. Get your stuff together. Since you did your homework and read  From Emotions to Advocacy , you know to go out an buy a big binder, and put everything in it. Get a few binders. You may need a new one each year. Lots of paper is pushed in special ed.  4. Know what you want. This is probably the hardest, because who comes into this an expert on their kid's disability? It is worth becoming one. Short on time? If you have an autistic child, I recommend looking into physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Know what these fields do, and how they might benefit your child. Next, look up teaching strategies, such as ABA, floortime, TEACCH, pivotal response training, etc. and consider how they might (and might not) help your child. Ask if the teachers are familiar with these strategies. Then, look up sensory integration and sensory perception, and ask about sensory integration, sensory diet, and sensory accommodations. Are the staff trained to deal with sensory issues? What accommodations can they recommend?  5. Take someone with you. I have found having private therapists at the meeting makes a big difference- you have folks there on your side, paid to look after the interests of your child, with professional expertise to make educated and appropriate suggestions. Other people like other parents, or even hire professional advocates. Stack the team in favor of your child. If you have any inklng of doubt that your school personnel are not going to be batting for your child, get the room full of people whose only concern is your child's success and wellbeing.  6. Bring a tape or digital recorder. Record the entire meeting. Most districts require written notice that you will be doing this. Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to inform you that I will be audiorecording the meeting on (date) in order to have a full record of (child)'s educational planning process. Yours, (You).  7. Don't panic. You don't have to sign the IEP the day of  the meeting- take it home, look it over, take it to your private team. No worries. Even if you sign it, you can call a new meeting and change it.  Thats my advice to our new and near-new parents. I'm not too far from newbie-dom myself, so as I said before, comments are open. Advice is greatly appreciated.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fetaweb.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/crazy-season.html", "title": "\nThe Crazy Season\n"},

{"date": "Monday, June 02, 2008", "body": "\nWhen do you tell people your child has autism? How do you explain autism and being autistic?  Joey goes to Sunday School. We haven't gone quite as much lately, because the new building is full of new chairs and new carpets and all the sizing and chemicals that go with new carpet and new upholstery, and apparently I am allergic to it. But he goes.  There were multiple purposes for him attending Sunday school. Primarily, it provides him some religious instruction. That has become less of a reason because the instruction I have been seeing isn't what I was hoping for- it looks far more Baptist than Methodist, and we're a very Methodist family. It also places him in a \"normal\" setting with non-disabled children. That has gone OK so far; we met with his Sunday School Supervisor and the teachers last year, though this years' teachers haven't been as willing to be trained. Being pat of a church gives him a church family, and a possible support network as he gets older. Also, we have a \"contemporary\" service and Joey liked to go drum and listen to the music, which we also haven't done lately. When they moved to the new building, it really threw him off, and he's had to start from scratch in getting used to the room again. With my allergies, he hasn't had much opportunity, either.  The Sunday School is fairly informal, with children coming and going depending on whether their parents decided to go to church, including guests from elsewhere. There are regulars like us, and then there are other random kids that come and go, or new families who move in and join.  Usually after Sunday School, we go get some McD's for lunch and try to talk about what they learned-mostly Bible stuff (If you aren't Methodist, you might not understand why I find that interesting enough to note. In other Methodist churches, Sunday School consisted of using modern material to discuss Biblical ideas. You didn't learn the Good Samaritan, you learned stories about modern children who helped their families and neighbors in all sorts of [mostly mundane] ways, thus providing a model for appropriate behavior and values). The boys usually like being in Sunday School and are often in good moods after.  But not yesterday. Yesterday, when I dropped the guys off, they were in pretty good moods; but when I picked them up, Joey was \"sad\". His teachers said he had been sad all morning. As usually, they had no idea why. However, I had an inkling- a new child was in the room when I dropped him off, and when Joey echoed something at the child, the child had objected (Joey;s very into races and winning races this weekend, and the child told him point blank \"But there's no race!\" when Joey tried to include him.) From talking to Joey, apparently that was not the end of the incident, and his friend Lucy (a little girl who has been in Joey's Sunday School class for over a year now) intervened (\"She played with me\").  This is a problem we encounter more in Sunday School than I was originally expecting- partly from my own naivete. I have seen several children not only actively avoid Joey, but being encouraged to do so by their parents. When you mention that Joey is autistic, their faces go hard, and the avoidance is redoubled. Joey's old Sunday School teachers would regularly remind students about autism and that Joey needed do \"do his own thing\" like move around the room and write instead of draw. (These reminders also served to educate new class members). These teachers seem to want to ignore it. Their idea of inclusion is to simply treat all the kids the same, and since Joey is so \"high functioning\", hope that he blends in enough to be OK.  The result is that some kids accept him, especially ones that are used to him. And some kids think he's really weird, and avoid him. And some kids think he's so weird, they tell him what they think of his weirdness- and this makes Joey sad.  I think asking Joey to change and \"be like everyone else\" is unreasonable and undesirable. However, leaving him to the wolves to fend for himself against kids who have never dealt with a disabled peer is also not fair- not to Joey, and not to the other child. After all, when they ostracize Joey, they miss having a cool friend! Though I don't want Joey labeled and seen only for his autism, I don't want him to be excluded by his peers because of ignorance if I can help it. So which approach to take? Telling people he is autistic, or trying to let him \"blend in\"?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/to-reveal-or-not-to-reveal-that-is.html", "title": "\nTo reveal or not to reveal: that is the question\n"},

I liked bubble gum OK, and it was fun, but there were some kids I knew who chewed it extensively, as  Violet Beauregarde  extensively.

For a while we got it at Target, and that was fine. They had the yummy chocolate kind, and Joey really liked that. Then Target switched to the yucky liquid-filled kind and no more chocolate; we went to CVS and found our treasure, though only in strawberry or watermelon. So be it. But now they've gone to tape or liquid-filled. So the hunt is on... where to find bubble gum in a consistent supply? Why doesn't any one store sell the whole selection of bubble gum? Am I going to be reduced to ordering it online, where you have to buy it in bulk (I wasn't thinking I was going to need to make a sudden $75 investment in bubble gum!)

{"date": "Thursday, June 19, 2008", "body": "\nThe  Commonwealth  of Virginia  is proposing changes  to the  Virginia special education regulations -  dangerous changes  that threaten to exclude parents from important parts of the process. With the new changes, children above the age 5 will not be able to be categorized as \"developmentally delayed\" and services can be terminated  without parent consent . These changes being made under the excuse of complying with with IDEA... but in fact, they go directly against the purpose of including parents and serving children with disabilities based on individual need instead of diagnosis! Some months ago, parent organizations in Northern Virginia got together and put together comments to protest the changes. They invited parents to use their comments as a framework- or even just change \"we\" to \"I\"- and send them in to voice our protest. The public comment period ends June 30.  Please check out my links above, and then let the Virginia Department of Education know how you feel about these changes to Virginia law:  Email: ReviseSpedRegs@doe.virginia.gov  Address: Special Education Regulations Revision Process Office of Dispute Resolution and Administrative Services  Virginia Department of Education  P.O. Box 2120  Richmond, Virginia 23218-2120 Fax: (804) 786-8520 Here is what I sent in, based on the Fairfax comments with my own commentary added:  As a parent of a disabled child, I am extremely concerned and dismayed by many of the proposed changes to the Commonwealth of Virginia\u2019s special education regulations. These regulations and policies are intended to ensure my child\u2019s rights are respected and protected. As his parent, legally responsible for protecting those rights and acting in his best interests, I am concerned that so many of the proposed changes seem to threaten my ability and right to protect my child and ensure his rights as a human being are respected and honored.  The purpose of the IDEA is to ensure children with disabilities are treated as human beings, just as their non-disabled peers are. In the IDEA, children are with disabilities are guaranteed a free and appropriate education that meets their unique needs and prepares them for further education, employment, and independent living.  Thus far, Virginia has been at the forefront of protecting those rights and promoting the necessary parent-school partnership for protecting those rights. This essential partnership ensures that child such as my own child have access to appropriate services and support. Without this relationship, schools and parents lose important information and cooperation for understanding the needs of any child and appropriately serving and supporting them and educating them. The proposed changes threaten this relationship by threatening Virginia\u2019s historic guarantee of parental rights in special education. The Virginia Board of Education must not allow this roll back of civil rights in Virginia for children with disabilities and parents, such as me, who advocate for them.  It is my understanding that the IDEA requires parent consent as a matter of ensuring parent involvement, and thus recognizes the essential role of parent involvement, advocacy, and support in ensuring the rights of children with disabilities. The spelled-out right of consent to changes in an IEP and termination of services are currently Virginia-specific. They were added to clarify the intended partnership between parents and schools. It makes no sense to exclude part of an IEP team- especially the sole member of the team whose natural role is direct representation of the child- from important decisions such as changes to that agreed IEP.  The current proposal deletes important Virginia-specific parental rights and protections under the argument that it is respecting Part B if the IDEA 2004 to \u201cminimize the number of rules, regulations and policies to which local educational agencies and schools are subject.\u201d This is not a specific mandate of the IDEA, but a general theme of federal legislation. The changes proposed actually move to defeat the mandate of the IDEA: to ensure children with disabilities a free and appropriate education.  Regulations promulgated by the federal government are considered a bare minimum standard for states to follow. States can, and regularly do, exceed federal regulations because the respond to the needs of their particular citizens, which is their right. Minimizing rules, regulations, and policies must not mean elimination of long-standing Virginia-specific rights currently guaranteed to the Commonwealth\u2019s citizens.  Below I address specific concerns with the proposed Regulations Governing Special Education Programs for Children with Disabilities in Virginia. These specific concerns address area which have historically guaranteed the rights of children with disabilities and their parents, and are essential in providing all children with disabilities the free and appropriate education that is their right.  1.  Parent Consent Provisions    Parental Consent to the Termination of Services:  [8 VAC 20-81-90, provision of existing regulation, not included]    I oppose the elimination of the current requirement that a parent consent to the termination of special education eligibility and related services.  I thoroughly contest the claim that Virginia\u2019s guarantee of the parental right of consent to the termination of services is particularly burdensome or costly to schools; removing this right on consent to termination instead places schools in a position of conflict of interest, where the child\u2019s rights conflict with a school\u2019s budget, and goes directly against the mandate of the IDEA.    Virginia has historically recognized the essential parental right to participate in any decision on the continued services of their child because this right of consent:    1. Ensures that the best interests of the child are served,   2. Guarantees that the parent is treated as a full and equal member of the IEP team as required by IDEA,  3. Protects the integrity of the IEP team process outlined in IDEA,   4. Prevents schools from making eligibility and service termination decisions by fiat and not by the consensus of the IEP team as intended by IDEA, and  5. Acts as a counterbalance to the pressure on school personnel to eliminate children from their special education services due to limited school district resources.    Without the right of consent to the partial or full termination of services, parents would be unable to prevent local education agencies (LEAs) from ending services when it is not in the best interest of the child.  Practically speaking, the fear of termination may also force parents to accept less adequate IEPs and services, which goes directly against the purpose and intent of the IDEA.  In addition, disabilities are by nature lifelong conditions; services should not be removed simply because the child has improved (no matter how slightly).  Parental Consent to Services for Transfer Students:  [8 VAC 20-81-120, provision of existing regulation, not included]    I oppose the elimination of the current requirement for parental consent prior to providing special education services to transfer students.  The proposed regulations would require only a \u201cconsultation\u201d with the parent.  Such a proposal could permit an LEA to implement an IEP that does not offer comparable services to the student\u2019s previous school district.  Parents would have no ability to  require an LEA to come to consensus on the delivery of services upon transfer, as is otherwise required in the development and amendment of existing IEPs.  2.  Child Study Committees [8 VAC 20-81-50, provision of existing regulation, not included]    I opposs the elimination of Child Study Committees as currently required in the existing regulations.  VDOE\u2019s proposal to leave the referral procedures up to LEAs removes the protection of timelines and the guarantee that parents will participate in the referral process.  The proposal also eliminates the requirement that classroom interventions not delay the evaluation.  This endangers the right of a child to receive appropriate service and support in a timely manner.   Existing Child Study Committee requirements outlining the procedures LEAs must use to refer students for special education ensure consistency in the application process across all Virginia jurisdictions and are vital to parents\u2019 understanding of and participation in the referral process. Consistent referral procedures also ensure that LEAs do not set additional timelines that unduly extend the time between when a child is referred for services and a parent consents to an evaluation.  3.  Functional Behavioral Assessments (FBAs) [8 VAC 20-81-10, pg. 27-28]    I oppose permitting the process of developing a Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) to be merely a review of existing data that does not require input of the parent.  The regulations should  clearly state that an FBA is \u201can evaluation that consists of a systematic collection and analysis of direct and indirect data, and may include a review of existing data.\u201d  It is the frequent experience of parents that schools conduct FBAs in name only, failing to explore the actual function of a child\u2019s behavior and hastily compiling previous observations into a paper trail to justify disciplinary action.  Failure to  effectively investigate behavior which impedes learning defeats the purpose of the FBA to change such behavior and allow the student to participate as much as possible in a least restrictive environment.  To  determine an appropriate Behavioral Implementation Plan (BIP), a formal FBA must be conducted, and for an assessment to be effective, the parents must participate as a matter of parental consent.  (For additional discussion of FBAs, see #10.)  Parents often have information vital for implementing an effective and appropriate FBA; this information may not be immediately apparent by simple observation or review of existing data. Many disabilities that effect behavior are not immediately apparent. Misinterpretation of behavior can result in ineffective and inappropriate FBAs, and thus eliminate a child\u2019s access to a free and appropriate education.  4.  Transition [8 VAC 20-81-110, pg. 155]    I support the continued allowance in the proposed regulation that directs transition services be put into effect when the child turns 14, two years younger than the federal guideline.  Parents and children need to plan for postsecondary goals well before the age of 16 in order to devise a correct curriculum that aims to improve long-term outcomes and to accumulate necessary information for decision making on further education, employment and independent living.  5.  Timelines [8 VAC 20-81-60, pg. 97]    I oppose the proposed 65 business day timeline for an eligibility decision rather than adhering to the federal guideline of 60 days from the date of parental consent for evaluation.  This proposal could cause a child with a disability to wait an additional 4 weeks longer than allowed by the federal guideline to be found eligible.  Intended by federal law to prevent a child who may need services from waiting unnecessarily to receive them, the 60 day limit provides ample time for an evaluation in most cases.    In those instances where additional time may be necessary to produce the required data, the I recommend parent consent should be sought to extend the limit by a maximum of 10 additional  business days.  In addition, this timeline should apply to both initial evaluations and reevaluations.  I further recommend that a clear time limit be established from date of referral to the date of parent consent for an evaluation so that an LEA does not attempt to unduly extend the timeframe.  6.  Developmental Delay [8 VAC 20-81-80, pg. 121]    I oppose limiting the developmental delay category to the ages of 3 to 5 and recommend the IDEA 2004 definition of developmental delay from the ages of 3 to 9.  The developmental delay label is especially important for young children who exhibit deficits and require early intervention, but who may not be easily categorized.  These children benefit from maintaining the developmental delay label and delaying a decision on the determination of their essential disability.  Rushing to label a child\u2019s disability may have serious long term repercussions on that child\u2019s education and emotional development. Labeling children for convenience of policy or law is extremely dangerous and senseless.  7.  Definition of Autism [8 VAC 20-81-10, pgs. 12-13]  I recommend that the proposed Virginia regulation defining autism reflect that of federal regulation, which states, \"A child who manifests the characteristics of autism after age three could be identified as having autism if the criteria in this definition are satisfied.\"  [Italics added.]  Virginia regulations have substituted the word \"diagnosed\" for \"identified\" and is an improper term to use for educational purposes.  School personnel are not qualified to make medical diagnoses.  8.  Eligibility Criteria [8 VAC 20-81-80, pg. 119-120]    I strongly oppose including any eligibility criteria for disability categories in the regulations that exceed those specifically defined in the federal regulations.  Such overreaching provisions may work to the disadvantage of children who would otherwise qualify for services as a child with a disability.  For example, by defining the criteria for eligibility under autism, the proposed regulations may exclude children with an autism spectrum disorder who do not fit the narrow diagnostic criteria contained in the proposed regulations.  Federal law includes autism as a covered disability under IDEA; it does not  endeavor to define the various educational criteria for the autism disability as a spectrum disorder.   Furthermore, if VDOE sets specific criteria for autism, which it has not done previously, it will be taking away flexibility from LEAs in making individual eligibility determinations.  Autistic spectrum disorders are particularly difficult to categorize because of the wide diversity of skills and disabilities presented by people with autistic spectrum disorders. Removing the flexibility from LEAs in making individual eligibility determination will threaten the rights of children who, though disabled, do not fit into neatly defined categories and diagnoses.    9.  Definitional Terms for Disabilities [8 VAC 20-81-10, pgs. 36, 24-25]    I recommend use of the term \u201cemotional disability\u201d rather than \u201cemotional disturbance.\u201d  The term \u201cemotional disability\u201d conveys less negative stigma on the child than \u201cemotional disturbance,\u201d while summarizing the nature of the eligibility that it is intended to denote.   Similarly, I recommend the regulations use the term \u201cintellectual disability\u201d in place of \u201cmental retardation.\u201d  The term is outdated and offensive to many as it use in general language has become too extremely pejorative to be useful in designating or summarizing any disability of any kind.  Use of the term \u201cmental retardation\u201d tends to lower expectations of educators on children who meet the criteria for the disability.    10.  Discipline Procedures [8 VAC 20-81-160, pg. 183-195]    I opposs elimination of the current requirement for the IEP team to convene to conduct an FBA and implement or modify a behavioral plan for any child with a disability under a long-term removal.  Students with disabilities whose behavior warrants such removals need greater intervention from their IEP teams, not less.  IEP teams must act proactively to determine the causes of behavior and plan ways to prevent future episodes that prevent the student from being successful.    In addition, I oppose elimination of the current provision that states students who are short- term removed should be provided services that enable the child to appropriately progress, not just participate in the general education curriculum.  Services provided for such students are already grossly inadequate, and the student\u2019s disciplinary problems are greatly compounded by the failure to meet the child\u2019s educational needs.  The proposed regulatory change would eliminate all requirements on local school divisions to attempt to remedy this shortcoming.  11.  IEP Progress Reports [8 VAC 20-81-110, pg. 154, provision of existing regulation, not included]    I oppose the proposed elimination of the current requirement that IEP progress reports be provided for students with disabilities at least as often as periodic report cards are provided to non- disabled students.  There is no justification for the change in providing progress reports to students with disabilities less frequently than they are provided to students without disabilities. In fact, recording and sharing data about students with disabilities is vital in documenting the student\u2019s measurable progress.  12.  Short Term Objectives [8 VAC 20-81-110, pg. 151]  I recommend the regulations clarify that IEP teams must consider including short-term objectives or \u201cbenchmarks\u201d for all students.  Unless consideration of these objectives is included on the IEP meeting agenda checklist, these useful tools will go unused, much to the loss of students with disabilities for whom benchmarks are necessary to determine if their educational program is actually working.  As every good teacher knows, reaching IEP goals is unlikely without short-term objectives.  13.  Prior Written Notice [8 VAC 20-81-170, pgs. 201-202, provision of existing regulation, not  included]    I strongly oppose the proposed limitations in relation to current regulation on when schools need to provide Prior Written Notice.  Prior Written Notice is one of the few ways that parents can get their questions answered by reluctant schools before entering the procedures leading to due process and must not be chipped away from the existing rights of parents in Virginia. Prior Written Notice not only protects parents, it also protects schools.  14.  Due Process Hearing System [8 VAC 20-81-210, pg. 234-264]    I strongly oppose removing appointment of due process hearing officers from a list maintained by the Supreme Court of Virginia and shifting responsibility for the entire hearing system exclusively to VDOE.  The proposed change presents a possible conflict of interest and would improperly create a non-independent judicial system which could not guarantee the impartiality of hearing officers that is required by IDEA.    Furthermore, I oppose the elimination of the current requirement to develop and submit an implementation plan following the rendering of a due process decision or the withdrawal of a hearing request.  The proposal that VDOE be provided by the LEA, upon request, with documentation that the area(s) have been corrected is only an after-the-fact requirement upon school divisions.  Parents would no longer have the assurance of written guidance or timelines so that they know when to expect corrections to occur and ensure their child receives FAPE. Implementation plans ensure that changes are made in an effective and timely manner.  15.  Special Education Advisory Committee Guidelines [8 VAC 20-81-230, pg. 273-274]    LEA participation on local advisory committees:  I oppose the change in the proposed regulations that would allow LEA personnel to act as voting members on local advisory committees.  A conflict of interest would prevent LEA employees  from acting in a truly independent capacity.  In addition, the proposal thwarts the purpose of the advisory committee, which is to offer honest critiques of the LEA\u2019s special education policies and programs.  It is hard to see how a member of the advisory committee who also works for the LEA could operate effectively if the member had to consider his or her employer when weighing in on committee deliberations, decisions, and recommendations.    Gender and ethnic restrictions on membership of local advisory committees:  I opposs the proposed requirement that local advisory committees reflect the gender and ethnic makeup of the local school division.  This proposed requirement is highly discriminatory against women in their roles as advocates for their children.  Women also make up the majority of professionals in education and volunteers on local PTAs. Such a gender requirement is not imposed upon LEAs in hiring administrators, teachers and other professionals, nor is this gender requirement typically made of other school board advisory committees.    I further oppose the proposed requirement that local advisory committees reflect the ethnic makeup of the local school division.  This requirement is so vague as to be unusable.  For example, in  many areas of Northern Virginia, the ethnic diversity is so broad that it is not uncommon to see more than 50 different cultures represented in a single school.  Even if the appropriate volunteers among parents of children with disabilities could be found, a local advisory committee that contained a representation of every ethnic group in the City of Fredericksburg would create an entity whose size would completely paralyze and render it useless. Additionally, parents and guardians do not necessarily share ethnicity with their children or the children for whom they are advocating (such as foster children), so even if all parents volunteered, the ethnic makeup of the school division may not be represented, depending on how it is to be determined.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.doe.virginia.gov/", "http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/dueproc/regulationsCWD.html", "http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/dueproc/proposed_regs.pdf", "http://www.wrightslaw.com/virginia/regs.index.htm"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/changes-to-virginia-sped-regulations.html", "title": "\nChanges to Virginia SPED Regulations\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 23, 2008", "body": "\nSo I signed Joey and andy up for Vacation Bible School. This year our church is doing a sort of  tableaux vivant ish \"Jerusalem Marketplace\" thing. We all get into costumes and run around learning about what life was like during Holy Week. Joey has trouble relating to and learning social studies, so I thought it might be good for him to have all the multi-sensory stimulation to relate to.  We ran into several issues. One, I had to volunteer as a class adult to be sure Joey's sensory issues were considered, such as breaks and gum and whatever he might need. I was placed in his class so I could take him solo if need be. That's fine. But it turns out that the other adult helper is also there because of  her  special needs kid. We can't very well  both  run off solo with our kids should needs arise and leave the class leader with ten kids all by herself! We are also the only room that didn't get some of the high-school-age church members as extra aides. Figures.  Two, the change in schedule, though I had been warning Joey and trying to prep him for it all week, almost lead to complete meltdown. The idea of going to church on Monday was just too much for Joey to handle. He repeated \"Church on Monday... No church on Monday! That's silly! Church on Sunday!\" for a good deal of the morning. This is actually unusual for Joey, who usually takes schedule shifts in stride with a little warning.  Three, we all gather first in the sanctuary, and the chaos is deafening. Andy just about had a meltdown when we hit the door. Fortunately, Joey's speech therapist is a member of our church and was helping in Andy's tribe/class today, so she snatched him up and helped him settle and regulate.  Four, it's a church, not a school. The class \"teacher\" came completely unprepared, and hadn't even glanced over the day's lesson and scripting, so she knew less than I did about what was supposed to be going on. The whole program is kind of geared to an older kid crowd, say 3rd-5th grade, and no one seems to be prepared to gear anything to kindergardeners or preschoolers, including the crafts, games, or the explanations given for what was going on. No one seems to be trained to work with children at all. It seems to be a whole building full of adults trying to wing it.  Five, because I'm volunteering, I don't have three precious hours to myself each day this week.  The good news is the marketplace itself is gorgeous and I have seized control of the kids assigned to me, and know exactly what my little subgroup will be doing each day. I made some books about each of the major crafts they will be doing (pottery, woodworking, weaving, and basketry) so they can relate to what they will be doing before they jump in to do it. Because everyone else is winging it, I have the flexibility to not wing it. Also, I get to spend all morning with my Joey, and I get to explain things as we go along, and talk about it with him knowing what he did all morning. Also, I get to spend all morning with Joey.  Joey, all to myself.  This is going to be a  great  week.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/vacation-bible-school-day-one.html", "title": "\nVacation Bible School: Day One\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 20, 2008", "body": "\n We had a really good day today. The boys were golden. We started at Colonial Beach, where they had a good swim. JOey was pretending to be Magic School Bus characters. Andy was a crocodile. Hilarity ensued.  I spent the morning in a comfy folding beach chair collecting pretty rocks and holding Andy's collection of pretty rocks. If I had brought a glass of wine with me, it would have been perfect.  Unfortunately, another family showed up and the mom was screaming profanities at her kids (I have no idea why- they looked like they were behaving just fine to me). We decided it was time to move on (well, I decided, and the boys did not protest). We changed into clothes and headed out into the sunrise to find lunch.  We stopped at the Happy Clam, which I had several recommendations for, but now I have no idea why. It was expensive, the food was mediocre at best, and the famed desserts were not available (in high season!) No need to go back there. But the boys were good, and they did get fed, so we were off and running again.  We drove over to the Westmoreland State Park, which is lovely. Lots of camping, a park with great equipment, a pool, paddleboats, fishing... and Fossil Beach, where people find shark teeth. We decided on Fossil Beach. The hike was a challenge, but we got there and the boys just loved it. We were by ourselves, the water was warm, and there was not a tooth to be found; but the swimming and quiet was lovely. Joey was being the Magic School Bus. Andy was being a shark. Hilarity ensued.  We collected more pretty rocks, the boys did a lot of swimming, and then we trudged back to the car (a good trick with my asthma).  We beelined to the camp store for ice cream and a couple of for-sale shark teeth (next time, they will know what we are looking for!), then headed for home. The boys spent the ride home pretending to be bitten by their teeth, or pretending the teeth were their own ( look mom, my tooth fell out! My tooth is growing in! Look at my tooth! oops, it fell out! ... ) If all trips went this well, we'd have more of them. The cost of gas be damned.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SFw-OZ_2UiI/AAAAAAAAA7k/rhm7STbP5co/s1600-h/06_boys_trail.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SFw-OWGzCPI/AAAAAAAAA7s/s4Ahw1aTRW0/s1600-h/06_boys_beach.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/long-day-of-adventure.html", "title": "\nA Long Day of Adventure\n"},

Andy's class has given up on the Synagogue School part, the person running it just wasn't willing to alter her presentations to accommodate preschoolers.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 24, 2008", "body": "\nI just saw that folks were reposting favorites to welcome new traffic on the Hub. I noticed because my daily traffic just doubled today. Wowzers. Welcome, new folks checking out the Hub! And old friends checking out the latest! In fact, hello and namaste to everybody! I'm glad you stopped in for minute. And in case you are interested, I'm reposting a post I read a lot. If you think its weird for me to read my own blog, well... then I'm weird. But I knew that already.  I am going to add in more links to the original text, because I think it is fun to add in links so people can check out what you are making references to. If you'd prefer, you can check out  the original post and comments . I also now have a sidebar list of posts I like from my own blog.  I have chosen for my repost:  A long, long talk with another mom ********************************************* My best friend is a lady who lives down the street with three  hydrocephalic  boys. I\u2019ve mentioned her  before . And whenever I am feeling particularly beat up, my butt usually ends up on her couch. Needless to say, we had a long talk this morning- about  yesterday . Being a \u201cspecial needs parent\u201d is not like being another kind of parent. Apparently there are people here who don\u2019t know that, or don\u2019t want it to be a reality. But it is. Parents who do not have special needs kids really and truly have no idea what it is like to have a special needs kid, or what it is like to be a special needs parent. Most parents are living it up in  Italy , and we\u2019re over here in  Holland - or, probably more properly, India.  I love India. No, the real  India , I mean. I spent three months there, and a separate three-week trip before that. I wish I had been there longer. I\u2019ve never been to the real Holland, but I\u2019ve been to Belgium and Germany, both of which are spotlessly clean, at least in the tourist districts. They are beautiful, wonderful places\u2026 but clean. Very, very clean. And in many ways, very like places in the US.  India is a whole new world. There is dirt, grime, heat, poverty,  cows , beggars\u2026 the whole crunch of human life. Clean water comes in bottles. The hotel room uses a  geyser  for hot water, and it only will heat a couple gallons at a time, and then you use a bucket and cup to actually take the shower. Air conditioning is a rarity- as is refrigeration. In the villages, you\u2019re lucky to have running water, and you have electricity for only a few hours a day (and not consecutive hours). Paved roads are a city \u201cthing,\u201d  motor-rickshaw  is the transport of choice, and cows have the right-of-way. Living in India when you expect the standards of US living is a really big challenge.  If you spend your entire trip in India focusing on these challenges and wishing you were in an international hotel, you really miss the wonders that are India. You would miss sitting on the far side of  Sanchi  Stupa 2, in the breeze, with the scent of ashoka blossoms and the plateau stretched out below you. You would never see a  shrine  in the middle of road, draped in orange and yellow garlands and filled with carnations, while incense and the ringing of bells fill the air. No one would be able to run up to you from the local temple and offer you  prasad , or ask you to hold their baby while they take a photo. You would never see the lights of  navaratri  or the colors of a  fruit   market , stacked high in the morning. You\u2019ll never share lunch with a troop of  monkeys . If you don\u2019t go into that cave that smells of bat dung, you will never see the paintings of  Ajanta.   At the same time, what\u2019s so wrong about sometimes wishing you could stay at an international  hotel  and have a nice, gourmet dinner? Or just be homesick, wishing we were in a comfy living room with a TV, wearing our favorite pajamas? Our problem is whenever someone here mentions being homesick, we\u2019re told that India is a beautiful place, it\u2019s where we are, and we shouldn\u2019t \u201cbe that way.\u201c The Dutch and Indians often have no idea why Italy is such a big deal, and get insulted when someone wishes they had seen the  Sistine Ceiling . Did these people never wish they had won the lottery? Never wonder what life would be like if they lived in a different house? Have they never seen the  Monty Python skit  about the accountant who wants to tame lions? But we, as parents, are not permitted to be homesick. We aren\u2019t allowed to wonder about dreams we once had, or mourn their loss. After all, we\u2019re moms and dads. We\u2019re not supposed to be human\u2026 Meanwhile, my long talk with my friend\u2026 We \u201cforget\u201d that our kids are \u201cdisabled.\u201d This is just who they are. When you live in India, India is normal, and you spend weeks on end not even thinking about Italy. Our kids wouldn\u2019t be who they are if they were not disabled. On the other hand, they wouldn\u2019t need the help and support for the rest of their lives, either. Joey could play with the other kids instead of spending whole days in therapy-- basically, in school. For those of you who have forgotten, most kids like vacation a LOT better than school. But then, most kids don\u2019t scream bloody murder when they are served their spaghetti in a blue bowl instead of a red one, or when they have to go to the park instead of the pool. They can swallow their food without being taught to do so.  My friend is sometimes sad when she sees kids walking down the street, hand in hand with their mom. Her kids will never walk down the street. She will probably never know the feeling of having her children tell her \u201cI love you.\u201d She doesn\u2019t dwell on it. Her children are not a burden to her, she takes pride in every little accomplishment they achieve, she loves them and supports them. We trade phone calls: \u201cMax sat up by himself today!\u201d \u201cGreat! Joey answered a question today!\u201d \u201cHOORAY!\u201d They are our children. But there are those moments when we are reminded that life was going to be so different. We were going to have jobs, spend afternoons in the park, go for spontaneous trips to the zoo or the grocery store. It would be nice to be able to join the other parents down at the local eatery for a beer now and again. Just now and again. According to many folks who emailed me, having such thoughts and moments make us anything from mean, horrible parents to outright evil people who should give up our kids to the State for foster care. Our lives are not as scrubbed and tidy as Holland. Should I wish it were?  The real world really has dirt, and poverty, and heat, and irritation, and inconvenience. It is beautiful, anyway.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydrocephalus/detail_hydrocephalus.htm", "http://www.journeyofhearts.org/kirstimd/holland.htm", "http://www.journeyofhearts.org/kirstimd/holland.htm", "http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_india.html", "http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/holycow/hinduism.html", "http://catalogs.indiamart.com/products/gas-geyser.html", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Auto_rickshaws_in_India.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/RpVsZaOIPRI/AAAAAAAAAEo/6kDJBx4ERDc/s1600-h/Eluralaksmi.jpg", "http://www.shunya.net/Pictures/NorthIndia/Sanchi/Sanchi.htm", "http://www.sacredsites.com/asia/india/animistic_shrines.html", "http://lh4.ggpht.com/_sIeAHmNHc_0/R7A4LXUym6I/AAAAAAAAB2c/siGEZrNHDKc/IMG_0746.JPG", "http://www.webonautics.com/ethnicindia/festivals/navarathri.html", "http://www.shunya.net/Pictures/NorthIndia/Calcutta/GariahatMarket5.jpg", "http://www.shunya.net/Pictures/NorthIndia/Varanasi/VegetableSeller.jpg", "http://www.bhopal.net/march/monkeys%20at%20lunch%20at%20UP%20border.JPG", "http://www.devi.org/ajcave17.html", "http://delhi.regency.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index.jsp", "http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/CSN/CSN_Volta.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMOmB1q8W4Y"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/day-late-and-dollar-short-talk-with.html", "title": "\nA Day Late and A Dollar Short: A Talk With Another Mom\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 24, 2008", "body": "\nI arrived this morning prepared. Very prepared. Bigger cups for water. Different costume, so I could readily change and be in Tribe colors. I gave both boys a good squishing before we went in to the chaos of the Sanctuary. Bring it on.  Andy was skittish, but not a mess, and seemed happy to be back with his new friends. Joey was OK, and pleased to be allowed to carry the tribe banner. The games people were better prepared for a younger crowd. The school section still went over the heads of our group. Then we hit the Marketplace.  Yesterday, Joey loved the fishing stand, with the big wheel to spin and pretend to be on the boat. Today, the adult who had been there yesterday was gone, and it was left to a couple of 8th graders, who denied Joey access to the wheel.  The Marketplace is a bit of chaos, and it is in a gymnasium, so the echoes add to the chaotic feel. The tribes break into smaller groups, and some of the adults just let their kids run, while others (like me) try to keep grouped and at least keep tabs with their charges. I had one kid enamoured with the carpentry tent. Joey is enamoured with the fishing tent. So between crafts or while we are waiting for one kid to finish, I let the guys \"take a break\" by being where they are comfy and interested. Having the fishing area off limits when it wasn't yesterday... well, I think we can all see where this is going.  I made an error. After we made dreidels at the carpentry tent, Joey learned of the fishing area closure, and started to be upset. In an attempt to distract him, I took the boys to the herbalist and perfumer cart, away from the fishing area.  Did you catch the mistake?  Yep. Sensory overload. I added scent to the already near-overload of sound and sight. the other two boys were interested, but Joey was overwhelmed, and already upset by being denied the space he was using to calm himself (spinning that big steering wheel is very calming- the work of the spin plus the visual stim of the spinning object). Meltdown, level 1 commenced. It quickly progressed to level two.  That was the moment the \"Daily Drama\" began. Today we had a Roman soldier abusing a couple of disciples. It actually wasn't something I thought altogether well-chosen, but whatever, Joey completely missed it anyway. We were busy being squished and rubbed and trying to get him out of meltdown, and I managed to stem the tide while everyone's attention was pulled elsewhere. Once he was back to grips, he was good to go.  We also were in luck- word got around that we needed the fishing area open, and the kids who were stationed there got word, and let him in. So we got that calming in, too. Then we moved on to jewelry (except my carpentry kid- he was happy learning about carpentry tools, and the woodworker was happily teaching him, so I left him alone. He can always go back and make necklaces if he's interested.) The bead stringing forced focus, and he did one side while I did the other, and peace resumed.  The rest of the day was pretty smooth. The other adults discovered what I mean by \"Joey wanders\", but there was no danger of him escaping from the room (there is an adult soldier posted to make sure kids stay in there and don't wander off), so that was all good, and perhaps a little educational.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/vacation-bible-school-day-two.html", "title": "\nVacation Bible School: Day Two\n"},

That tells me that awareness hasn't been raised at all. Only shackles.  Several of the letters and comments say that Wendy Portillo and the school are not at fault because Alex should have been in a special class. This ignores the fact that children like Alex have a legal right to be in the least restrictive environment, that Wendy Portillo was left for  months  without appropriate training or support, and that Wendy Portillo could have gained valuable strategies for dealing with and understanding Alex with a simple Google search.

I'm adding valuable websites to my list for parents all the time (have a favorite info site? do send it along!).

We're not getting the word out. We're not getting that awareness raised. We have got to get out there and get in the faces of these people. Whatever you believe about autism, about its causes, about the strategies for dealing with autism, raising a child with autism, providing services for autistic people- folks, this case is just plain ugly.

Joey was very sensitive, and did a lot of \" I'm not worthy .\" The re-emergence of \"I'm not worthy\" has been an interesting phenomenon. When Joey is very tired, and is just being peevish, instead of having a total meltdown, he now reverts to I'm Not Worthy. It actually has made life a little better- less total meltdowns, because I have this extra clue that one is impending and can intervene. Also, the I'm Not Worthy is not as dramatic as it used to be- the howling that comes with the head on the floor is less intense, and he doesn't smack his forehead on the floor, he just touches it and stays there. It only counts as a Level One if the howling is loud. It is more like a pre-tantrum.  The other thing is Joey has a lot more words to use to explain what the trigger is. He may not be able to tell us all the little irritations feeding into the problem- who can?- but he can give me clues to the current trigger. \"I want another turn.\" \"He's in my space.\" \"I need help!\" this is  such  a vast improvement from where we began! I am grateful to be able to intervene, and give Joey those much-needed calming hugs. It also reminded me why it was such a good idea for me to be in the tribe with him. Other mom wouldn't understand the need for fast intervention and deep pressure. More likely, he would have been put into time out or punished as being spoiled. Instead, I could step in, calm him, assure him that he would have another turn soon and talk about how other children need to play, have their turn, and have fun, too; that if another child is in his space or too close, it is OK for him to move; that he was doing great with his basket, and I'd be happy to tie on the next yarn color for him.

{"date": "Thursday, June 26, 2008", "body": "\nHaving Joey in Vacation Bible School is a bit of a challenge for my nerves. Not Joey himself; Challenges for ME. You know, my own issues. We all have them. I can see how different Joey is from kids his own age. That can be hard- not because it is a problem, but because I'm a human parent who wants my kid to be happy and have friends. It is also hard because so many folks come up to me, knowing Joey is autistic, and say weird things, like, \"You've done great work! He's doing so well!\" All I did was drive.  Joey  did the work part. \"Are you sure he's autistic? He seems so normal!\" Yes. Yes I am. Um... thanks? \"Oh, normal kids do that, too.\" This is in response to things like having a small tantrum over losing a turn or signs of frustration from not understanding the rules of a game, or something like that. Yes, normal kids have tantrums; excuse me while I intervene before this becomes a meltdown.  They mean well. But they have preconceptions of what autistic people can and cannot do, and Joey isn't fitting those parameters. some of these preconceptions are spread by parents, therapists, and caregivers of autistic kids- and I have even seen some of them on sites written by autistic people.  1.  Autistic people cannot lie . They need to stop by my house. Joey's IEP includes taking responsibility for his own actions, instead of trying to foist his misdeeds on someone else. (\"Joey, did you just take that toy from Sally?\" \"No. Andy took it.\" Andy is no where to be found, and the toy is in Joey's hand, and I watched him take it from Sally...) 2.  Autistic people are \"uncompetitive.\"  Oh, haha. Joey's latest perseveration is, \"I win! I win first!\" and \"I'm a loser! I cannot win. I lost.\" Joey likes being good at things, and being better at things than other people- just like other kids.  3.  Autistic people cannot be spiteful.  Sure they can. Joey sometimes hides toys just so Andy won't have it. He picked this behavior up from Andy.  4.  Autistic people cannot be social/they don't like people.  There are still doctors in the world who will not diagnose a child as autistic because they are \"too social.\" This is a bunch of baloney. Joey loves people, loves to participate, and is highly social. He may not have the skills to be successfully social, but he gives it the old college try every time.  5.  Classically autistic people do not speak. If your child speaks, s/he actually has Asperger's Syndrome.  People actually will change a child's diagnosis when they start speaking to Asperger's, as if that is the sole difference between \"classic\" autism and Asperger's Syndrome. Joey is verbal, but is \"classically\" autistic, not Asperger's. He remains severely communication-challenged. He has a lot of trouble answering questions or following a conversation. \"Verbal\" does not mean \"not communication-disabled.\" I think parents don't fight the change because Asperger's is seen as a sort of \"autism lite\" that is more manageable; there is some psychological thing of \"my kid is improving! He's no longer Autistic; he's Autistic Lite!\" There are more success stories out there about people with Asperger's, as opposed to people with \"classic\" autism. The change in diagnosis is seen as a glimmer of hope for people who do not want to be \"stuck\" caring for their child for the rest of their lives.  As others of these myths rear their ugly heads  en masse , I'll let you know. In the meantime, I'm still fighting the \"autism is caused by bad parenting\" myth and the \"I shouldn't have to deal with your disabled kid in public\" attitude. Don't like my kid learning to relate to public places? Don't like it that he needs to chew some gum in order to calm himself and navigate the store? Well, guess what: I hate the smell of coffee. I don't go about telling people with coffee breath to get out of my space, even though I find it disruptive and disgusting. Get a clue.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/myths-of-autism.html", "title": "\nMyths of autism\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 25, 2008", "body": "\nLast week in school, Joey had a sudden and dramatic reaction to... something. He turned red but not hot, and got his prickly rash on his back. He normally has a prickly rash, I had it when I was a kid, too. It doesn't itch, it just looks not smooth. But this was a really angry looking prickly rash, enough so that the nurse called, and so we took him over to the allergist. We did one of those scratch tests last week, and he's not allergic to any of whatever they were testing. Today we were to start a patch test. This is when they affix tape to your back with little squares of stuff to see if you have a contact allergy.  So we went over, and they put these tape squares on his back, and proceeded to \"reinforce\" the tape with more tape, none of which was sticking to his back very well. She kept telling him to stand still to put it on, but the minute he moved, there were puckers and pulls, and I was just not very happy. Somehow in my mind I had envisioned more like that sheet tape they used on me in the hospital, which sealed things in.  This  looks like a joke.  I was assured he should go to school, but shouldn't bathe. Sponge baths. OK. I should take the tape off on Wednesday and bring him back on Thursday. OK.  I dropped the child off at school, told the aide who fetched him what was going on, and continued on my merry way.  Skip ahead to 3:45. One happy boy hops off the school bus and scurries into the house. I get the coat off, then check his back.  There, clinging to his back, is a ball of mangled tape.  I called the allergist's office. They acted remarkably surprised, as if this has never happened before. I assured them that the nurse placed sufficient tape on my son's back to mummify a rat, but no avail. I now await instructions from his doctor as to our next move.  The good news is his back looks perfectly fine.  I shall keep you posted.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/02/mass-of-tape.html", "title": "\nA Mass of Tape\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 28, 2008", "body": "\nSo it's summertime, and that means Hollywood owes us some family fare. Blockbuster, kid-friendly, crowd-pleasing popcorn movies. I took the boys, sans Joeymom, to  Kung Fu Panda  a couple of weeks ago, and  Wall-E  today.\u00a0 I guess it's worth mentioning three summers ago, when Joey was between his first and second years of preschool, one of the few summer activities the school did was to host a movie event in the school auditorium. I forget the movie now, and while it was decidedly low-tech, it was a nice test to see if Joey could sit still and pay attention to something for more than a few minutes. Well, Joey being three and autistic, he failed miserably. It was dark. The movie didn't interest him. He and his brother ran wild throughout the non-crowded auditorium. We had to bail after only a few minutes. Joey  has come a long way  in dark, crowded settings. So with that in mind, we ventured to Kung Fu Panda. I was a bit concerned with its PG rating. In the ads, Dreamworks' animation looked gorgeous, and it was. But the guys watch the  dino documentaries , what with T-Rexes eating their bloody prey and all, so how bad could it be? Well, Andy lasted about 10 minutes into Kung Fu Panda before crying. Great sobbing wails of 'That's scary.' So we came home. For the record, while there was really no violence at the point where Andy lost it, it was an intense scene of non-violent conflict.\u00a0 So with reviews read, a G rating in tow, and two boys excited to see it, we trekked off to  Wall-E . Well, this time, Andy did much better. It was still 'scary', but he was able to cope by sitting on me. We lasted an hour. The impulse for leaving wasn't any great crying fit, it was a combination of Andy's periodic 'I wanna go home' and a movie, apart from the endearing title character, that was more or less unlikeable.\u00a0 This ain't your father's Pixar film. Like Ratatouille before it, Wall-E is a grown-up movie that's appropriate for children. Unlike immortal classics like the two Toy Story movies- with their themes of friendship, growing up, and staying true to one's self- \u00a0and Finding Nemo with its examination of disability, parenthood, and fear, Wall-E is a less-than-subtle dig against consumerism and current environmental practices. Oh goodie. However you feel about those issues, they do not lend themselves to a fun, entertaining film. I eagerly await the 2009 blockbuster from Pixar, 'Capital Punishment, Abortion, and Child Abuse'. Yes, the company that branded everything imaginable with Cars characters just two years ago, has taken a stand against consumerism. Indeed. The good news is that Joey liked the movie. He sat in his seat or bounced on it the whole time. Andy lasted longer than before. But unfortunately, I was not sorry to bail on Wall-E early.\u00a0 How does everyone else do at the movies? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_with_Dinosaurs", "http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/walle/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/boys-at-movies.html", "title": "\nBoys at the Movies\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, July 08, 2008", "body": "\nSo we went for a big adventure today:  Williamsburg . And I decided to spice things up by adding  Jamestown  to the trip.  We did great. We got down to Williamsburg and found the  reinactment  in full swing, which meant all the main ways into  Duke of Gloucester Street  were closed (you're supposed to buy a ticket to watch the programs). However, you can still slip through some of the back gardens and get there, so we did get  gingerbread cakes . It was still a bit early to go to lunch (the taverns open at 11:30), and the guys were hot and tired, so I decided to run them over to McD's instead, then head down to Jamestown.  I got so lost, we ended up back where we started, 20 minutes later. So I parked the car (in the exact same parking space) and we had lunch at the  King's Arms . Much yummier than McD's.  Then off to  Jamestowne ! The  Jamestown Settlement  is the new museum down there, and it kicks ass and takes names. You walk in and its like you're in the forest with the Powatan. They have reconstructed a 17th century English street, a Native American village, and early American homes. They have short films throughout on things like sailing to the Americas, trade and shipping, slavery and the gold trade, etc. etc. etc. It totally rocks.  Then you go outside .  Outside they have full re-creation of a Powatan village, Fort James, and  three  period ships to go on and explore, all with folks in costume doing things and talking about it. they also have a boardwalk about the marshland and why the colonists decided to stay there (in case you didn't know, Jamestown is in a swamp. Williamsburg is a little farther inland, but still surrounded by swamp.) We didn't get to see all of it, partly because we were dying of the heat, and partly because they had to shut down the outside because of a huge thunderstorm. It was done  very  professionally, and they got everyone into the building before the storm hit. All the living history people then set up inside, and continued to do their thing! How cool is that?  We did get to climb all over one of the boats, which the boys just thought was great because it was obviously Captain Hook's pirate ship. They had the costumed guys in hysterics, racing around saying \"I'm  Peter Pan! \" \" I'm Captain Hook! \" and pretending to be dancing, singing pirates. Yes, indeed.

{"date": "Thursday, July 10, 2008", "body": "\nSo there we were, in the garden of the King's Arms Tavern, ordering lunch.  I am very proud of my boys (did you notice?). They say 'please' and 'thank you.' They can order their own food, and they eat what they order. They stay mostly in their seats, and when they do get up, they aren't disturbing other folks, they are looking at the birds and the plants in the garden. Joey tells the waitress how good his lunch is. Andy shows off his crayons.  It is one of those moments when, at the time, the idea of Joey being \"disabled\" is left aside, not even considered. That he is autistic is always present, but not really thought about, either. Joey is being Joey, Andy is being Andy, and we are having a lovely lunch together under the grapevines of the garden trellis. It is only now, two days gone, that it occurs to me:  Wow .  Joey is one of the hardest working people I know, and look at how far his work has taken him! Like other children, he learns to read and write and do math and that sort of thing. History and social studies is a weak point for him, hence the trips to Williamsburg and other living history exhibits and museums. But he has also had to learn how to speak. He has had to learn how to self-regulate in sensory-rich environments. He has had to learn to interact appropriately with strangers. Things that other kids pick up on as they grow up and experience the world, Joey has had to be taught, has had to learn just as other kids learn reading, math, or science- with lessons, with experiments, with carefully constructed experiences and situations and controlled responses. He's had to practice skills that other kids seem to \"just know\" (which means they were taught at a younger age, or could use and synthesize models of behavior they observed on their own).  And the results of all that work? A lovely lunch in the garden of the King's Arms Tavern.  Most people I would say this to would reply, \"well, sure\" and give it no more thought. Or they would look at me funny, because don't all kids have to learn this stuff? Shouldn't good behavior be normal? What's so special about eating lunch? And how do you explain to these people the work that went into Joey learning to eat that lunch? The work and support that was invested in helping Joey be able to walk over to that restaurant, sit in the garden, and be able to focus on his food, bite it, eat it? How do you explain what a huge accomplishment this was?  Well, I've found you don't. You folks- well, the folks I know and who kindly comment on this blog- understand what this meant to us- to Joey, to Andy, to me. But for other people, who \"just don't get it\"? I've found the best thing to just let them know what a gorgeous day we had, and leave it at that. Leave out the hiccups, the small moments of impending trouble that were thwarted and salvaged, and just say, \"What an amazing lunch we had. I really love taking my guys on trips.\" After all, this is perfect truth- and all the information they need or can handle.  But to you guys... look at how far my little buddies have come! I am  so  proud of them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/07/pride-and-joy.html", "title": "\nPride and Joy\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, July 03, 2008", "body": "\nI've been wandering through the toy aisles again. We live in a sea of toys, but as the boys are getting older, it is starting to be time to start combing through the ocean and sorting out seashells we just don't need or play with anymore. The point is to thin the tide, so that we can be awash with a whole new wave of toys.  Most toys out there don't look like much fun to me. I mean, there are lots of the toys that you thought were cool for ten minutes at a friend's house, but not really, super fun, hours of playing kinds of toys. Toys seemed designed to play with one way, and that's how you play with them, no imagination required. The whole world is expected to simply memorize episodes of TV shows designed to sell toys. Except that the shows Joey like to repeat like that, they aren't marketing right now (such as  Magic School Bus ,  Franklin  or  Little Bear ), or never did (ie,  Oobi ).  Another problem is inappropriate themes and designs. My kid doesn't need to be playing with stuff covered in Harley-Davidson tattoo themes. The attitudes in the designs seem  meaner ,  harsher ,  harder . Pirates and dinosaurs and jungle animals aren't enough to just be these things, they have to look tough and mean. Why? My kid is six. A  lion  should look majestic, powerful, noble... but why make it look mean?  If I had my druthers, I would bring back toys that I played with, hours and hours on end, so my boys could really enjoy them and get those ever-needed creative playskills. Here are a few:  Fisher Price Little People, Old Style. The new style are so specific, they're no fun. Also, they are all little kids. The old style stiff was a little more abstract, and included lots of grown-ups, so you could play lots of different things with them. The new figures hold things like tools, frogs, books, etc; the old style ones didn't even have arms, o you could pretend they were holding whatever you needed them to. What's with the move to less abstraction in toys? Abstraction allows the mind to fill in the details.  Fisher Price Adventure People. I have been looking at action figures, and I find them totally inappropriate for children. They muscle-bound hulk-bodies are not just stupid-looking and ugly, they aren't any fun. Besides, I think making the world seem like it is full of pro wrestlers is not appropriate for children. Adventure people looked like people. Normal people. People you saw around you. That made them fabulous for everything from dollhouse families to jungle-rescue make-believe to... anything. Get those old molds out, Fisher Price, and bring us toys that are actually appropriate for kids!  Old-Style Star Wars Figures. See Adventure People. The new figures have the same problem. Crack out those old molds, those older designs were great for really playing. Luke and Leia aren't body-builders.  The Ginghams. As a kid, I just loved paper dolls. I had several sets. I also loved Sugar And Spice paper dolls, and had a great set of international costumes. paper dolls made today don't seem to be made to be played with, just looked at.  But the Ginghams were the best. They had playsets you could get, and furniture, and they were pretty easy to cut out. I just adored them. They were simple enough to make up your own play. Of course, i also adored Holly Hobbie, which was certainly part of the attraction. Still, they weren't wildly funny-looking, and were not over-elegant. They were  playable  paper dolls.  Fashion plates. They have some similar products out now, but the original plates were by far the best. You mixed and matched the figures to make the outfits, then did the rubbings, then turned the plates over and they had patterns on the back for rubbing over the pictures. I spent hours creating \"magazines.\" Days, even.  Color forms playsets. No, I mean lots of them. Lots of selection to charm your kid. We need Little Bear ones, Franklin ones, not just Dora and the Bacjyardigans (shows that don't charm my kids at  all ... but if they charm yours, go get the colorforms sets!)... ones with lots of small pieces and stuff, like the old Holly Hobbie sets had, or the old Snoopy sets. I even recommend those older sets. Bring them back. They'll sell. Why? Because they were fun. They were quiet. They were something you could take with you in the car or to grandma's, without taking any batteries. The new sets don't have the little detail pieces, the freer settings.  I know it is hard to find simple, big buckets of legos these days, but they are still made. Its harder and harder to find large, plain wood blocks, but hey are out there. So let's bring back some of these old classics. They were fun... enough so that I still remember them, and miss not being able to give new sets to the kids in my life. I know they'd just love them as much as I did.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.scholastic.com/magicschoolbus/", "http://www.nickjr.com/shows/franklin/index.jhtml", "http://www.noggin.com/shows/littlebear.php", "http://www.noggin.com/shows/oobi.php", "http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=5425&e=imaginextlanding", "http://www.hasbro.com/default.cfm?page=browse&product_id=19582", "http://www.hasbro.com/default.cfm?page=browse&product_id=19710", "http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=5425&e=product&pid=38787", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SG2R0YrzkaI/AAAAAAAABAo/TELS0xmAkKY/s1600-h/afdf_1.JPG", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SG2P_ihvk1I/AAAAAAAABAY/uIOh0K58OlE/s1600-h/b41c_1.JPG", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SG2RMXt1W1I/AAAAAAAABAg/_VxQICTW8mM/s1600-h/78.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SG2NfkxdTlI/AAAAAAAABAI/5PFhg3IDzBM/s1600-h/gpdbc1.gif", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SG2OIN7DCRI/AAAAAAAABAQ/DHcRcjrK6og/s1600-h/sugarspice.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SG2Se4eLhZI/AAAAAAAABAw/tzVYAuA2OY0/s1600-h/fashion_plates1-702580.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SG2Uf2uf4dI/AAAAAAAABA4/SjpVoabK4B8/s1600-h/85fd_1.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/07/toys-i-wish-were-still-made.html", "title": "\nToys I wish were still made\n"},

The loving memory is of a child who lived just shy of six months.  I know a lot of kids that some people think would be better off not being here. In fact, there are people in this world who think Joey is one of those kids. They make it clear with their attitudes towards prenatal testing, their attitudes towards disabilities, and even the way they act when they discover Joey is autistic.  I just want those people to know a few things.  I love Joey and Andy. I wouldn't trade them and who they are for all the tea in China.  Just because autism is part of who Joey is, and I love Joey as he is, doesn't mean I don't want to help him, support him, and raise him. I want him to grow and be happy and enjoy life. He's doing a good job of that.  Let me make that  really  clear: Joey loves living. He enjoys life. He wants to be here, too.  I know several children who are more disabled than Joey with various conditions. I assure you that they all enjoy being here, too.  There are things far worse than having a disabled child. I cannot imagine the pain of the parent at Andy's school. And I hope I never know what that is like. I am absolutely sure it is far worse than anything I have ever experienced. Ever.

Yes, yes, labeling clothes, putting together snacks, checking off supply lists, and packing backpacks. Sure. I also had to run out to my mom's, because her basement flooded and I'm helping her clean it out (we spent most of the day today out there- JoeyAndyDad heroically took two loads of trash to the dump so I wouldn't have to lift bags full of sodden clothes and cardboard.) And I cried all the way home.  Yes, its only half-days. And I'll get Friday mornings with just Joey, which is a rare treat. It will only be four weeks for Andy, six for Joey. And then I will have one week, most of which JoeyAndyDad has also taken off work and we hope to be at the beach for, before they go back to school for real. And we have had an amazing few weeks, with trips all over the place, which I can't afford to do for another seven weeks. And I am an utter failure at providing Joey with the structure he needs to get through his day with any sort of normalcy (and before you post, \"Yes you can!\", be aware that I know it is a failing on my part, and really would rather not feel worse about it). I'll still have afternoons- well, when we aren't running to therapy. Or the gym. Or running errands. Maybe some afternoons we'll do some of these craft projects I was planning. Or visit some folks on the weekends.  But its just not the same as having my buddies here with me.  I'm not saying all day, every day is sunshine and roses and easy living. But that's life, and I wouldn't miss my babies even in those moments when everything seems to be in melt-down. Every moment is part of who we are.  I know they both do better in school, they learn a lot, they have a lot of fun, they learn to be independent and confident and themselves, without Mommy's shadow. All children need some freedom to breathe and be themselves, and learn who they are, and process what I am teaching, just as time with me permits them to process what school is teaching.  But I feel I am missing out. And I miss them. And life is just very different when there aren't two little guys giggling in the back seat. Even when its just one, its not the same.

JoeyAndyDad and I have decided we could make a mint with about twenty acres anywhere in a 10 mile radius of Fredericksburg, because there is actually little within that striking distance. There is no petting zoo, no DinosaurLand-esque parks, no child-friendly museums. I put in some fiberglass models, a few goats with a feeding machine, a small child-friendly museum, charge two bucks, and call it income.  So I was delighted to find  The Bug Box . This is a small insect museum/nature center right at Four Mile Fork, which means within our beaten path. We haven't been before because it is only open on weekdays, and up to now, weekdays have been very, very full. It costs $2 per person, and inside is a nice, small collection of interesting live insects, turtles, lizards, frogs, and even a snake. Additionally, the walls are covered in beautiful collections of insects and butterflies mounted for display. In the back is a small discovery room, which though doesn't offer that much in materials, does offer a place for everybody to sit and some bug-related things to look at. There's even a small restroom. Perfecto.  The boys loved it. There were two red-eared turtles they could have watched all afternoon. They both raced around with magnifying glasses, looking at the bugs and lizards and laughing and pointing (well, Andy did the pointing- Joey still doesn't do the joint attention thing that well) and generally enjoying themselves.  Stimey: I recommend the next time you want  ants , just get a small fish tank for them. It seemed to be working beautifully for the Bug Box.  So we now have a new rainy-day haven, right here in town, for long afternoons. Now I just need somewhere to go on weekends... As an aside, this is my Five Hundredth Post.

I think it is partly because I have a fresh set of captive-audience ears at hand, but somehow autism and Joey fall into the conversation. Sometimes people ask. Sometimes it just seems to appear in the conversation, I suspect because my brain just leans that way.  Several of my New Jersey crowd have special needs kids at various levels. How they cope it something very interesting to me. Whether therapy is left off a an inconvenience, their kids are relabeled to fit them into certain classrooms or situations, or they are out there fighting and placing their kids in various activities and placements, they all have ideas of how to cope, how to help their kids cope, how to pay the bills and have a life. They are all apparently better at this last item than I am, because they're all published and working on projects and going on with their life plans. OK, that go off track. Back to the point. I talk a lot about Joey. I talk to people in the park. I talk to my New Jersey crowd. I talk to folks in the train station. I talk to people in McDonald's. I talk with people in the grocery store. The questions folks ask, the observations they make, the advice they want to offer, it has its ups and downs, pros and cons.  It always amazes me how many people still think autism is caused by vaccines. This idea is so entrenched in the popular imagination that when you speak against the idea, people start to argue with you. People who have no clue what they are talking about, who ten minutes before when the conversation started didn't even know autistic people can speak, relate, and show emotion, are suddenly experts at vaccines and how they cause autism. Weird.  It always amazes me how many folks are surprised when I say Joey was autistic from birth. One person this weekend even replied with a shocked, \"isn't that really rare?\" Well, no. Most of the studies I have seen seem to indicated it is about half-and-half based on parent observation. I have seen numbers as wide as 80% congenital and 20% regressive, which would make \"from birth\" far more common than regressive autism.  It always amazes me how many folks say, \"wow, he doesn't look autistic!\" I refrain from asking what they expected an autistic person to look like. I think the fact that Joey is happy, healthy, and affectionate really takes people off-guard. The idea of an \"invisible disability\" is confusing to people. It is the same attitude as the people who give us dirty looks (and the occasional rude comment) when they see us using our disability hangtag. Joey doesn't  look  disabled, so why should we get to use the close-in parking spots? They don't see Joey trying to dart into the street or wandering around the car, and even if they did, would that pass their personal test for who deserves a handicap tag?  But what really amazes me ifs people ask questions, listen to answers, and then ask more questions. They want to know about Joey, they want to know about autism, or they are at least polite enough not to fall asleep. There is hope out there, ready for the asking.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/07/talking-about-joey.html", "title": "\nTalking About Joey\n"},

To be honest, I have a pretty tight little circle of blogs I read regularly. I see other peoples' blogrolls of daily reading, and I boggle at how they have the time to do all that reading. I think folks have picked up on my little circle, because whenever awards go around, I tend to bring up the same dozen blogs. I hunt and peck at other blogs, but when it comes down to it, I have my comfy dozen, those familiar comfy couches in virtual livingrooms, and there I take up my residence. I follow along those stories, think about those children, those parents, those families. Other blogs drift through, other faces, names, tales; but the focus remains on this one small circle.  Sometimes things reverberate through that little circle from those drifting names and faces. The reverberations of loss of one little boy is one of those. I wasn't particularly following  Evan's  story and life.  I peeked in now and again, popped by when something caught the interest in some of the  autism  headlines sites I sometimes peruse. When I got the news from  Niksmom  that Evan was sick, I had to ask which blog he belonged to, I couldn't remember, I just had some connect that I had read some of his adventures. But many of my little dozen were regular readers, followers of this family, profoundly impacted by the sudden loss. We may have never met each other, but we are friends and family all the same. I am terribly sorry that Vicki is going through this loss, I cannot imagine losing a child, but the pain must be... even the thought of it is overwhelming. What can I do from my little virtual corner than to send what hugs I can, do what I can to honor a child and a family who mean so much to so many? To put out that reminder, in my own way, that we are all precious, even people I don't really know, know only from glimpses of glimpses?  I also want to hug my little circle, who feel so much pain and very real grief in this loss.

I've never heard a more exact description of classic autism.  3. People do not understand that once a person is in an institution with a label, you might have to ask to have your loved one screened for something else if you suspect something else- they won't \"just do that\" or \"watch for it\" automatically.

No part of him actually touches the seat.  \"No Mac and cheese today. No mac-a-roni and cheese.\" \"No, love. Here, look, read here. You can have chicken strips, or a cheeseburger...\" \"CHEEEEEESEburger?\" Andy croons with faux surprise. \"... or a grilled cheese sandwich.

Joey sadly orders a grilled cheese sandwich. Andy, who usually just gets the food bar so he can have all-you-can-stuff-in-your-mouth-bacon-buffet, orders chicken strips. We get some jello and green beans from the bar to try to calm Joey while he waits for the food he doesn't really want.  It arrives, and Joey wolfs down the sandwich, though he continues to look depressed while doing it, and does it by first picking off some cheese, then nibbling the bread, then digging off more cheese...  \"I want chicken,\" Joey announces, eyeing Andy's plate.  \"You just had your lunch. That is Andys lunch,\" I remind him. \"Do you want some salad?\" Joey looks dejected.  \"You want chicken?\" Andy chimes. \"Here, I cut you a piece.\" With that Andy carefully cuts a chicken strip in half, and gives the piece to Joey, who is ecstatic.

Yes, indeed.  ******** We wait for Andy to come out of OT. I get on the floor and play block-building with Joey, but he can't focus all that long. He gets up and starts pretending to be a dinosaur, a t-rex, and knocks over my building. I rebuild, and he roars and knocks everything down again.  \"I'm a dinosaur!\" he roars, and wreaks more havoc upon my quickly-constructed village. He stomps out into the hall, roars, stomps back to repeat the catastrophe. He roars more and stomps out into the hall.  \"And people keep saying autistic kids have no imagination,\" my mom chortles.

Tell me one thing you did today.\"  \"I play with Mrs. Huff.\"  \"Did you play a game?\"  \"Igisee {snork snork hiss hiss}!\" \"Did you play a game?\" \"I got a prize!\" Well, he must have done something good. They don't always get prizes.  \"Good job! Wow!\" \"No prize today!

I win a sticker!\" \"Did you win a sticker at school?\" \"No. I get a sticker and Andy doesn't.\" Ah, He is referring to our  sticker campaign .  \"Yes, you are well on your way to earning a sticker. What was your prize today?\" \"I played with Mrs. Huff and Mrs. Macy.\" This is a scripted answer.

Reduced to nonsense sound, he then uses them to \"fill\" voids of sound, as oral stim, as avoidance strategies, or uses them for sensory processing or language processing stall. This particular set of sounds is from \"I go to sleep!\" and then the sounds of pretend snoring.

Or I just freeze in those moments after the boys are in bed, pondering. I don't have time during the day, when I have boys and life is hurrying along. But in the pauses... I think about it.  What is this world I am trying to prepare Joey and Andy for?  The stories stream in from all quarters. Autistic people threatened with isolation, arrest, death. Some threatening to burn down the home of an autistic child. People who insist autism is 99% a discipline problem. Families with autistic people being tossed out of stores, planes, restaurants, schools, churches. Labels attached to autistic kids: trainwrecks. Idiots. Weirdos. Freaks.  I see it. Kids who tell Joey to go away on the playground, or who avoid him altogether. Adults who recoil from him when I explain he is autistic. This is the world I am preparing him for. How do you prepare a child from that kind of discrimination? How do you help a person grow and understand how beautiful and wonderful and special they are, when you know people all around them are going to be sending a different message?  I carefully cut the zinnias, because I know it will still be a couple of days before the boys get into the back yard now. Our afternoons are already booked with speech and OT, the mornings with camp and school. By Friday, there will be new blooms, and it's better for the plants to cut them. I place them carefully in the vase with a few roses, just to fill the vase really. I'll put them on the mantle and tell them that these are their zinnias, from their garden. Andy will get it. I don't know whether Joey will understand or not, but perhaps when we wander out Friday, he'll see the new ones. The sunflowers have their head buds on them, so we can talk about that, I can show them the sunflower buds in our book about sunflowers growing. The tomato vines are finally setting tomatoes (who ever heard of not having any tomatoes at the end of July???). I ponder a brief lesson on tomatoes and seeds, but store it away as a \"just in case\". It isn't likely that Joey will be able to focus on the garden long enough for a lesson. Maybe I'll do that when they start to ripen. Maybe they'll be going pink by Friday, and that will hold his attention. Focus and attention are real issues for us. We were hoping when he learned to read, he'd get interested in books, but that hasn't really happened. It's all just words to him.  The zinnias are all different colors. there is a sunny orange one, a sparkling white one, a bold red one. One is a purply pink, another a creamy cross between ivory and lemon yellow. The soft pink of the roses makes the more brash colors pop out.  Is this world going to be such a terrible, tough place for Joey? The world certainly has its violent crimsons, but isn't it mostly soft pinks, butter yellows, warm oranges? What about the ladies and the older men who see Joey in the store, and crinkle up their faces in delighted smiles, a response to his giggles and grins? What about the ladies in church who tell his classmates that God made us all as we are, and loves us all as we are, and we should love all our fellows the same way, as they are? What about the folks who, realizing Joey is different, slow down their speech and try to engage him a little more? What about the family in front of us in the awards ceremony who, seeing Joey going across the stage for his reading award, clapped enthusiastically and noted, \"he must be smart, he's the only one in his class to get the award!\" even though they had never laid eyes on him before? Do we notice the fear stories all the more, because they pop out of a world that is, for the most part, trying to be supportive of my child and my family?  Perhaps that is a lesson for my Joey and my Andy: always be kind. Help and kindness unlooked-for is a treasure that makes the world a better place.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/07/fear-mongering.html", "title": "\nFear Mongering\n"},

{"date": "Friday, August 01, 2008", "body": "\nGood ol'  abfh . She gives me so much to blog about.  There is a sort of tension that runs through the \"autism community\" between autistic people and parents who are raising autistic people. Often this tension is constructive in its way. Most \"autism parents\" don't have autism, and they are working hard to understand how to best support and work with their children. Hearing from people who actually have autism is a huge help in trying to consider the way autistic people see and experience the world, the consequences of decisions made on a child's behalf. How does one advocate effectively and respectfully?  In our latest episode, abfh takes on the term \"meltdown.\" It is, indeed, a term that causes consternation, because it is, in its essence, a negative term for a negative situation. In the comments, I noticed that commenters were concerned about the definition of the term. Abfh is concerned that a normal child's whining or tantrum is viewed differently than one had by an autistic child. These are very valid concerns, and ones that can very well feed into a stereotype of autism causing violence. However, I found abfh's example to be way off- feeding into the idea that parents of autistic kids are \"faking it\", that their lives are no different from other parents, if they would just suck it up and see their autistic kids in the same light as their non-autistic children.  In other words, if we're tired and drained and feeling depressed and having trouble raising our disabled kids, it is... see it coming?...  our own damn fault .  Now, this ain't no pity party. This isn't about oh poor me I have an autistic child and life sucks. Because I don't feel that way. Life is great. My boys are beautiful. Unique and beautiful.  Joey is not a violent person. He's very laid back, easy going. Andy is my loose cannon. I would have to say, anecdotally, that non-autistic people, especially those with sensory issues, are more likely to be violent than non-autistic people, even when both persons are generally described as peaceful, well-behaved kids. When I hear that all-too-familiar \"crack\" sound in the back seat, I can lay my money on who hit whom with a better than 50/50 odds.  However, situations are very different. Joey tends to be unexpectedly explosive. He got frustrated with a task last week and struck his aide. If a non-autistic child struck a teacher, they would be suspended. Why wasn't Joey? By understanding his frustration and his problems with impulse control, focus, language, and frustration tolerance, are we contributing to a stereotype of violence?  How about we take another look at the mom in the grocery store? I know this scenario quite well. One child is autistic, the other one isn't. If Joey gets overwhelmed, we have a meltdown (or used to). If Andy whines about wanting a toy, we call that a whinefest. What is the difference?  Any child who is hitting (themselves or others), biting (themselves or others), flailing, tossing their bodies into walls (or floors, or furniture, or people), and/or smacking their heads against surfaces (or people), usually while screaming (but not always) is having a meltdown. I don't care what triggered the behavior. I don't care if the person is autistic, not, or from another planet. The complete loss of functionality and control is, for us, the very mark and essence of a meltdown. All sensory systems go into overload. Communication systems often shut down partially or completely. Self-regulation shuts down. Yes, folks- welcome to Chernobyl.  When Andy wants a toy, it may be loud, inconvenient, and annoying. I understand there are children who then escalate to meltdown over toys, but I have never seen it. If Andy started smacking me over a toy, biting himself, or flailing, I would leave the store immediately in order to contain the situation. If I knew he did this regularly, I would not bring him to the store- in other words, I would do for him as I would do for Joey: recognize triggers as best I could, and work to either manage them or avoid them. But he doesn't.  When Joey gets truly overwhelmed, he descends quickly into meltdown. Joey has never had severe issues in the store, but he often has difficulty with motor tasks such as dressing- a task that often lead to meltdowns when I began this blog. HE would get overwhelmed with the frustration, put his face as close as he could to mine and scream his lungs out. Unless I acted quickly, he would then proceed to bite his wrists. This is a level 3 meltdown. For us, unless it is dramatic and involves the possibility of injury, it isn't a meltdown. The screaming and loss of function is level one. Flailing is level 2. Biting is our proceeding to level 3.  When I say Joey  has had a level 10 meltdown , I am talking about  a dangerous situation . Our  level 10s  are not the worst I have heard of, but they are our worst- and they are very violent and physical situations. Yes, Joey has had level 10s in public. It has, thankfully, been a long time.  Do non-autistic kids have meltdowns? Yes. Yes they do. Do autistic kids have more? In my experience, yes, they do. Non-autistic kids do not face the kind of constant frustrations that autistic kids do, so non-autistic kids do not have the impetus to meltdown as much. Does that make autistic kids more violent? No, but it can mean more effort is needed to support these kids, to manage triggers and provide self-regulation skills, so that their frustration and anxiety levels are more comparable to non-autistic kids.  One thing I have learned- and yes, I mean that I didn't know it before- is that no person melts down without a reason. I may not  know  the reason, but there  is  one. As I am the adult, it is my job to figure out the puzzle and discover what is feeding into the child's frustration (not just the trigger). It may not be a single reason- a build up of frustrations can cause a person to act out, tantrum, or melt down. That is important information to disseminate.  The stereotype of the violent autistic is not because autistic people melt down, but because people not familiar with autism do not understand the triggers and frustrations. It looks random. Because those reasons and triggers look random, they are not managed, and so autistic people can seem to be melting down more than a non-autistic person would. I think if a non-autistic person had the same level of frustration, stress, and anxiety that many autistic people face every day, they would melt down just as much, just as often, and just as violently.  When mom goes home from the grocery store to blog about that meltdown, it is partly to gain assurance that other people's kids do this- after all, it is dramatic and often requires energetic intervention to prevent harm- to gain insights and advice about how to manage issues that may have fed into the melt down, and often to vent their own frustration about not being able to manage effectively, act quickly, or support their child enough. I know when Joey melts down, I am sure it is because I have failed as a parent. If only I had understood the signals, the warning signs, the triggers, the frustrations, then Joey wouldn't be sporting a pattern of tooth-sized bruises on his wrist. Meltdowns are scary, not just for the person melting down, but for everyone around them. It is a volcano of frustration venting the pressure.  Blogging means fewer parents melting down. After all, if we do, it really is our own fault. We have the skills and language to vent, right? P.S.- It is, once again, School Tax Holiday. The Annual Torture he Children At The Shoe Store is tomorrow. I will keep you posted.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/07/faaas-karen-rodman-and-autisticasperger.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/08/tensions-what-is-meltdown-ramble.html", "title": "\nTensions: What is A Meltdown?

{"date": "Thursday, July 31, 2008", "body": "\nOne of the consequences of wandering all over town with a bumper sticker that says  \"Yes! You Can Ask Me About Autism!\"  is that people stop you and ask you about autism. I got another mom asking me the #1 question today: \"I'm supposed to get my kids vaccinated today... what do you think? Should I do it?\" I took some time to talk with this mom, because we had some time, and she has kids in the same camp as Andy. Besides, she had chased me down from the parking lot, and the fear behind the question is one that one must take care and investigate before answering. What is she really asking?  Some are honestly asking, \"Do you think vaccinations cause autism?\" That is a very simple question to answer. No.  Some are asking, \"Which do you fear more- these shot-prevented diseases, or autism?\" That's an easy one, too. I am far more afraid of measles, mumps, rubella, meningitis, whooping cough, polio, chicken pox, hepatitis, tetanus, typhoid, pneumonia, diphtheria, and rotavirus than I am of autism. All of those diseases can kill you. I do not find autism to be frightening, other than the whole mystery of the unknown, since education about special needs in the general population is practically non-existent. Having to fight the school district? terrifying. Then I refer them back to question 1, and the fact that there is no this-or-that question here. If you are really really concerned, talk to your pediatrician about an altered schedule so you can spread out the shots and watch for side effects more effectively. High fevers can do strange things to a child's brain, and you need to watch for them. I would be more worried about seizures, though.  Some are asking, \"Is autism worse than death?\" This is really a slightly different question from #2. The absolute terror behind this question is something I find rattling. This is a parent paralyzed. They do not want to be blamed for their child being disabled. They don't want to roll the dice and take a chance of harming the child. They have never seen measles, mumps, or whooping cough. Polio is, to them, a distant legend. Pneumonia is a cough. Diphtheria is something they get in third-world countries. But autism... that has been very much to the fore, and the images they see in the media are not images they want projected on themselves and their children. Autism is not worse than death. It is a different way of thinking, feeling, and experiencing the world. It can result in severe disabilities, such as communication disorders (including social skill issues), sensory disorders, fine motor skill problems, and even gross motor skill issues. Not all of these issues are disabling, and there are therapies available to address these issues, if you can lay hands on therapists, time, and money. It is easier to support your autistic child than it used to be- there are more people out here like me, willing to help, there have been more trails blazed before us, there is more understanding in the educational and medical communities (though there is a lot more work to do), there are law offices who specialize in advocating for and representing autistic people and their families, than there was even ten years ago. I often invite these kinds of parents, asking this question, to come meet Joey, if he is on hand. I give them the address to this blog. I give them my handy-dandy sheet of websites to research autism and special needs issues.  And then there are some who are really asking, \"What is autism?\" The word is a vague shadow on the edges of information. They have no thought of not vaccinating their kids, because the vague shadows of the diseases they are protecting their kids from is still clearer than that of autism. There is curiosity, intrigue. They have heard fuzzy rumors, maybe caught a glimpse of Jenny McCarthy or seen a few minutes of Rainman, maybe they watch Eureka. This is another case of come-meet-my-kid and and a nice handout to take with them after you've talked a bit and introduced Joey. They don't want  too  much information- just enough to take the edge off mild curiosity.  Then there the parents asking, \"Is my child autistic?\" Now, I am not a developmental pediatrician. I can't diagnose kids. I do recommend that anyone worried about their kid should have that child independently screened (not by the school- by a developmental pediatrician or someone else with the credentials and ability to diagnose a child with an ASD or discount ASD.) There are kids out there who are eccentric without being autistic. Sensory integration issues can easily be SPD and not autism. There are disorders that \"look like\" autism, especially in young children, such as Tourette Syndrome. I always want to take some time with these parents. They are usually scared, worried, and feeling desperate and guilty. What they usually need is reassurance, a kind I don't really feel I can give (I can't give them that resounding, \"No!\"). A kid that looks normal to me might not be; a kid who looks really in need of service may be normal. I have no idea, I'm not trained for that. All I can say is, get the child screened, and if it comes back an ASD diagnosis, here I am to help you. Don't be afraid. Vaccinate your children.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cafepress.com/joeymom"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/07/vaccination-question.html", "title": "\nThe Vaccination Question\n"},

I saw the Didarganj Yaksi. I have not gotten to Madurai yet, but I am working on it.  5. I moved back to Fredericksburg in the end. We have a lovely little house right downtown. 6. Yes, I do teach. I have taught at Germanna Community College, Mary Washington College/University of Mary Washington, University of Virginia, University of Richmond, Shenandoah University, and St. Mary's College of Maryland. No, I have no permanent full-time gig anywhere. Adjuncting sucks in pay, but is great for teaching.  7. I did a cross-country trip with my now-husband a couple years after graduation. It was fabulous. We especially liked Yellowstone.  8. I am currently learning to be a genealogist. If any of my regulars want me to practice using their family, I'll take your contact info.  9. I am getting ready to start a number of small research projects, including a project about the restoration of the Thomas Stone Historic Site, the use of Hindu images at ancient Buddhist sites, and Baltimore Realist painting. All projects are contingent on having some actual time to work on them.  10. Life is good. No, it isn't what I imagined it would be fifteen years ago, but I have my family to hug, kitties to pet, a lovely home, plenty of food in the cupboards, and plenty of clothes to wear.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 06, 2008", "body": "\nThere have been a lot of comments swirling around disability parking. Here in Virginia, autism is specifically mentioned as a condition which impairs judgment while walking, and therefore have a right to disability parking. However, there is an attitude that handicapped/disability parking is only for people with visible problems walking.  Which is, of course, absurd. Here in Virginia:  People with heart conditions are permitted disability placards and plates. Can you tell a person has a heart condition by looking at them?  Did you know that deaf people are also permitted disability placards and plates? Can you tell a person is deaf by looking at them?  Did you know dementia (including Alzheimer's Disease) qualifies for a disability placard or plate? Can you tell if someone has Alzheimer's or other dementia by looking at them?  Not only autism, but any developmental disability or amentia which impairs judgment qualifies a person for a disability placard or plate. Can you tell if a person has a developmental disability or amentia by looking at them?  We have a placard for Joey. He doesn't bolt often, but when he does, it  is  dangerous. It has made a huge difference in our lives, when disability parking is appropriately placed next to a building, close to the entrance (as opposed to across the street or halfway down the block. Why do people do that? Those spaces help hardly anyone!) Offering disability parking that requires my child to be bused elsewhere (such as, say Williamsburg, or some of the local functions here) is also  useless  for us. (fortunately, Williamsburg has a lot for the taverns with a disability space, right behind the taverns we like to use. It's across a street, but at least doesn't require the shuttling- it's a real shame they shut down the other closer parking lots. If not for those tavern spots, we probably wouldn't be able to visit Williamsburg at all!) So even with the placard, life isn't all accessible and peaches and cream, but it does help a lot.  And for those folks who think you need to  or should have a visible disability to have a placard and use those spots, I can only say, I hope you never need one.

Things we thought were better off in the dust.  One thing that is making a slow comeback here is Joey's door fetish. He loves to open and close doors. As soon as he could open and close doors, he would. He loves my buffet, with the big square doors on either end, opening and closing, opening and closing, opening and closing. We haven't gotten that bad yet, but I can see it creeping in, creeping in. He has been finding doors to open and close. He discovered at door at the OT office. Open, close. Open, close. I caught him messing with the bathroom door. Open, close. Open, close. He was waiting to get in the car and discovered the driver door was unlocked already. Open, close. Open, close.  This is not a good sign.  But also, 'tis the season. The dog days are upon us. Our schedule has been a wild mess of summer activity. Even with the morning school routines, he knows it is different- breakfast is at home, lunch is with Grandma, not at school. His other teachers and classmates aren't there. The days are shorter, there is only four of them a week. It is a breath of routine in a swirl of unpredictability. The days are hot, which exacerbates everything- Joey  hates  being hot. The streams are starting to cross. Joey is hot, tired, and confused. He's stressing out.  We managed to get through Shoe Day without a meltdown. The lady at the shoe store was ready, braced for the usual. She handled it very well, talking him through putting the new shoes back in the box, letting him do it himself, so that the shoes \"would be all clean and white for your new teachers and new friends!\" Really, she did it very well. I think she did some research in preparation for us this year.  But now we have the doors. He is starting to throw toys when frustrated with them again. He is back on Blue's Clues and Little Bear.  Tomorrow, I am taking him tot eh Bug Box, just the two of us, while Andy is at camp. I'll see if I can get him to focus on the lizards, snakes, and bugs, maybe the frogs and turtles.

{"date": "Monday, August 11, 2008", "body": "\n As summer draws to its close and a new school year dawns, it is time for Andy to say goodbye to old friends. First, a goodbye to his first successful preschool teacher, who has also run his summer camp classes, Andy's Mrs. S (not to be confused with  Joey's Mrs. S ). We brought Andy to her class with some trepidation, as he had a lot of sensory issues and an unsuccessful preschool experience. Fortunately, Mrs. S runs a tight ship, and Andy learned what was expected of him double-quick. She was sensitive enough to his sensory needs that together, they were able to negotiate a  successful   preschool experience ! Andy loves his school, he loves Mrs. S, and we will miss her. At least he will see her around and about next year! However, we will not be seeing  MIss Cindy  any more. Sadly, she is moving to Texas. We said goodbye to Miss Cindy on our final visit on Friday. I don't think Andy really understands, but we're going to handle it just like another new teacher, because he will get a new therapist. We don't know who just yet. The difference Miss CIndy has made in our lives is earth-shattering. Without other serious issues to address, sensory integration OT really does work wonders with sensory integration disorder. We have gone from a child we thought would be going into special ed, to an excellent shot of him entering a \"regular\" kindergarten class (though I'm personally shooting for the inclusion class- I know those teachers ROCK!)

I sometimes allude to them, but rarely discuss them, such as specific encounters with idiotic people and negative experiences with other people. I would far rather talk about positives. It sets an example. Teaching by positive model is far more effective around here than saying, \"Don't do that!\" The issue of  Tropic Thunde r has caught my attention because I have had negative experiences. After all, what do I care, it isn't a movie I would have gone to see, even without the offensive language; and offensive language never stopped me from seeing  South Park . In reading over the remarks made on my  iReport  and other surrounding reports on CNN and other news sites, I have caught the pulse of something disturbing. People seem to be ignorant of the use of \"retard\" towards disabled people.  We have all worked hard here to help and support Joey, and Joey has done a ton of work to be able to function in everyday situations that most people take for granted. We can go to a store. We can eat in a restaurant. Most people don't know he's autistic unless something is said, or something goes really wrong. However, there is no missing that he is unusual. Eccentric. He sometimes comes off looking spoiled, because he gets antsy and needs to move, or doesn't return immediately when I call. He sometimes dashes off and has to be called back. He sometimes needs to be contained in a shopping cart, even at six years old (and big enough to look 8 or 9). He sometimes babbles nonsense. For some reason, people think any of this is any of their business.  Which is fine, we're in public, we're not invisible. It is how the questions are sometimes asked.  \"Why is he acting so retarded?\"  \"Why don't you tell him to sit down and stop acting like a 'tard?\" \"That is so retarded! Why is he saying that?\"  Excuse me? And it isn't even the question itself; it is the tone of voice when it is asked. They are not asking me if my son is intellectually challenged, and if they can help or get more information about his challenges. It is a judgment against him, against me, said with a broiling distaste and hate that results in just one response from me: we walk away. I don't even dignify such questions with a response.  Yes, this word is directed at people with disabilities. Yes, it has been directed towards us. Yes, it hurts.  I'm not out to ban movies like  Tropic Thunder , or  Something About Mary , or anything like that. People have a right to make movies. People have a right to ask me these questions. This is a country with free speech, and no-one will go to jail for coming up to me in a Wal-mart and  asking, \"Why is he acting so retarded?\" That's wonderful. I like knowing who the bigots are. I also have the right to write this blog. I have the right to tell those people they are bigots, jerks, and even... well, fill in the colorful metaphor of your choice. That is free speech.  I find it disturbing that people don't realize this term is used to disparage disabled people. It is. We have the right to free speech, but with rights comes responsibility.  Just because you can say something, doesn't mean you should.

I printed out some worksheets from E nchanted Learning  to help focus the visit- one on insects, and a book about spiders. We showed up with worksheets, crayons, and four bucks. We were ready for action.  The lady who runs the place took one look at my worksheets, one look at Joey, and said, \"no charge.\" If you're doing homework, you get in  free . How cool is  that ? She was expecting a school group, so we got right to business to squeeze in as much focus as I could before the group showed up, or Joey wore out.  I have a very difficult time getting Joey to focus. Half of that is that Joey has difficulty focusing, because after all, I'm mom, and home isn't school, and all that. Getting him to sit and do an activity in a sea of distraction and home is nearly impossible. However, he took focusing while at the Bug Box right in stride. We used the first sheets as a sort of scavenger hunt, so that he had to read the sheet, look for the bug, then her could write the word. Then we moved to the next bug. That had him wandering around looking for bugs, small objects in a vast visual field- he did very well, all things considered. We did get through the whole little workbook.  Then we sat ourselves in front of real, live tarantulas and talked about spiders. We read the little mini-book, looked at the spiders, talked about the spiders, and then he had to answer questions about the book and the spiders. He had to know what spinnerets were, what an exoskeleton was, and the difference between an arachnid and an insect. That last was a little sketchy for him, but we got it. He answered the questions. He finished the little worksheet.  Holy crap, I got the boy to do  two  assignments, focus for a whole frickin'  hour , and answer  questions !!! Where am I, and what has happened to my child???

My mom is thinking about buying them both headphones.  Joey's  will be connected to a CD player, so he can play his  favorite   songs  and chatter and sing to his heart's content.  Andy will get  noise-canceling phone s so he doesn't have to hear any of it.  Yes, the boys are out of sorts. Friday afternoon, I tried to get the boys outside- something that is usually a very popular idea- and we had a drip of rain. They both ran into the house at the first drop. That is really odd. They retreated to the basement. Any time either of them appeared upstairs, I had him bounce on the trampoline for a minute. Trying to get them calm. It worked a little.  Allan kept them moving a good bit today, in the basement, outside. We went to see Dexter, and that was a good time had by all. BUt I think the wild schedule takes its toll. Tomorrow we'll go see the  cousins , and so that will be another tiring, unscheduled day. Then he will go to school, but not usual school, because its only a half-day, with no breakfast or lunch there. Joey finds that really odd. Everything is chaos.  Three months of chaos. The result? Out of sorts. It's only natural. At least we have enough structure to pull him through. The summers before, those preschool summers we failed to get ESY for him, he would be a wild ball of stimming by now. I know some folks don't see anything wrong with stimming, but for Joey,  it does become problematic  if he only stims.  Right now, it is a matter of management. Joey needs to chatter. It is a sort of stim, but not a distracting, drift-away kind, so I don't really want to stifle it (it would kind of be like taking a kid's teddy bear away- perfectly harmless for a kid to hug a teddy bear to calm himself, right?)

{"date": "Sunday, August 17, 2008", "body": "\nJoey is getting a little round. There is no getting around it: I suck as a nutritionist. Trying to take control of what Joey eats has been elusive. His love of mac and cheese does not help.  Joey normally eats both breakfast and lunch at school. The teachers use these meals to help Joey with important skills. He must ask for a tray. He must stand in line. He must communicate with the lunch ladies. He must offer his card to pay for his lunch. He must learn to eat different foods. I could go on.  So I looked up the rules about food programs in Virginia, and what is supposed to be served, because to be honest, it all looks like junk food to me: poptarts, chicken nuggets, spaghetti, potatoes, muffins. How many carbs are they supposed to be pushing on my kid?  The  school lunch program  is required to provide 1/3 of my child\u2019s daily recommended intake of protein, certain vitamins and minerals, and calories. No more of 30% of the calories can be from fat, and no more that 10% of saturated fat.  The s chool breakfast program  is to provide \u00bc of these things (INCLUDING PROTEIN\u2026 how do muffins provide protein, exactly?), including calories.  All of this is based on the  federal dietary guidelines . According to those  guidelines (2005) , Joey should be eating 1400 calories if sedentary, 1400-1600 calories is \u201cmoderately active\u201d and as much as 2000 calories if \u201cactive.\u201d So my first question is: how are they defining school children? Are they feeding them as \u201csedentary\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d? Because folks, it only takes 100 extra calories each day to gain 10 pounds in a year. A 600-calorie difference is huge. It is the difference between him being able to eat dinner and not.  To complicate matters, it isn't calculated daily; it is calculated as an average over the course of a week. One day that lunch could be 1000 calories, as long as over the course of the week there is a lunch with, say, 300 calories.  Let's look at a week of food from my child's school. Finding specific nutritional information about these meals has been elusive, so the calorie and carb count you see is my best guess based on nutrition information I found about similar foods available to the general public. The only information I have about the food being served is all it is listed here, so I cannot assume any of the foods are \"diet\" (ie, sugar-free, fat-free, etc.) unless it specifically lists the food as such on the menu. Also, I noticed they allow Joey to have chocolate milk, and he usually chooses that, so the \"milk\" is for chocolate milk.  The Menu:     (Calories)     [Carbs] Monday:  BREAKFAST  Breakfast Pizza (420)    [41.5]  {** \u201cSchool\u201d pizza can be as high as 530 calories!} Chilled Juice     (90)       [23] Milk    (160)    [25] Total:  (670) [89.5]        LUNCH  Chicken Patty on Bun  (380) [44] Lettuce & Tomato Cup  (4)  [1] Steamed Broccoli  (30)  [6] Vanilla Cream Cookie (250) [37] Milk   (160)  [25] Total: (824) [113] Daily Total:  (1494)  [202.5]   Tuesday:  BREAKFAST  Blueberry Pancake  (240)   [46]  w/Sausage   (85)    [0]  {**Some sausages can be 270 calories per serving!} Orange Wedges   (62)  [15]  {**Assuming this means fresh oranges}  Milk   (160)  [25] Total: (547) [86]        LUNCH  Hot Turkey/Bacon Sub (400)  [47]  {**This could be as low as 300 calories, as high as 600 calories!} Seasoned Corn (67)  [16] Fresh Fruit  (65)  [20]  {Bananas are much higher} Apple Turnover  (260)  [34] Milk   (160)  [25] Total: (952) [142]  Daily Total: (1499) [228] Wednesday:  BREAKFAST  Ham & Cheese Croissant    (280)  [29] Fresh Fruit Cup    (65)   [16] Milk   (160)  [25] Total: (505)  [70]   LUNCH  Hot Dog    (240)  [18] {**many brands are higher, depending on the filler used} on Bun    (110)  [20] Potato Wedges  (147)  [31] Chilled Peaches  (80)  [10] Sherbet    (120)  [28] Milk   (160)  [25] Total: (857) [132] Daily Total: (1362)  [192]   Thursday:  BREAKFAST  Bacon & Egg  (184)  [0] on English Muffin  (189)   [30] Chilled Juice     (90)       [23]        Milk   (160)  [25]  Total: (623) [78]   LUNCH  Deep Dish Pizza  (478)  [57]  {**Assuming it is cheese only.} Tossed Salad  (15)  [2] Green Beans   (7)  [1] Choice of Pudding   (130)  [21] Milk   (160)  [25] Total: (790) [106] Daily Total: (1413)  [184]   Friday:      BREAKFAST  Chicken Biscuit  (170)  [18] Apple Juice     (90)       [23]       Milk   (160)  [25] Total: (420)  [66]   LUNCH  Grilled Cheese (200)  [40] Smiley Fries  (160) [24] Fruit Jell-O  (70)  [17] Choice of Muffin  (180)  [22] Milk   (160)  [25] Total:  (770) [128] Daily Total: (1190) [194] ********************* As you can see, my guesstimates seem to be OK, as we are consistently getting around 1400 calories per day, and about  170-200 carbs per day. Friday was the only exception; perhaps they are using a more caloric brand of chicken biscuit or cheese sandwich than I used.  Therefore, the school is assuming ALL of their children are 1. male (girls need about 200-400 fewer calories per day) and 2. active, otherwise I would have no room to feed Joey snack or dinner. We are supposed to send in a snack of a juice-box and food item every day. Normal choices would put this snack at about 100-200 calories; I have chosen more in the 30-calorie range, due to the joys of diet drinks and diet jell-o.  But wait. Is my child really active? He gets PE three days per week, and recess every day. So about an hour of his school day, maybe an hour and a half, is active, assuming he is actively participating- which, I noted in my visits, he spend a good deal of his recess time rambling about the perimeters, not running, climbing, swings, or other \"active\" activities. Many afternoons are taken up with therapies, not running. Let's say Joey is \"moderate.\" He is allowed 1400-1600 calories per day.  So on many days, he may have consumed all the calories he needs before he ever reaches my door; at best, he needs no more than 200 calories at dinner. Yikes.  If I feed him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for dinner- and nothing else- that is 300-350 calories. I could skimp it to about 250 calories. Double yikes. Skinless chicken breast with broccoli? There's 200 calories. If there is no butter on the broccoli. And he gets only one serving. And nothing else.  No wonder we're having a problem.  Hint to folks screaming about obese kids: try feeding them less at school! Just because there are kids who don't get food at home doesn't give you the right to stuff my kid full of sugar and calories. Have a kid on the free lunch program? Then provide their snack, too. And give them the extra calories there. Not at breakfast and lunch. For breakfast and lunch, assume \"sedentary.\" Its also a good idea to assume there will be food awaiting those sedentary kids at home. Assume mom would like to make cookies once in a while. Or serve mashed potatoes with dinner. Or even peas.  So I think we're going to talk to the teachers about packed lunches, where I can control the calorie count. PB&J with carrot sticks and a sugar-free dessert, eaten with his beloved chocolate milk, is only 500 calories. A hard-boiled egg, piece of fruit, and his beloved chocolate milk is only 300 calories. Plus his 30 calorie snack- that's 850 calories. Even at \"sedentary\" I can feed him a nice 550-calorie dinner (still light!), and be all good!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/AboutLunch/NSLPFactSheet.pdf", "http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/breakfast/AboutBFast/SBPFactSheet.pdf", "http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document/pdf/DGA2005.pdf", "http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document/pdf/DGA2005.pdf"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/08/issues-of-food.html", "title": "\nIssues of Food\n"},

Because the e lementary school lunches  are just not appropriate for Joey (he has put on a ton of weight!), we are sending in packed lunches and breakfasts this year. He will buy milk at school.  So we are searching for ideas. Joey's entire daily calorie intake should be 1400-1600 calories, so we need breakfasts around 350 calories and lunches to be around 450-500 calories. Also, we want his total daily carb intake to be less than 200g, and with our family history, maybe no more than 180g. So 45g (3 servings) at breakfast, 60g (4 servings) at lunch, give or take. He needs to have a serving of protein at breakfast and two at lunch.  So far, we have cottage cheese and fruit and yogurt for breakfasts. I wish he ate eggs again. We're going to have to try to get that back into the picture.  For lunches, I could roll veggies in cheese or lunchmeats. I'm hoping he'll keep eating broccoli and sweet potatoes for me. I like to get him eating nuts, too. PB&J is a fine standby, though both boys have been liking those at dinner (and I'd rather go heavier at lunch, and keep the light dinner.) I wish he ate lettuce, that would make things a lot easier. :P  Anybody got any great ideas of delectable foods that can be packed for school?

{"date": "Friday, August 22, 2008", "body": "\nAfter the success of Sunday, we again turned our faces to my Aunt and Uncle's house, and the glories of the pool and the cousins. (Sorry about no pics yet, my hard drive is running short of space, to soon be remedied). It was to be a fine day of fall gardening, relaxing in the pool, and playing with cousins. The perfect adventure.  We tool down the road in good time, stop for breakfast, then stop for gas at the 1/3-way point. We have to cross the Potomac on 301, and I want to be sure we have a nice potty break before crossing into the world of Southern Maryland- it will be a good half-hour before we reach more civilization after leaving the little corner and the safety of its WaWa. We pull out, and toodle down the road. All is good.  Now, there are two ways to get to my Uncle's house. There is a rather straightforward way up I-95, then cut over to 301 from there, but it requires a ride over the Wilson Bridge, a total nightmare, and not a lot of places to stop quickly if Joey feels unwell, which he has been doing more of lately. The longer but pleasanter way is down 301 over the Nice Bridge, with plenty of place to pull over, even the shoulder of the road is reasonably safe if need arises. It's also much prettier, with more to point out to the boys, and plenty of family history to talk about along the way.  Toodle, toodle, toodle. What are all those cars doing up there? Why are they stopped?  Oh, no. Accident on the bridge.  301 might be great if you have to pull over, but turning around? Not so great. Now, better than if there was a problem on 95; but there are other ways to get up the 95 corridor, such as route 1. But once on 301, getting back to 95 is an hour venture, plus we'd be back to the start of our journey. Yeeps. Eeps. Erk. Once on 301, you are stuck on 301. There are not parallel roads to turn on to and skirt the disaster. besides, the disaster is the Bridge. On either road, no \"alternate route\" in the world will help if the bridge is down. There isn't a close alternate bridge.  So we are stuck. For an hour and a half.  Also, 301 at this point sits right next to Dahlgren. For my non-locals, Dahlgren is a military installation that works on missiles and other fun technologies of destruction. Hence, the area is a cell phone dead zone. I can't even call to tell my Uncle what has happened, and why we are running late.  And I have my poor mom with me. Now, this Uncle is my father's brother, but they've been so insistent in asking about her that she decided to join me for the visit. Also, I have two small boys in the car.  And one of them has decided he needs the potty. Now.  One of the good things about having small boys is their keen ability to pee in a cup. A large-sized McDonald's cup, specifically.  Twice.  I hopped out of the car at one point and fetched our crayons and coloring sheets form the back of the van. That bought us some time. We sang songs. We read books. I did some needlepoint. We finally got across the bridge.  First item up for bids was getting a potty for Mommy, who had to drink a very large McDonald's soda in order to provide a cup for other necessities. Then we had to pull over and let the boys run for a minute, as they were going INSANE. Then we still had another hour to drive. Oh, and now it was after noon, and lunch awaited us at the end of that further hour- an hour and half late eating does not make for happy boys.  Yes, it was a joyful ride. One babbling away, the other demanding silence and any toy Joey put his hand to. Mom didn't say much. It was hard to hear one's self think, which is required to form conversation.  But at long last, we arrived, and there was much rejoicing. And much swimming in the pool, despite it being C O L D. And much running of the cousins. Not much gardening. And a smooth ride home, with Andy sleeping most of the way.  But oh, the adventure!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/08/roadtrip.html", "title": "\nRoadtrip\n"},

Everything started out normal: Joey on the Whip, whipping it up, and Andy at the fishing pond, catching sharks and winning prizes, with nary a sidelong glance at the rides.  Then things started getting into gear. Andy got on a little train ride, one of those small things like you find outside grocery stores or in malls. He did OK. Then he got on the ride with the cars that light up. We were ecstatic! Wow! He rode like a champ! then he got on the ride with the bigger fire engine while his brother went outside.  Meanwhile, Joey discovered he was too tall to ride his favorite motorcycle ride. He was upset, and is still repeating, \"I'm too tall! I'm too tall!\" However, he discovered he was tall enough for Big Boy rides! He got on a boat that swung all around (I would have  loved  it when I was young... but now it looked a little dizzying), and the Himalaya (one of those rides that goes around with up-and-downs, and then goes...  eeps .. backwards!), as well as some of the middling rides, like the smaller roller coaster.  Joey likes rides a lot. He was sad about not being able to get on teh little rides, but the big rides were no small consolation!  Andy is in that in-between size- he can ride the little rides, and those \"middling\" rides! So he got on the bumper boats  and  the airplanes. He loved the boats. They didn't look like much fun to me- he kinda just floated around- but he loved them!  Grandma even got in on the ride action! I think she tried to get on the Himalaya with Joey when she realized he got on it, but didn't manage it. She came and got me instead (and I would have liked to have seem photos of my face about every five minutes this whole afternoon. 'Andy's on a  RIDE! ' then 'Joey's on the  WHAT???? ') She did manage to get on the Mixer! The boys had a really great afternoon. Trimper's is always a treat- on the carousel, on the Whip, or just wandering around looking at the great paintings and happy faces. Andy and I even won a couple of real games- we pounded a frog into a lilypad for a big prize, and we picked up ducks, and we shot water guns!

(That's because they ARE! And never fear, I squished them.) It was one sweet prince's first day back to school. we were worried, because there was a new teacher, a new building, and lots of new classmates. I have signed Andy up for the 3-day half-day preschool, so most of the kids in his class are preschool \"newbies.\" Most kids who have a year under their belt go on to the five-day or the full-day. He has a couple familiar faces in there, one from his old class, one from church.  Andy hopped right in and got down to business. I think the teacher was surprised. This is only her fourth year teaching preschool. Let's all wish her luck. Anyway, Andy found a nice game to play and settled right in, so we kissed him and hugged him and left him to his world.   Joey has been a little depressed lately, and leaving Andy at school was very upsetting for him. A visit to Max and Charlie and Jack-Jack didn't cheer him up, so I took him to the Bug Box. And this time, I remembered a camera. He loves the turtles and the snakes, and he's interested in the spiders and butterflies. Most of the bug-bugs, like the stick bugs and the grasshopper, don't hold his attention- I don't think he can discern them from their surrounds yet, or it take a lot of energy for him to do it. The snake was on the move today, so tha brought a giggle out of him.  We didn't stay as long as usual. He was still sad and missing Andy, and there were some very little kids there today, who were whiny. Joey got very upset and concerned about them when they cried or complained, and I think that wore him out, too.  Then we went and got Andy.

We had a Blue's Clues Roller-Coaster Birthday Slumber Party, with popcorn and mac and cheese and presents (they each got a Blue's Clues playset) and sleeping in Grandma's bed! We munched popcorn through Hanna, which was little more than a prolonged summer storm here. No real flooding.  Today we wandered into the woods to see how high the river was. I grew up in these woods. There was once a well-trod path here, beaten smooth by the passing feet of myself and my brother nearly every day. Now my sons had a look at their future domain, two princes of the woods where their mom once roamed free.  I was roaming mostly free in these woods by the age of seven, when we started building the house. I would run down the path into adventure and freedom, and return with the ringing of the ship's bell my mom and dad mounted on our porch. When you heard the bell, it was time to come home. I assure you that bell is very loud, and carries a lot farther through those woods than one might expect.  Joey is now six years old. There was a time when I thought by now we'd be spending summer afternoons with Joey wandering through these woods regularly. That has not been the case. WIll he ever roam free in these trees, in his own little kingdom? Will he learn to return with the clang of the bell? That day certainly is not yet here. I thin kit will come, but not today.  We wandered over to the garden, too, but the deer ate most everything we planted there. I am dreaming of building something of a walk-in cage for future planting, but when will I have time and resource to build such a thing? Anyway, by that time, most of what was being said were whines, as if they were allergic to the woods and outside. I think we need to take more walks together! Beat down the paths a little more! I couldn't even get Joey to look at the swollen river, or the trees, or anything. He was preoccupied with branches constantly brushing him and insects buzzing about and being tired. I may come some mornings and hack at the trees and the paths so he can get more used to being outside, being in the woods, and has some set paths he can use before he strike out to make his own. Andy was being persnickety, too, though he had more interest in the woods, like the tree we saw that had been beaver-felled, and the small yellow flowers, and looking for spider webs. He's not old enough to be wandering about unsupervised, but I still need to get him out into the woods more. I hate to see them both with forest allergy.  In the end, we retreated to the walking along the driveway. Joey is much more comfortable with having the set road to follow.

The boys were so excited! They were very patient waiting for the boat to head out to sea.  Joey and Andy liked looking out and watching the water slip by, and the houses and boats in the harbor. Joey liked the patterns the water made as the boat slipped through it. We also passed the Duckaneer, a boat that looked like a pirate ship. Maybe we'll go on that adventure next year! Andy also liked to show his brother stuff, like the ponies on Assateague, and some of the big boats. He also liked exploring some of the tanks on the boat- with horseshoe crabs and urchins in them! Fortunately, once the boat got going, the boys didn't have to stay seated, they could walk around the boat. Andy would have gone crazy.  My handsome boy sure liked being on the boat, even if it made him a little sleepy. It was also a little chilly, but we did OK in our long clothes. Some of the other folks on the trip looked cold.  We toured the Ocean City harbor before heading out to the island, so we got to see the big fishing boats and trawlers. The guide pointed out boats for fishing, clamming, and even collecting whelks. Andy got to show a whelk shell to the rest of the passengers on the way home.  The boat landed at Assateague, and we disembarked with nets to catch stuff in the water and check out what we found. Everything had to be left behind, though. Andy was eager to get out there and start looking! We had to take off our shoes to keep the sand off the boat. When we came back, they hosed everybody off and checked to be sure everything we found was left behind. They let a couple of kids take some shells, but all the seaweed and sand had to stay put.  The boys wandered along the edges of the island looking for stuff to net. We rolled up the pants and got busy searching for cool stuff!  Some of the other passengers went into areas marked \"closed for preservation of endangered species\", which we didn't appreciate. We stuck to the shore, off the grasses and mudflats. Assateague is a barrier island, so it is constantly changing.  We got to see some of the ponies and some herons, but not the deer we saw last time. that's OK. We'll be back! Joey found a few shells, including a spider crab shell and some clam shells. On the boat, he also got to touch an urchin, a starfish, and a horseshoe crab! Andy's great finds included several kinds of seaweed and clam shells. This red piece was his favorite, but we also found some brown stuff, and some bright green kelp, and some seagrass (which the crabs need to breed!)  We made sure to carefully put everything back in the water that we found in the water. Andy wanted to keep his red seaweed, but we talked about how seaweeds help feed other animals, and he put that back, too. But I made sure to get a photo of it for him (which made him a lot happier about putting it back.) Then we wandered back to the boat, and to the beach. We looked at all sorts of cool things on the boat, too. I think the boys really liked the Assateague Adventure, which was pretty cool for a first boat trip!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0zL654TVI/AAAAAAAABUE/SG24vzjcpFo/s1600-h/12_boys_boatready.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0zDYeP7aI/AAAAAAAABT8/seeRfmzCUa8/s1600-h/12_joey_boatriding.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0y84UqU6I/AAAAAAAABT0/CImKB8sonyQ/s1600-h/12_andy_pointing.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0yz3GdDMI/AAAAAAAABTs/XywFzOGhACA/s1600-h/12_joey.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0ysBFqYPI/AAAAAAAABTk/114EuJii1Vs/s1600-h/12_andy_onboat.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0ykuMjaiI/AAAAAAAABTc/0DDvJr0-jFc/s1600-h/12_boys_nets.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0ycwgwHxI/AAAAAAAABTU/a9R_xzkKwR4/s1600-h/12_joey_shell.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0yWSvtD6I/AAAAAAAABTM/XwIDahMiTdQ/s1600-h/12_andy_seaweed.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL0yKUt5hdI/AAAAAAAABTE/q8UZqxbbvfU/s1600-h/12_boys_headingback2.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/beach-trip-part-three.html", "title": "\nBeach Trip: Part Three\n"},

They are wound up and ready to tear each other apart, while vying for undivided parental attention.  In the car? Choruses of repeated  soundified  cacophony, bounced back and forth, or punctuated with \"DHO-WY!!!DHO-WY!!! BE QUIET! I NEED QUIET!!!!\" In the house? Stampedes of elephants rampage through the house, chasing two terrified cats, while singing \"Blue's Clues\" or the daily Favorite Ditty at the top of their lungs. Sometimes trucks are pushed by said elephants, exponentially increasing the noise.  In the yard? Sand is flung willy-nilly to squeals of protest and sandy bodies dashing past the parental guard into the house... where the child promptly turns into a very sandy elephant.  In the store? I avoid the store during the Witching Hour at all costs. We'll survive a single night without milk, bread, and toilet paper instead.  Any relief from the Witching Hour is infamously temporary. Nothing will eradicate it completely from a day. A method that provides relief today will not work for weeks to come.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 16, 2008", "body": "\nJoey participated in a summer reading program, and for a treat, the school let families come to a picnic lunch with the kids today.  Actually, there wasn't much special, you showed up, and ate a crummy school lunch with your kid. But Andy got to come, and I got to have extra minutes with my Joey, so we were all about it. Woo-hoo! So the invitation said to come five minutes early and meet the children in their classroom to go to lunch. So we pack up Andy and Grandma, and off we go to Hugh Mercer. The parents are arriving in a staggered timing because the picnic is during \"your child's regular lunch period\", which is also staggered. Consequently, we managed to sneak into a parking place just as the first wave of parents were leaving. We present our IDs, get out passes, and go to Joey's classroom- but he isn't there. He now has lunch with the self-contained teacher rather than the autism teacher. Fortunately, Mrs. Huff is a wonderful lady, and she takes us around to Joey's new inclusion room.  Last year, we were very spoiled, and unfortunately, I was unable to take full advantage of it. Joey's kindergarden teacher,  Mrs. S  (they really do call her Mrs. S), is a gift from heaven- a truly talented teacher. Whenever you appeared in Mrs. S's room- announced or otherwise- she had a big smile and a welcome-come-in-and-join-us attitude. There were no bones about it- we were the moms and dads, important to our children and their education, and we were always welcome to come participate in the classroom. Spoiled. Rotten.  We appeared in the door of Mrs. A's room (I'll leave off the full name for right now), escorted by Mrs. Huff, and five minutes ahead of lunchtime, as the invitation stated; Mrs. Huff announced us. We were greeted with, \"Well, we're still doing instruction. They have to meet him in the cafeteria!\"  \"Oh,\" I responded, taken aback. \"We're sorry, we were told to go to his classroom.\" We retreated with Mrs. Huff continuing to apologize, and hotfooted it to the cafeteria.  Not impressed. For one, I'm a parent. I should be welcome to come witness my child's instruction time. For two, she should have addressed me, as I was standing there, if she wanted me to go to the cafeteria. For three, we were instructed to go to his classroom, and she should have been aware of that. All the other teachers were- all the other parents arrived in the cafeteria  with their child's class .  So we are now in the cafeteria- where to wait? The tables each have signs on them to say which teacher sits there, and when. Mrs. A is not listed anywhere. We double-checked. We triple-checked. No sign of her. We finally ask, and apparently Mrs. A has been relegated to the \"Quiet Table\" due to shortage of room (? Don't they know each class that needs a table for lunch before school starts? Even Mrs. S has a table sign!) So we go to wait at that table, and here they come. Dexter and Joey are in the middle, but end up at the end because they both want to hug Andy. We get into the lunch line, and I help Andy and Joey (and mom helps Dexter) get their lunches, and we emerge to find... no-one we know. So we follow Dexter to the table. Where has the rest of the class gone?  Note that no-one has introduced themselves to us, nor really asked who we are. One lady asked if we \"belonged to Joey and Dexter\", and I later discovered this was the classroom aide. Joey's usual aide was out sick, and her sub was not there at the moment (I think she was taking another child somewhere- Joey technically does not have his own aide- and this is a different person from the classroom aide). Suddenly this same person appears and asks Dexter and Joey is they are going to join the class outside for the picnic, and again if we belong to \"Joey and Dexter.\" I corrected her (\"I'm Joey's mom\") but I am not happy that the class was already out the door, and our guys had time to go to the entire other side of the cafeteria and sit down before anyone corralled them. Were they watching? What if Joey had decided to scoot out the door- especially with the change in routine?  We are still not introduced. We scurry after the boys, outside to a grassy spot around the corner. The teacher (I later learned this was the teacher) as two blankets and eight children. She spread one blanket, and Andy, Joey, and Dexter sit there; the other children, the teacher, and an aide sit on that one. The classroom aide sits in the grass between the two after kindly fetching a chair for my mom, who really can't sit on the ground. The teacher finally says something like, \"I'm Mrs. A\" before joining the rest of the class on the other blanket as a few other parents start to arrive (they had gone to the classroom, but had missed the class.) A few stray parents from other classes wandered out to the other huddled groups.  What did I notice about this? For one, my child and his friend were separated from the other students in the class. Was this just because we were already there (whereas the couple of other families arrived shortly after we came outside)? Mrs. A seemed to have no interest in speaking with me whatsoever.  Not  a good sign. Sometime over the course of the lunch, she did thank everyone for coming, but didn't even know my name (\"Thanks to Mrs. C, E's mom.... oh, and thanks to- uh- Joey's mom for coming. Oh, and Joey's Grandma.\"). Even after the lunch is over, and we're marching the class to the computer lab, it is like we were dismissed-by-snub. Andy said his goodbyes, the classroom aide and the aide sub (who arrived as lunch was ending- probably lunch was her break time) said something, but the teacher? Not a word. She was \"busy.\"  Instead of feeling like we were a part of the classroom and Joey's education, we felt like we were annoying this woman and in her way. Not impressed.  Now, I'm not going to stomp my feet over a single negative encounter. But the first impression was definitely not good. If I don't see a definite change in attitude and understanding in the next encounter, we are definitely going to have issues. If this person thinks I'm going to take being treated like this again, she's going to be in for a big- unpleasant- surprise.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq_4hoV_Ufo"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/trouble-brewing.html", "title": "\nTrouble brewing\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 14, 2008", "body": "\n I've been fiddling a lot with genealogy and scanning in a lot of family pics (did you notice?) I'm working on becoming a genealogist. Looking at the pictures and working with names has been a little surreal. Most of these photos are images that have been in my life all my life- faces of people I never knew, images of people I did know, and do know; frozen upon paper and caught in time.  The older photos, the ones of my great-grandparents and great-great grandparents, they have a special quality of both familiar and strange. I look at those faces, and think f them- this is great-grandmother Heinz, This is great-grandmother Conway (actually, great-grandmother Phillips, she got remarried). The photos my mom knows and points out, set in the 1920s, the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s. Then I have the names. My grandmother's parents were Bertram Evan Heinz and Elsie LaBlanche DuPler. Actually, Elsie LaBlanche DuPler Heinz, but I don't think of her that way, because in genealogy charts, you record women by their maiden name. Elsie LaBlanche DuPler has been tough to find. I' not sure when she arrived in Maryland, but I suspect her family is not there. I have photos of her mother and father, but I have no idea when the photo is taken, or where (though it is around the turn of the century).  Like my grandmother, Elsie LaBlanche DuPler was an artist; I have some of her work, including a line drawing for a magazine. I've been told she did some drawing for a magazine, but no one seems to agree which magazine. She was French, and her parents were born in France; the photo I have of them does indeed look like something out of  Gigi . This French lady married into a family of German Methodist ministers (the kind that don't like comfortable furniture). She had five children, four girls and a boy. The last art I have evidence of her doing is in the 1920s- apparently being a mother took precedence over self-expression.  As I was flipping through the photos of great-grandmother Heinz, it really hit me that this was her- this was Elsie LaBlanche DuPler. It was kind of like looking into the  Mirror of Erised . That is her. So many stories, so much research, so much delving into records and pasts trying in vain to find her. Yet there she is. She lived. She was.  I want my boys to understand their connection to the past. Understanding history is understanding the development of thought and understanding of the world. To progress with thought and understanding, to move truly forward, to choose to move forward, you have to have an idea of where you have been. There is also something about not letting people simply fade away, lost in an oblivion of time. To make lives have worth, to not forget. To realize the impact of people you never knew, never met, upon your own life. To know that Joey's impact, Andy's impact, upon our lives will echo, will continue, will be and have been.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SM1ztpBM4_I/AAAAAAAABZE/4dJ1NPI7RZg/s1600-h/fishing.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SM1ztq3IXaI/AAAAAAAABZM/hj8XzCrmPTY/s1600-h/granheinz.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SM1zt3TDgQI/AAAAAAAABZU/v8TMvYw1gng/s1600-h/granheinz2.jpg", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051658/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SM1zt2OaheI/AAAAAAAABZc/of2HMmKucfk/s1600-h/ggrandmother_beach.jpg", "http://hp-lexicon.info/about/books/ps/rg-ps12.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/genealogy.html", "title": "\nGenealogy\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 22, 2008", "body": "\nWe had a lovely day at the fair. Last year this week, we had been sick as the proverbial dogs after our beach vacation*; but this year, despite my own headcold, we were determined. Joey went to his swimming lesson (he just loves them!) and then we were off to St. Mary\u2019s.  The main attraction for the guys this year was the pigs, followed closely by the sheep. They could have looked at pigs and sheep all afternoon. We also looked at the chickens, the turkeys (the boys still don\u2019t like  turkeys ), the rabbits (fuzzy!), the goats, the Clydesdales, and the alpacas. We zipped through the 4-H building looking at the veggies, but the boys weren\u2019t really into that this year. I think if we had taken them through the ag building with the pumpkins, we would have had better luck. Anyway, we had some lunch, then off to the rides (light lunch- didn\u2019t know what was ahead of us.) They had some pretty new rides this year, which was nice. One of them was a dragon roller-coaster that the boys hopped on and were very, very happy \u201cdriving the dragon.\u201d Then it was time for Joey to pick a big-boy ride.  He picked the Hurricane.  Note to self: before putting your six-year-old on a big ride, watch the ride in its entirety.  It started fine, going around in a circle. Then it sped up and the cars started to lift, and Joey wasn\u2019t happy about that.  Then it did its thing. Oh. My. God. The arms went up and down while you were in the car sideways, and spinning around. He actually liked that part, but then it slowed down to ta spin and down again, and I think his tummy was a bit off. Talking later to other folks with kids on the ride, apparently a lot of crummies in tummies from that ride. Yikers.  We went on a few more, slower rides, and the dragon again, and then did some moon bouncing. By the time they got out of the moonbounce, they were both ready to fall over. That\u2019s a good day.  So we ran through one of the commercial buildings looking for pens from our presidential candidates- and they weren\u2019t giving out pens. In fact, only one place in the whole building had pens. That sucks. But we got our one pen and let the tummies calm down, got some ice cream, and headed home.  I won\u2019t say there were no rocky moments in our trip, but what trip with kids has no rocky moments? They were few, brief, and the boys had a fabulous time. It\u2019s nice to have an A+ trip now and again.  Happy Autumn Equinox! *There was a LOT going on this week last year. But the reason we skipped the fair was we all had colds.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/day-at-fair.html", "title": "\nA Day at The Fair\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 23, 2008", "body": "\nI\u2019ve been getting a lot of emails asking me to review and endorse products here at Life With Joey. Is it so common for folks to endorse products on their blogs? I generally ignore these emails. If I want to talk about a product or service, I talk about it: TV shows we like, toys we think are helpful or fun, services that have helped Joey and Andy grow and develop. I share these with you.  So you all know we love  Signing Time . If you don\u2019t, check out some of my  previous   posts   about   our   experience  of  Signing Tim e and Joey\u2019s  improved   communication ! I was honored and flattered to be contacted by  Signing Time  and asked if I would like to review  Baby Signing Time 3 and 4 , which will be released this October. Why do we love  Signing Time ? Because it is a well-made series focused not really on signing, but on communicating. Signs are introduced to a multi-sensory approach: there is a picture of the word, the word spelled out, the sign (explained by Rachel so that the sign actually makes sense and connects to the word it represents), and then age-appropriate models using the signs with music. Not only is this a great way to teach hearing kids to sign, but it gives multiple avenues of access for different learning styles to learn words. Signing Time selects vocabulary that is also age-appropriate and pragmatic: words that kids will know and use. The episodes then group these signs so that they connect together and help kids remember them. The episodes provide plenty of signs, so even a single episode can get you moving on your way to communication.  The screening DVD included Episode 3 (A New Day) and Episode 4 (Let\u2019s Be Friends.) It also included an interview about a child who learned to read as a baby, emphasizing the multi-faceted approach to the signs mentioned above. I wasn't much into the interview, it was kind of preaching to the choir, and though it mentioned not all babies will learn to read with Signing Time, just having the interview included implied this. It needed to be presented differently so it looked less like an ad, and more like a \"wow, isn't this a really awesome child!\" Maybe label it something about \"Meet the kids of Signing Time!\" or \"Welcome to our community!\" or something like that.  Although I know and love the regular Signing Time series, this was my first experience with Baby Signing Time.  Baby Signing Time is geared to infants and young toddlers, through about age two. If you have a three-year-old, then you might want to just jump right into the first episodes of the first Signing Time Series. If you have a child in elementary school, add Series Two as well. For middle schoolers, I\u2019d start right in on Series Two, which is a little more connected and progressive than Series One.  Episode 3 (A New Day) was mostly introducing signs connected with the outdoors: weather, things you would see outside, bugs, useful signs for outside like stop, go, wait, and again, and night sky words.           The songs were simple, age-appropriate, and most importantly, not irritating to me as an adult. This is also part of the charm of the series- it includes music you can use to practice signs and play in your car without going nuts, because the songs don\u2019t talk down to the children. The songs and modeling of the signs made the signs relevant to young children, which will hold their interest. Seeing Rachel in bug headgear is worth the price of admission. At the end, parents get a treat with the song  Little Hands .  Episode 4 (Let\u2019s Be Friends) provides a wide range of general-communication signs, relevant to young children at play: signs about friends, opposites, feelings, toys, and foods.           The episode is upbeat and stresses positives, even when introducing signs such as \u201csad\u201d and \u201ccry\u201d (the song talks about the fact that feelings aren\u2019t good or bad; they are just how you feel!) Again, the episode is a string of simple, listenable songs geared to very young children. The parent treat song at the end is  Show Me A Sign .  The episodes use a few strategies that worked with my kids when they were very young to hold interest and keep the boys focused. First, Rachel exaggerates her facial expressions more than in the regular Signing Time videos. For young children learning to read other people\u2019s emotions, this is really helpful. Another good technical point as the use of bright, bold backgrounds behind the models before switching to natural settings. These bright backgrounds attracted my kids when they were very little, and I think it makes the models and signs easier for young children to see. Another really great thing al the Signing Time videos do is to use age-appropriate models, but also some models slightly older than the target audience. Baby Signing Time uses infants, toddlers, and preschoolers of diverse backgrounds and abilities to show the signs in action. Disabled children are included. Perfect signing isn\u2019t the point; showing a variety of children signing gives young children confidence in using their hands to communicate (even when their motor skills might be sketchy).  Do I think Signing Time and Baby Signing Time are good investments? Let\u2019s just say, I\u2019m saving up my money to get Series Two for my guys for Christmas, and I'll be getting Baby Signing Time for several families with new additions.  Getting children access to communication early, especially if there appears to be communications issues, is something I think vital to early intervention programs, and Baby Signing Time is an excellent tool for teaching communication skills to young children. Allowing a child to communicate can make a huge difference in their ability to function without frustration. Do we believe in using sign? Yes, we do. For Joey, it has made all the difference in the world.

He does this most nights, and then I end up in the recliner for the remainder of the night, because we only have a queen-size bed. We've tried a couple of times to break this nightly habit, but all such campaigns have only resulted in less sleep and still waking up with a boy in the bed.  Last night, I felt that familiar depression of a boy climbed up onto the bed, crawling across, and settling between me and JoeyAndyDad. He snuggled in, then draped his arm over me, and gave me a little squeeze.  And very, very quietly, I heard him say:  \"Squishy squishy squishy.\"  These are the rewards of being a mom.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/10/voice-in-darkness.html", "title": "\nA Voice in the Darkness\n"},

I write a new one every week, but the basics are, \"Dear Joey, I love you. I hope you like your lunch. Love, Mommy.\" Nothing has been said about these notes, and Joey isn't saying much about school these days (hence our current string of meetings with teachers). I just put them in because it gives him something to read, I miss him, and I want him to know I am thinking about him even when he is in school. But really, I haven't given them too much thought from Joey's point of view.  I'm working today. When I work, I am shut upstairs with my computer, the laundry, and some snacks, and emerge around five o'clock. On my breaks i change the beds, flip laundry, and eat. It isn't very exciting.  I forgot to bring up my lunch and take my meds this morning, so during my break I hot-footed it down the stairs to find boys preparing for lunch. Joey has been in the habit of carrying notebooks and crayons around with him, so I didn't think much of it when he seized my grocery list pad and a pen and started writing, taking little note of me rummaging through the freezer for a bowl of something-that-needs-to-get-eaten. I was already headed up the stairs, having stolen a kiss atop his busy head, when he came running to hand me the pad, \"Mom! Mom! Look what I wrote!\"  I took the pad from him, and he beamed as I read it:  \"Dear Mommy, I love you. I love you, too.

{"date": "Monday, September 29, 2008", "body": "\nThe way current special education law is written and interpreted, parents are supposed to be \"equal members\" in a child's IEP team. That means that a parent is expected to participate in developing a child's IEP, and their opinions are supposed to be counted as much as any other member of the team.  And the more I get into developing IEPs, and dealing with schools, and looking at regulations- especially the  new regulations  being written in Virginia- the more I think this is wrong.  By making a parent \"just another committee member\", the parent is outnumbered in every committee they walk into. When I walk into an IEP meeting, I am, at best, outnumbered 3:1 in favor of the school. Often it is more like 6:1. I've had it be as high as 8:1 (administrator, student services director, special education teacher, regular education teacher, autism coordinator/specialist, psychologist, occupational therapist, and speech therapist to me), and I haven't had any monster IEP meetings I've heard legends of. No matter how hard a parent advocates for the child, they are under the weight of school personnel consensus.  The fact is, as a parent, I am the one legally responsible for my child's education, rearing, safety, and health. At the end of the day, the year, the childhood, it is me, the parent, who must bear responsibility for the decisions of this ever-changing and often-hostile committee; and my child who bears the consequences of every failure along the way. In every meeting, my child is guaranteed only one voice in his defense and favor. Everyone else has a very basic conflict of interest- they are employed by the school, with a budget and a whole school population to consider. Only I (right now- until Joey can self-advocate) have only Joey to think about.  So why am I only just another member? Shouldn't I at the very least have 50% say? In all the complaints from schools about parents who want basically the ability to veto, I must say, damn straight I want veto power. This is  my  child we're talking about.  We have been fortunate this year and last year. Joey's current case manager is a person who really does care about Joey as a person, and is interested in getting him the support he needs to be successful. She considers what he needs individually, and not based on what other children in the program might or might not need. Unfortunately, we know from experience that it doesn't always work that way. What will his case manager be like when we move to the upper elementary? Will we revert to the attitude of the preschool, \"we need to consider the kids with more needs- your child is too high-functioning to get support\"?  No one knows Joey like I know Joey. I should think that even if this \"committee of equals\" must be, my voice would be the likes of Athens: a first among equals.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/dueproc/regulationsCWD.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/equal-members.html", "title": "\nEqual Members\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 03, 2008", "body": "\nI met with Ms. A, but really didn't get much farther. The upshot is Joey is bored and needs to be challenged, so she is meeting with his case manager to figure out what to do.  See, special education is not set up to deal with gifted kids who have special needs. They are set up for physical disability and mental retardation. They are set up to slow down, take a slower pace to get to academic material, rather than set up new ways of communicating information and with children. The idea of a special ed gifted child is considered a contradiction in terms, a real paradox by people who have no idea what special ed- and by some folks who teach there. They are not trained to deal with a child whose challenges don't include the academics.  Joey's last teacher was a creative, dynamic lady who could deal with this sort of thing. She was a whiz at making lessons and activities fit a whole range of needs and expectations.  This lady is worried about Joey feeling \"different\" if she gives him different work. I can understand that problem, but the fat is, Joey  is  different. Maybe instead of hiding it from him, we should embrace it, and help him to embrace it. Give him the challenge. Make his school work relevant to him. Is it a different worksheet from the person next to you? Sure it is. Can you accept the challenge, Joey? How about this extra work? Or better yet, extra fun?  Right now, Ms. A is handling it by having Joey hep other students. He is therefore forced to interact with other kids (she doesn't allow him to just do their work). No wonder he's been saying he wants to be a teacher when he grows up. It's an OK idea, it gives Joey the challenge of social skills that he does need, but Joey isn't progressing in the academics. I remember being bored in school. Boredom leads to all sorts of problems- including social ones.  So we are working on it. I did make sure certain things got noted, such as the cafeteria situation being dangerous- you can't just leave my kid to flounder with a change in schedule. I don't really care that you went over the change with your other students that morning- you have to be sure Joey not only gets told what is coming, but if it is a major change, you have to guide him through it- actively. She just comes across as an OK teacher, doing an OK job, and so Joey is just doing OK with her.

{"date": "Sunday, October 05, 2008", "body": "\nIn my quick guide to IEP season ( The Crazy Season ), I mentioned putting together a powerpoint presentation of your child to personalize the proceedings. This idea is catching on elsewhere, so I thought I'd talk about it a little more for folks who may be going into meetings, or expecting to, and feeling overwhelmed.  If you are feeling totally out of control, or uncomfortable about your school folks, or just crazy-crazy, a good thing to do is to step back, take a deep breath, and create a reminder of what the focus of this meeting ought to be: your child. How well do the school personnel really know your child? What information do they need to plan and prepare an appropriate program for your child? Who is this child, and what does the child really need? What do you, as the parent, expect?  What we did is put together a powerpoint presentation. If you are not familiar with powerpoint, don't panic, it is a very easy program. It's word processing for slide shows. We set ours up so that each slide had bullet-point information about Joey on one side, a photo of Joey on the other, and we alternated which side was which for visual interest. You can plunk short video into it, too, instead of a photo. We only did this once, but I'll get to that in a minute.  In our slide show, we wanted to emphasize Joey as a human being, as a child with potential, and as the focus of the program being discussed. We were entering a new school, with an almost entirely new staff, and we wanted to communicate to these new people the importance of what we were doing in planning Joey's kindergarden program.  With this in mind, we asked ourselves first and foremost: Who is Joey?  This Question sets the tone for the presentation. This isn't about being sappy, this is about humanizing a process that is very apt to dehumanizing and bureaucratizing. We selected a photo of Joey and made two clear statements of Joey: Joey is our bright, cheerful, loving son and Joey is a caring and helpful older brother. We wanted to encapsulate Joey's personality and position in just a few easy-to-read statements. Bullet points break things down for clarity, give your viewer a clear list. Keep it simple, but pack it. Every word counts.  Next, we listed things Joey likes. This information is helpful in keeping the presentation positive and providing information about motivators and frame-of-reference. You can get a lot more done with Joey if you understand that he loves Little Bear and the color blue. We put a simple one-slide list paired with a photo of a \"like\" that we didn't directly list. Then we used a second slide to list the TV shows and Movies that were most important to understanding Joey and his speech (Joey often quotes these shows when trying to form language and communicate). Next, we added a slide of Joey's favorite stories. Again, this provides a frame-of-reference for the teachers; they can familiarize themselves with a short list of narratives your child is particularly attached to, then use this information to facilitate communication and motivation.  Now that there is a clear idea of what Joey likes, we went straight into Joey's strengths. Again, we wanted to keep the presentation positive. If your child has very strong dislikes that you think need to be clear and addressed, go ahead and put those in; but it might be a good idea to include problems (especially sensory issues) with another section addressing issues.  We dedicated three slides to strengths. Two were strengths we knew about and had documented. Then we put in a slide about strengths noted by his therapists. This lets the teachers know Joey  has  therapists, and things that might not have been observed at home. We then listed the latest successes (at the time, potty training, fetching items from another room, and learning ASL were important successes to note for Joey).  Instead of countering all this positive information with something like \"weaknesses\" or \"issues\", we chose to label the next section \"challenges.\" Now we were getting into the meat and potatoes of what teachers wanted to talk about. IEP meetings seem inherently negative, because the discussion focuses on weaknesses and what will be done to shore up skills and get the child progressing. Progress itself seems to fall to the wayside. However, it is important to show that you are familiar with your child's challenges, and state what you think needs to be addressed. We had one slide of challenges we wanted addressed, then one slide of challenges noted by his therapists. This gives some authority to your presentation: these aren't just things you're paranoid about, but rather these are things noted by an independent source as problematic.  This is where we put our short video, so the teacher could get a sense of the behaviors Joey manifests- particularly the tracking and clicking. Explaining tracking to someone can be a little difficult if they have never seen it.  Continuing the challenges theme, we then noted the concerns raised by the various evaluations we had of Joey. We did as full a set as we could get anyone to do on Joey before he entered kindergarden, trying to get a baseline. Why people won't just do a full work-up on a child I don't know; but we did the best we could, and then noted all the concerns in the powerpoint. Again, this gives the teachers something to work with, but also makes it clear you know where your child stands and what s/he needs. Knowing what to ask for is a huge part of the IEP battle.  We divided the concerns into different slides based on the field: PT, OT, Speech. Then we did a slide just of other concerns we felt needed to be addressed- things we had noticed needed attention, things that Andy could do, but Joey still couldn't, etc. this is slightly different from \"challenges.\" Our \"Challenges\" section included things like \"Being able to create a sentence\", \"maintaining interaction with peers\", etc. This \"Concerns\" section was more specific: \"Ability to take turns\", \"Ability to recognize consonant sounds\", \"unable to roll out playdoh.\"  We concluded our presentation with \"Our Goals and Dreams for Joey.\" This is an important slide, don't neglect it. Teachers are thinking of IEPs in terms of year-to-year. Our job as parents is to have a bigger picture in mind, a long-term vision of where we think the child can go, what s/he can achieve. Let the school personnel know what you are expecting in the long term. Be ambitious, but realistic. We want Joey to eventually be able to continue his education if he so chooses. We want him to be able to self-advocate. We want him prepared to function as an autistic individual in a non-autistic world. We want him to be able to participate in an inclusion setting with (and eventually without) a paraprofessional. Make it clear: my child is a human being, and I want my child to participate in society. With Joey, these long-term goals are certainly reasonable.  One tip: use positive photographs, even in the \"challenges\" sections. Make sure the child's face is seen often and as clearly as possible. Emphasize the human-ness and reality of your child. The negatives will tend to emphasize themselves, but often no-disabled people have trouble seeing disabled people in a positive manner, so use the power of this visual to emphasize the positive- especially when you are talking about things that seem negative.  The good part about making the powerpoint is it gets you organized in your head. You get a nice, clear picture of your child's strengths and challenges, and what you want the school to do about it. You clarify your expectations- not just for them, but for you. \"This is where we are. This is where we want to go. This is what is getting in our way.\" But most importantly, you clarify that your child is a child like all children, that disability is not dehumanizing. This is a human being who needs support. If you provide that support, we can achieve these long-term goals.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/10/powerpoint-thinking.html", "title": "\nPowerpoint Thinking\n"},
{"date": "Monday, October 06, 2008", "body": "\n Stanford University is developing a safer test for children with aneuploidies, particularly Down's Syndrome.  The extra chromosome is picked up in the mother's blood, instead of an invasive test that risks injury of the fetus or even miscarriage. Part of the \"good news\" about the new test is that it can be done very early in the pregnancy, \"giving women more time to make choices about their pregnancy.\" Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association, said: \"There is no question that these non-invasive tests will be introduced in the next few years. \"It's therefore incredibly important that potential parents are given accurate information on Down's syndrome before they make a choice about whether to terminate or not. \"We don't consider Down's syndrome a reason for termination, but we recognise that bringing up a child with Down's syndrome isn't right for everyone. \"The more informed parents are, the better the position they are in to make the choice that is right for them.\" Carol Boys is absolutely correct. Parents need to be informed, and make an informed choice- not a choice out of fear of the unknown... fear of  Holland .  I have  written  on this  subject  before, but revisiting this theme is something I find worth doing. Not everyone reads old blog posts, and each day there are new parents in our little corner of the world- the one labeled \"special needs.\" They need to be informed. We all do. However, I am especially keen on making parents informed before that baby is even born. The decision to have a child- any child- should not be based on fear. It should be grounded in solid, reliable, and complete information, as complete as we can make it. Raising a special needs child is a special challenge. However, raising any child is a challenge. The challenges are different, the experience of parenthood may be different, the friends you make and the ideas you value, the insights you gain and stories you tell may be different, but different is not worse.  If parents knew the supports available, the resources out here, had clear understanding of their rights and what to do to cross those hurdles and meet those challenges, would raising a special needs child be such a terrible thing? If people understood that a person's special needs, even when severe, makes them no less a human being, no less an asset to the human race, would there be more resources available?  In all those \"So You're Expecting!\" books, we ought to have a chapter, \"What if my baby has special needs?\" The opening of that chapter should be: \"All people have special needs. The trick is knowing what resources are available, and how to use those resources to best support and raise your child.\"  Without that understanding, the choice made is not informed by facts, logic, and information. It is made from fear.  To all you expecting parents out there:  Be prepared.  But don't be afraid.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7654201.stm", "http://www.our-kids.org/Archives/Holland.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/10/informed-decisions.html", "title": "\nInformed Decisions\n"},

Then he started putting random words into the blanks, with his old fist grip and the worst handwriting I've seen him produce in months. What the...? I finally gave up and sent him to sit in his room (and hopefully calm down and rest a little), and his dad is wrestling with the worksheets now. Why is it such a big deal that the sheets are for school, rather than for me? Am I going to have to set up a homework cubicle?  Yikes!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/10/homework-strategies.html", "title": "\nHomework strategies\n"},

The story usually begins, \"Once Upon a Time, T-Rex Andy was stomping through the woods...\" and then we have Mommy make up a little adventure, then Andy takes up the thread (when I say, \"The End\", Andy then says, \"Then...\" and starts his own story). Joey can hear us doing this in Andy's room while he is having his own ritual in his own room with JoeyAndyDad.  Joey decided tonight that he wanted to make up a story, too.  With a little help from JoeyAndyDad, Joey made up his own story. He wanted to talk about  Hopkins  (from  Signing Time ) and Blue (from  Blue's Clues ... he's been on a bit of a  Blue's Clues  kick), so Dad suggested Blue could Skidoo into  Signing Time  to play with  Hopkins . So Joey made up his own adventure, where Blue was trying to tell everyone she wanted to learn to sign! (Blue in the  Treehouse  was the first clue, Blue's paws were the second clue, and a frog was the third clue!)

I miss the trees that used to be in the yards around us; the fall isn't the same without the changing red leaves of the dogwood or the brilliant yellow of the old Tree of Heaven trees and mulberries. They all went down with  Isabel . The neighbors used to have cherry trees, but when they also went with Isabel, they planted pear trees- not as nice, either.  But the roses are having their fall bloom, and I am working on getting things cleared out and mulched in. I know you shouldn't mulch before first frost, but I have to do what I can when I can, or it doesn't get done at all. I picked some zinnias to take into the house. The boys were playing- Andy in sandbox, Joey with his hulahoop. He likes to pretend he is a car, with the hoop around his waist. Andy's dinosaurs were rescuing each other. Joey was zooming around the yard. I took a break from yardwork to sit on my bench- which could use a good coat of paint.  Then Joey sits next to me.  \"Let's have two seats,\" he says. \"Let's go!\" \"You're driving,\" I smile to my left at him. He grins and vrooms.  \"Where are we going?\" I ask casually.  \"We're taking Grandma home. Then we go to the store.\"  I watch him pretending to drive, happy as a clam. Vroom!  \"What do we need at the store?\" I ask. \"Cookies! We need cookies. Better go to the store!\"  And he's off, the hula hoop around his waist.

{"date": "Saturday, October 11, 2008", "body": "\nYes, I was supposed to work this morning. That is what I was supposed to do. But sometimes life has other plans.  This morning we awoke to Andy hacking his lungs out and Joey bouncing at our feet. So we dragged ourselves out of bed to deal with morning madness. We decided try tuck Andy back into his bed with some cough meds and try to get him to rest. JoeyAndyDad hopped into the car with Joey to get some doughnuts. I got my work corner ready for the day. I thought about calling in to work only half the day, as Andy looked pretty rough and might need a trip to the doctor; at the very least, JoeyAndyDad might need some help (having the boys on two different levels of the house is a bit of a challenge).  The phone rang. Who calls the house at 8 in the morning?  JoeyAndyDad does, when the car just cuts off while driving. Again. I get a premonition that it would be a good idea to call and cancel my work session, which I do before carrying Andy as-is to the car to go get Joey, while JoeyAndyDad calls for a tow truck. I grab Joey, then go get the doughnuts (We love  Krispy Kreme !) and come back to lighten up the wait for the tow truck with warm, sugary, doughnutty goodness. The plan is to take the car over to Jeff's (our mechanic), and pick up the car we left there to be winterized (the Jeep). But then. what if the other car isn't ready enough to be driven? I didn't want to strand JoeyAndyDad out there, so I waited to go over with him.  Sure enough, the Jeep isn't ready. So we leave the green car and the red car and head home. By this time, Andy is looking positively perky, Joey is beside himself, and things are generally going crazy. I make an executive decision to take the boys to the  Bug Box , which is having a special event today.  We had a fabulous time. i didn't take the camera, because I left JoeyAndyDad home to recover from his morning. We looked at bugs, and played at the various tables, and made thank-you cards and ornaments for wounded veterans, and a good time was had by all. Then we got thirsty and tired, so we headed back to the car to go get some lunch and drinks. I got everybody strapped in, plopped tiredly into my seat, and turned the key.  And nothing happened.  And when I say nothing, I mean  nothing . No power  at all . The door locks were not even working now. Nada. Silence.  Fortunately, there is an auto parts store right behind the Bug Box, and we were parked right in front of it. Even more fortunately, there is a very nice man working there. Several other ladies who were loading up their tired, thirsty children suggested I run in there for help, and they kept an eye on my guys while I did so. It took a few minutes to get their attention and ask, and then a few more minutes for them to finish up what they were doing to come out and help- long enough that one of the nice ladies came in to check and make sure they  were  going to help. And they took so long coming out that she had turned her car around to help jump my car, as I already had cables.  I would like to take this opportunity to say, thank you, very nice ladies who took their time to help me, to watch my kids, and to offer their battery, when they all had better things to do and tired, thirsty kids of their own. I don't think those ladies have any idea how grateful I am.  We were about to hook up the cables when the guy came out of the shop with a jump machine, so I rather flusteredly thanked the nice lady and sent her on her way (I hope she wasn't insulted... I was pretty flustered). Turns out it was a good thing I did. Apparently, my battery was super-duper hot- something was overcharging it. Our first attempt to jump it with the machine was a failure, not enough power. The guy then went and drove his big truck around and connected up my cables.  And they melted.  So I was glad the nice lady who stayed got to go home instead of using her battery, it could have been a huge disaster, and someone could have been hurt. Instead, the guy fetched his industrial cables, and got a surface charge going so I could get the car started. I was fine- as long as I didn't turn the car off. Oh, and the jump blew the fuse for my radio (or shorted it out).  So I drove the guys home, tossed them to their Dad, left instructions for my mother to be called to pick me up, and off I drove back to Jeff's. He wasn't there, but I left a note.  That's right. All three cars were now in his tender care.  Mom is letting me borrow the truck so I can get Joey to his swim lesson in the morning and Andy to school on Monday. We're working on how to get JoeyAndyDad to work on Monday. I stopped to grab a child seat, and Jeff had returned. We both laughed hard, but he also promised to get us a working car ASAP, probably Monday night (the Jeep just needs an inspection to be in working order- but what if the stations are closed for  Columbus Day ?)  We are eagerly awaiting the call.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.krispykreme.com/", "http://www.bugbox.net/", "http://holidays.kaboose.com/columbus-day/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/10/dead-cars.html", "title": "\nDead cars\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 16, 2008", "body": "\nClub 166 has drawn our attention to an  offensive skit  put on by Saturday Night Live, and now showcased on NBC's website. The fact that people find this funny is very disturbing. This isn't laughing with someone (such as  The Birdcage  might be to the gay community). This SNL skit is nothing but pure mean. 100% pure mean. If you think something this mean is funny, all I can say is, wait until this kind of meanness is directed at you.  Even though Joey stayed home from school today with his cough, we went ahead and had OT. It's amazing how much work my boys have done in the last few years. Andy's OT saw us there, so she fetched the results from his latest eval and sat down with me to look at it. He's gone from moderate deficits in motor control and sensory integration, to being fully functional in the classroom and displaying normal-range motor skills in our year of OT. We have a number of strategies for dealing with the remaining sensory issues. We are considering having him in a group OT setting over the summer, but for all intents and purposes, he's discharged. How's  them  apples?  Around the corner came a friend of ours from school. His mom is big in the disability community around here. He's in middle school now. He's come a long way; he asks and answers questions now, even though his speech pattern consists of rises and falls of inflection that give his speech and eerie, sing-song sound, he does speak with good control of language. He flapped his hands happily to see his mom in the waiting room. He had come out to get some water, and the OT aide came with him to guide him over to the sink, where he got his own water, though it took some prompting and a few tries. A sing-song stream of talk on his favorite subject accompanied the process, then stopped abruptly when it was time to return to the session.  I thought of that SNL skit, and realized, with a deep sense of grief and anger, that people who think that skit is funny, probably will think this child is funny. And stupid. And not worth knowing. And how wrong they are. The child has problems with social behavior and cues, but his ability to read and do math are amazing. Listening to his knowledge on his favorite topics is like listening to a living dissertation. He tells jokes- good ones. He has his own way of doing things, many very inventive ways of getting around his own motor skill difficulties. He's a good, smart, hard-working kid. To think of him as the butt of jokes because of his challenges just makes me see red.  Joey comes out, and I know he will also be facing those people who think mean is funny. He tilts his head, smiling as he jogs in a tight circle while his OT tells me about the session. He shows me the pumpkin he drew, a beautiful orange jack-o-lantern, with \"Jack-o-lantern\" written in his blocky letters on the back. I have a first grader who can spell \"headphones\" and \"smudge\" and \"cheeseburger\", who can read on a third-grade level, who can add three numbers together- but he is still considered by some people to be a joke. Something to be scorned, laughed at, put down.  Then they tell me to \"get over it.\"  I don't think so.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/10/send-comments-to-nbc.html", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115685/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-it-isnt-funny.html", "title": "\nWhy it isn't funny\n"},

First and foremost, this absolutely must go to  Maddy at Whitterer on Autism , always good for a new insight into life with people who think about the world in a very different way from you do- and live in the same house. And not just the autistic people. I also recommend her blog  Sandwiched Genes , which includes more of the old-style  Maddy posts about conversations in her house, as if you were a fly on the wall. I'd get swatted, of course, because the room would hear me giggling.  This also must go to  Stimey at Stimeyland , who embiggens us all. One of these days I'm getting up there for a playdate, Stimey. Really. I think our kids would have a blast. Discover her adventures in having sons, with and without autism.  Here is to  Miss Kitty at Educated and Poor , and her adventures in academia. Miss Kitty taught an awesome class about country music over the summer- how cool is that for a comp lit prof? Better yet, she has a chicken named Myrtle May, and lots and lots of kitties at the Happy Kitty Cottage! Please go visit  Ambulance Driver at A Day In the Life of an Ambulance Driver . The evil Sumdood lurks in the corners of a world of coffee, midnight ambulance runs, hurricanes, and a beautiful little girl named KatyBeth. AD addresses issues of entitlement, disability, compassion, and trying to make sense of complete nonsense in the medical world.  One of the new blogs I'm following- and finding really interesting- is  Jen at I'm Going Coconuts . I'm kind of lurking there, but I think it is worth a look at her life with her beautiful children, including a child with Asperger's Syndrome. She's starting to navigate through the special ed world.  Here's one for  Kristina at Autism Vox , where we discover the larger issues of disability rights and experience, combined with personal notes abotu her family and experience close-at-hand with autism.  And then everybody ought to go say hello to  kristi at Autism, Blessings, Challenges  her her wonderful TC. It's a straight forward blog about day-to-day living in a world that includes autism.  abfh already awarded it to  Niksmom at Maternal Instincts , but I thought I'd let her know I'd give it to her, too, But it doesnt' count to give it to somebody who already just got it, right?

And by that time there was no one left to speak up.\"                -Martin Niem\u00f6ller There are many times when someone said or did something ignorant and mean, and I have spoken up. Every time I do so, I of course get my share of folks who support and folks who just plain don't get why I'm unhappy. Such is the way of the world; ignorance is hard to admit to and give up.  And there are plenty of moments when I have been reminded of my own ignorance, bias, and thoughtlessness. Thinking and changing is part of growing, and may I never stop growing until I'm dead. There is always more to learn.  But it remains hard to realize that there are some lessons people should have long ago learned and generalized, and yet the mistakes remain part of our society, even praised. Being\"politically correct\" once meant you showed respect to others and engaged in constructive dialogue using constructive language; somewhere along the way, that got lost in a frenzy of semantics and bulldog attitudes that insisted the point was more than to not offend. Is it really more respectful to say \"disabled\" instead of \"handicapped\"? The idea of asking a disabled or handicapped person- particularly the person standing in front of you- got lost in the war of folks on one side or the other. So much for being politically correct. The phrase got picked up and bashed by those who only wanted to think of themselves, which is  so  much easier, anyway.  Why is it is still \"funny\" to laugh at people, instead of with people? Most of us recoil at the idea of blackface being funny, but still laugh at the \"retard.\" We fail to see the difference between Bill Cosby talking about having to kiss his aunts or dropping his ice cream and  Topsy  jokes. Do you know the difference? Why is latter offensive, and the former not? Why do people still think it funny to laugh at other people, when it is well-known that laughing at someone because of their race or religion is unacceptable?  There is a huge difference between laughing  at  someone, and laughing  with  someone. Laughing  at  people is mean.

He spent a good part of the afternoon cradling it in his arms, patting it lovingly, and referring to it as his \"baby pumpkin.\" Which, it is- a baby, unripe pumpkin. Smart boy.  Andy picked out this little tiny pumpkin. Now, when I was a mere lass, my brother and I picked out a pair of pumpkins together. His was very tall and thin, and mine was tiny. We called them \"Laurel and Hardly.\" Andy would have been in love with Hardly. Then we went for a good chicken chase. Andy likes pretending to be a T. Rex and run after the chickens, roaring. He scared the bejeebus out of some chickens today. Sorry  Myrtle May .  Joey preferred to chase the chickens while crowing like a rooster. Or just crowing. He sounded remarkably like a real rooster.  Maddy's son  would be so proud of him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SQKAX2i_m9I/AAAAAAAAB-k/42LL03Enkxc/s1600-h/02_boys_mom.jpg", "http://www.sneadsfarm.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SQKAXwKaqkI/AAAAAAAAB-s/D_EyEfDtHZA/s1600-h/02_joey_pumpkin.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SQKAYOqwozI/AAAAAAAAB-0/khhQ9Avgc0Q/s1600-h/02_andy_pumpkin.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SQKAYA3aOrI/AAAAAAAAB-8/HFSan3A01Tc/s1600-h/02_andy_chicken2.jpg", "http://educatedandpoor.blogspot.com/2008/10/myrtle-mae-monday-102008.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SQKAYf-UicI/AAAAAAAAB_E/JG-Th1FIRjM/s1600-h/02_joey_chicken3.jpg", "http://whittereronautism.com/2008/10/lunch-with-love/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/10/to-pumpkin-patch.html", "title": "\nTo the pumpkin patch!\n"},

I've been trying to engage my children in an activity that does not involve the television or the computer to no avail. No interest in making bead-chains, decorations, water-colors. Joey briefly got interested in drawing cupcakes and coloring them and cutting them out, but then he wanted to take them to a friend. Great.  So I give up, put them in shoes and coats to go for a walk in the lull of the rain. We are out to collect leaves and other now-wet items, and Joey had put his paper cupcakes in his bucket, so I offered to hold them. I take the cupcakes and store them in a safe pocket- to be left also holding the bucket. \"No, Joey,\" I hand him back his bucket. \"You have to carry this.\"  And then the \"I have to be first\" game starts. Joey runs screaming down the street because Andy is ahead of him. And then he gets ahead of Andy, and Andy starts to run to get ahead of Joey. And they are both screaming. And no one is looking at leaves, or acorns, or even where they are going. We live in the town, you have to watch for things like cars.  So I call them back, and try to explain that we are trying to have a nice walk and... Joey starts chewing on his bucket, wandering away down the street, paying not one nevermind to me at all... actually, he's just avoiding me. Right into the street.  So I recall him, and take the bucket so he will pay attention to what I am saying, and he starts emptying his lungs.  We gather ourselves together, and we start to continue the walk...  And it starts to pour. We need to go home. So I say, \"It's raining, we have to go home.\" And Joey commences screaming again, now a good tantrum- how frustrating to be told everything is fine, only to it suddenly not be fine for an entirely different reason.  I melted down on the spot.  I manage to get hold of hands and half-drag my children back to the house, with Joey screeching the whole block home. ************************************ Edited a couple of hours later: JOey is in front of the computer Andy is watching his beloved new favorite, Max and Ruby.

{"date": "Friday, October 24, 2008", "body": "\nA couple Falls ago, we- that is, my sons and I- started attending church. We gave a couple of churches around a try, and had a lot of trouble the minute the word \u201cautism\u201d was uttered- local churches, particularly Sunday School teachers- wanted no parts of it. Some of you may want to drawl on about how Sunday School teachers are volunteers, they have no special education training, they aren\u2019t prepared to deal with special needs, yadda, yadda, yadda. And I say to you: this is supposed to be a Christian community. Joey is part of that community. I\u2019m happy to help and talk with you and even be in the classroom to support him; but you have to welcome him in. We were turned away.  So we ended up in one of the big downtown churches, mostly because when I mentioned that Joey was autistic, the Sunday School supervisor said \u201cOK.\u201d And when I asked to meet with her and with his teachers, they all said, \u201cWonderful.\u201d And then we met, and talked, and it may not have been a perfect world of support and understanding, but everyone did their best and the teachers loved Joey just as they loved all the other kids in their class, and stressed that we\u2019re all God\u2019s children and He loves us all just as we are- including Joey. Some of the kids liked him, and were friendly; some of the kids didn\u2019t, and weren\u2019t, and it was funny how this was mirrored in their parents\u2019 reaction to meeting him or seeing him. We were glad to have a place where Joey could be an active participant in his community among his peers.  Then we moved on a year, and the next teacher wasn\u2019t interested in meeting, and it was a little less successful a year, and the supervisor that was so willing to listen left. That\u2019s the way Sunday Schools go. Some people stick it out forever, some folks come and go. Andy\u2019s Sunday School teachers had been at it for fifty years.  And then we signed up for Vacation Bible School. I would call that moderate success. We had some incidents, but overall, he had a good time, and all was OK, even though I had to be there with him instead of letting him be on his own a little. The new supervisor of Sunday School mentioned there were plans for a special needs class in the Sunday school, and would I like to get into the discussions about it? There was a problem where the upper-levels (second grade and up) do \u201cRotation Sunday School.\u201d This means that the kids have rotating themes throughout the year- and they move from room to room for different activities. We had a couple of the older set that couldn\u2019t handle all that change so quickly (Sunday School is only about an hour, remember). So I said I\u2019d be glad to help, and heard nothing more about it.  I\u2019ve been working on a lot of Sundays. The Fall is the busy season for one of my jobs, and as it also has a slow season, I like to try to build up some cash now to tide over the slower months (although it usually ends up making money to play catch-up from being through the slower months). We finally got a chance to go to Sunday School last week, as my work was cancelled for the day. So we went to introduce the guys to their new rooms: Andy to the preschool-4\u2019s (the teachers Joey had his first year), and Joey to the First Grade room.  So I arrive and take Andy to his room, and one of the ladies pulls me aside and asks me about Joey. How is he doing? Where am I taking him?  We got guided not to the First Grade room, but to a new class- the Disabilities class, which currently consists of those two older kids, and now Joey. They have two people who \u201calternate\u201d covering the class, and they are both special educators in their real lives. (How is \u201calternating\u201d the teacher going to help kids with trouble with transitions and change?)  In other words, for Sunday School, Joey just got put in the self-contained classroom. And I find myself in a bit of a Catch-22.  Apparently, the first grade teacher doesn\u2019t want Joey in her room, because she had one of the now-older kids, and didn\u2019t know what to do with him. In other words, she was not properly supported before, and has no desire to be left in the cold twice. That may be reasonable enough, but where does that leave Joey? Isolated and closeted in a self-contained environment- a class that I am being given the strong impression was created specifically for him and these two other kids, one of which isn\u2019t showing up regularly, either. He will get one-on-one (or nearly so, if the other kid shows up) attention for reading the little weekly reader things and the week\u2019s Bible lesson. But he\u2019ll be shut away from his friends, from his peers, and they are shut away from him.  I appreciate the effort and thought of trying to support people with special needs, but what about supporting them in the least restrictive environment? What is more important? Learning Bible stories, or being included in the community of his peers? You probably have figured out my answer to that. If you haven\u2019t, please note nowhere else in this post have I said anything about Bible stories.  That may seem strange to some folks, but we\u2019re Methodists. The Bible stories themselves aren\u2019t nearly as important as the lessons they teach- love, acceptance, honor, respect, living a life that spreads God\u2019s grace in love through positive action and attitude. What good is memorizing The Good Samaritan if you keep passing by on the other side of the road every time you see someone in need? Teach the kid to help the person in need. They can read the Bible story later.  So we are left with a Sunday dilemma. Do we go back? Do we leave Joey in the self-contained room, or do we fight to have him in a room where the teacher doesn\u2019t want to deal with him? Should we be looking for a new church home?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/10/lre-catch-22.html", "title": "\nLRE Catch-22\n"},

{"date": "Friday, November 07, 2008", "body": "\nI have a meeting with all three of Joey's main teachers on Wednesday at 11 o'clock.  Joey has been spitting in faces. He's been hitting other children, especially the classmate he sees the most. He's been screaming.  He's been frustrated, angry, depressed, and bored, and he's acting it out for everyone to see.  When Joey was very small- brand-new, in fact- he didn't cry much. At the time, we just thought we had a \"good baby\"- and in fact, we did. He was such a good baby that if he cried, we jumped, because you knew something was  seriously  wrong. This was a child who didn't cry when lunch was late, sat patiently through lectures and appointments, and even stayed quietly in a stroller through my entire PhD graduation ceremony. When this child gets fussy, we want to know what the  hell  is going on.  Mrs. A sent home some \"homework\" a couple of weeks ago- words to learn five at a time until the end of the school year. Each year the kids have a list of these words, called the  \"word wall\"  (because they get posted up on a wall as they learn them). It was the list for first grade, with a note saying, \"Joey, please learn these words!\" He knew them already. In fact, he's been reading these words for over a year now.  I emailed her, asking her what I was supposed to be doing with these words. Nine weeks into the semester, and Mrs. A had no idea that he already knew all these words- in fact, we're most of the way through the third grade word wall list. She suggested putting five of them in alphabetical order. Right. Apparently that was tedious (really? no kidding!) so now they are going to have him use the words in a sentence, maybe using the second grade words. OK, that's a little better, it includes some demonstration of comprehension, something Joey  does  need to work on.  But we didn't work this out before we implemented the lesson. In fact, Joey's needs were not only completely ignored, the teacher- nine weeks into the school year- appeared to be completely oblivious to what those needs are.  I remain not only unimpressed, but I'm starting to get plain pissed off.  She'd better be with the program by noon on Wednesday.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theschoolbell.com/Links/word_walls/words.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/double-double-toil-and-trouble.html", "title": "\nDouble, Double Toil and Trouble\n"},

The afternoon was a perfect temperature for hopping in leaves in front of the office building, so I let the boys do that for a while before the proposed gathering of pine cones from across the street. Grandma has been held up by a phone call, the boys get restless. Snatching Joey off the bus isn't really the best idea, he has no downtime to dispel after-school-mood, so I want to get him engaged.  \"Ok, guys, let's go get pine cones.\"  \"OK!\" Joey calls back and makes a beeline for the road at his trot-trot-trot. I run, but I am to going to be fast enough; I must rely on my voice to recall him from the blacktop as the car appears around the curve. Of course, it fails; audial processing takes too long. Fortunately, the driver is paying attention and there is a good stretch of road to react on. Joey processes a car is on the road with him and flees to the further side. I can see the driver wave at me. What if it had been someone less careful, someone on a cell phone, someone moving a little too fast?  *************** Allan and I sit in the kitchen, a new breath in our routine. The boys are watching their new favorite,  Max and Ruby . Recounting the day, having a drink together, a luxury. Allan's had a new claim. I'm making plans for the holidays. A boy walks in.  He has no shirt on.  Apparently this is incredibly funny, and Joey starts to giggle with his playful, \"Oh! I have no shirt!\" \"Yes, no shirt,\" we confirm. More giggles.  Andy appears, also shirtless, but this is less of a shocker. Andy is not as fond of clothes as Joey is. Whatever the joke it, the boys are in hysterics over it. We shoo them back into the livingroom. Adult conversation recommences.  A boy walks in, laughing.  Joey is now completely naked.  This is apparently even more funny than having no shirts, far too funny for articulate speech. Even funnier is Daddy's shocked question, \"Where are your  clothes ?\"  The other boy runs in, also naked as a jay-bird, and starts the \"neeeee-kiiiiiiiid BUTTS! Nekkid butts! Nekkid butts!\" chant.  Adult time over. Boy time recommences.

{"date": "Friday, November 07, 2008", "body": "\n\"Mom, turn the music down!\" Joey demands as I try to tuck him into bed. He has repeated this request several times every night for the last three, maybe four nights. The problem is, there is no music playing. He hasn't been very interested in his CD player, and the radio in the van is broken. Perhaps he wants me to turn down the music in Andy's room? I can just hear it, if the room is quiet; perhaps Joey is having some sound sensitivities, or problems filtering out sounds, and that faint sound is bothering him?  \"Honey, you aren't playing any music,\" I remind him in my I'm-being-patient voice; the one that would probably infuriate me if I was trying to tell you something and you answered something completely absurd in it.  \"Turn the music down, turn the music down!\" he repeats, covering his ears as if several bombs were exploding all around the house. Andy's CD has ended. The silence is deafening. There is no music.  \"Do you want me to turn the music  on ?\" I ask, trying the same change of tactic I have tried the last three or four nights, trying to coax the words of what he's really asking out of his mouth. I do this because I am insane: trying the same thing over and over, in an attempt to get a different result. For some reason, Joey has taken to saying the opposite of what he means. For example, if something is cold, he complains that it is too hot.  \"Turn my music down!\" he tries again, just as insane as I am. However, the slight change in the phrase catches my attention:  his  music, not Andy's music. I go over to the CD player. He bounces and gives me some signals; the kinds of slight changes in his attitude and body language he once used almost exclusively to communicate, and I know so well. I have done the right thing- i have moved over to the CD player. Perhaps he really does want it on; but when I move to press the button, he flinches and covers his ears.  \"Turn it down, turn my music down!\" he cries out warningly. Connections are made, synapses fire, my brain reads his twitches, his face, the slight turn of a child at once wanting something very badly and yet terrified to get it. I turn the volume way down before pressing play. Sure enough, even with the turning down, it is a touch on the loud side; i quickly turn it down more, so that it is more of a soft-lullaby sort of volume.  Waltzing Mathilda  wafts gently through the air.  Joey squeals, giggles, claps, bounces. He begins to sing- a little loudly- to the song. He laughs and hugs me, unsolicited.  \"Gold star, Mommy! You get a Gold Star!\" he laughs, his whole person a beam of sunshine, as I have not seen him in weeks. I leave him dancing and singing in his room. He can do it all night for all I care, as long as that smile stays beaming upon his face.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/turn-music-down.html", "title": "\nTurn the Music Down\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 09, 2008", "body": "\nYes, the meeting is on Wednesday. Joey's report card was no great surprise, he has trouble communicating and speaking, he has been having behavior issues. Otherwise he is moving right along.  People associate special education with being stupid. It is an inescapable fact. I have seen and heard my child, individually and as part of the group, referred to as a \"vegetable\", \"idiot\", \"retard\", \"parasite\", \"waste of resources\", \"budget drain\", and even \"trash.\" Why? because people see these kids as a waste of time, resources, and even compassion. They think these are kids who will never make in society, who will always be dependent, who have no future. This is the way our society views people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities. Many even se their own family members who may have challenges in this light. The concept of spending a little money now to save a lot of money down the road is a foreign concept, all the more so in our current now-now-now immediate-gratification culture.  It's one thing to see this in the general public, who are, frankly, generally ignorant of special education and special needs. Even families with special needs individuals within them can be generally ignorant (sometimes mind-bogglingly so). To realize that people in the special education system itself are this ignorant is enough to make a parent bang their head against a wall. Seriously.  Here's the long and the short of it: Joey is in first grade. However, he reads on a fourth grade level, and does second grade math. His classmates are still on first grade levels. His teacher is not offering him differentiated work. Naturally, the child is bored to tears.  When one is bored to tears, and one is six years old, one tends to act up and act out. then add the autism, and the frustrations that go with it, to this stew, and we are starting to have a serious problem.  What do you do with a child who  is both gifted and special needs ? What do we do with the kids who are \" twice special \"?  Our school system is going to have to tackle this problem, and soon. They have a small horde of autistic kids coming up from the preschool who are much like Joey- \"high functioning\" and even gifted, but not able to go into a regular classroom independently.  The most obvious answer to this would be to have a para in the inclusion room who specialized in the child or children there. The special ed teacher in our system is a floater, so that wouldn't be enough. However, the school doesn't like the idea, because hey, it costs money.  So what exactly do I expect from this meeting? I have one teacher who knows Joey very well, and does her best to support him. I have one teacher who is still learning what Joey can and cannot do, but seems to be trying very hard to meet his needs and challenge him. Then I have a the teacher who hadn't noticed, nine weeks into the school year, that Joey was well beyond first-grade level vocabulary and spelling. What do I really hope they will do? How do we find and create an appropriate placement for my son?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.uniquelygifted.org/", "http://www.2enewsletter.com/welcome%20page.htm"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/long-and-short-of-it.html", "title": "\nThe Long and the Short of It\n"},

After five years of riding the bus, they suddenly want Joey to stand on the street to wait for it, instead of coming out from the house when the bus arrives. There is a 20 minute window for the bus to arrive (10 minutes on either side of the actually time it is supposed to arrive). As many of you may know, a 20-minute wait next to a busy street should be a really interesting challenge for us. I'll keep you posted.  2. Joey's teacher and I are thinking of recommending Joey begin a math group in the inclusion room. This will work for two angles: differentiation for Joey will be easier, because he'll be in a room where other kids may be working on more advanced levels than their classmates (his group will be targeted to his skill level), and he will be away from another student whose behavior has a major influence on Joey, and unfortunately a negative impact. It will also take him away from Mrs. A for another 30 minutes a day. However, this will mean another major schedule change for Joey, and possibly without the support of his usual aide.

However, today he started to crash- didn't eat his lunch, kept putting his head down, and finally got a trip to the nurse, but no fever. Then at OT, he complained his ear hurt (and kept putting it against warm things). Ear infection? Imitating someone at the nurse's office? Just a little fluid in the ear from the sniffies? There is only one way for me to find out.  Off to Medic 1. For those of you unfamiliar, Medic 1 is a walk-in \"emergency clinic\". If I try to call my regular doctor at 5 o'clock on a Thursday night to say my kid might have an ear infection, I might be able to get in next week (my regular doc is off on Fridays). With the Medic 1, I can walk in and see a doctor within two hours. I miss my old country doc who would see you within about twenty minutes as a walk-in (and was NEVER late for an appointment), but this will do in this day and age.  We go to Medic 1 enough that we know most of the evening-shift docs and PAs, so it isn't a huge issue of new-ness for Joey. We sat in the lobby for about an hour, talking about nurses and doctors and what each would do for him. We played duck-duck-goose, and each time I was the goose, I'd grab him and smooch him, which he thought so funny he had the other sick folks in the waiting room giggling.  When the nurse called us back, he got right up on the scale, took his temp orally (!) and did the finger-clip thing. Five minutes later, the nice lady doctor comes in, and Joey looks up and says, \"Oh, hi, it's you!\" and hops up on the table. She talks to me for a minute about what the problem is and what his symptoms are, that sort of thing, and she asks him a few questions (to which she got various not-very-relevant answers, but he did try) before pulling out the stethoscope. Upon viewing the stethoscope, Joey starts \"taking deep breaths\" (I have no idea how she heard anything through the noise). Peek in the ears, peek in the throat, peek in the nose, all cool.  Pronouncement: allergy or virus. Have a nice night.  That's right, no push of antibiotics. No lecture for wasting time of the doctor. No fuss, no muss, check him out, tell em straight up, and send us on our way with a recommendation to use adult Robitussin instead of crappy kid stuff.  Now that's the way I like it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/how-doctor-visit-ought-to-be.html", "title": "\nHow a doctor visit ought to be\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 12, 2008", "body": "\nSo I arrive a few minutes early, to be intercepted by Joey's case manager, the beautiful and very talented Mrs. Huff. We chat about the bus situation and the fourth grade word wall that Joey is working on, the social skills lessons he is having, the sensory shift he seems to be experiencing, and of course, the math issue. At least  somebody  is looking out for Joey. She notes that now the child who needs one-on-one ABA is all set up with his own therapist (Mrs. Huff supervises the program, but they have someone new to actually implement it), she has more time to check on her other students and actually see how they are doing.  We get into the meeting. We talk a lot about Joey. How he uses language and communicates. How he expresses anxiety. The boredom issue. The classmate issue. What folks are working on. Some things were said and asked that were good. Some things that were said I still find a little concerning. We didn't talk about pulling him for math, which I thought somewhat odd, since I thought part of the point of the meeting was to broach the subject of pulling him for math. I make sure to note that boredom is the Enemy. Joey  must  be engaged to be functional. If you let him drift off, let him descend into the frustration of boredom, we have Trouble.  We leave the meeting, we are walking down the hall, and Mrs. Huff, the beautiful and talented, turns to me and says, \"I want you to come see this classroom, I think this will be a good fit for Joey for math. I've been talking to the teacher already...\"  You go, Mrs. Huff. You absolutely, positively  rock .  I saw the room. I met the teacher. She has a couple of aides in there, but not a special ed one, so Joey's shared aide- and sometimes Mrs. Huff herself- will go in there to support him. So as soon as the paperwork goes through, he will be pulled from Mrs. A for math. This will also alter his recess, so he'll go to recess with his new classfriends, so he'll have that much time away from both her and the classmate. Once we get him settled into the new routine, I hope he starts feeling better (and I hope this isn't just stressing him out some more).

{"date": "Friday, November 14, 2008", "body": "\nPeople often mistakenly assume children cannot distinguish between reality and pretend. This is  untrue . It is more accurate to say that the line that seems so crisp and clean in our adult eyes, that sharp division between what is real and what is not,  is more blurred  in the world of child, where things are not so in focus yet because they don't have the information and experience we have as adults. Thus a child can know that dragons do not exist, but be afraid one is living under the bed.  I remember this blur in my childhood. I was certainly aware that Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was a character in a made-up story, and not a real entity. Yet I was excited as a child to see the red glow in my window in the early hours of Christmas morning, thinking that Santa was here because I could see Rudolph's nose. (As an adult, I can surmise that red glow was probably the brake lights of my grandparents' car as they arrived for Christmas morning.) I was aware that Mr. King was a real person, yet when he appeared on my birthday wearing that famous red suit, he was and remains to me, Santa Claus Himself. The line that divided realty and fantasy was blurred, and my brain made connections between them that we as adults no longer make (well, except the adults who believe in ghosts. But we can discuss that in some other post.) To my great delight and interest, Andy has an imaginary friend.  I have never known if Joey truly has an imaginary friend; the communication and language barriers, his use of echolalia to communicate and talk about the world around him, make it difficult to determine if he ever has had his own pretend friends who inhabit that blur between reality and make-believe. I can tell you that Joey  does  make-believe, and even has some running narrative to that make-believe, but I have such small snippets and snatched glimpses of that world, it is hard to say whether he has his own characters there, or he has simply lifted characters from known stories and shows. Certainly, he remains attached to Octopus, through not in the take-him-everywhere sort of way he used to be; his Little Bear remains a comfort to him, he still clings to Yellow Bus on occasion and becomes happy when Yellow Bus emerges from the toy pile. How much actual character do these entities have in his world? I suspect more than my brief glimpses would attest.  Andy's friend has emerged as an interesting character who appears throughout our daily routines and paths. I have been listening for clues and asking questions, and I am keen to learn more about this new member of our family circle. Here is what I have learned so far:  Our friend's name is T-Rex, or Dinosaur. I had started suspecting there were actually two friends (Andy usually differentiates between T-Rex and other \"dinosaurs\" [Its not a dinosaur! It's a T-Rex!]), but now I am convinced these two names are attached to the same friend. It is Andy's mood that determines which name is being used. Dinosaur lives \"out there\" and often pops up \"over there\", that being somewhere outside the car, usually in clumps of trees or dense woods beside busy highways. However, Dinosaur can also appear near buildings, near stores, and even in parking lots or fields. When Dinosaur appears, he can be doing any number of activities, including hiding, having lunch, eating cows, playing, tickling, looking at us, playing with other dinosaurs, and playing with his friends the Lizards (remember our running  bedtime story ?). However, Dinosaur is never right here; he is always over there, doing something.  Dinosaur has an imaginary friend named Spooky. Spooky is a ghost, and also features in our bedtime stories. spooky likes to play hide-and-boo (you hide, and when the seeker gets close, you jump out and say 'boo!' and they are required to yell out 'AAAA!') Dinosaur does not like to step on sidewalk cracks.  Dinosaur likes Grandma's house. He also likes cookies, lollipops, cake, bacon, and cows. Dinosaur likes to run very fast and win races. He also likes to blow bubbles and play hide=and-seek. He also apparently keeps his eye out for Andy at school.  I'll keep you posted as I find out more about our new friend.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mixingmemory.blogspot.com/2004/12/fantasy-reality-distinction-in.html", "http://www.psy.utexas.edu/psy/FACULTY/Woolley/pdf/fantasypaper.pdf"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/in-their-world.html", "title": "\nIn their world\n"},

They see them as outsiders, keep them at arm's length, forget to let them in and enjoy them. More and more and more people I meet are like that- there is an isolation of humanity in today's culture. We have become so focused on nuclear \"family\" that the rest of it drops into a grey abyss, our children not given the skills and understanding to expand their families and relish them. After all, all families are strange. They are full of people. People are here to be loved. Too many folks now expect people to meet certain ideas and expectations before they will even acknowledge the other person's existence, much less refer to the person as a \"friend.\" Instead of taking people as they are, and start from there, and see what happens, they automatically exclude everyone until proven otherwise. Safer? Maybe. But you miss out on a lot of family.  Joey loves the world and the world loves Joey. People like to be accepted, no strings attached. Joey has a knack for that. \"Hi, Friend!\" he cheerfully calls to all and sundry. You're invited- you\u2019re a friend until proven otherwise. Andy doesn't have this talent. He's far more of a question first, be friends if the answers are OK kind of guy.  Anyway, Thanksgiving is one of those family holiday things. People's families get together and celebrate being on the earth and get to have some time to just hang out and enjoy each other. We can appreciate Aunt Susie's love of carrot cake, the lopsided way Cousin Johnnie smiles, take joy in Grandpa's old war stories and Grandma's taste in clothes. We can pick up on the little clues that speak to who we are.  When we grow up, and go out to make our own little nuclear units, holidays are great times to remember the rest of our families. Those brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and cousins who may not share our bloodlines, but remain our families. Those connections to humanity that remind us that we're all in this together, we might as well enjoy each other for this brief shining moment.  Evan is coming. Christmas is upon us.  I love Christmas. ************************************************ With holiday love to Beth, Jean, Maddy, and Joe, and the rest of my online family.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/repost-turkey-is-comin.html", "title": "\nRepost: The Turkey is a-Comin'\n"},

The guys feel that speed, the excitement, the anticipation; ad I do my best to share with them the magic, the joy, the love that goes into Christmas here. I also do my best to not go insane. It's an interesting tangle.  \n \nMeanwhile, life continues.  \n \nJoey wasn't feeling so good this morning. He didn't eat much for me yesterday, and he didn't eat today (I emailed his teacher about it, so she kept me apprised). He wanted a sandwich for dinner, but he didn't eat it, he just carried it around on its plate. I think what he really wanted was the routine of having food. I was supposed to take them to Chuck E. Cheese, but with Joey feeling off, I thought it might be a dangerous plan. Stomach bugs can be nasty and sudden.  \n \nAndy had a lovely tantrum at the end of the day, because I tried to talk to him about his habit of co-opting Joey's toys. In particular, there is a small blue plastic bin that belongs to Joey, and Andy decided  he  wanted it. The chorus of  \"Mine! Mine!\"  commenced, upsetting Joey (who wanted his bin). Yes, tantrum city. Biting, kicking, screaming, total tantrum- we even reached a level one meltdown at one point, where all we could do was hug him and not let him kick things. Yikers.  \n \nOn the other hand, he was a perfect angel at lunch, despite noise, crowds, and not our usual table. He ate his lunch and gabbled about his food and his coloring and his dinosaurs, the other people in the restaurant, school... a charming little four-year-old boy.  \n \nIf I can get everybody even-keel, I plan to upset the schedule by pulling everybody during the week to go up to Baltimore and visit  Valley View  and the trains at  Kenilworth . After their trip to Chuck E. Cheese. Oh, and in the middle of putting up garlands and trees. And...  \n \nAs we ease into the \"holiday mode\" we'll have fewer hiccups, it will become something of a baseline norm.

{"date": "Friday, November 21, 2008", "body": "\nJoey is at Grandma's for a sleepover. We miss him. There is something sad about an empty bed when one of them goes to Grandma's. Joey's room is so quiet and dark, with him there to turn on the nightlight and play the CD. He's having fun, though.  We've been prepping Joey since yesterday for the visit. He should have had his turn a couple weeks ago, but he's been struggling so that we couldn't in good conscious either disturb his routine nor foist a depressed, acting-out child on Grandma. Joey needed some bedrock, as school wasn't going well for him. When we asked him if he wanted to go, he clearly said \"No.\"  Then came Ms. Sc. The world has changed.  He has been in such a good mood, and suddenly doing so well, Grandma decided it would be a good idea to have him come for his turn at Grandma's. We decided the main attraction would be going grocery shopping for Thanksgiving. So we started talking about Thanksgiving dinner, and he had clearly been talking about it at school, because he knew he was supposed to have turkey. Yesterday we started being more specific: what did he want for Thanksgiving? Besides turkey? And then this morning was talked about it, and I started making a list of things we would need in the grocery store to have those things, complete with photos.  Before I tell you what he wants, I should note there is method to my madness. With the new  change in bus policy  (which has my bus driver as confused and unhappy as I am), I discovered we did best if he had something in his hands to distract him. The best thing we had was his new schedule, with the pictures and the written out routine. He clutched it the whole time we waited, and all the way to school, and we didn't have a single \"No bus! No school! I missed the bus!\" wail. So I thought a nice visual grocery list would help him if he started feeling anxious in the grocery store. I take Joey to the grocery, but not very often, because he does sometimes get very nervous, and likes to run around the cart in tight circles. With him in such a good mood, he should do fine, but just in case...  So what does he want for Thanksgiving dinner? Unprompted, he came up with turkey, pumpkin pie, and cheese. Then he agreed to sauerkraut, dressing, peas, corn, mashed potatoes, and biscuits. He said \"no, thanks\" to asparagus, sweet potatoes, and gherkins. He was unsure about cranberry sauce or cranberry bread (though he liked the cranberry bread last year).  Joey came home in after-school mood, so at first we were unsure he still wanted to go to Grandma's. Then he suddenly clicked and got very happy.  And Andy freaked out. He wanted to go to Grandma's too. He likes Grandma's house.  So while Grandma explained to Andy he would be going to Grandma's on Monday, I got Joey out to the truck, where he was all smiles and grins. He told me he was going to give Grandma ten hugs and ten kisses. He was ready to go.  What a week that child is having. A new math teacher, new friends, baking cookies, and now a trip to Grandma's. How much more exciting can life get?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/to-grandmas-house.html", "title": "\nTo Grandma's House\n"},

With Andy, he makes things pretty plain. What he doesn't directly ask for, you can see him getting excited about things. If everything under the tree was a dinosaur, Zoboomafoo, or a construction set (legos, tools, etc), he'd be ecstatic.  But what about Joey? There isn't a lot of merchandise with Max and Ruby, and the books are a bit disappointing. He has a bike. He has his computer, and is very happy with the games there. He has plenty of the kind of blocks he likes. The fact is, as soon as we detect interest in something, we already do our best to support it. He has books and toys of fish, of firetrucks, of cars. What could he want?  So plan B: ask. Joey, what do you want Santa to bring you?

{"date": "Saturday, November 22, 2008", "body": "\nThe boy is back.  Joey is a sweetie, there is no getting around it. I missed his smile, and the tilt of his head, and the sparkle in his eye. Now he's back, and I just want to crawl into bed with him and squish him. But I won't, because if I wait a couple hours, he'll crawl into bed with us, and we can squish him. And we'll be warmer that way.  Joey has had a lot of anxiety lately. Although I can make some educated guesses as to some of the issues he's wrestling with, I do wish he could give me more clues. Last night, Andy was having his usual fuss about bedtime and bathtime and wanting to splash (with a very large pitcher), and I overheard this exchange:  \"AAAAAAAAA!\" \"Why are you screaming?\" \"Because you are annoying me! I  want  it!\" \"You get water all over the floor when you have this. Play with some of the other toys instead. Look, there's a bowl.\" \" AAAAAAAAAA! \" \"You have a bowl to put water in. What's wrong?\" \"I'm sad!\" Joey can't do that.  Often when we are headed into IEP meetings, I try to explain that there are things Andy can do that Joey still cannot do. Then they ask me what, and I find myself at a loss; because Joey is Joey, and although I know there is the skill gap, trying to come up with exactly what those skills are is daunting- I expect Joey to be Joey, and Andy to be Andy, and what does that mean exactly? I know there are deficits, but when I have my boys, I just don't think of them as deficient; pinpointing the disability is something I have to think hard to do. I get asked, \"What do you want for Joey?\" and my current answers seem meaningless in the context of an IEP. What does \"I want him to be happy\" really  mean ? We're not to Christmas, but with the troubles we've been having this year- minor compared to previous years, because our caseworker totally rocks- I'm already getting ready for our second grade IEP. When I go in there to explain what Joey can and cannot do, I am going to print out this blog entry.  When Andy is feeling anxiety, he can tell us. Joey can't. The result is that Andy's acting out gets words, gets understanding, and gets fixed. You hand him his pitcher, or you explain to him that he won't be getting the pitcher, he should play with something else. When Joey is anxious, we become Sherlock Holmes, trying to uncover the clues, the trails, the sources of anxiety. Then we have to analyze those clues to try to discover the whodunnit problem that resulted in anxiety, and think of how it ought to be fixed.  I want Joey to be able to have more input into those solutions.  Now it is morning (I started the post last night), and the boys are off to their swimming lesson; the contrast between what Joey can and cannot do seems all the more strange to me. In the three short months Joey has been taking swimming lessons, he has learned to swim independently right across the pool. Ms. Heidi says he has a good, strong stroke. Maybe he'll be on a swim team when he gets older. Wouldn't that be awesome? We just need to get him to breathe properly (put his face in the water while he swims) and he'll be on his way. Not bad for six years old.  It seems strange to me that people would want this child closeted away. They can't see the wonderful things he can do, the wonderful, beautiful person he is, simply because he has trouble speaking. As he gets older, what roads will be blocked for him, not because he can't do the tasks, but because he can't put what he can do into words from his mouth? I wonder about kids who are completely non-verbal, the challenge of living in a world where speaking is considered a vital marker of intelligence. In fact, I think now the ability to see people and accept people for who they are is a far more important form of intelligence. To be able to look past what people cannot do, and appreciate what they  can  do. And perhaps that is a post for another day.  I miss Joey when he isn't here. I am so glad he has fun with Grandma. I am also glad to have him back.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/11/joey-returns.html", "title": "\nJoey Returns\n"},

According to family lore, my great-grandfather died of pneumonia from influenza, as did Buster. We originally thought Bob brought it home from school, but we now know they were gone before Bob was sent to school. We don't even think he made it to take on the church we was assigned in Buffalo. My great-grandmother was a single-parent working mother before such a thing was commonplace, trying to raise three children alone in Baltimore.  Joey has had three episodes of turning blue. Once he got severely chilled in school, and went cold. Then he had  croup - with an onset like lightning. And now he's had  pneumonia .

{"date": "Wednesday, December 03, 2008", "body": "\nThis morning Joey woke up- the boys slept in just a few minutes- smiling and saying, \"School!\" Ellora was chirruping for breakfast. Andy was giggling about being a nekkid butt. All was well with the world.  A little later, bundled up and waiting for the bus, without warning, Joey turned to me and said, \"No school. Because I am coughing.\" My mommy sense twitched, but he wasn't feverish, he was smiling, and he was still looking out the window for the bus. So onto the bus he went with a note to his substitute teacher about my cell number, just in case. After all, he had stayed home sick yesterday.  One should not ignore a mommy sense twitch.  I got Andy off to school, finished up some stuff at the office, and picked him up. We went to lunch. We had ordered it when the call came.  Joey \"wasn't breathing quite right.\" We paid, before the food came, and out the door we went. Poor Andy!  When I got there, it was more than \"not breathing right.\" He had turned blue, and the nurse had measured his O2 saturation at 57! (the ER nurse was a bit skeptical about him being conscious with it that low, but the nurse actually wrote the numbers down for me- 57, 74, 94 in a 20-minute period.) They had him take many deep breaths and got it back to 94. Presented with the options available, she recommended the ER. Off to the ER we went. As I locked him in the car, he started another episode- his fingers were blue- but we got him to breathe like the nurse said and dashed to the ER (which is practically across the street). He was pinking up when we got there, no fever, saturation of 88-91, and coughing. We were put in a triage niche and waited.  Adventure one: bloodwork. We had to take him to the lab and I hugged him in the lab chair while three very patient phlebotomists got they blood they needed from him. He screamed the entire time, but held his arm still. I can't say I blame him. The lab folks always say things like \"this will pinch\" but I feel the $*#^$(^ needle in my arm the whole time (IV lines and shunts drive me to distraction!). I would say Joey does, too.  Adventure two: x-rays. After waiting outside the x-ray lab with a  very  patient Andy and Grandma at our side, we got our picture taken. He actually did a lot better than I expected, considering he clearly had no clue what the tech was asking him to do. Unlike  last time , this tech was willing to set up the guards and help Joey out by holding up his hands, and keeping him in position, and giving him extra demonstration of how to hold his breath. Consequently we got each pic on the first try, and much faster.  Adventure three: nebulizer. Next we had a breathing treatment. At first Joey was OK with it, but as the few minutes wore on, he got anxious about getting the mask and mist in his eyes (which were bothering him because his temperature was starting to creep up), and it got uncomfortable for him. We had a hard time getting him to calm down and breathe instead of crying, fussing, and barking. However, it seemed to work, he was breathing better.  Adventure four: waiting. We were shown back to the waiting room to await test results. Joey's fever shot through the roof, and he fell asleep on a couple of chairs. By now, poor Andy was ravenous, so we sought out the gift shop for food (the cafeteria wasn't open yet, and we had no change for the vending machines). The child survived the afternoon on potato chips, Cheetos, and gummy worms, with apple juice. Joey took a few swallows of orange juice and a gummy shark before we were finally called back to a larger room in the ER (not just a triage chair).  Adventure five: the good news and the bad news. Dad arrived with his iPod, to the joy, relief, and distraction of the boy. He got to watch movies of himself while waiting for the doctor. The PA came to tell us it was a touch of pneumonia in his right lung, and his bloodwork indicated massive infection. The bad news: Joey was getting an antibiotic shot. The good news: by getting a shot, he could go home, because modern medicine  rocks . The nurse who came in to give him the shot was the gruffest person we encountered the entire time. I suspect her demeanor had something to do with the three \"code yellows\" that came in while we were waiting (since something about \"trauma\" was mentioned, and there were three Stafford ambulances outside, I suspect there was a car accident with multiple injuries), rather than her personality or professionalism. I think we really struck a chord when Joey started really losing it (he was very upset about having to have a shot in the first place, so the actual moment we had worked ourselves into a bit of a fit)  after  the shot was over, because he was \"broken\". She got confused and asked, \"what's broken?\" and I explained that he's autistic and that is his way of saying he wasn't feeling well. She got the oddest look on her face, kind of like when realization smacks you hard. She fetched him a popsicle.  Adventure six: vital signs. After an antibiotic shot, you sit and make sure there will be no allergic reaction, the nurse comes to take your vital signs, then they do the release stuff. Makes sense. However, Joey was very, very,  very  done, and to have that blood pressure cuff squeeze his arm again, which is  very  uncomfortable for him, just put him over the edge. We fortunately had an excellent nurse who took good care of Joey and just kept talking and helping Joey understand he had to stay still and quiet. We finally got the stats they wanted, and I could finally take him home and get some advil in him to get the fever down.  He's tucked into bed now. His fever is down, he's feeling better, he got to watch TV in Mom's bed for a while and has five, count them,  five  glow sticks to play with. He ate crackers and ice cream for me, and drank some pomegranate soda (it's by 7-Up, and yes, you should try some, it's magnificent- and only around for the holidays, which kind of sucks). I got his meds filled and so we are on the road to recovery. Andy is staying with Grandma, so both boys should be getting some R&R.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/12/pneumonia.html", "title": "\nPneumonia\n"},

So naturally, they started beating on each other. Loudly. Andy started throwing toys. Grandma finally has to take a toy away, and he started screaming.  Joey started imitating him. You can imagine from there.  Cold. Tired. Wet. Miserable. The perfect storm for a Witching Hour. It was so bad, nobody got enough gold stars to get a prize (they are currently in love with glow sticks).  As the storm passed and we arrived home, my ears heaved a sigh of relief. They were so exhausted, we couldn't even bake cookies. Early story time with a few extra stories, then bed.  The good news is Joey did his homework perfectly this morning. And he's having his sleepover at Grandma's tonight, so we've been having fun talking about it.

I actually made plenty of pics to enclose this year, printed plenty of our holiday letter, even bought pens just for the purpose. Weeks ago, I noticed a bag full of boxes of Christmas cards somewhere in the guest room or attic as I was poking around. I also had a few boxes ready to go on the diningroom table.  Oh good , I thought.  I have a ton cards, I don't need to buy anymore.   This is a big deal. We all have our foibles. One of mine is buying loads and loads of Christmas cards, particularly just after Christmas, and storing them up for the grand Sending of the Cards. Then I would see pretty cards I liked right ater Thanksgiving, so I would buy more. And then the after-Christmas sales would come...  This began partly because I had an obsession with greeting cards when I was younger, and partly because I used to send out almost 250 cards. This year I am down to 127. I need lots of cards. However, I don't need truckloads of them each and every year. The idea that \"I don't need to buy cards\" would even cross my brain is just huge.  So I sat down to write my cards yesterday.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 16, 2008", "body": "\nWe missed the bus this morning.  If there is one thing I cannot stand, it is to not be able to find a pair of scissors. I am so bad at losing scissors, I buy them regularly. I was at an estate sales once and bought ten pairs. When I grandfather died, one of the things I claimed was a pair of scissors. I just bought two new pairs last week.  I have no idea where any of them are.  I have unfortunately passed this talent for losing important things to my son. This morning we needed to find Joey's shoes, like every morning. This had become such a problem over the summer that we designated a spot next to our front stairs for shoes. I have a bench in the front hall, the kind with three cubbies with baskets for holding... well, toys for us. Shoes go next to it. Of course, its been moved a little so I can fit the tree table and stand (the hall opens nicely into the living room). So I head over the the bench to grab Joey's shoes... and no shoes.  Under the couch? No shoes.  Under the kitchen table? The trampoline? The dining room table? No shoes.  Bathroom, bedroom, upstairs hall? No shoes.  Joey only really has one pair of shoes. I buy him good ones form Stride Rite. The good thing is he knows his shoes, and we don't have to worry about wanting one pair or another. The bad thing is if we lose them, they  have  to be found.  Joey's visual scanning and other skills he needs to find objects in a jumble are not good. I-Spy books frustrate him. He quickly figured out that his shoes were missing... and that I was quickly growing frantic trying to find them. This just made it worse, of course, and we were soon in full-meltdown (level 2). Asking Joey to please find his shoes only escalates the problem; if I can't find them, why should he?  So we tried some questions. Where did you take your shoes off? Where did you put them? When we came in from bike-riding, where did you go? I got nothing but more screaming and random pointing.  And then the bus horn beeped.  With no shoes, I had to send the bus on, which sent us to level 3.  It was another ten minutes before I found the shoes. Where were they?  Jammed behind the bench. Remember I said I moved the bench? He had put his shoes where they would be if I hadn't. Only the bench was now in the way...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/12/lost-shoes.html", "title": "\nLost Shoes\n"},
{"date": "Monday, December 15, 2008", "body": "\nI wrapped the gifts for Joey's and Andy's educational teams. We had seventeen to wrap for Joey, and four for Andy. How do we do it?  We buy in bulk. When we see a good deal on something, we buy them. Lots of them. I had gotten used to the concept when I was young, and Perrygo Christmas drew near. My dad has a sister and two brothers, and each have multiple children. To get through, we hit all sorts of sales and outlets to get the best deal for our dollars. My mom is a pro at seeking the best deals.  This year's deals were through Williamsburg. We got real Lenox dishes to fit our budget. We ordered 25 of them. I think the folks at the shop were a little freaked out. We also stocked up on some other items on sale for future presents- after all, the boys are going to be in school for a while. The storage problem is solved by keeping everything at my mom's office. I thought about keeping a blog of where the deals are, but then you'd all buy everything out and I'd not get these awesome gifts for my people. ;)  A few years back, Ross Simons was the most awesome site to get gifts in bulk. When Overstock first opened, it was also uber-awesome. Both of these sites are now too big for their britches, kind of like \"outlet malls\" which are now just retail strip malls, not \"outlets.\" When I was very little, we would drive to Reading , Pennsylvania to go to the real factory outlets, like Carter's- but I wonder if they are still there, or have the factories all gone to China?  One of the tricks is to find websites of companies you like, and look for the online outlet. Decide how much to spend per person. Then stick to that. If they don't have stuff in budget, look for another good site. Most catalogue companies have websites now. Saves you gas an frustration of shopping, too.  Now I need to turn my attention to wrapping for the family.

{"date": "Friday, December 26, 2008", "body": "\n We had a lovely, quiet Christmas. The boys were very happy to see those presents! Andy was ready to jump right in ad tear that paper off to get to all his treats. Don't worry, Santa brought him his dragon.   Joey was a little more stand-offish, but he was very happy to unwrap that first present and find a large blue car- just what he wanted! Joey wears out faster, and after three packages, he retreated to the quieter kitchen to play some video games before coming out to open more gifts.    Andy was also excited to get this wonderful pirate ship! He has been playing with it, and when he got stickers in his stocking, he turned it into a dinosaur ship!  Yarr! 'Tis a pirate ship, matey!  The ship has sailed all over the first floor in search of adventure. It has been attacked by dragons, laid seize to a castle, and even sailed past the fearful Turkey of Death! It is always fascinating to watch Andy play and make up his own stories to go with his toys.   Joey got his car, but he also got some other nice toys, like a rocket and the aforementioned castle, and lots of legos.  I think he liked the rocket because Max likes rockets. The boys got personal DVD players from Grandma, and he's been watching himself some Max and Ruby! It was very calming for him, which is always a good thing. Joey did very well remember to take breaks and take his time. The self-regulation is coming right along! Mom and JoeyAndyDad and Grandma and Uncle Evan got some cool presents, too. Joey gave me a necklace, a ring, a potholder, and a candle holder; Andy got me a lovely winter decoration. Grandma got a salt and pepper shaker set from Joey, and tea towels from Andy. Andy got Dad a mug and a tie that plays Jingle Bells. I also got a cool iPod Nano, and JoeyAndyDad got some Apple gadget thing he wanted. It's not an iPhone, but its everything but the phone.  After the main presents,we had some lunch, then took our time to open up the stockings. They had small goodie bags in their rooms when they woke up, but stockings here are full of small toys, candy, and a clementine in the toe.  The boys got harmonicas from Santa in their stockings. I have been informed that I am not permitted to complain about the cacophony.  Andy likes to perform for the singing, dancing turkeys. Perhaps he will be a musician!  He also liked sneaking up on and pouncing on the turkeys, and preying upon them as a T-Rex. Diving at them and knocking them over so their little feet flapped helplessly in the air was also a popular passtime.  Another popular toy was the shark fan Andy got from Joey's teacher, which also attacked the castle, ship, and Turkey of Death.  We also played a few rounds of the fishing games, and ate lots of chocolate. Oh, and cookies. And roast beef. And more chocolate. I need to bake more cookies next year.    One thing that Joey told us he wanted was snow. Until a couple days before Christmas, \"snow\" was the only consistent thing he asked for. Santa couldn't control the weather, so he brought Joey some snow in a tub- the kind you add water to.  Andy's stocking also included a volcano and plenty of chocolate, a fishing game, and plenty of dinosaurs.  The boys also got these tin lasers- no batteries required. Andy had a shoot-out with his Daddy. Old-fashioned toys are so cool- all the play value, none of the batteries (so they work better for longer!) Get him, Andy! Get that Dad! Watching the guys play is one of the star attractions of Christmas Day. :)  Even Dad got something cool- this solid chocolate Santa! Yum yum yum! Who doesn't want a huge chocolate Santa for Christmas, after all? (yes, I did say \"solid\"!) Other hits of the day? The Ladybug game, the faux dissect-a-frog, the remote-control tarantula, and Hyperdash! I hope to get some batteries into Joey's lightning machine machine soon, and let you know what that's like.  Of course, Joey's favorites included the singing stockings- the reindeer and the puppy. As afraid as he is of regular dogs, stuffed toys are an attraction. He took the puppy to bed, singing Jingle Bells!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2uQZ65VI/AAAAAAAACVU/APP_7CYijr4/s1600-h/11_andy_ready.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2uF0GdnI/AAAAAAAACVM/5m530ZGo5H4/s1600-h/11_joey_ready.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2tzXbBxI/AAAAAAAACVE/un2smRAGSXM/s1600-h/11_andy_ship.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2tkoSBxI/AAAAAAAACU8/qG48Blsssfc/s1600-h/11_andy_ship2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2gSnj5BI/AAAAAAAACU0/xiEygx60X6w/s1600-h/11_joey_rocket.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2gWrTDEI/AAAAAAAACUs/2mDC229r0Gk/s1600-h/11_joey_rocket2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2gJ3083I/AAAAAAAACUk/ccQ0hH5BQcc/s1600-h/11_joey_harmonica.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2gF1S4hI/AAAAAAAACUc/jLusNB7icqQ/s1600-h/11_andy_harmonica.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT2fh-95YI/AAAAAAAACUU/wt3FlAly3ho/s1600-h/11_andy_turkey.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT16BYwN3I/AAAAAAAACUM/Kw0EkydrNCQ/s1600-h/11_joey_snow.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT154JBf-I/AAAAAAAACUE/47_jlx4w31c/s1600-h/11_andy_volcano.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT15vPOnOI/AAAAAAAACT8/Df-AS2COD28/s1600-h/11_andy_laser.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT15kVe52I/AAAAAAAACT0/nA0gIz2mzFk/s1600-h/11_allan_santa.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SVT15Q40uTI/AAAAAAAACTs/KBRy5Vag3XI/s1600-h/11_joey_reindeer.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/12/merry-christmas.html", "title": "\nMerry Christmas!\n"},

I never wanted to be one of those moms who moan and groan about how long breaks are. I wanted to be having so much fun with my kids when they were home that I would be as disappointed about the return to school as they were. And in some ways, I am; after all, both boys love school, so they aren't disappointed about going back.  I am also not groaning about break being 16 days this year instead of 12-14 for the same reasons as others who groan. I don't really want to relinquish my children; if I thought they would like it, I would cuddle them at home every day forever. Or take them all over the place. I'm not ready to return them to school to get them away from me, because I feel I have better things to do (what could be better than boy squishing, 24/7?) I groan because I see what it does to them to have so long away from routine, schedule, and learning.  In my short summer break, I do everything I can. I will be saving my pennies this year to take them to  Wakefield , to  Williamsburg , to  Maymont , to  Colonial Beach , to the  zoo , to the  Baltimore Aquarium , to the  farm , anywhere and everywhere I can think of. Keep them moving, keep them engaged, keep them having fun, and everything is wonderful. Winter break is different. Being outside is harder, because it is colder, or rainy, or you are trying to get decorations up and down. Everyone else is having the same problem, so they are crammed into the same indoor activities you are trying to get into, and the boys don't do well with crowds. Trying to get them to do crafts and things at home is a bit of a challenge. Andy is better about doing things than Joey (it takes more effort for Joey to be successful, so he prefers other things at home- like his beloved and predictable computer games from  Noggin  and  Starfall .) Consequently, with no schedule, no routine, everything in holiday upheaval, we end up with major meltdowns, long whiny days, and general malaise that is not good for anybody. An extra three days of a break means my boys have three extra days of being unhappy and uncomfortable, three extra days of me trying to schedule and structure, and failing.  I gotta figure this out. We can't be doing this every Christmas break for the next 12 years.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nps.gov/gewa/", "http://www.history.org/", "http://www.maymont.org", "http://www.colonialbeachva.net/", "http://nationalzoo.si.edu/", "http://www.aqua.org/", "http://www.sneadsfarm.com/", "http://www.noggin.com/", "http://www.starfall.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/01/break-ends.html", "title": "\nBreak Ends\n"},

It isn't good enough for each of them to have a computer, they want to be on the  same  computer. One things they hardly ever do is go over to the craft table and start making anything beyond maybe drawing or writing with magic markers.  With all the Christmas stuff out, I have most of the craft stuff put away, and blocked off by other stuff we usually have out, but right now needed out of the way for Christmas. So- you guessed it- today they wanted to make stuff. Andy wanted to make stick puppets (guess where the sticks are?) and Joey wanted to make a paper-plate clock. I managed the plates, but not the construction paper Joey wanted to make the hands. Then came the ultimate offense.  In order to make a paper plate clock, the hands have to be held on by a fastener thing, a little brass or steel thing that you put through the hole of loose-leaf paper, then it butterflies out like a mollybolt to hold the papers together. This lovely little device allows the hands to move while attached to the plate.  I don't own any.  The meltdown was immediate, but thankfully quicker than usual, and I got him to use his words to ask to go to the store to buy one. Into the car and off to Staples we go! Certainly the one store on earth that will have paper fasteners, right?  Wrong.  Three stores later, and we still have no paper fasteners. I have distracted him with a plastic schoolbus from the Roses(its closing, so it was a whopping fifty cents) and a playdate with  Max and Charlie and Jack  (which we were late for, looking for fasteners), but no clock. What am I going to do? FRIDAY UPDATE: I found some very expensive ones at A.C.Moore.

{"date": "Thursday, January 01, 2009", "body": "\nI lay next to Andy, waiting for him to sleep. If I move too soon, we must start over from scratch, so I try to stay still. From the next room wafts the whispers, squeaks, squeals, and giggles of another sleepless boy. Most of it is soundified, incomprehensible gibberish, a steady stream of motor-sound and oral stim. Occasionally I catch a few of what were once words, or the current favorite mantra, which has clung to some thread of meaning, and which Joey finds hilariously funny. Over and over, chanting and giggling, Joey tries to talk himself to sleep.  Christmas break is hard. There is almost no chance of establishing a routine, a pattern from day to day to day to let Joey get his bearings and steer through the jumble of sound, glitter, and cold. I think the lack of daylight affects him, too. We do best with bedtime in spring and fall. In summer, the days are too long; in winter, they are too short. Even the simplest of structure eludes us. Getting up in the morning, he never knows when Dad will have the day off, even if it is mid-week. People may visit the house, which is topsy-turvy and filled with unusual, glittery items that only come out for about a month, sometimes just a week. The weather doesn't help, either; this year, it was 70 degrees one day, 40 degrees the next.  At first, he retreated to his computer, a safe haven of games that always act the same, once you figure out the rules of the game. But with so much to do and see and what-have-you, often there are stretches of unscheduled hours spent in cars, other homes, other places seeing other people and doing other things, all of which are unexpected, no matter how much warning I give him- and sometimes I have little warning myself. Left to self-regulate, sound becomes key. Clicking returns. Mantras- appropriate and otherwise- roar to life with a vengeance. It's the Witching Hour, all day, every day... and this year, for sixteen days (winter break is usually 13-14 days).  I listen to the stream of whispers and giggles. At least he's happy. Or finds it funny. He did fine through Christmas day, then everything began to deteriorate. Mrs. H sent me home a happy, huggy, smiling boy, and I'm going to send her back a echolallic mess.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/01/with-apologies-to-mrs-h.html", "title": "\nWith Apologies to Mrs. H\n"},

{"date": "Friday, January 23, 2009", "body": "\nWe've been having some communication issues here. Andy wants to play with Joey. Joey wants to play with Andy. Andy asks Joey to play by calling his name and inviting him to look at things and join games (\"Look, Doe-y! Look what I made! I made dis for you! Let's be monsters, Doe-y. Doe-y!  Look !\"). Joey's preferred method is to invite Andy to sit with him (\"Come sit here at your computer, Andy. Come sit with me. Play on computer number two.\") Sometimes Joey ignores Andy altogether, unable to pull himself from his micro-super-focus to engage the world around him. The result is a lot of frustration. Andy doesn't want to sit  next  to Joey, he wants to play with Joey. Joey wants to do his own thing, but he wants his brother with him while he does it, but sometimes he doesn't want to really talk to his brother. This has aggravated the Witching Hour and two brothers who really love each other have a breakdown in trying to connect to one another on their own terms.  So today, after Andy had another fruitless attempt at getting Joey to play with him instead of beside him, and various other issues and events of the day, it was suddenly decided that Andy could go for a sleepover at Grandma's house (it is his turn, anyway, and this would give me some rare one-on-one with Joey). A great fuss was made about packing Andy up, announcing he was going to Grandma's, and generally making sure Joey understood that plans had changed and Andy was not going to be home this evening. Kisses and hugs were exchanged. Joey asked when he would be going to Grandma's (in his way... which is to state, \"I'm going to Grandma's on Tuesday. Andy goes to Grandma's on Wednesday.\" Translation: I want to go to Grandma's, Andy should stay here.) Andy, pleased as punch (who doesn't want to go to Grandma's to get one-on-one attention and red pancakes?), settled into Grandma's truck and off they went.  Joey was in the kitchen with his computer. He had Andy's computer open, too. \"Come sit at your computer, Andy, and play,\" Joey called. Andy was already gone.  I took some time to sit with him. I explained that Andy was at Grandma's house. Joey looked sad, and let me watch him play a few rounds of  Tic-Tac-Toe . He told me he would go to Grandma's on Tuesday (BTW, he can't go to Grandma's on Tuesday, because he has school on Wednesday). Then he got up, moved to the livingroom, plopped on the couch, and stared at the silent and blank television.  \"Do you want to watch something? You can watch anything you want,\" I offered in an attempt to cheer him.  \"Oswald,\" he nodded. This was an out-of-character request, but I did have a few episodes recorded, so I turned it on for him, then knelt in front of him and gave him a snuggle and a tickle to get him to giggle. He pushed my face up to look into it.  \"You love me.\" Was it a question, or a statement? It can sometimes be hard to tell.  \"I sure do!\" I assured him.  \"And Grandma loves me.\"  \"Yes, indeed! We all love you! You're the bestest boy that ever, ever was!\" (This is a common statement of endearment in my family.) \"And Daddy. And Andy.\"  \"Yes, we all love you.\"  \"I love you, too. Play a game with me?\"  \"Of course!\"  And so we entered a World Championship match of tic-tac-toe until JoeyAndyDad got home.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 21, 2009", "body": "\nI find myself in good company when I say, with all due respect, that I was disappointed by Mrs. Obama's ball gown. Now, seriously, I am no fashionista. In fact, I know almost nothing about fashion, and haute couture just annoys me. Fashions made for stick figures just don't do anything for me. I just didn't like the dress.  Not that it was a  complete  disaster. It just was such an opportunity to wear  the  perfect dress, and that opportunity, in my humble opinion was missed.  What the dress did right:  I liked the bare neckline (or would have, without that shoulder thing. Let's pretend that shoulder thing didn't exist for right now.) Mrs. Obama has good shoulders, which is a \"rare fair feature\" and I am glad they featured it. Also, as an art historian, the showing of strong shoulders creates such a wonderful, powerful image of a self-assertive and powerful person, it was a good thing to emphasize.  I liked the swing and flow of the skirt. When Mrs. Obama turned, there was a dramatic sweep of motion in the skirt, and I think that created a sense of motion and mystery, energy and flow that really worked.  What I would have done differently:  White? White is a color you put on really skinny people to give them an illusion of weight. And I mean  really  skinny. Brides wear white our of post-Victorian tradition, not for flattering the figure. In fact, many bridal dresses pull out a whole host of other tricks for flattery to make up for the color. On top of that, Mrs. Obama can really wear color, so why not take advantage of that? A rich green. A bright peacock or royal blue. (I'm not into red for inaugurations).  The textured fabric? No, no. no. What were those things? Flowers? The dress needed some sparkle, but keep it flush. Don't look like a bunch of random butterflies just landed all over you. That's more for a kid's prom dress, not an adult's ball gown. Maybe some beading, or some sequin work, a little flash without overdoing it. I'd prefer beads, but they can be a little heavy, and you don't want to disturb the motion in the skirt. Maybe a shimmery material of some kind. LAce is OK if it isn't pop-up.  Waistline- oh dear. Mrs. Obama apparently has a high waistline naturally, so why not go with a faux empire waist to flatter? Especially with the white...  The shoulder thing. Dump it. It was distracting. It was way too heavy. It looked like an afterthought, disturbing the lines of the dress. What was the point? Was that added to help her get in and out of the car or something?  So I think in the end, I wanted there to be more elegance, more of an adult feel to the dress. To me, the dress looked like a glorified prom dress, not a formal ball gown. I put out this critique not really as a critique of Mrs. Obama. She has the right to have her own taste, and to select any gown she feels is appropriate. This critique is really more about what I feel are appropriate and desirable qualities in a a wife, a mother, a First Lady, and a woman in today's world, as communicated through clothing. In other words, this is not about the Obamas, the designers, or even really a dress; it is about me, how I feel, and what I want. So, Mrs. Obama, go for it. Set your own style, and never wear anything you don't love. Show us your ideas.

Through this lovely adventure, all the children not spelling a word are expected to sit in a chair and be silent. This is not Joey's strong suit. Come to think of it, it isn't Andy's, either.  All things considered, Joey did spectacularly well. When you think that this time last year, there was no way he could have sat in a chair for fifteen minutes, then gotten up, gone to a microphone, listened to someone ask him to spell a word, and then spell it, it was downright miraculous. Add on top the fact that they do a practice round before beginning the real bee, and you wonder how on earth he did what he did, even with divine providence on his side.  He lasted five rounds, plus the practice round, and threw in the towel on the sixth round (so he got six words right.) On that seventh word, it was pretty clear he was done. Fidgeting was way up, he was getting out of his seat to spin, he was being grumpy with people helping him, he was tired and ready to go. So when asked to spell \"vote\", he got up and spelled \"F-O-T.\" He turned and waited for the bell (indicating a misspelled word), then turned to his aide (who was allowed to be with him on stage), and according to her, whispered, \"Vote. V-O-T-E. Vote! I wasn't paying attention!\" Now, this last has become a formula for \"I am messing up on purpose!\" She was upset that he threw the word on purpose, but you know what? We've been trying to teach the child to self-regulate all year. I'm not going to complain when he actually does it.  I learned some about spelling bees, and have some ideas for next year (such as, they let other contestants get up to use the bathroom, why can't Joey get up to have a walk-break?), and I think Joey did have fun with it.

The sunshine was abundant, the eagle was winging about the river, the sheep were out, and it promised to be a glorious walk.  At ages 6 and 4, boys have a strange fascination with bodily functions. I don't remember girls being that interested in poop. However, my guys- and many boys I have met- are mesmerized. On a working farm, there is no shortage of poop about. Sheep poop. Horse poop. Cow poop. We even saw a little pig poop. And apparently, \"poop\" is a fun word to say when you are 6 and 4. Poop, poop, poop. The sheep were upstaged by their own poop.  So we rambled along, and came upon the beautiful magnolia tree, the pods scattered over the craggy roots, where the boys like to climb and play. JoeyAndyDad and I stopped upon Joey's command and watched them scramble happily over the tree.  And then JoeyAndyDad said, \"Look! Tree poop!\"  Yes, it was an instant hit. Tree pods and nuts are now tree poop. That's one way to make a nature walk a success.  We stopped into the colonial kitchen to look around. Joey has been having trouble grasping the concept of past and history, and that people did things differently and lived differently. So we popped our heads in and I asked them what they saw that was different from our kitchen at home. Andy noticed butter churns. I pointed out that there was no stove or oven, just a fireplace. JoeyAndyDad noted that there was no refrigerator. Joey noticed there was no mac and cheese.  Then we went back to exploring, and Joey slipped and fell. He's been doing that a lot more, as we have been missing OT sessions (Get better, Ms. Janene! We miss you!). He was very upset, because it was a muddy spot, and he got a lot of cold mud on his pants.  \"Oh no!\" he wailed all the way to the blacksmith's shop. \"A cow pooped me! A cow pooped my pants!\"  We managed to distract him by having him sit down for a little and catch his breath, then promising a peek at the pigs. Joy of joys, we wandered out (avoiding the poop) to see the pigs. Fortunately, there was one out in the pig yard to see (sometimes there isn't, especially in winter.) Then we wandered back to the trees (avoiding the poop, but pointing out every lovely pile) and took a rest on a bench. Andy found a walnut (more tree poop), and discovered some mole tunnels. When I told him what they were, he was delighted. He likes moles.  And so we wandered back to the car. We saw ducks diving on the river. We saw vultures playing in the air currents overhead. And we rolled the tree poop down the hill and giggled.

Maybe he is tired from being in school. Maybe all the odd days off- teacher work days, holidays, snow days- add up to confusion for him. Maybe he just gets a little crazy before making a leap forward in development (a leap we usually have in late spring). Maybe he leaps forward because whatever is going on now resolves. I've been so proud of him, with his spelling bee, and his wonderful job at his dance concert. I wonder if these things are more of a challenge this time of year, or if these activities help get him through the rough time. He was  so  happy yesterday, flapping his butterfly wings in his Bolivian folk dance. He was even in time to the music when he clapped and stomped, a big deal for Joey (who is often half a beat behind in such things.) My baby is growing up.  Andy has a bumpy patch about now, too- allergies. Andy and I took Grandma to the doctor's today. Andy and I needed our ears checked because on top of the lingering cough, we now have headcolds. Well, actually allergies, according to the doctor. My poor mom has inflamed lungs from coughing so long. It would be lovely if we could all just take some nice long naps and get all better. That includes you, my friends. All of us. Let's have a big Group Nap. Or maybe a Nap-In. We could protest the lack of sleep due to fighting with schools and government agencies for services the law says it is our right to have for our loved ones or for ourselves. A big Nap-In. Then we can all wake up and have the big  Bake Sale .  I think I may have wandered off-topic.

{"date": "Saturday, January 31, 2009", "body": "\nFor those of you who don't know, I am already starting to think about and plan for school next year. Yes, now. Actually, I'm a little late getting my butt moving.  The season is now officially open, as the subject was actually broached by Joey's teacher, Mrs. Huff. She is starting to look at second grade teachers and settings so that Joey can continue being in the \"regular\" classrooms for his reading, math, science, and social studies, and possibly move into \"regular\" setting for writing, too. She was apologetic about wanting to keep him for a couple of hour for language and social skills... I wasn't sorry. I know she's going to have a boatload of new kids next year- as many as eight, plus the four she has now- but perhaps having some group social skills would be a good thing. The bad thing about this possible scenario is I may have to put together a case for him to keep Macy, since she would be needed back in the autism room if there is going to be eight new kids there. There's just no money to hire extra aides.  In broaching the subject about Joey, and how we looked forward to keeping him \"mainstreamed\" (he loves having so many friends!), we also mentioned Andy. To be frank, Andy isn't going to need \"special education.\" We've worked hard to make it that way. However, his enunciation is still not right. He has sensory issues. He is going to need some eyes on him that know what they are seeing. Otherwise he's going to be labeled a discipline problem, just as he was at our first preschool.  It isn't easy thinking about 504 plans on top of IEPs, but I will definitely keep you posted about the process. I think I may poke around and make sure I'm talking to the right folks first. But this weekend, I'm looking to exactly what a 504 plan is and how is works, and what it would mean for us. It is my understanding that 504s are more difficult to enforce (there's no force of law as there us with IDEA), so do wish us luck.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/01/planning-future.html", "title": "\nPlanning the Future\n"},

If I hit you, you will break!\" Joey vrooms, turns the plastic ring he calls a steering wheel and zooms through the first floor after the penguin.  What Joey means is he is going to play chase. This is a favorite boy game,especially during the Witching Hour. Unfortunately, it can go horribly wrong during the Witching Hour, as they get tired and annoyed with each other, with their communication hurdles, and with the determination and differing wills of each other. For example, one wants to play penguin and the other wants to play bus. That is going to annoy each other, as opposed to two boys playing penguins, or two boys playing buses.  But I worry about what those words could mean if he uttered them in school, with no interpreter handy. How would his very real fear of being hit by a car be handled? Would it be interpreted as a threat?  Both boys end up crashing into the couch. Someone stubs a toe. Someone else gets annoyed about the two different games. I hug my boys, and they are off again, a bus in one direction, a penguin in another. They run into each other. It's an accident, but the results are explosive. I have to close my computer completely and get the boys engaged. We jump on the trampoline. We play a round of Feed the Kitty (a great game!) Joey gets onto his computer to play some games. Andy wants to watch some Sesame Street. The dust settles. Andy works on some of his art, darted between the kitchen art table and the living room where Sesame Street plays, constant motion.

{"date": "Sunday, March 01, 2009", "body": "\nI'm supposed to be doing a mountain of grading, but I'm grumpy, and it is never fair to grade when grumpy. The fact that a barrage of student idiocy and rudeness is the cause of the grumpiness is beside the point. I just can't do it. It's not fair.  Besides, I've already grumped at my children, grumped at my husband, and grumped at the falling snow. I spent an inordinate amount of time in the grocery store today. When I left the house at 7 am, the forecast said something vaguely about two inches of snow on green areas. By the time I reached my mom's house, following a swimming adventure with Frick and Frack in which Frick was all about swimming and Frack just wanted to scream instead of dipping his face in the water (sometimes I wonder which one is the \"special needs\" one... perhaps that is something for another post), around 9:30 am, we were expecting 6-10 inches. Its never good when it snows in Atlanta. Only I didn't know we were now expecting a blizzard. I just didn't think twice when my mom asked me to run out and grab groceries for her, because she's been sick and even two inches of snow can be a problem on her dirt road. When I got home after meeting JoeyAndyDad at Chuck E. Cheese (where the boys had a marvelous time, despite the crowd because we got there later than planned) and discovered the new predictions, back to the grocery I went. There is a huge difference between \"might have to entertain the boys with snow for a few hours\" and \"may be stuck in house with boys for two days\". (Since we live in the city, I doubt we'll be stuck here longer than that, even if it doesn't immediately warm up.) Whenever the \"s-word\" hits the forecasts, people around here go nuts. I went a little nuts myself, buying things like chips and crackers I wouldn't normally buy, and more drinks than usual, but I felt I was kinda prepping for a snow party. The people around me seemed to be stocking up for a major blizzard, as if they expected to be snowed in for the week. Actually, more like for the month. A week's worth of groceries on a Sunday wouldn't be that unusual, except for the huge number of people buying them; but these folks were going crazy. It also was putting off my nice, comfy schedule. This should have been a wonderfully relaxing day: a morning swim, a visit to Grandma's, a fun early lunch at Chuck E. Cheese, then home for an afternoon of cleaning the basement and enthusiastic boy-squishing, followed by a bit of grading after bedtime. Instead, I spent a lot of time crunched with crazed idiots who thought the world was ending, or would if they didn't have a month's supply of toilet paper right  now .  I could do a whole blog just on adventures I have in grocery stores.  And instead of getting to read lovely stories about snow to my beautiful boys, I spent an hour trying to solve problems for students who, it turned out, weren't interested in solutions. That makes me really, really grumpy, especially when those students sent me emails of desperation complete with TMI excuses for why their work wasn't getting done, in cranky tones- as if it was  my  fault they hadn't bothered to do anything earlier in the week when solutions could have been easier to implement. And I still have three weeks' of discussions and two sets of exams staring at me. If I stuck an A on each and every one of them and tossed them back, not one of those students would care. In fact, they'd probably be happy. Who needs to learn stuff, anyway? How depressing is  that ? Outside, the snow keeps falling, which means tomorrow's Field Day will likely be cancelled. In fact, I'm likely to have a snow day with my little guys, so I made sure I had hot chocolate with marshmallows on hand. If I don't get to grading soon, my grumpy butt will be stuck grading exams instead of playing in the snow. And that would just suck.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/03/grumps.html", "title": "\nGrumps\n"},

{"date": "Friday, February 27, 2009", "body": "\nThe boys both got new coats for the winter. I got Joey a beautiful blue one with matching snow boots because his old coat was getting small and the lining had disappeared (and rather unusually, has yet to turn up). Andy's new coat appeared after Christmas, because his old coat, which had been Joey's old coat and going strong for 4 years and through two boys, finally gave up the ghost (washing it had no effect on the filthy look, all the velcro had been pulled off, and Andy's wrists stuck out of the sleeves). Grandma found him a lovely red one, one of those fluffy down ones. Very warm, and it would crush better to make getting him in his car seat easier.  All was well until Andy decided he didn't like coats. Specifically, he realized it was easier to get into his car seat without one, and when you aren't wearing a coat in a car seat, your back doesn't get sweaty. Also, I think the weight difference was a factor- his old coat, being one of those lovely 4-in-one coat systems (I'm not being facetious. I love those 3-in-one and 4-in-ones: buy one coat, wear it the whole year round, just wear the parts you need! Totally, totally, awesome) had some weight and thickness to it that his new coat lacks. He's happy to wear it as an actual buffer against cold, but he's figured out that the car, once warmed, is, well,  warm .  And now that's been generalized. The minute he hops into the car, he's stripping off his jacket. The temperature makes no difference; even if it is freezing, he knows that in about ten minutes, the car will be warm. The fact that he'll catch his death in those ten minutes without a coat is of no interest to him in the slightest. This from the child who, up until three short months ago, insisted on having any jacket with a hood worn with the hood upon his head. Even indoors.  It also makes no difference which jacket he is now wearing. It was warmer than usual the past two days, so I pulled out the sweatshirts. I thought the weight might also encourage him to keep it on. No dice. Open door, hop in, remove jacket. It's a ritual now, ingrained into his the pathways and set on automatic. Open, hop, remove.  The teachers at his school, who have to put him in my car and strap him into his seat, find this very odd. They are busy trying to get him wrestled into the seat quickly, and he's trying to remove his jacket, which he wore for all of a half-dozen steps between the door and my car. She actually chuckled this morning, \"Poor guy. If they come with a jacket, we have them wear them home; even if its just for ten seconds!\" I was glad for the implication that my child isn't the only one to hit the car and strip.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/02/instant-jacket-removal.html", "title": "\nInstant jacket removal\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 03, 2009", "body": "\nYes, the IEP season is fast closing in on us, and I find myself opening small word files and pulling out spiral notebooks, filling them with lists of things that might need focus in next year's program. I scatter these listing tools throughout the house. This is not just for IEP lists- I have spiral notebooks full of all sorts of lists of things I wanted to remember and needed to do. Then I promptly misplace the notebook. Anyway, I have these tools scattered through the house so that when I notice something needing attention, I can write it down, and try to remember to mention it to Mrs. H so it can be considered for IEP-worthiness.  This is not as easy as it sounds. After all, to me, Joey is Joey. I have no reference to \"average\" 6-year-olds running around my house for comparison. I have no idea what \"average\" 6-year-olds do, how they speak, what they like. I am still shocked to hear of first and second graders talking about  House  (and I'm a Hugh Laurie fan) or even  High School Musical ; my kids are still on  Magic School Bus  and  Oswald , with a new smattering of  Sesame Street . Joey likes  Wow Wow Wubsy  and  Go Diego Go , but he has never watched the shows, he just likes the arcade-style games through the website. Superheroes? Joey doesn't know any.  Star Wars ? Why do 6-year-olds know about Star Wars??? I thought that was for the 8-to-12 crowd??? Thinking about him in terms of deficits is just not something we do. It takes something very obvious to catch our attention. For example, I have quite a few notes about his speech patterns, especially now that we've had an uptick in original, unscripted speech. Constructing original speech is very difficult for our little  Mrs. Who , so all the mistakes in language, which you might expect from someone just learning to speak a language, are coming out in force. I can break them down and write them up into lovely IEP goals to make forming speech easier and more natural-sounding.  Field Day is a good day to come out and observe Joey. I learned this  last year , when I felt the shock of seeing Joey in a room full of \"average\" kindergardeners, and how very different Joey really was. I was invited again to chaperone this year, so i was looking forward to getting an eyeful, and prepared myself for the eyeful. Realizing how hard it is for Joey to function and how much he really does struggle with things other kids find easy- everyday things like running and following a game- is really very hard. But this year, I was ready, I knew this was a tool for me to think about focusing effort and what skills needed more attention.  Then it snowed.  So now I am left to think of other options, other ways of getting the information I need to think about Joey and what he needs. Do I try to visit school while he is in one of his inclusion classrooms? Do I make more notes about issues we see at the park and other public venues? Where else can I get a good look at Joey in \"average\" contexts? What will these observations tell me? And will I remember where I wrote them down?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fox.com/house/", "http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/originalmovies/highschoolmusical/", "http://www.scholastic.com/magicschoolbus/", "http://www.hitentertainment.com/oswald/uk/intro.html", "http://pbskids.org/sesame/", "http://www.nickjr.com/shows/wubbzy/index.jhtml", "http://www.nickjr.com/shows/diego/index.jhtml", "http://www.starwars.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wrinkle_in_Time#Mrs_Who"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/03/happy-spring-happy-iep-season.html", "title": "\nHappy Spring, Happy IEP Season\n"},

Whenever we have odd days like this one, we tend to have a real issue several days later.  I knew we were having an off day when Joey got to swimming. Andy didn't go this morning at all, he was sleeping in and spent much of last night saying he didn't want to see Ms. Heidi, he wanted to stay home with Daddy. He got his wish. Joey got to the pool, and right away I could see Ms. Heidi was having a harder than usual time getting Joey to do his swimming- and Joey  loves  swimming. Was it the rain? or a harbinger of something else?  At home, the moods are spinning. One minute we're happy, playing trucks or decorating our leprechaun trap for school, even watching a little TV or having some popcorn- and suddenly, with little to no warning, its time to melt down. A torn sticker. A dropped kernel. A truck that rolls just a little too far. The world blurs into meltdown.  Melty days are hard. For one, I have few tools to uncover the underlying issues and problems; I am stuck with trying to put out the little fires with no way to discovering what is smouldering or why. Also, the lack of warning means you have a lot of sudden noise, which means not only do I get startled, but Andy is also more likely to melt down. Trying to keep everyone engaged is harder to do, and no guarantee of peace. It also means all the usual tricks are used up by lunchtime.  They are also dizzying. Laugh, giggle, quiet, SCREAM, giggle, SCREAM, fine, quiet, giggle, SCREAM. Mood changing so rapidly that it is hard to know which one is current, and no way to know why.  Having it happen on a cold, rainy day only exacerbates the issues. You can't put them outside to make noise for a while. They are caught inside with you.  So it looks like tonight will be a swell night to pull out some amaretto after the guys are in bed, taking three deep breaths, and hope school goes OK in the morning.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/03/days-in-360.html", "title": "\nDays in 360\n"},

In the world of sibling rivalry, it is the deliberate nature of this destruction that is concerning us most. Here come our deerstalkers and pipes- another mystery is upon us.  Is this simple sibling rivalry? Are we acting out in place of lashing out with words? Instead of calling brother names, we scribble on his things when he isn't complying with our wishes? And what does Joey want? Does he want Andy to play with him? Was there some other action we missed- for example, did Andy tease him, hit him, threaten him? Did Andy tell Joey to go away?  Is this something deeper? Is he lashing out against his brother because he is having troubles elsewhere? Is he using Andy as a surrogate to lash out at, instead of someone at school or the playpark?  Is this a acting out against something totally unrelated? Other frustrations, other issues, other discomforts?  If we solve this mystery or not, we still need to do something. This is not acceptable behavior. Joey needs tools for dealing with frustration, discomfort, and unhappiness that are not destructive. We need to help him manage stress. He needs a better way to communicate stress. Screaming at the top of his lungs when we express our disappointment is just not that helpful or constructive.

Well, if you were expecting me to come back a month later and report spiffy rooms, made beds, yummy sandwiches, and new jeans put on by a child who spent the whole night in his own bed, then excuse me while I laugh myself silly. I believe these days are all coming, but such campaigns are kind of like IEP goals- see where you are a year from now.  However, if you were expecting, like me, just some progress towards the goals, then we're doing just fine. Mostly. Considering we've had a rough patch (ah, spring...), any progress is a victory. I don't expect any serious progress until we can get through the rough bits and really focus on the campaign goals.  Joey has successfully made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with some help. Our first step into a wider world. I have purchased wheat flour, yeast, and honey,  but have not really gotten to open up the Elmo cookbook and get going. I need to either improve my prep skills so I can be cooking with two kids at once, or I need to create more one-on-one time for my guys.  The bed-making campaign has not been started. That will probably be easier to start after we get him to sleep in his own bed all night- which we also haven't started. They aren't little long. I am torn, though I know it is a good thing for forwarding independence- I will miss waking up with a little guy snuggled in.  Dressing has been tricky. I have him consistently dressing himself, including picking out his own clothes, taking off his pajamas, and putting on all his clothing independently, but we still haven't added fasteners.

After all, reading gives us a whole new avenue to get information to him, and he does really well with it. We have bought a plethora of books of all types, a huge range of topics, anything to try to catch his attention. I could open a library, and I don't see that as a bad thing. I figure once his interest gets caught, he might start devouring them like Cookie Monster in a bakery.  But that didn't really happen. We encouraged him to read books, let him pick out the books, but it always seemed a chore. He did have a Blues Clues book he liked to read, but only at bedtime, and it was far below his reading level. We had another bright spot when he brought him  Mouse's First Fall  from the library, and read it to me. Joy of joys! But when he got his own copy, it was returned to the shelf- and again, it was far below his level. I figured the real excitement for him was the success; he could read these books all alone.  Lately, he has shown interest in  Do Unto Otters , a book about manners, and would read that to himself at bedtime. However, he preferred certain pages to the whole book, mostly the one with the word \"Snotter.\" Oh dear.  Then I bought a Pinky Dinky Doo book ( Back to School ). It is closer to his reading level, though still a little below. He's been loving watching Pinky Dinky Doo, so I thought it might catch his eye.  He's been carrying it around as if it were  Bus . He reads it on the couch. He reads it in the car. He reads it in bed.  Folks, I think we have found a winner.

I also took one of his presents with us, a huge box of crayons! He really liked getting something at the restaurant. Having it be a huge box of crayons was extra bonus. The boys had a really good time, and did a good job staying in their chairs and eating their food. I was very proud of them! Then it was time to go home and open more presents! Mrs. H sent this awesome Wubsy toy for the bath, and Joey ran right up at bedtime to take his bath and try it out. When you put soap on it, and squeeze it, it makes suds. (It works.) He was also very pleased to get his own clock for his room (part of the stay-in-bed campaign, but he hasn't really figured that out yet), a bubble machine, a ball-dart game, and an electric Uno game.  What was super-cool was that he figured out:  1. he was getting presents  2. they were for him  3. he actually liked opening them, and did it with some speed.  He would open one, look at it for a minute, ask for batteries to be added when appropriate, and then  moved on to the next gift . It was incredible. He  really  wanted to fixate on the clock, but his hands went out and picked up the next package and got going. This is an amazing advancement over Christmas, when he opened one package, saw it was the car he wanted, and for him, Christmas was done. The rest were just chores, requiring the entire day to plow through, more or less.  Then we had cake! Another amazing feat- Joey blew out all the candles, all by himself! Yes, it took three puffs. Who cares? He was excited, he was happy, he blew hem out without any help from Mommy or Daddy. Totally, totally awesome. My baby is getting all growed up! Joey put on a whistling concert while I cut the cake (that's right- the child whistles...  without his front teeth . No, I haven't a clue how he does it. He's just proud and pleased as punch to be doing it.) Then we all had the cake he asked for- one with sprinkles inside and outside, and chocolate frosting. Yum! (We took the blueberry muffin-cupcakes with blue frosting in to school, they were yummy, too.) Happy birthday, little buddy!

The boys did get to go out and find all those pesky eggs the Easter Bunny was so not-nice about scattering all around instead of leaving them in the basket. The boys cleaned up the yard nicely, finding all those chocolates and jelly beans in bright plastic containers. Andy was delighted that some of them were dinosaur-shaped.  Then the boys headed for the porch, where their Easter Baskets awaited with more chocolate (well, not so much for Andy, who doesn't really like chocolate), more jelly beans, peeps, and toys. Andy was very excited about the jelly beans and the peeps, and the stuffed duck (which he had picked out himself the other day). Joey liked his blue car and his blue peeps and his chocolate rabbit.  Andy had a great time exploring the baskets and showing us all his new treasures. I got them pads with tic-tac-toe, very exciting, and these hands that point on a stick, teachers use them in classrooms. The boys think they are fabulous.  Finding cellophane to wrap the baskets has become increasingly difficult. That's actually last year's cellophane, the baskets never got unwrapped. I just stuck the new stuff in the same way you reach in to get it out. Next time I see rolls of cellophane, I'm stocking up. Don't other people wrap Easter baskets in cellophane anymore? The magic effect is well worth the $2 for the roll, trust me. An Easter basket without cellophane is like a Christmas present without paper.  Remember that chocolate rabbit in Joey's basket? It didn't live long. Joey  loves  chocolate. When it comes to candy, he and Andy are like Jack Sprat and his wife. ANdy doesn't care for chocolate, Joey doesn't care for lollipops or jelly beans, together they eat the whole store.  I love the way Joey seems to contemplate sweets and food. Its a very careful, conscious process of relishing it.  This is the way Easter really ought to be.

It is about learning to accept life and your children the way the are, instead of the way you thought they were supposed to be.

The instructional dean's office has decided they need documentation that they have \"helped\" all the adjuncts, and even though I've been there ten years, they came and \"observed\" my class (\"we have to treat you like a first-year adjunct because we don't have this paperwork...\"). Oh joy. So stress is running high, because basically, telling a ten-year veteran that you are going to treat her \"like a first-year\" is really, really suspicious. And of course, it was the worst lecture I gave all semester.  I'm running around trying to get papers graded. Why do I even assign papers? Oh, to help them learn to write. Right. Sounds like a great idea until you are in the thick of it, and realizing they can't write a coherent sentence, much less a paper. And you can only \"teach them to write\" if they give you a draft.  I decided to check my enrollments for summer and fall, to find my summer online 102 is doing really badly (I have to have at least 16 students for it to be a go; I have 3) and I have no info for fall at all- odd, since they are currently registering for both summer and fall. So I pull up the class schedule- and discover the only live class I was offered isn't there. There are several classes that I have no idea whom our new department head has gotten to teach, since she hasn't asked me, and she made noises of not offering classes to one of the other adjuncts who doesn't turn up for things like meetings. That's neither here nor there; if she's cancelled my class, it would sure be nice if she at least emailed me to let me know, right?  I got back to mom's office to find I had screwed up the book we're publishing, and had to re-do the cover.  Andy has been in constantly motion for three days. He made circuits in my mom's house, bouncing on pillows yesterday. Today he got very sensitive to anything that didn't go his way. He was pretty good for Grandma, and through a nice lunch with Grandma. Then we had to chase Joey's bus down because we got out slightly late. That put everybody off. Having to run off to school to talk with Joey's teacher didn't improve things.  We had a nice chat at school about the upcoming ESY and second grade and what kinds of goals we think he might need and how he is doing now in inclusion. We have the most awesome case manager on the planet.  Then I came home to two melty boys. Grandma needed to be taken home, and the boys were offered the ride, but Andy was so tired and out-of-sorts he started waling on his brother, and had to be left at home with JoeyAndyDad.

So who stole those children and put these two wild things in my house? The Witching Hour on Monday? Holy Hannah. And today? I think Andy bounced in constant motion from the minute he woke up until the minute he passed out in bed. At Grandma's, he pulled out the floor cushions and the couch cushions and made a circuit of bouncy spots to walk over- a little circuit he walked the whole time I was at work, apparently. Even strapping him into the carseat did nothing for keeping him still. His little bottom bounced and wiggled all the way to Grandma's and back. We went to the park and bounced there. We picked up Joey, and another great, wonderful day at school meant another bouncing child in my car. They bounced into speech therapy. Andy ran around outside while Joey worked. Then we bounced home (very loudly, I may add.) Then they bounced all the way to Andy's art show, bounced back out to Grandma's (so we could give her Andy's T-Rex sculpture as a gift, since she's been taking care of him while I've been teaching), and bounced at Grandma's before bouncing, wiggling, and shrieking all the way home. Can we bottle this stuff?  Lest we mistake this constant motion for normal four-year-old-ness, Andy's OT gave me a letter to send in to his school. She listed a number of strategies for meeting his sensory needs in the classroom. I now am supposed to call the school and set up another meeting about looking this over and seeing what we need to do now (since the ChildFind screening committee decided he doesn't qualify for special ed). Vestibular breaks. Transitioning strategies. Visual cues. In some ways, it just looks like good classroom management to me, but then i realize that most kids don't need these things to get through a day. They can have lunch in the cafeteria without having a breakdown (or a meltdown) for twenty minutes afterwards.  Monday was rainy. The school Andy goes to has an \"open floor\" plan- ie, the classroom walls only go halfway, so the cacophony of seven classes echoes throughout the day. It must drive Andy crazy. Regularly, he would get a break from the noise when the class went outside to play- but with the rain, there was no break. No wonder the poor little guy was grumpy. He holds it together long enough to get through school, and then he's had it. As we emerge from teh change of season for Joey, we have some of the same thing- he is now at least able to hold himself together to get through school, but its exhausting. He comes home and is  done . So he and Andy go picnicking on each other. The Witching Hour begins.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/04/holding-together.html", "title": "\nHolding Together\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, April 28, 2009", "body": "\nWhen I read  articles like this , I often wonder about the extremes our world seems to be pulling in to. And how many of the people I know don\u2019t exist on either side.  On one side, folks who seem to believe that autism is only a deficit, something to be eradicated like polio. Do all of them believe that vaccines or heavy metal poisoning is to blame? I suspect that is not the case. What bothers me about this end of the interpretation spectrum is that Joey would not be who he is without autism. He would be a different person completely. There is something in this idea that denies who autistic people are as individuals, insisting they are actually someone else. That really, really bothers me.  On the other end of the spectrum is extreme neurodiversity. This is the idea that autism is \u201cjust a difference\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be addressed at all. This complete acceptance and embracing of autism may seem like a great idea, especially compared to the complete denial of the opposite extreme. However, there are problems here, too. Extreme neurodiversity wants to put an end to therapies such as speech therapy and ABA. If you\u2018ve ever tried to work with a bad therapist or poorly done ABA, you know why. If you have a therapist who is domineering, rather than supportive, what are you really training the child to do? What does it mean to be \u201cfunctional\u201d? Do all stims need to be squashed? What about the gifts my child has, the way he sees the world?  Here at Life With Joey, we prefer middle ground, thought, and individualization. This is a middle ground that rarely gets talked about in the media. We believe therapies are tools, and our purpose is to support Joey and provide him with the skills he needs to thrive and appreciate his talents and strengths\u2026 which, you might note, is the exact same purpose we have for using tools available for Andy. There are domineering parents in the world, with and without autistic children. If you just dictated to your child what they will study in college, you might what to think about that again- is that really supportive, or are you projecting yourself onto your child? There is a difference between guiding and forcing, and it is important to know the difference when trying to raise children (who will grow up whether you raise them or not.)  So well-done  ABA  can be a useful tool.  Floortime ,  TEACCH ,  RDI ,  pivotal response training ,  PECS ,  sensory integration , speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy\u2026 tools, not ends. Be aware that the first therapist you come across might not be a good fit. That finding what is right for your child or loved one can take time and work, and lots of research. Not everything is helpful or necessary for every child. Joey didn\u2019t need 40 hours a week of pure discrete trial training. Often being aware of different methods and being able to actively adjust and mesh together different methods and understandings is key to individualizing your approach to your loved one. Don\u2019t just dismiss things out-of-hand; check it out. Pay attention. Document what works.  For us, Joey needed to be able to speak and use language. It isn\u2019t a matter of just putting a keyboard in front of him; he types like he speaks (the processing issue is in putting the words in correct order and tense, not just getting them out of his mouth).  He needed to stop tracking in the classroom so he could focus and learn (he can come home and track to unwind all he likes). Yet he is still our Joey, and we wouldn\u2019t want him to be anyone else.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/27/autistic_culture/index.html", "http://www.kennedykrieger.org/kki_misc.jsp?pid=4761&bl=1", "http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml", "http://www.teacch.com/", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/", "http://www.autismnetwork.org/modules/behavior/pri/index.html", "http://www.pecs.com/", "http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/sensory-integration-activities.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/04/are-you-aware-xxv-world-of-extremes.html", "title": "\nAre You Aware?

We are working hard to help him, to support him, to give him the tools he needs to survive, thrive, and be a part of society, to enjoy his talents and his strengths and overcome his challenges. This is, as far as I know, what parents do.  And as a parent, there are things that keep me up at night, wondering. Is it enough? Will he be OK?  I have been weighing the idea of going down to the police station and seeing if there is anyone I can talk to about Joey. See, Joey is a runner.

He can't deal with noise. He needs movement. And we're not even addressing his speech at this point- the school SLP keeps saying he's fine, but then I hear him next to other kids his age. And even by ourselves, he can be difficult to understand.  We had him evaluated, and it was determined he did not require special education. Well, OK, not even speech? Hmmmm. Stay tuned on that front.  Our OT put together a nice little letter about his needs and methods that might be effective. I sent it to the school. Today, I got a nice email asking me to make an appointment... not with the special ed coordinator/vice principal, but with the principal. I called and set it up with the principal's secretary right away.  I'm a little nervous. First, I'm leary of meeting with someone whom I was unaware of being part of special ed services loop. This was higher than I thought was necessary to discuss my child's placement. This could be a good thing, perhaps she needs to sign off on a 504, or I need to ask for one from her, as part of the process. Or it could be a railroading tactic- getting in there and being told there is no such thing as sensory integration dysfunction and I should shut up and go away. That happened when we noted the school OT  wasn't doing sensory integration  for  Joey , and we had to go to the  Special Education Director . I have to think of a plan in case this is a railroading- like putting the new special ed director on speed dial on my cell phone (and remember, I don't usually carry around my cell phone.) Second, should I be prepping for this just as I would for an eligibility meeting, if I am going to go in and ask for a formal 504? I don't have a lot of time. The appointment is Thursday. What paper do I need to bring with me? Should I have Andy's notebook in order? I suspect it would be a good idea to be prepared. Perhaps having some statement from Joey's teacher- who has at least glimpsed Andy and his issues- might be a good idea. Or not. We don't want to get her in trouble.

It is a very brief report that I found more interesting in reading what the observer thought was important to note, rather than as anything really useful. There was very little opinion expressed. I was really worried about that, because often admin think of lecture-format classes as \"old fashioned\" and prefer more Mickey-Mouse approaches (where kids get up and do a lot of singing and dancing and playing with computers, often giving them facts in fun formats, but not really encouraging skills for critical thought, communication, writing, or making connections between facts and events). And when push comes to shove, these are intro classes, and I do them lecture-style. Not droning, one-way lecturing, but I share a lot of information really fast.  Some things I thought interesting to be important? They noted I responded quickly to the request to be observed. Um... what, you think I would wait weeks to respond to my boss? Are people that stupid? Also, they noted I \"fulfill the requirement to turn in syllabi.\" Yeah, one time I mistakenly emailed my syllabus to the wrong address (the secretary had turned over, oops) and I got CHEWED. OUT.

It isn't a frown, really, but it definitely is not a smile, and you know its bad when you see it. Joey bopped around the corner, asking for sandals. His feet are too hot in shoes. This shoe-less thing is something both my boys are experiencing right now-neither want socks or shoes. For Joey, this is very bad, because without socks, his shoes become a military-grade chemical weapon (something he shares with my brother and father). I was hoping that was what The Look was for. I was disappointed.  Joey is back to  spitting . This is a huge, huge issue, because spitting is so completely and utterly unacceptable. He's been spitting on the floor and smearing it around, which is bad enough; but spitting in his aide's face is a quick ticket to  Ms. T . So we have come back to The Look.  \"Don't you have something else to tell your Mom, Joey?\" Ms. Macy prompted him sternly.  \"I need sandals,\" he evaded.  \"No, Joey. What is the  other  thing you have to tell Mom?\" He plopped onto the bench. \"I went to Ms. T today at 11:35.\" Time is one of Joey's passions. However, this pronouncement heralded a long, long, long afternoon. Whatever the spitting is about, it means Joey is feeling out-of-sorts. It probably doesn't help that his visit to Ms. T became a bit of a theme to the afternoon. Even  Ms. Nikki  had to talk about it in speech.  So when I asked him to leave the car seat where it was in the back seat, the world came to a well and proper end. By the time we got home, he was so out of sorts, I had to send him up to his room to calm down. Unfortunately, he didn't; he got more upset, and so I set about making sure he was at least comfortable. Changed clothes, removed shoes, adjusted room temperature and fan speed, found favorite books, picked up items that he had thrown about the room. He didn't want to talk to me, but he spent another ten minutes up there, between raging and talking to himself.  Thank goodness for Dad. A new face, and we can at least get calmer and talk things over. IN talking about what happened today, Joey and JoeyAndyDad also talked about Ms. Macy, and all she does for Joey; helping him through his day, and especially letting him go out into other classes and see all his many friends; and by spitting at her, he made her feel bad. That seemed to really strike a chord with Joey; both that he made Macy feel bad, and that she does so much to help him (especially that she lets him go to other classrooms. Joey really does love having lots of other kids to interact with). He has made her a card and now says he's going to apologize to her tomorrow. And I think this time, it will be more than a kid being told to apologize; this time, it will be Joey telling Ms. Macy how he feels about it. He's sorry, and doesn't want to make her feel bad.

Unfortunately, I failed to consider the issues my own child might have with learning a different language.  To be honest, Andy has very little trouble with language, so I didn't think much about it at all. It is the speech that is the trouble- articulation. Why wouldn't I think, if he has trouble articulating in English, that he wouldn't have trouble articulating in Spanish?  Lately, he has been very upset about going to school on Wednesdays, because he doesn't want to do Spanish or Music, his two Wednesday specials. So I have doing a lot of trying to pull out of him why he doesn't like Spanish or Music. And this morning, I got some answers. Apparently his little friend thinks singing is \"yucky\" and Andy is upset about that, because he  likes  music, but he  doesn't  like his friend saying that the songs are yucky. And then there was Spanish.  \"Worth er yucky.\"  \"The Spanish words? You don't like the Spanish words?\" \"No.\" \"Why don't you like the Spanish words? What words have you learned?\" {Tangle of sounds that included, I think, \"Spanish\", \"pretend\", \"words\", \"don't like\", \"yucky.\"} \"Spanish isn't pretend. It is a real language. We speak English. Not everyone speaks English. People in other places speak different languages. Some speak Spanish; people in Spain and Mexico speak Spanish. Some people speak French, or German, or Hindi... and Mommy learned a language called Sanskrit! People spoke it a long time ago.\"  {pause, then something that I think included something about sounding funny.} \"Are you having trouble  saying  the Spanish words?\" \"Yeth.\"  \"They don't sound right?\"  \"Yeth.\" {Something that included the name of his friend.} \"Does {Andy's Friend} say the words? Can he say the words?\"  \"Yeth.\"  \"And you have trouble saying them?\" \"YETH!\" Oh, dear. So we talked a little about how it isn't his fault that he has trouble saying the words. And I told his teacher that not being able to say the words is frustrating him, and I suspect someone was making fun of him not being able to say them properly- or he  perceived  they were making fun of him.

We had plowed through the fear, and emerged on the other side with the realization that Joey was still Joey. He hadn't changed. We had. Why had we been afraid? Because so much was unknown, and people who were supposed to be helping us were actively blocking us, fighting us, making it difficult to get Joey help, for us to get help. We wanted to help others get through the fear, fortify themselves with information, and share our experience. Don't other people get tired of reinventing the wheel all the time?  What we discovered after a while was a network of other folks, and we have soaked up your experiences and knowledge to help us help Joey and Andy. Today, Joey can ask questions and initiate conversation. He reads and writes and lets us know what he needs. Andy is about to start kindergarten. Both boys are toilet trained, screaming is not the primary form of communication, and we are saying goodbye to old friends like Oobi and Blue's Clues... my boys are growing up! And to you guys: thank you.  I may not be a big, wide-read, famous blog, but I think we are achieving our purpose: a comfy corner to take a breath, shed the fear (and the exhaustion), and know we are all here having our favorite beverage of choice on the comfy couches. We're pleased and honored to have you here. And today- have some cake and ice cream, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/05/happy-blogiversary-to-me.html", "title": "\nHappy Blogiversary to me\n"},

I hope this series has provided useful info to get a range of information and approaches to autism (whether you agree with all those approaches or not, it is good to know about them). You may have noticed that I focused more on sites and information about and by autistic people, information about education strategies and organizations, and support materials. This does, of course, reveal my own views and biases.  I have one more for you before we move on to Disability Awareness Day.  The  Organization for Autism Research  is not about finding cures, but providing information about education and services, statistical information, and treatments. Again, you may or may not agree with everything on the site, but it does have useful information, and lots of things to think about.  Autism is part of our lives. For each and every one of us, autism is a fact. We are autistic, our child(ren) is autistic, our cousins, our friends, our neighbors, our extended families- somewhere in that milieu, there is an autistic person. It is important that we gain understanding of autism and accept autistic people, just as we would want to be understood and accepted: with respect, with love, and with joy.  Happy Autism Awareness Month.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.researchautism.org/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/04/are-you-aware-xxvii.html", "title": "\nAre You Aware?

{"date": "Monday, May 11, 2009", "body": "\nMyth 5:  All autistic people take everything very literally. Consequently, they have trouble with imagination.     I have been recently introduced to two very interesting new characters. The first is a small white bear named Gyp, who likes to drive trucks. Today, Gyp was trying to go to  Mystery Island . We went to the park, and at our park there is a rock outcrop, and Joey decided that was Mystery island. He spent the afternoon with Gyp in a truck trying to race to Mystery Island (running back and forth between the playground and the outcropping).    The other we met just this week: Gravy Dillider. I have our first Gravy Dillider story for you, as soon as I get the illustration scanned in to share. No imagination? Um....  Myth 4:  Autistic people don't talk. If they talk, they they have Asperger's Syndrome.      Asperger's Syndrome is an ASD. In other words, people with Asperger's Syndrome are autistic. However, it is more than just a distinction of language use. A person with a diagnosis of \"classic autism\" doesn't suddenly become \"Asperger's Syndrome\" if they start to talk. In fact, Joey had some language when he received his diagnosis. In fact, one of the hallmarks of Asperger's is normal language development- and one cannot turn the clock back and say Joey has had \"normal language development\" of any kind, even as his language skills emerge and we start playing catch-up. There is such a thing as a verbal autistic person.  Myth 3:  Autistic people do not want contact with other people, they prefer to be alone, or they are anti-social.     I seriously doubt autistic people are any more likely to dislike being around people than anyone else. They may have more trouble expressing themselves in a manner that invites social connection by non-autistics, they may have issues with social skills and maintaining conversation, but that's not the same as not wanting to be around people. (Just like not being able to speak doesn't mean you have nothing to say).     Joey is extremely social, and loves other people. He likes have other kids around, he likes playing with other kids, and he likes knowing lots of people. Joey loves everyone.  Myth 2: A utistic people are savants- what they lack in communication and social skills, they make up for in wonderful gifts.     The idea that autistic people are all like  Rainmain  remains strong in the popular imagination. I get asked a lot what Joey's \"special gift\" is. Joey has strengths and weaknesses, like other children. His weaknesses happen to be more visible than other people's, and get in the way of his ability to function and communicate. His strengths help him overcome his weaknesses, and give him talents to enjoy and share- just like everyone else. The older Andy gets, the more I realize how true this is- both of my boys have strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes Joey's strengths are also more noticeable, because his weaknesses are so noticeable, and the contrast becomes striking, like a  Caravaggio  in a world full of  Raphaels . As yet, Joey has not shown himself to be particularly a savant, but he is a very smart and very talented person, and I'm definitely keen to discover what other talents await to unfold.  Myth 1:  Autistic people have no sense of humor. (Often this is connected to a lack of social awareness).     Yes Joey has difficulty with jokes. It isn't because he doesn't enjoy them; he has trouble with the subtleties of language required to tell one. However, Joey loves being silly and funny and jokes that aren't language-heavy. Well, perhaps even that is a myth. One of the teachers at school discovered I was Joey's mom and launched into a wonderful story: She encountered Joey in the hall. He's usually such a sunny, happy kid, but that day he was grumpy and making a terrible face (one of his Pinky Dinky Doo frowns, which are quite dramatic-looking). She asked, \"Joey! Where's your smile?\" He replied, in his grumpiest voice, \"Not here!\"     She met him later that day. He looked up, saw her, smiled like a Cheshire Cat... and pointed at the smile with both hands, to let her know his smile was back.  Myth busted. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://pbskids.org/wordworld", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/", "http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/caravaggio/", "http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/raphael/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/05/joey-mythbuster.html", "title": "\nJoey: Mythbuster\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, June 07, 2009", "body": "\nJoey has a very interesting relationship with time. In one facet, he is utterly fascinated with it. Clocks are talismans for him, totems if you will. A room without a clock can be disorienting to him. He has been telling time since he was very small, both digital and analog. He will gladly tell you if your clock is digital or analog. And if the time on it is correct or not.  In some ways, this is very understandable. Joey loves numbers. Number and clocks are predictable; the cycles of the day mostly do not change. The ebb and flow of daylight is slow enough that it doesn't put him off, except for the spring forward and fall back of time changes. Six o'clock is six o'clock every day, and it is time to eat. Analog clocks have the added bonus of moving hands that move in circles, spinning about the clock face at regular paces.  Because of his fascination with clocks, he also is a stickler for schedules. When we first realized he had a team of 15 teachers and paras at school to deal with, we were concerned he would get anxious with all the changes. The reality is that as long as Joey know where he is supposed to be when, he's good to go. He get anxious when 1:20 arrives, time to go to math, and something puts off going to math.  He has also developed an odd habit of constantly telling everyone the time. When he was very little, and someone asked him a question, he would respond with a color. \"What day is it?\" \"Red.\" \"Where is your coat?\" \"Blue.\" \"What is the capital of Sardinia?\" \"Yellow.\" \"What is the average air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?\" \"Green.\" Now, he tells you the time. \"Joey, what happened in the story we just read?\" \"It's 10:42!\" He also announces the time at (apparent) random (though I suspect he has reasons for barking out the time at that moment that we just don't understand yet). You can be going along in a lesson or conversation, and suddenly Joey will burst out, \"Look! It's three o'clock!\"  So powerful is this connection with time, I talked the tooth fairy into giving him a watch. He straps it on each morning, happy to have his little time-totem close at hand. I thought about getting him a pocket-watch instead of a wrist-watch, but I was worried about it getting lost.  Which brings us to the other facet. As much as Joey loves time, the concept of \"past\" is very difficult for him. This abstraction of time is something he struggles with, far more than kids normally do at his age. The symptoms of this lack of understanding are not all expected. Yes, he has a very difficult time with history and placing figures and events on timelines, or understanding these people are no longer walking around. However, it also means he has trouble with tense use (what is \"past tense\" to a child with no grasp of \"past\"?), trouble recalling events of the day, trouble connecting consequences with actions.  We have been working on this by showing him lots of movies and books of himself in the past. Showing him baby pictures, old video clips, clothes he used to wear. Our next step is to increase exposure to pictures of me, JoeyAndyDad, and Grandma in the past, when we were children, etc. If he can grasp that Mommy was once a little girl, we can start working back from there.  The idea of a past-less existence is one of the more difficult things in trying to understand Joey and his views of the world, at least for me. I suppose as an art historian, the idea of having no history is very strange. I know many cultures did and don't have an idea of historicity, the past is unimportant, the future is no significant, because the now is eternal; but that is not my own culture. We live in a world where Barbie dolls are kept \"mint in the box\" to be collector's items, instead of given to kids to play with and be destroyed by use. Nostalgia is a marketing tool.  With his close affinity to time, we hope we can use it as a tool to understand \"past.\" Then we can move into the idea of \"Once upon a time\"... well, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/06/time.html", "title": "\nTime\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, June 16, 2009", "body": "\nWhen I went to pick up Joey a couple Tuesdays ago from school, his para was coming out of the school with a beautiful surprise: her absolutely beautiful grandchild. And the news that she was going to be taking custody of this gorgeous little girl, and needed things like a crib and a highchair and... well, baby stuff.  My basement and attic are stuffed to the gills with baby stuff. My guys were well-loved, well-cared for, and fully outfitted. Heck, I have three cribs.  Three . See, not only were they fully outfitted, they were fully outfitted in two homes, because when Joey was very little and we thought I was headed back to work, he spent a lot of time at Grandma's while I did the Visiting Professor thing. And then Joey wasn't  quite  out of his crib with Andy came. My wonderful cousin also gave me a lot of things from her own twins, and those things often came in twos. We have a  lot  of baby stuff.  I kept most of it because I always thought there would be a third. When Andy was revealed as a boy, it was just part of the plan- that whole \"try for a girl\" thing (what? Have I never heard of \"My Three Sons\"?). Well, really, just to have that third baby, that new little one, another round of fresh baby head and powder and tiny little clothes and strollers. (No, I didn't forget about diapers and spit up and crying and potty training and being up at all hours of the night. But it was all worth it.) And that baby was going to be a girl, I just knew it. (Of course, I \"just knew it\" with Andy, too. Nevermind.) I saved the few girl things we got at Joey's baby showers. I have a small box somewhere in the attic with Holly Hobbie plaques to put on her wall, to \"girl it up\" a little. I have some mermaid fabrics to make her a quilt and maybe a bumper.  And she's not coming.  I sit now in a sea of baby equipment, sorting through bins of baby clothes. I have a small sack of things I just can't get rid of yet. I know I am missing another box of clothes somewhere, there are too many outfits I haven't seen. I have a huge bin of things to take to Ms. Macy- sheets, towels, clothes, cloth diapers (which make great burp clothes), books, toys. I have a bunch of equipment in the van to take. So I say goodbye to these things, and to the little one who never came, and never was. Perhaps it is an easy thing to be in love with a person who never existed, because they can be anything you wanted them to be. They can be all the smiles and firsts and little soft heads, without the diapers and the sleeplessness and the spit. Yet it is stillhard to say goodbye, when you never really got to say hello.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/06/saying-goodbye-to-little-one-who-never.html", "title": "\nSaying Goodbye to the Little One Who Never Was\n"},

This is great, because whenever we have more sign, we get more speech. This time, Joey has been proudly showing me his signs, and the boys are singing some of the songs. Andy was all excited to see Rachel signing \"candy\" again. Joey has been chattier, even after school.  More chat is always a good thing. Even if it devolves into chanting, its all processing and language, and that means we're prepping for a leap forward. It also suggests that his ESY program is going well; when Joey is depressed, he is not interested in moving forward and learning things.

Just the idle breath of this word sends my children into spasms.  The word is \"quickly.\"  This well-known casual prompt to keep young children from dillying and dallying brings on utter panic to Joey. The world is racing past, time goes into warp, and like the  White Rabbit , we will now be Late! It is 8:42am, and we need to leave the house at 8:45 to get Andy to camp. Joey discovers he has no pockets to stash his mini-clock.  \"No pockets!\" he complains, slapping the sides of his legs where pockets ought to be in any shorts sold for young boys. But Walmart begs to differ. \"No pockets!\" There is a glisten in his eyes, a strain in his voice-  this will not do . I try to think fast, while trying to gather up the things Andy will need at camp and find my shoes, which have mysteriously walked away from the front hall.  \"Well, run upstairs and change into another pair of shorts, then, quickly!\" The last slips from my lips involuntarily. If I could have, I would have reached out and snatched the word back and jammed it down my own throat. But it is too late.

Quickly! \" upstairs as I manage to get Andy into his flip-flops and out the door.  \"Come on, Joey,\" I call encouragingly, resulting in more frantic chanting of \" Quickly! Quickly! \" He appears at the top of the stairs, holding another pair of shorts, this one a pair of converted boxers- he is particularly fond of them, but they also have no pockets. \" Quickly! \" he squeals at me plaintively.  I avert the meltdown by coaxing him down the stairs and helping him into these new shorts, without mentioning they do no have pockets, nor does he have his clock. Fortunately, his watch is strapped tightly to his wrist. This would have taken a lot less time if I had just stopped and instead of using The Word, had gone upstairs to help him with his clothes.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2009", "body": "\nIn an attempt to get the boys to relax, and give me a minute to just enjoy watching them being themselves while taking a big breath, I wandered out to Grandma's house (that would be my mom's) with boys. Actually, it was a bit of a hectic morning, unexpectedly; my classes were all up in the air again, and I had to go straighten it out. I also had Andy's stuff to straighten out. Things are clicking along on all fronts again. (Yay!) So, breathing. It's a Good Thing.  Mom took Andy with her, and I went to get Joey off the bus. Another surprise- one of Joey's beloved (and practically new) crocs got broken at school. Joey doesn't do broken. He perseverates on it to anxiety meltdown. Just what I really didn't want. So we popped into a shop that fortunately had a pair in his size on sale. Disaster averted.  We then scooped up some Happy Meals (the boys love teenie beanies, and its the last day), and off to Grandma's we toodled, to slide on her big blow-up water slide and Sit. Down.  Blowing up the big slide is always an adventure. It is too heavy for us to move around, so once it is set up, there it stays. I pull the motor through a window (it can't stay out because- get this-  it can't get wet .) Then I hook everything up, and turn on the switch. As it inflates, I chase the  spiders  off, and rescue several with my famous Spider Rescue Stick. (the only spiders I believe in killing around here are black widows. I don't like them in my house, but spiders eat other bugs like biting flies and roaches). Anyway, as I am rescuing a particularly large spider, Joey is saying, \"snake! I see a snake!\"  (How many of you just found yourself clinging to the ceiling?) Grandma and I took a few minutes to see it ourselves, but there it was- I had practically stepped on it putting up the pool. Now with all the noise and bother of the search, it was poised for self-defense. A small, brown, diamond-mottled snake, with a swollen head... hearts stopped. Praise of Joey commenced. But I was now trapped in the pool with a long stick and a measure of distance as my only defense. Yes, folks, Joey had just saved us pain, agony, and possibly his and his brother's lives.  It was a  copperhead .  We got the boys back to the porch, and I managed to get the pool turned off. But now we had a copperhead to deal with. When I was young, we didn't see many copperheads around my house, because there was plenty of space for them elsewhere and we nurtured the company of large black  ratsnakes , who eat copperhead hatchlings, and black  kingsnakes , who eat copperheads. With all the clearing around here (why do people buy wooded lots, then cut down all the trees???), the copperheads are being driven this way, and the old kingsnake that used to hang out around the garden hasn't been seen in a while. I hadn't seen a live copperhead in quite some time. I wasn't enjoying it now. Especially one eyeing me and my stick that look of \"jab me with that thing again, you idiot, and I'm going to show you exactly how long I am!\"  Sorry, herpatologists out there, but to me, copperheads are the same category as black widow spiders. They are beautiful. And the must  DIE . But as mom as I stared at this little snake, an he glared back at us, we were at a loss. I've never killed a snake. Its not like a little spider that you toss a shoe at. If I get it wrong, I could be in  big trouble . We found a little grasscutter blade tool thingy, but the handle was only four feet long. And it was looking right at me. With that look. You could almost hear it say, \"Go ahead, idiot. Make. My. Day.\" And mom was reinforcing the fact that it really, really needed to  join the Choir Invisible . Maybe even  pine for fjords.  She was right. As I said before. DIE. DIE. DIE.  And there it was. To get a good swing in, I'd probably have to chop off part of the pool, and it's position under a bench attached to the garden wall meant I would be at a very odd angle.  \"Mom,\" I said, \"we can't do this.\"  In other words... bokbokbokbokbok! I'm a chicken. No, wait, we're  both  chickens.  Yes, the snake was allowed to live. And the boys were not allowed to play in the pool. And we have our handy blade tool thingy close to hand, waiting for Round Two: Death of the Snake.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://entoplp.okstate.edu/ddd/insects/wolfspider.htm", "http://www.snakesandfrogs.com/scra/snakes/copperh.htm", "http://fwie.fw.vt.edu/VHS/reptiles/snakes/eastern-ratsnake/blackrat_snake.htm", "http://fwie.fw.vt.edu/VHS/reptiles/snakes/eastern-black-kingsnake/eastern_black_kingsnake.htm", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npjOSLCR2hE", "http://orangecow.org/pythonet/pet-shop.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/08/two-big-chickens-in-afternoon.html", "title": "\nTwo Big Chickens in the Afternoon\n"},

The. Place. And today I got smacked with, \"well, kids act differently at school that at home...\" No kidding! But I just spent yesterday morning explaining that when I pick up the child at noon, he is NON-FUNCTIONAL for at least twenty minutes- you cannot speak or make any noise in the car, or he completely melts down. What is he going to do after lunch in a couple of weeks? So they want something from his teacher from last year, to prove this stuff effects him at school. The teacher I've been telling them would regularly answer the question, \"How is he?\" with \"I don't know\" because she had another kid in there that was not getting OT and stuff and needed a lot more attention. To her credit, she did go in to school to fill out the last form I had sent over. And the clear statement: without this new form, he doesn't qualify for service in the eyes of the school psychologist.  What does this tell me? I have provided them with letters from a psychiatrist and his occupational therapist, both stating that this child needs support (and the OT even gave recommendation for what support would be helpful.) And they mean to the school exactly Diddly Over Squat. Somehow, this looks really familiar to me. Oh, yeah, they like to ignore my private professionals. After all, they're school folks. Until we can prove that a regular environment is inappropriate, it's appropriate.  Um... huh?  So, like, you can put a child into an inappropriate placement until it is proven inappropriate?  Well, until you are actually in the system under IDEA, the answer is apparently, \"yes indeedy!\" So what do you do? Make the school deal with him for a couple of months and see if you don't end up right back at the eligibility table? Because we are very probably looking at one of the school folks fighting us, and we know what happens when school folks fight you at eligibility. Remember, consensus must be reached.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 01, 2009", "body": "\nWe're back from Eligibility. Special education is a funny thing. You have to provide huge amounts of evidence, and missing a single piece can mean the whole process is derailed, especially if the problem is not academics, but Everything Else.  IDEA is now supposed to cover \"functional skills\"- a child's ability to participate in a classroom environment with his peers. It is not supposed to be just grade-based. There are many facets to education; you can get all the answers right, and not be able to button your coat or handle the group dynamics, and you should be able to get help to be successful and learn the skills you need to do these things. However, it is far easier to prove an academic problem before hand. It tends to show up on their lovely little standardized tests with nice, neat little numbers to measure.  Having a highly intelligent child complicate things. A child who compensates in a 1:1 setting during testing to come into the \"normal\" range may actually be able to display real giftedness if given the appropriate accommodations. But how do you prove it? How do you prove a child will have trouble in a classroom until they are actually in one? Do you have to allow a child to fail before providing them with the help they need to succeed?  According to the school, you do.  We had evidence of problems ahead. We had a strongly worded diagnosis and letter from our psychiatrist. We had recommendations and information about Andy in group situations and the problems he had from an occupational therapist who has worked with him for three years. We filled out forms about the behaviors we were seeing at home. It came down to Andy's  teacher from last year .  You remember, the one who was teaching her first class ever? And her opinion of Andy's behavior based her experience of... one class. In a group of 18 children.  Since her scores all came out \"normal\", we have no evidence that ADHD is impacting Andy in the classroom. Well, except for the OT's notes. And the psychiatrist's experience.  So we have to let him loose on a teacher and a class with no accommodations for the start of school.  It's not all bad news. His teacher, Mrs. B, was in the meeting, as was Mrs. Huff, so she's well-warned. She also got a look at him (she let us go see her classroom), so she has some idea what we're in for. She does email. We already have the next meeting scheduled, because the  guidance counselor  looked around the table and made it clear that her prognosis was we would be returning to the table within weeks. The roadblock was exactly where we knew it would be.  I still have a massive headache from the lack of logic and sense here. What is the point of having committees and real people talking about a child, with a child clearly in need of support, if they can't give that child service due to a first-time teacher in a completely different setting can't fill out a form accurately?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/09/proving-it-before-fact.html", "title": "\nProving it before the fact\n"},

Joey's didn't (he's been barking when anxious [pretending to be Scud from Toy Story] and he barked in the library.) Week one hasn't been too bad. We had some bus issues that are resolving. Andy is enjoying riding his own bus. I ran into the special ed teacher that services the IEP kids in Andy's class, and she thinks he's doing great, following all the rules. that's a good sign. What I had to tell her is oh, by the way, he hasn't eaten his breakfast all week. We talked a lot about how Andy's breakfast is in the frog bag, but by the time he gets to school with all the excitement and distraction, he forgets. I think. I'd packed his favorite strawberry rolls in the bag and told him they are in there and everything, trying to get him to eat it. No go.  We're trying to find a rhythm, and get into the groove, as quick as we can, because the quicker the better.  I've had a shower every day this week since school started. Very weird.  I got to go see a friend this morning and have tea. Tomorrow we're going to write a cookbook together. Tomorrow afternoon, when my mom has an errand of her own, I'm going to call another friend I haven't talked to in a while because everything has been so insane. Its going to be a real event!  And look, I can see the floor in the hallway and the counter in the kitchen! I have had some kind of meal prepared for two of the three school nights! (Though I burned Tuesday's dinner- eep). It's amazing. Incredible.  I miss squishing my boys all day, though. When they hop of their buses, I just want to squeeze and smooch them. And all they want is something to eat and to go play outside. We compromise. They play, and stop in for smooch breaks.

{"date": "Saturday, September 05, 2009", "body": "\n There is no denying it, we've been having adventures all over, ad I have had little time to write about them. But allow me to back up, and first tackle the best of the best: the Beach.  The beach is something of a give-and-take. Joey loves the beach. He loves the water. He loves the waves. He loves the pool. He loves getting on rides and eating ice cream and popcorn and getting lots of attention from Mom and Dad and Grandma. However, he has just the vaguest suggestion of schedule. Everything around him is new, different, unfamiliar. He doing different things, seeing different people, eating different foods. It can be very overwhelming, especially if he decides he doesn't like what he is doing, seeing, or eating.  To mitigate some of these issues, we brought toys, books,  linens, and favorite clothes from home. Oh, and movies. Mom got the boys these great personal dvd players (only one of them stopped working almost right away- Fisher Price isn't what it used to be), so we have movies for them to watch, which made life easier on all of us.  There is nothing quite so wonderful as watching Joey in the ocean. He takes such delight in it! So I surprised that, when given the choice, he wanted to be in the pool. Perhaps being able to be deeper in the water, the calm water perhaps, is attractive; but there is still the sea, in constant motion. Joey spends too many of his days in a state of anxiety and stress, trying to learn, trying to do what he needs to do, and struggling to do it. To relax and just be a little boy- what a breath I hope it is for him.  Sheer joy is what you see in boys at the beach. Of course, they each have their own ways and likes. Andy prefers games. Joey prefers rides. Andy likes an evening darting in the surf in search of shells, Joey prefers bobbing in the pool. To each their own, and it is available to them, at their own leisure.  It was, all in all, a beautiful week of boys, and sand, and crabs, and games, and lights, and feeding the gulls. May we all have such moments in our lives, reminders of what we all work so hard for.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SqKkJeaJQcI/AAAAAAAAC9k/9FiG1_pa42Y/s1600-h/07_boys_onboat.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SqKkIz94T0I/AAAAAAAAC9c/fm4iLsbA8v4/s1600-h/02_boys_breaker.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SqKjt_iBaWI/AAAAAAAAC9U/uFIbCZbmiog/s1600-h/14_boys_birds.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SqKjti2BrxI/AAAAAAAAC9M/qk1NJqkmYPs/s1600-h/15_andy_frogs.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SqKjtBIf_GI/AAAAAAAAC9E/SFe1q11Wjkg/s1600-h/05_joey_rollercoaster.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SqKjs0dLScI/AAAAAAAAC88/H1UNSN3dKO0/s1600-h/05_boys_boardwalk.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SqKjsfk1xsI/AAAAAAAAC80/EJOZK3Y4J9o/s1600-h/06_boys_sand.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/09/water-water.html", "title": "\nWater Water\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, September 27, 2009", "body": "\nWhen we concluded Andy's eligibility meeting, we already set a date for returning to eligibility. We had a psychiatrist who was so sure he needed an IEP to address his focus, hyperactivity, and sensory issues that she wrote a letter on the spot and lectured me about how I needed to get him in the system and how had I let him go this long without intervention? We had OT recommendations based on the work done with him for two years, with strategies to help him focus and remain on-task and self-regulate. And we had a first-year teacher who said he was just fine. The school psychologist thought he was just fine. The guidance counselor did not. I'm still working on the letter where we note that a gifted student who scores \"normal\" is having educational performance issues. But I digress.  We are three weeks in. Andy has been behaving himself at school. No timeouts. Treasure Box every three days, right on schedule. I went to the school picnic, and he sat outside in the midst of the kids and actually ate food without getting up once (though he did cling and insist on being hugged tightly). We have had all good days, sunshine, roses, and fun.  Well, at school, anyway.  Once home, we have to be doing very physical activities, or he starts in on Joey. Since I don't want Joey to become a technicolor display of shades of purple, fading to yellow, I have been getting that physicality channeled as best I can. Trucks, trampolines, running, jumping. Homework is a neat trick. We had one good day. The rest have been like asking him to stick bamboo under his fingernails, with level 5 meltdowns. I cleared my kitchen table to be sure they had space to do work, and put together a \"homework kit\" so I have everything we might need close to hand (crayons, pencils, glue, paper, sharpener...) because sitting down to do the work is bad enough; if they have to be put off while I find the crayons or the pencil sharpener, I might as well forget it. I have also discovered I sometimes need to have things for Joey to do, as he often doesn't have homework (he does it at school while waiting for the bus). You just never know.  Then we work on winding down, except Tuesday, when we have speech therapy for Joey. Then we have to go see Ms. Leslie. OT is on hold right now. For Joey, social skills groups don't start for another week, and our therapist is now only in Stafford, and we can't just schedule him through her any more, we have to go through the receptionist, and the less said about that the better. Let's just say I know I owe them money, but I have no idea how much, because the bills make no sense whatsoever, and when I ask about it she \"sends me the ledger\" which makes even less sense, and still doesn't total up what I actually owe. I've never had a medical place who couldn't tell me what I actually owe, or have it in big letters on the bottom of the statement (ie, WRITE THE CHECK FOR THIS MUCH AND WE'RE ALL GOOD.) She keeps telling me the number on this bill is that, but it doesn't match up with the payments I've made, and I now know from experience that I usually actually owe them more than this says I owe, for reasons beyond me. And the bill for Andy from them makes even less sense.  But hey, he's doing fine at school. Everything is peachy. I bet we get to the meeting on the 8th and get told he's just fine, nothing to see here. Then what do I do? Whenever I mention that we are having increased problems at home, they all smile and say things like, \"well, kids need to unwind some time!\" and \"oh, what kid likes homework?\"  I was unaware that most kids screamed, hit you, and ran off when you asked them to sit and do a coloring page from school, or trace their name. Nor was I aware that this was \"unwinding.\" Do all kids become violent, aggressive, and hoardy when they get home from school? I mean, the trying to eat me out of house and home I understand. The wanting to watch TV, I get that. Even the pushing the trucks or jumping on the trampoline, fine. Even the whining about and lashing out at the brother. But is the Witching Hour really so universal? Is this normal, and I just suck as a parent?  I am pondering what to do when I get told he is doing just fine and wonderful and get those looks of \"what's wrong with you, Lady? You just wanted somethin' fer nuthin' and to abuse the system!\" Should I cancel the psychiatrist appointment? I mean, why medicate him or anything like that if he's doing so fine and this is all normal? Should I put him more OT, if he's doing just fine at school and they don't think he needs service? After all, the insurance is being weird about paying (or more precisely, NOT paying). I could put that money toward more speech therapy or OT for Joey, or put Andy into nature classes through the rec center or something like that. They have drawing classes for his age group on Wednesday nights, or painting on Thursdays. And then there is Joey. Talk about Anxiety Mess. The barking is really causing trouble. I went to his picnic, too. He was with a different teacher than i was told he was eating lunch with, and then this teacher told me he'd be having math and core with her, but I was told he was doing that with someone else. Have they changed him again? In a sea of kids, he was eating alone. If I hadn't been there, it would have been completely alone- even his friend D sat with his back to him. The other kids clearly were unused to Joey, and comments like \"he's the strange kid that barks\" could be plainly heard (and were repeated that afternoon after school). Being a dog also means he is getting those teeth out and in trouble more. He likes to bite my shirt. He got upset about some toys this morning, and when JoeyAndyDad tried to hug him and help calm him down, Joey bit him so hard there's a bruise (which then progressed into a Level 8). The sibling thing isn't helping. Andy tries to get him to play, and he doesn't want to play, so Andy pokes him or hits him, so he hits or bites Andy, who of course slugs him back... you get the picture. Trying to keep them separated is a real trick, because despite all that, they love each other and want to see each other (its a sibling thing). Getting in the car is an adventure in screaming and the back-and-forth beating on each other. Not good for the nerves of a child who is having school stress, too.  I'm glad we got to the fair. Yes, there is stress in being out of schedule, and the long ride, and all the excitement. We had Andy crying because the barns were dark and the midway was loud (complete with hands clamped over ears). We had Joey nervous about  the ride he got on last year and didn't like  (which, just to note, was  not  there this year). But there was also rabbits, ducks, chickens, turkeys, geese (or as Andy insisted, giant ducks), cows, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, pumpkins, gourds, crafts, games, and rides. Oh, and ice cream.  I just don't think its normal to declare a victory when you can distract your kids for almost an hour by having one do a simple scratch-through craft and getting the other one a new book about his latest obsession, before they start in on the screaming, biting, hitting, and more screaming (not squealing or just running around playing loudly-  screaming ). Is it?  This week, I'm planning on getting out the pirate stuff, and see if I can't get that explosive energy at least  channeled .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/09/three-weeks-in.html", "title": "\nThree Weeks In\n"},

This has resulted in two new Treasures: a frog and Smiley Happy Guy. SHG is a yellow bendy figure with a vague similarity to a Walmart nightmare, only with more character.  Joey also has bee collecting treasures, the most interest he has shown in toys in a long time. Yes, he still has his totems, but these seem to be toys being used to actually play, which is great. He has gotten into small stuffed animals, especially of dogs and cats, and he enjoys naming them. The current favorite is a small brown beanie baby he is calling Stybirde. Yes, thats how he spells it. He likes to stroke Stybirde's whiskers and when he's being a dog, Stybirde gets growled at a lot- because hey, its a cat! Both of these treasures were missing this morning.  Now, to add to the disaster, I am sick. No fever, but coughing, hacking, sneezing, stuffed sinuses, sweat whenever I move SICK. Everybody else in the house seems to be getting over this; here I sit. Since we have no therapies or anything today. and I don't teach today (well, I have online office hours later), I called a personal National Holiday, with my daily goals being to Eat Ice Cream, Get Rest, Take A Nap (which I have not, as of writing this, accomplished), and.... find two missing toys.  I searched the house, and despaired when neither toys appeared before I started dripping sweat everywhere, which wasn't very long. Then it hit me: such popular toys would surely have made it to the car! So in great glee, i snatched up my keys, and headed out to the car.  Nope.  I made their beds, because they often take such small treasures to bed, only to lose them amid the pillows and wadded sheets.  Nope.  I swept up all the toys hiding under their beds. No sign of the ones we wanted. I checked around my own bedroom, in case they brought them when they crept into bed this morning. Nothing.  It was during my second sweep of the downstairs that I noticed a small treasure chest, tucked discretely in a piece of furniture that is supposed to be a wine bar, but for now just holds a lamp. The chest and the table were the same color, so I was lucky to see it at all. I opened it.  No, they weren't in there. But the frog was. And that meant Andy had played here in the last few days. Sure enough, under the wine bar, I swept my hand, and out came Smiley Happy Guy and Stybirde.  And I so totally rock.

And then they come home, and the Witching Hour commences. Immediately. Without any baby preliminaries.  See, the trouble with holding your breath all day is that at some point, you need to breathe. In fact, you gasp for air, and try to take deeper breaths than normal to make up for the lost oxygen. He comes home and starts flippery-flopping around like a beached fish. It isn't pretty.  The first few days, I had him play with his trucks out front, but now he refuses to do that; he wants to come inside and arrange his stuffed animals and watch  Peep . Well, he has to do homework first. Doing homework after any of these activities was not working, so now, homework first. The Firecracker becomes all sparks and fire. He's ready for some air, and has to hold his breath a little longer. But if I give him air, he doesn't want to hold his breath again even for a minute.  Meanwhile, our words of the week are \"idiot\" and \"stupid.\" Joey picked these up from  Toy Story , and now uses them to amuse himself. Andy has now realized they are powerful words, too. Whenever some one asks them to do something, or tells them something they don't want to hear, that person is stupid. And an idiot. And each other? Stupid idiots. If you reprimand or correct Joey? He says he's a \"stupid boy.\" These words may have to be banned.  I think I may go for a new strategy tomorrow. Boys home, offer pushing of trucks, and if that is a no-go, I'm going to have invented a game that involves the trampoline. A few minutes of bouncing and a light snack, to be followed by homework.

{"date": "Thursday, October 22, 2009", "body": "\nWe had our department meeting tonight for one of the college I work for- the kind of meeting where everybody sits around and complains about students not doing any work and trying to figure out how to trick them into having to do some. I got a rather rude awakening to the future in this banter, as many of the students who were considered \"problems\" were disabled students- some documented, some not. The excuse for not wanting to deal with these kids? \"We're not trained to do that!\"  Disability accommodation requires everyone involved to be proactive. This means that people need to do more work, and nobody- especially a bunch of adjuncts who get paid next to nothing- wants to take on more work. However, it's a whole breakdown of communication and reversion to reactive tactics: the disabled person doesn't want to admit disability due to stigma, real or perceived; the disability office needs to contact faculty who will be teaching a person with a disability to make sure accommodations can be and are made; and the faculty needs to be proactive in requests and getting training and support for accommodating disabled students. Community college faculty are especially in need of support, and the community college setting is often inclusion admission, and seen as a \"safer\" environment for disabled students. Students can stay at home with familiar resources and services, while still furthering their education.  Naturally, I opened my big, fat mouth, and started in on \"you know, there are some very simple things we can do to accommodate these students which don't require any real training...\" Things like turning off florescent lights and keep noise to a minimum never occurred to these people. Letting students sit in the front row, allowing for movement breaks, and visual schedules? So simple,  if  you know they are needful. Why they can't include real accommodations on those silly letters we get from the disability office (I think if you have any kind of disability, they just give you a letter to excuse you from timed tests, and send you on your way. Who needs individualization, after all?) Why are faculty, most of whom have never had to deal with disability in their own lives, left to flap in the wind- and thus leaving those students flapping, too?  Mobilizing to change attitudes here. \"We're not trained!\" is not an excuse to not accommodate; it is a call for action to get trained.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/10/glimpse-of-future.html", "title": "\nGlimpse of the Future\n"},

Unfortunately, goldfish was not what I was planing to have. I was thinking of some smaller, less territorial fish. But goldfish is what we have. And goldfish get big, they are highly territorial, and if they get pissed off at each other, they tend to chew each other's fins off. So I woke up one morning to discover Quille basically had no tail fin, and his dorsal fin severely munched.  I made some changes. I don't have a second tank. I have been keeping the water superlatively clean, and I re-arranged the stuff in it so that Quille can hide in the fake plats and get away from Chris. However, the damage is done. Quille's tail and fin are healing, but I doubt they will ever fully recover. Also, the injuries were severe enough that he was a pretty sick fish, and so Chris has now well outstripped him in size. Quille is looking better, but he's smaller than Chris. Hence Quille's ability to hide in the plants and avoid his nemesis.  Yesterday, Joey noticed.  We were watching the fish, when Joey started insisting that Chris was Quille. With the kind of odd, since he knows the two fish and can tell them apart, or at least he always had before. When corrected, he frowned.  \"My fish is small. Quille is the smallest fish ever. He is small, small, smaller.\" We began a spiral into the depths, and just before school is not a good time. So I put on my mommypants and tried to talk about it while we put ourselves together, while we walked to the bus, while we waited.  Yes, Quille was smaller. He had been sick, but now he was better.  Nope, that wouldn't do.  I reminded him that fish do not live long. We talked about acceptance of others as they are, about Nemo and Gil and their fin issues, and what it meant to love a pet or anybody- just as they are, not as we wish they were.  But Quille was still small, small, small and Joey was still upset, upset, upset.  And then I remembered watching the fish darting around the tank that morning. You would think a bigger fish with a bigger tail would win that race, but our little Quille is a tough little fish.  \"Well, because Quille is smaller, he is faster than Chris. And he hides better.\"  \"My fish is faster?\"  \"Yes. Quille is faster, because he is smaller.\"  \"My fish is the fastest!\"  On to the bus he went, quite happy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/11/goldfish-lessons.html", "title": "\nGoldfish Lessons\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, November 08, 2009", "body": "\nA little boy comes creep-creeping into my room. Beside me, JoeyAndyDad snores lightly. My feet are covered by a warm kitteh. The boy crawls up onto my bed and flops in the narrow gap between me and JoeyAndyDad, created when I rolled to see who was creeping in- as if I didn't know. I cover him with the quilt, and he snuggles down with the half-dozen stuffed toys he has brought with him, and his beloved and now-repaired Blankie. I can feel his ribs. He's just grown again, so he's thin as a rail. He sighs. He's asleep.  Its three in the morning. Or maybe two. I have to get up, or fall off the bed. Besides, I need to toddle to the bathroom.  I return to find a boy spread out comfortably in my spot. He's resting, I won't disturb him. I take up my new regular position, reclined in JoeyAndyDad's big recliner, swathed in a quilt. I roll some of it under my chin so my mouth won't hang open if I fall asleep, and dry out my mouth and throat. I have enough trouble with my voice this time of year.  Note the \"if.\" Now my brain is whirling. I try to derail it, pulling up a fiction story I've been toying with, one of the ones that never really get anywhere, because I am not terribly good at writing stories all the way through. My characters are too flat to get far. Perhaps its because the live ones in my life are so intensely interesting. My brain catches on one drama, and what might happen. It swirls to another. It follows a detail of it to thinking about school, about my own students, about some situations here, some there. I'm spinning wheels.  The alarm goes off. That's JoeyAndyDad's alarm. It is five o'clock? or six? I forget. I hope the time has come so quickly because I drifted off somewhere in the spinning. JoeyAndyDad climbs over me, trying not to wake either or the boy or me. He starts his routine. I hear my other boy creep in, climb into bed next to Andy. He's whispering to himself. I catch a few words, he's echoing an episode of  Peep . I listen to the little voice, hoping again to drift off for the remaining... hour? Whatever.  The alarm goes off again. It's time to get up.  I fold the chair, remove the warm quilt, rise to my feet. JoeyAndyDad is still in his routine. I start mine, kissing boys who are awake, or letting them sleep is they are not. Today, they are awake. Andy giggles and makes silly faces. Joey repeats a phrase. Neither make any clear sense, other than being something to say. I sing to them, kiss them, tickle them.  Then it is time to get dressed. I take my meds, check my sugar, check my weight. The scale is going in the right direction, but slowly. I get ready, get dressed, get boys into the bathroom to dress and prepare themselves. A circus of boy-ness ensues, but we're through and dressed in clothes in about fifteen minutes, not bad at all. Having a new clothes organizer for each other them has definitely sped up the process. We tumble down the stairs. JoeyAndyDad has managed to escape to work without me seeing him, because his car is gone.  I track down socks and set the boys to the task of putting on their shoes. I toss food into their bags; breakfast, lunch, snack. I make sure homework is in the folders, along with needed money, forms, etc. Joey helps me feed the cats. I feed the fish. I'm not sure Quille is looking so good, but have no idea what to do for him. I ponder what to tell Joey if we find him bottom-up one morning. They have already lived longer than I expected.  I get coats on two boys, between the three of us we get them zipped up, bookbags on backs, and we're off to the bus stop. The boys run to the corner, then wait. We cross and are joined by other families. They talk about things with no relevance to us, after-school care and sports and sleepovers. The bus arrives, with Joey's bus now right behind it, because the schedule has changed again. I wave to both boys, and they are whisked away into their own worlds.  I am on the corner, the families drifting back to their own lives, or huddled together with me outside. We say goodbye, I walk back to the house. Today, I have about an hour and a half before I have to head out. I do some cleaning. I was doing painting, but its getting too cold for that. I take a shower. I check my lectures, make sure my memory stick is in my pocket. My brain is already on today's lecture. I think of small corrections I need to make, ideas they will need to connect to other material, problems in the new textbook. I pop A Christmas Carol into the CD player in the car, and whirl off. I hear some of the story, formulate some of the lecture in my head,  but most of my concentration is the driving, the swift see-and-ID-and-gone of moving down the road. I note landmarks. I'm at the bridge. I'm at the light. I'm at the town.  I'm at the school. I park, wander in to the adjunct office, stopping to say hello to folks at the front desk. We banter in the office while I make fresh print-outs of my lecture notes. It's time to setup. I drag the video equipment into place, get it fired up. Some students straggle in. I'm ready to go, but tardiness seems to be the theme with this class. I start taking attendance, its quick with so few attending. I start the lecture. Students continue to straggle in, until the room is full.  The lecture goes OK. I bounce around, the students look bored, every with the spiciest story. There are a couple awake out there, I teach to them. I worry. Making Byzantine art relevant to students who have no idea where Byzantium even is? That;s a challenge. And unfortunately, it will take me several lectures to really do it. My voice is croaky. Not good.  They disperse, I get in the car and plot my course. I'm headed over  to the office today, Mom and I have bookkeeping and stuff to do. I ride down the road, we're in Christmas Past now, Fezziwig is being described. My brain spins. Fortunately, this isn't my double-dip day, I don't have to comeback for another lecture. I have grading to do. The boys will need to be engaged this afternoon, and it looks like rain. I forgot to buy laundry soap. I need to change the fish water. I run through the plot lines of the several soap operas we have going with folks connected with the office. I worry about all of them. I wonder how  Nik  is doing. I forgot to send a birthday present to the kids of some of my friends. I plot out my grocery budget for the rest of the week, since I have the foresight not to burn through it on grocery day, because I always forget things.  I pull into the office parking lot, My stomach growls. I realize I forgot to eat this morning. I wander into the office and start getting caught up on the news, making lists of things I'm supposed to be doing, wondering if I will get around to opening up my eBay shop this year. It's November already, its really too late, but perhaps I could get a few things up. Or not. I forgot to toss my laptop into the car. She's freezing. I wonder if I shouldn't be writing the novel based on the characters that swirl about there, rather than the bland, banal tale I've been spinning in the dead of night to myself.  We finally decide we're hungry, and head over to my favorite Mexican place for lunch, at least a half hour, maybe an hour, to talk with my mom. We ponder the soap operas. More constructively, we talk about the boys. We plot out school. I complain about the students who are driving me crazy, and chat about the students who make me proud. But best of all, its my mom. I take a deep breath, and the lunch is done, I have to take her back to the office. I watch her go in. She's still cold. I'm worried, because no one will tell us why she's having spikes and crashes in blood pressure, or what to do about it.   The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come glides into the pawn shop, Old Joe is tallying up the ill-gotten gains. I pull into the driveway. I have a few minutes before the boys will be home. I turn on a  video , even though I won't get to see the whole thing. I try to pick up the livingroom, which is scattered with paper, crayons, toys. I toy with the idea of getting out a game. It isn't raining yet. I pull out popcorn for snack. My time is done. I walk down to the bus stop, chat with the neighbors a few minutes. We lament the loss of some of the trees on the street, they complain about their grandson who is due off the bus. He gets let off first, and bounces down the street. I have no idea what they are complaining about. He's bouncy like Andy.  Andy's bus comes down the street. One of the other neighbors comes to get her child. She's got an older one with Asperger's, so we know each other better, but there's no time to chat. The bus is here, Andy is pulling off his backpack. He puts his hand in mine, chats about his day. Andy has a beautiful, ringing voice. The words may not be clear, but the joy is. He runs forward, kicking up leaves. Joey's bus turns the corner as we come up to the house. Andy jumps for joy, bobbing on the sidewalk at the edge of the street; he wants to \"get Joey all by myself!\" Joey hops off the bus, hugs his brother, and barrels to the door. I wave as the bus pulls away. They're home.  We hang the backpacks on the hooks. Andy wants to play with the child from the corner, so we go outside. The boys run with trucks and draw with chalk. I want to be knitting, but instead I take my laptop out and start answering student email and working my online classes. I glance up regularly, so it takes longer than it would later, but later I need to be putting together more material for the class I picked up for my sick colleague. The child from the corner comes over. I'm glad. He plays with Andy, and they even get Joey into the game at times, though he tends to wander off, talking to himself. They run; he sits in the grass, intent on his own play. It's still grey, but still not raining. Andy and his friend are playing something with pieces of cardboard, being bossy with each other as only young boys can be. Joey saunters up onto the porch, and I set my computer aside as he mounts the steps; he leans in to me, taking my face in his hands.  \"I like you,\" he says, breathless.   \"I like, you, too,\" I reply.  \"Do you like Doritos?\" \"I do.\"  \"Nacho cheese or Cool Ranch?\"  \"I like Cool Ranch.\"  \"Can I have some Doritos?\"  \"Certainly. Bring some out for the others.\" He disappears into the house; I have to remind him to close the door. He appears with the snacks and doles them out. Andy sets his aside, he's too busy to eat. Joey sets his out, takes a chip now and again to munch thoughtfully as he draws- no, he's putting numbers into columns, dividing them by hundreds, tens, ones. He asks me for a three-digit number, and I give him one. we go through this several times before he wanders off to write something else, out in front of the garden. Andy and his friend are running in and out the house, fetching toys. I remind them to keep the door closed. I keep answering students, check the news. The inane headlines tell me nothing has really happened today. I close up the computer, just in time for JoeyAndyDad to drive up. Its time for the friend to go home and get ready for his mom; its time for my boys to go in and calm down before trying to feed them; they are tired. I realize I have once again forgotten to start dinner, now I have to come up with a quick something that requires little cooking, as Joey gets upset when I cook.  I get a brief from JoeyAndyDad on his day, and give him a run through mine. He heads upstairs to change and breathe for a few minutes. the boys beg for some TV, and I turn it on before heading to the kitchen.  I decide on chili, as Joey is eating that now. Andy breaks into his chip bag at last, I toss the dinner together as the boys watch Peep. Well, kind of. They are mostly chasing each other around the house. I offer the back yard as an alternative, but am turned down. I'm short a can of beans for my recipe, I dump in a can of corn instead. I get it into the oven. I check the fish. Quille is still looking small. Chris is looking strong.  Andy had fetched paper and markers from the art table I have still set up in the kitchen, he is drawing dinosaurs. Joey is writing times on paper and cutting it into strips. I ask him why, but the answer makes no sense to me. Last week he was drawing Buzz Lightyears and cutting them out. Oh, and cats. But today. its strips of paper with times on them. A fight breaks out between them. The Witching Hour has arrived, delayed by the outside play.  I serve up the chili, Andy makes \"yuck\" noises. Joey sits and eats, Andy wants his in the living room. I can't have chili out there, we all sit and eat, JoeyAndyDad joins us. we try to get the boys to talk about school. I remember that Andy has a homework sheet to do. Andy pops up to \"go get something\". He has eaten some of the cheese off the top of the chili. Joey is finishing his. Andy pops up again. And again. JoeyAndyDad tries feeding him, a strategy that often works, but he honestly doesn't want the chili. He wants Doritos. I offer apples instead, but that is refused. We get a few bites of chili in him, and he's off.  We have more Peep and more drawing of dinosaurs and time slips before bedtime. I check some blogs quickly, see what is new in my corner of the world. Its time for baths; I send the boys up to undress and feed the cats and fish. Quille seems to be eating fine and unmolested by Chris, but I think Quille's tailfin looks ragged. I can't afford a second tank.  I wander up the stairs, turning off lights as I go. I pop open the laptop again, trying to finish the blog check as Andy takes his bath; then I go out to hug Joey and see if he wants a story. He doesn't. He's busy with Stybirde and Stymegard, playing something with a flashlight. the flashlight batteries are dying, he starts to perseverate on the dying flashlight. I'm out of batteries. Andy is ready for stories, Joey is sent to take his bath, still upset about the flashlight.  Andy and I find some books. One he knows so well, he recites the lines with me. I have him try to read another book himself, this one is about spiders. He likes knowing the word \"spiders\" but gets tired halfway through. I put it away for another night, let him pick out another book. He is playing as I am trying to read, his bed scattered with small toys. Its time for sleep. I turn off the light and turn on the CD. I make a motion to leave, and he protests. Mom has to snuggle him to sleep. He tells me a story, I can't follow the plot, but he's very pleased with it. We play Piggie. He settles. By the time the music goes off, he's asleep.  I then go in to Joey, kiss him, tuck him in. He is telling me about his play with his cats. He is repeats some lines from Toy Story, and we sing the theme from Peep together. then I give him another kiss and leave him to his play. Dad must have found a battery, because the flashlight is working.  I have to run out to the store and fetch the forgotten groceries, by the time I get into my nightgown, it's nearly ten. I still have grading to do, and the finishing touches for a lecture. JoeyAndyDad is watching something on his computer, and I work. I take a brief break to finish my blog perusal, then work some more. Its after midnight again when I snap my computer shut. We settle in the darkness, my brain spinning. Evan has a new job, I wonder if he'll be able to come for Thanksgiving. I have a few students who need swift kicks to get them moving, or they are going to flunk. I think about the news from the blogs. I have to work in the morning before my lecture, I won't have that time to clean. I wanted to make a quilt for a friend for Christmas, but I haven't even started. I worry about my mom. I worry about my guys. The wheels spin.  A little boy comes creep-creeping into my room. I think,  he won't be little long .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.peepandthebigwideworld.com/", "http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/", "http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-in-life.html", "title": "\nA Day in the life.\n"},

{"date": "Monday, December 14, 2009", "body": "\nThe holidays are upon us.  Santa is working hard to find a large dinosaur, hopefully plastic, articulated, and with a roar, and somewhere in the range of $30. Decorations are going up. Tomorrow's plan: clean the kitchen so I can spent the majority of Tuesday. Wednesday, and Thursday baking. Oh, wait, that would be today's plan. Yes, tis the season for insomnia, too.  Also its the end of the semester. It is much like the huge deadlines faced by folks with real jobs. We all call it Hell Week- no, its not the finals that are the problem. Grading is no problem. The student whining, however, is enough to make your head explode. And this is the time of year when the whining is loudest, and the most useless. It is too late. This year, they went whining not just to me, but to my department chair. There is nothing that feels like a punch of stomach like having the students you have spent the entire semester supporting, giving breaks, coaxing, pleading, pulling out all the stops trying to get them to understand material and perform at the college level complain to your boss that you are \"unprofessional.\" No, wait, how about an email from said boss asking you to \"do some soul searching\"? It sure makes you feel sorry you have standards. Life would be so much easier if you didn't. Students who get As rarely complain (\"getting\" and \"earning\" are two entirely different things).  No, wait, what about realizing you've dropped a ball? I've called the school Joey will be in next year- no, more accurately, I have emailed, as I was told to do that rather than call- three times. The first time I actually got a response from the principal's secretary saying he would call. He never did. The other two messages? No response at all. I should have already been in to see classes, meet teachers, and get the transition process rolling. I should be planning spring IEP now. Instead, I have done nothing, gotten nowhere, and been summarily and consequently ignored. I run the risk of Joey suffering as further consequence. One of those days I planned for baking will likely be swallowed by trying to stand in the office in protest until someone deigns to speak with me.  It's a little more important than cookies, don't you think?  I still have holiday cards to send. I haven't even taken a good photo of the boys yet this year. With my computer crash, I lost a bunch of addresses and am still trying to track them down. I pulled out last year's cards, but of course the address I want most is the envelope that is missing.  I need to put together teacher presents. These folks have worked their butts off. Joey's teachers have really done gangbusters for him this year, now that the schedule is settled. This is likely to be the last year to give a present to Mrs. H and Ms. Macy, so I want to have something super-spectacular for them. Joey's speech therapist has been a godsend. Andy's teacher has been nothing short of a miracle.  I ordered some books last month from scholastic. I wonder why I haven't gotten them yet.  The boys have been so good, and got such good report cards, I took them to  Charles d'Fromage  for dinner. Two ecstatic boys. I signed up for coupons, which made it even better. Andy likes to go up in the tubes, there is a lion cage above where I set up basecamp. It roars when you go in. He can also sit up there and call down to me, and to his brother. Oh, and know when the pizza arrives. It must be a fabulous view. Joey won a bunch of tickets at skeeball, he was  so  pleased with himself. Yes, nothing like an evening of listening to Chuck and his pals singing classic Christmas carols, like \"Big Band Santa\" and \"The Twelve Days of Chuck E's\" .  Two more final exams tomorrow. I already have two who have called in sick. But I got their number. I put up an online version. They can do it nicely from home- where they claim to be as they send me email.  I gotta get these grades done. This semester desperately needs to be over.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 15, 2009", "body": "\nComing off the bus, his first question is always, \"Can I play with Joey and Andy today?\"  \"Sure,\" I usually reply. Andy gets off the another bus, because the friend is slightly older, but he and Andy are quite compatible in terms of energy. Andy likes having someone to run off energy with. We wander over to our house together.  \"Where's Joey?\" He stops, then says, \"oh, I forgot, he's on another bus.\" That is all there is to that, a statement of fact; his friend is missing, he misses him, he wishes Joey present, but will be patient.  \"Let's go outside,\" he announces; the weather is nice, and he wants to be out in it rather than playing with Andy inside. Besides, my glass is up, so he can't bounce in here. Joey wants to watch the Disney Santa laugh, so he doesn't move. Andy tosses on shoes and coat. \"Aren't you coming, Joey?\" Joey doesn't respond right away, so the child says, \"OK, then,\" and out he goes; as he reaches the door, Joey finally gets the words out, \"I want to watch Santa laugh first. When this is over.\" The child looks slightly disappointed, but responds with another version of \"ok, then.\"  Andy and the child race up and down the sidewalk with trucks, they are actually playing two different games, but the games mesh nicely. Andy then races off forward, is fussing with a tree; the child glances at our van. He has seen it dozens of times before, but suddenly notices my bumper stickers. He reads them aloud.  \"What's autism?\" he asks.  \"Autism is a different way of thinking, having your brain wired a little differently. It causes kids to have different strengths and weaknesses than people expect. Autistic people often have trouble talking or having a conversation, for example.\" \"Oh.\" \"Joey is autistic.\"  \"Yeah.\" He reads another one. \"Autism is not a tragedy, ignorance is a tragedy.

I have seen him struggle with trying to include Joey, trying very hard to play with him, talk with him. I have often wondered what this child thinks of my son, since he has seen Joey react in unexpected ways, answer in unexpected ways, or not react or answer at all. Now there is no doubt, the fierce look, the sharp tone, the grim brow tell me everything. This child finds the idea of JOey being \"different\" to be perfectly acceptable, and people who think less of Joey as being ignorant.  And he's quite right.  I do love that child. He can bounce through my house anytime he pleases.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/12/why-i-love-child-across-street.html", "title": "\nWhy I Love the Child Across the Street\n"},

We had speech this morning at 9; I left plenty of time, and we did so well, we got to stop and have  Second Breakfast  before the appointment.  Then, since were out of my driveway and actually in the world, we decided to kick butt and take names with errands.  We did some stuff for my mom at her office. We got folks paid who needed to be paid. We got the holiday cards in the mail (will yours reach you by Christmas? No idea. But Merry Christmas anyway. I feel fortunate I got to write them at all this year). We picked up a few things at the grocery. I even took the boys to lunch! And what a lunch it was! It is our  favorite little place  to take the boys, so we had a lovely time. The boys actually got up, got plates, served themselves food, and sat down. By themselves. Without any peeps for help from a mom. It was kinda weird, actually. And when they wanted more food? They got up and got it.  My babies are all growed up.  After such success, we went home and made snowmen and watched movies and ate popcorn and drank hot chocolate and stuff. because that's what you do when it's day 3 of the Snowpocalypse: you just sit back and enjoy the snow.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.welovedc.com/2009/12/22/surviving-the-next-snowpocalypse/", "http://www.gone-ta-pott.com/second_breakfast.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/12/out-into-world.html", "title": "\nOut Into the World\n"},

We lasted about half an hour, because the snow kept blowing into our faces- and coats, boots, mittens, hoods...  This is still the morning venture. By the time we went out for the afternoon, Joey was in snow above his knees to go down the sidewalk. He got snow in his boots, which made him very unhappy. But the morning for him was OK.  Boys exploring a winter wonderland like they have never seen.  We got about 18 inches, maybe 20. It hasn't snowed like this here in a while. It was the fluffy stuff, too cold to pack- maybe tomorrow the sun will hit it enough to be able to make snowmen. Or something. Virginia usually gets wetter snow, so the depth is a little deceptive. Rule of thumb is that wet snow is half as deep as dry snow for the same about of water. So this storm would have been 9-10 inches or normal Virginia snow. That would still have been major (in my opinion, more major, as wet snow is heavier to shovel and doesn't blow or sweep as well as dry snow). This was an awesome storm. Think the whole winter will be like this? Spring semester will be a disaster!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sy76oY7jNwI/AAAAAAAADHU/CMAgvhWaCT0/s1600-h/03_andy_snowing.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sy76oBi0xcI/AAAAAAAADHM/cWDNsZRaX3E/s1600-h/03_joey_snowing.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sy76n4l27sI/AAAAAAAADHE/FYaJ_1J7ZGg/s1600-h/03_boys_snowing.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/12/hey-look-it-snowed.html", "title": "\nHey, Look!

You might also recall that he insists on coming to see us around January/Christmas, and that I'm too much of a freakin' chicken to do anything about it. After  last year , you'd think I'd get the hint. But no.  He was arriving at 3:30. There were murmurings of picking up the kids from school and hiding out at Chuck E. Cheese, but I didn't. I should have. But I didn't. There was no way to clean the house in time. I hadn't really bought them any presents. My plan had been to see them at the family Christmas and hope to hide for another year. However, my father had made something for the boys, and it was \"too big\". Just what we needed, something big.  Every year, my father makes something for the boys. It is a nice gesture, I suppose. One year he made them a rocking chair (meaning he painted one green and put a little \"John Deere\" faux logo on it). Another year it was rocking horse (not sure if he actually put that one together or not). He glued little wood animals to some peg strips he got as the craft store one year. Last year it was a Tic Tac Toe board, which worked out nicely, as the boys were very into Tic Tac Toe. This year? This very large board, painted in strips, with a hole, and legs on one side. You set up the board so it is angled, and toss bean bags at the hole. He had some fancy name for it, and much time was spent informing me of the official rules, and the fact that this was an official-sized board, but the hole was a little bigger than \"regulation\" because the boys were still little.  Do you have somebody that does things like this to make themselves feel better, and have you ever wondered how you are supposed to take it? I'll put it against another example of gift-giving. My Uncle Lou made the boys a game a couple of summers ago. He took PVC piping, made a three-bar frame, then drilled into tennis balls and connected two with a rope. You throw the balls-on-rope at the frame, and score points if you get them to wrap around one of the bars. The boys love it. It comes apart to be stored, and it is an outside game. He made it for them because he had made one for his own grandsons (the Cousins), and they had really liked it. During a visit, they surprised us with it.  Somehow, it feels so very different. My uncle has no obligation to my children. He saw they really enjoyed something, and he made it happen. Am I the only person who sees the difference?  My husband has assured me more support next year. As in, when we get (if we get) warning, we are hauling butt to Chuck E. Cheese. It's less stressful.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/01/insanity-again.html", "title": "\nInsanity: Again.\n"},

For Joey's world view, Christmas came, Christmas went, it is time to move on. So today, the tree came down. Happy Twelfth Night.  I started while the boys were in school, stripping the tree of ornaments that might require special packing or sorting of any kind. The gold chains, the paper Santas, the toys, etc. all go in their own particular boxes, leaving the plastic to be tossed into one big tub together. In a couple more years, I'll be able to get my real decorations out. Then the boys rolled in. Andy took a few decorations off, then got distracted by the arrival of our  neighbor . Joey came off the bus without his backpack, and he nearly melted down he was so upset about forgetting it on the bus. He didn't really recover enough to be interested until I was taking the lights off. Those still need to be boxed. So I ended up doing the vast majority of tree-disassembly myself.  And like most years, as I take the decorations down, I realize that the vast majority of you, once again, never even saw them.  If that strikes you as odd, just keep in mind that as I am putting them up, I am thinking things like, \"wow, Stimey would really like this,\" or \"Niksmom would think this was totally cute,\" or \"I wonder what Maddy's kids would think of this.\" Yes, I love my Christmas decorations, and the solid majority of them I am thinking, \"I'm glad Mom this this is pretty\" or \"JoeyAndyDad enjoys this\" or \"Joey and Andy are gonna go bonkers over this.\" And of course, \"Hey, this is nice. Let me see how it would look if I did this.\" And there is an awful lot of things I wish I had gotten around to doing, planned to do, even bought what I needed to get it done, and didn't. But it just seems really weird and surreal to me that most of you guys never see them. In fact, very few folks ever see them. The boys. JoeyAndyDad, My Mom. Evan. This year, my Dad and his wife saw them. Ms. A and Mr. Wesley happened in to see them mostly, but not fully, set up. The neighbor saw them briefly.  And that's it.  I know, last year I put up the video of the decorations, and I hope you guys liked it. I love putting them up and seeing the world all pretty-sparkly Christmasy wonderland in my house. I will miss my lighted garlands of glass ornaments, even if I've been mostly too tired to spend a lot of time in the evening downstairs.  But somehow, that realization that you guys don't see them, it is just one of those things.

I think he knew when he toddled in to the bedroom and saw my face. His own dropped.  He didn't cry or wail. He had questions for me. Was his fish moving? Was he in the box with Chris and Godot? Would a cat eat him? Can we get a new fish? What will Andy name his new fish?  Then the processing: Quille isn't moving any more. Quille was alive yesterday. Andy's fish is dead. It isn't moving anymore. Quille isn't moving anymore. We will get new fish. I'm sorry about the fish. I hate that my fish is dead. My fish died.

Both boys seem to have latched onto the new minnows.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2010", "body": "\nI've been sharing our lives with you all for 3 1/2 years now. Potentially, I have let the entire world in on my life, my thoughts, my adventures, my ups and downs, for the last 3 1/2 years. Life is very different. In May of 2006, Joey was still in preschool. He speech was so limited, I actually blogged about even the hints of  conversation , though Joey was still using single-word responses. We went crazy with joy at signs of  pretend play . The huge, dramatic  meltdowns  of a frustrated child were far more common. I remember that  first comment from Maddy , that first hint that I wasn't just talking to myself out here. We were in the midst of  IEP Hell , trying to get footing, trying to get a master's in special education practice and law in the few short months we had to master the system and the skills for getting Joey was he needed. We needed to know what he actually needed. At the same time, we had Andy to raise and learn about, and  his needs  to understand and master.  Yeah, we've come a long way. In that time, I have seen other folks with wider-read blogs, blogs that started and took off. OUr little corner has remained a comfy corner with my squishy-comfy couch, hot chocolate on the stove, and plenty of cozy quilts to snuggle under. I don't do the things that make a blog expand and take on life of its own. I don't advertise, I don't label and tag, and don't do a lot of jumping up and down and making noise elsewhere. I don't do reviews, unless I feel like something out to be brought to your attention because I think it would be helpful and awesome. I have never been to  BlogHer . If I get 100 hits in a day, that's a big deal, and I check out what I talked about to cause the spike.  I started out trying to help folks. That was the idea behind this blog- to offer what we were learning, knowing others needed to know, and fast. Being a quiet little corner can help that, because you don't get the tramping of unwelcome feet, you don't see a lot of the venom from having huge numbers of people with vast diversity of opinions battling it out in your comments. I can share experiences here that might not normally be put on a huge blog, more pictures, more little vignettes of life with children generally, and with an autistic child, a very beautiful autistic child, specifically. I can provide those little reminders that life is good, you can do this, and we're all in it together. After all, that's what life is- we're all in this together. The Earth is really quite small, you know. A little comfy corner of the cosmos.  Perhaps being a bigger blog (and a better-written blog), along the lines of  Whitterer  or  Stimeyland  or  Maternal Instincts , I might reach more people. Or maybe not. One thing you learn as a teacher, just because you give the lecture and answer the questions doesn't mean everybody learns. Yet somehow I find being that comfy corner of the web with the squishy couches and ice cream to be something else the community needs. Maybe that's just the way I am.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogher.com/", "http://whittereronautism.com/", "http://stimeyland.blogspot.com/", "http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/01/my-small-corner-of-interwebz.html", "title": "\nMy Small Corner of the Interwebz\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, February 02, 2010", "body": "\nThere's been a lot of negativity blowing in the wind this week. Lots of little drops of water that converge into a massive waterfall. Or that last little flake that starts the avalanche is tossing about on the breeze. Soap operas and novellas here that I usually leave in the shadows of my life instead of pasting into the public view of the internet. The  ravages of hypotheticals  and the ire they raise, the what-ifs, the should-bes, the thoughts of things  gone awry.  The accusations of  blowing roses  (I think that will now be a permanent part of my image vocabulary) which get me  thinking about life , and the way  we thought it would be . All of which gets exasperated by exhaustion, stress, drama, and of course, depression. One of the joys of clinical depression is that all the negativity can get magnified. Oh, fun. Well, that's what the Wellbutrin is for, right?  I've done my  weighing-in  on the cure non-issue. The semantics of it all seems to get mired in the problems of parenting, existing, and expectations. It's as sticky as it gets, all the stickier because its completely moot. All it does is aggravate the negativity.  No, this isn't the way we planned life to be. Heck, last fall I had all these plans for cleaning and cooking and sewing and working and... life happened instead. All those dreams and thoughts and hopes and fears for my life I had before Joey? All moot. That's not what happened. Life happened instead. Funny thing, life. It has a funny way of rolling aside into little eddies instead of sticking to the main current. Lots of little droplets, running downhill together to the sea. If we separate the droplets out and look at them, which can we blame for sending us into the eddy?  Perhaps it is more my way of coping with stress to try to start from here. I suppose it is an attitude that got emphasized in studying Buddhism, where questions of origins are often considered \"not edifying\", and so left unanswered. How we got here? Only important to avoid getting here again, if this isn't where we want to be. So often, we can't avoid it, so mulling on it now isn't helping. Here we are. Where to now? I would much prefer resources going into educational strategies and support systems for autistic people, because Joey is autistic, and he had needs, right now. How he got to be autistic is a mystery, and not one I'm so sure would be that useful to solve. \"Would you cure him?\" is not an edifying question. I have no time for that right now. I have to start from the right here and right now, not some hypothetical possible starting point.  Oh, sure, we have to think of possibilities. At the same time, we end up with chicken-and-egg logic loops and angels-on-pinheads academic games that just aren't that useful right now. It just gets mired in negativity.  And as for the roses thing? I'm not going to tell anybody they don't have the right to feel angry, bitter, resentful, sad, depressed, despondent, stressed, tired, desperate, frustrated. When your life isn't going as planned, when you watch people you love lost in frustration, in depression, struggling, hurting, trying so hard, unhappy, isolated, stressed, it gets to you. And I'm not just talking about our autistic loved ones, either. The morass is laid out before you, and to get mired in it like Brer Rabbit in the Tar Baby. You have the right to get lost in the morass. That's being human. Some might say it is weak to do so, but I disagree- even the strongest have the right to feel all of these things, and we all get a little wandery sometimes. But is that useful? Are you feeling any better? Are you a better person for getting lost in your own resentment, your own anger, your own grief? Isn't there a difference between feeling these things, and getting lost or mired in them? You know why you should make lemonade when life hands you lemons? Because lemonade is constructive, sweet, and even fun. Citrus gone soft and moldy isn't only not useful, it gets a little smelly. And makes the other lemons go bad quicker. But hey, they're  your  lemons. Sometimes you can just enjoy looking at the lemons. There isn't always a rush for lemonade. Not everyone even  likes  lemonade. Maybe we should squeeze them a use a little zest, and make lemoncake instead. Or they might make a nice wreath...  Once caught in our eddy, it can be hard to escape the pull of that swirl. Once you find yourself drowning in lemons, you might not exactly be thinking \"hmmm, what I really need now is a nice, cold glass of this stuff.\" And as I've said before, dump a little clinical depression on top, and you find you're really being pulled down into the vortex. One thing I do when I feel that pull, is I come here, and write about Joey and Andy. I write about things that happened. Sometimes its good to share the pitfalls, the hard stuff, the things that I wonder if its happening out there to other folks. More times its better to write about things going right, partly to keep them in the fore. There is little more one can do to counter darkness than to drown it in light- open the door, turn on the light, light the candle, raise the blinds and draw back the drapes. Air out the bad stuff, emphasize the good stuff, and start from here. Now take a step forward. One foot in front of the other sounds so easy, but we all know how much of a challenge it can really be.

It's going to snow pretty heavily here this weekend, and I am going to run out of my meds, so I had to have them refilled.*** Also, they called school pre-emptively, and I didn't want to take the guys into a crowded grocery store the day of a Snowtastrophe, so off I went to grab a few things in case we lose power, like marshmallows. Oh, and some stuff for mom to make a lasagne and some soup, in case she gets snowed in for a few days, which is far more likely than me being snowed in for a few days, as I live on a main drag downtown.  The scene at the grocery was incredible. Insane. There was no produce. I got my hands on the last head of cabbage. There were no bananas, no grapes, no pears, no berries, no broccoli, no carrots, no onions... I grabbed a head of lettuce, which the poor produce manager had brought out trying to stock something. People were taking it faster than she could stock it, right out of the box beside her.  There was no bread, no cheese, no sausage, no hamburger. The deli should have closed before I got there, but were so busy, there wasn't time to close. I did manage to get some cold cuts. There were no roasts, except sirloin. They were restocking the chicken, it had been cleared. There were some expensive cuts of things, but anything reasonable was gone. Oh, and there was plenty of stew meat at $3 a pound. Who pays $3 a pound for stew meat? Eggs, milk, orange juice, toilet paper, pasta, soda, chips, all ravaged. No velveeta. No cottage cheese. No yogurt.  I have never seen anything like it.  Someone tried to sneak my head of cabbage from my basket while I was perusing the eggs. I saw a person pick up the last package of hamburger, and get accosted by three other shoppers who wanted it. I wasn't the only one who found the whole thing absolutely ridiculous, and so there was a group of us who just burst out laughing every time we passed each other, with comments of, \"We're all gonna DIE!!!\" High adventure in aisle five! Fortunately, I have another little grocery store I like very much, but they haven't even tried to compete with Wegman's prices. However, desperate days, my friends, desperate days. I went there and paid a little more for my stuff, but they actually had the stuff. Because when they are calling for two feet of snow in this part of the world, it is indeed Snowpocalypse. It might take me a couple days to get out of my driveway, and I have two boys to entertain for those two or three days. And they are home from school tomorrow.

{"date": "Thursday, February 11, 2010", "body": "\nWe had a little snow adventure today. Mom has some doctor's appointments that are needful, so we had to get her dug out and to them, lest we have another several-week wait to see these people. So once again, I set out to retrieve her from the country.  When we had our Jeep, this was not a terribly difficult matter. However, the Jeep got creamed by the shuttle at JoeyAndyDad's work, so we don't have it this winter. We are waiting for the settlement to start shopping for a new one, because winters like this do happen- and besides, his work requires him to be there even in bad weather. Anyway, we don't have a 4WD vehicle right this minute.  I loaded up the boys and headed into the Wild Blue Yonder to go over the river and through the woods (literally). I must say I've been mostly impressed with the snow removal in these parts- the main arteries were mostly dry, most of the side roads are clear, and even the little roads are passable. Heck, even the road back to my  mom's was plowed and minimally slushy, and that's practically a miracle. We got to the circle, no problem.  I sat in the driver's seat, poised at the top of the driveway. Let me tell you a little about the driveway at my mom's, the one I learned to drive on. It is about a tenth of a mile long through the woods. From the circle, you dip down into the driveway; back about halfway is an intersection as the driveway teardrops on a slope. You bear left to go straight in; you bear right to head up a small slope, then have to turn a hard and steep left around to face out again. I had a plan. I would go the left, and just before getting to the steep loop, I would gun it up, then back in a y-turn to the parking, and be facing out. This would save me a potentially dangerous slide around that steep loop.  The last vehicle down this driveway was the big electrical trucks after the last storm, so we had to deal with the new accumulation, some four inches on top of the other, which has melted down some in the interval. I sat poised, looking down the stretch of virgin white. Without my 4WD, did I chance it, or not? My mom cannot walk so far. The appointment was an important one. I took a deep breath, and plowed forward. Yep. I'm an idiot.  I made it, oh, about a quarter of the way.  The snow was incredibly wet and heavy, but the real problem was that the center of the driveway- between the ruts made by the electrical trucks- was still higher than the clearance under the van. With it being so heavy, my van, not being a snowplow, could only push so far; and the wet snow turned to slick smoothness of ice under my tires. Suddenly I couldn't go forward any more- and I had no traction to go back. Quietly cussing myself out, I got the boys out and we walked down to the house. I explained the problem. My mom, a wiser woman than I, was surprised- she thought I would honk from the circle. Which is, of course, what I should have done.  I got the boys inside, grabbed a shovel, and headed out. I tried to get under the wheels and dig to the road surface. Unfortunately, I couldn't get enough out from under the wheels themselves for this to work at all. I went back, fetched a bag of fertilizer, and headed back to use that traction. A good deal of wheel spinning and choice words later, I head mom calling- she had a rug to try to put under the wheels. I ran back and got it, and was shoving it under the wheel when I herd another car. I looked up to see a large truck with a snowplow blade on the front, perched as I had been at the top of the driveway. Oh no, I thought; even if I can move the car, I'm stuck!  But then, blessings on him, the guy got out and offered to pull me out. We got hooked up, and got started.  And that's when his truck got stuck. Remember that dip into the driveway from the circle? That equates to a steep little hill to get back out to the circle. Try to climb up and out is hard enough, without having a van to pull behind you through thick, heavy snow.  He and I shoveled the worst of the snow out of the way, trying to make it easier, but he just could not get up that little incline. So then the second angel appeared- in the form of my moms next-door neighbor, who has lots and lots of man-toys. One of them is a large 4WD truck with a tow chain. We attached that truck to the snowplow truck, and started again. The circle was well-plowed, and wet, but not icy; so after some more revving and cursing, we were on the move! Up and out! The nice guy with the plow then tried to plow the drive, but the snow was so heavy and thick, he couldn't do too much. We managed to get some of the snow off the left-hand straight way, and make nice ruts to drive on, but not all the way to the parking area- in fact, the steep loop is currently blocked by the snow push pile. He kindly brought my mom out, though.  We are definitely replacing the Jeep, ASAP. You never know when we're going to have a winter like this.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/02/digging-out.html", "title": "\nDigging out\n"},

{"date": "Friday, February 19, 2010", "body": "\nWe are standing in line at the grocery store. The little family in front of us is a mom, a dad, a girl about Andy's age, maybe between my two. She stands, perfectly silent, between mom and dad, her hands neatly folded in front of her, looking over the groceries her parents are buying. Her head moves to follow the exchanges between her parents and the cashier. She smiles at a joke. She beams knowing something is being bought for her. She looks happy at a compliment from the cashier.  I have one swinging from the bars that mark the line as handicapped-accessible and divide it from the next register. The other is yelling at me to look at a variety of items at the far end of the line. I prompt them to stay close to me. They are now playing some game in the aisle, one that involves \"skating\" and racing. I prompt them to return to me. Joey is making a very loud sound, a musical intonation from his new Buzz Lightyear game. Andy is squealing that Joey is hurting his ears.  The mom and dad glance back at us. The eyes of the girl follow their faces. They are giving me The Look. I am busy hugging Andy. I see no real reason to do anything about Joey singing, except to remind him to do it in an inside voice, and then to clarify that an \"inside voice\" is quieter. He reduces the volume, but picks up the quantity. Andy starts asking for things, and getting upset when I tell him he can't have a balloon, a candy bar, a soda, a toy. He never is allowed these things in the check-out line, but he has the tenacity of a 5-year-old in the throes of marketing genius.  No, the check-out isn't going particularly slowly in front of me, thanks. This is the speed this is all happening- a few minutes, long enough to check less than 20 items through, pay for those items, a couple extra pleasantries with the cashier, and the family is gone.

{"date": "Monday, February 15, 2010", "body": "\nDear Aspies Who Don't Want To Be Called Autistic:  Come meet my son. He's in the top math and reading groups, too. His main difference from you? You can use language better. We know a lot os Aspies who cannot function as well in the classroom as my son, despite their language-use strengths. Your strengths and weaknesses may be different, but that doesn't make you better than him, or him better than you. Hence \"different.\"  Yes, Asperger's Syndrome looks different than PDD-NOS, or \"classic\" autism, or even Rhett's (which I understand they are going to remove altogether). But the DSM is about biology, not identity. Not everyone displays all manifestations of any condition, and grouping those who display certain sets is a way to help them understand what they might need; but that doesn't- and shouldn't- change the diagnosis if the underlying biology remains the same. Kind of like everyone is human, no matter their need for suntan lotion.  In our little enclave, we have a number of kids with varying kind of autism. Am I entirely convinced there is one sole cause? No, but whatever the trigger or cause, the results are similar: the brain is \"wired\" differently from the majority of the population, and the results are a different experience of the world, a different way of handling and understanding experience, and a difference in the way the body and brain handles messages (both coming and going). What specifics result in one child being able to talk, and another not? And do those specifics mean that one child should have a completely different diagnosis from another? How is my child similar to, and different from, a child who has difficulty walking as well as talking? A child who is having a harder time acquiring skills? A child with more severe internal issues as well as external issues? Is it a matter of degree?  I am always fascinated by the idea of Asperger's Syndrome being understood as \"Autism Lite.\" There is an assumption that all Asperger's kids are \"high functioning\", but I am having trouble understanding what people mean- because the apparent meaning that speech is a skill that trumps all others just doesn't make sense. The child down the street speaks better than Joey, but has a lot more anxiety and sensory issues. I will never forget the older child that came to OT after Joey a year or so ago, who could speak beautifully and always had. However, he insisted on playing with my hair (as in, he just walked over one day and started playing, no preamble), refused to sit in a chair, and spoke beautifully and perfectly, as long as you were talking about space*. As long as you couched everything in terms of planets, spaceships, lasers, and Star Wars, all was good. And when he got particularly anxious, everyone around him weren't people- they were planets. I thought it kind of fun being a planet, but didn't go over so well with his teachers and classmates, and it often got in the way of participating in activities or lessons.  Does this child's perfect grammar and solid diction trump the fact that he could only speak on one subject? Does that make him \"higher\" functioning than Joey? Is Joey \"higher\" functioning than this child, since Joey can follow lessons and participate in a regular classroom? Hmmm. Again, we find ourselves mired in semantics. What is \"high\" functioning? Are all aspies automatically and by definition \"high\" functioning? And if is the answer is yes, does that make them different at a biological level from someone like Joey, or are we grouping people together by similar symptoms of the same condition, like separating humans by race (or even ethnicity)? Should we quibble about who is more disabled than whom?  Personally, I think there is nothing wrong with celebrating ethnicity, even race, as long as we all agree we are all human. These identities are not about being better than others, it is about being different and diverse. Being different makes the world fun and gives us plenty to share and think about, gives us different perspectives to consider. No difference is \"better\" or \"higher\", they are just different. *I'm actually changing the specific topic, because the topic he liked was so specific and particular, it might be a privacy issue.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/02/aspergers-autism.html", "title": "\nAsperger's Autism\n"},

Battlefields are, almost by definition, outdoors. We don't have nature centers or kid-friendly museums or anything like that. We have a lot of old buildings, loosely scattered over town, with various levels of restoration and kid-friendliness. But the boys are getting to the age when I would like to get them familiar with the history we have around us. After all, George Washington grew up here.  So we got out our cameras, and headed out to see some of the sights. I decided on a group of attractions that sit together- the Hugh Mercer Apothecary, the Rising Sun Tavern, and the library. Between attractions, they took a lot of photos of the street and the sidewalk. No, seriously- pavement and concrete are wonderful textures to photograph.  You aren't really supposed to take photos inside, but the ladies there were so nice! We didn't do so well with the tour, especially since there was another family there, so I pulled them back out to the front room, and the other guide let the boys ask questions about what made them curious. Andy wanted to know what was in the jars and wanted to know more about the big specimen jars. Oh, and they got to see leeches. Real leeches.  Joey was a bit out-of-sorts, but managed to show some interest in the jars and labels. He was happy to see one marked \"marshmallow\", but was confused that it was an herb, not fluffy white lumps of sugar (marsh mallow was used to sooth sore throats).  The tavern part of the adventure was less successful. Th girl there wasn't as creative, and then the other family showed up there (I don't think they were very thrilled to see us, having experienced our presence at the apothecary), and the boys were pretending to be dogs- so we had to move on, and we didn't even get to see the tap room. We grabbed some books at random from the library (no, really- they just kind of picked out two books that had pretty covers. They weren't in a be-quiet-and-focus mood) and headed home. I was hoping to fill up most of the day with our adventuring, but I didn't even have to worry about the two-hour parking limit on the street. We'll try again in a bit; as they become more familiar with the places, they;ll be more comfortable and listen better.

I still prefer to bring you  the happy pictures of field day , but there were fewer this time. Unfortunately, we were coming off a hard weekend with some tummy ick, so he got tired fast and frustrated even faster. He would watch his friends be able to do the activities- and we were in with the self-contained class instead of in with one of Joey's regular classes- and get angry and upset that he couldn't do them, too. I keep being told he doesn't need physical therapy, or even occupational therapy for gross and fine motor skills, but it was terrible for him to be the one who couldn't speed through the sack race or walk like a crab. He couldn't jump rope or turn a hula hoop, even just around his wrist. Even trying the team walking, which he has always happily done with his beloved Ms. Macy, he quickly shifted to \"I can't do this!\" and ran for the gate- a problem they have been seeing increasingly during P.E. at school.  He did find some activities he liked- he always likes the parachute. He tossed a frisbee well, something he and Ms. Macy have been working hard on. He liked kicking the ball into the soccer goal. Moments of brightness. I keep telling myself everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Certainly I was never sporty, and there were these few activities he did fine with, and I tried to emphasize those. It is difficult to see him so frustrated, and to realize how different he is from the skills of his peers. I told Ms. Macy I signed him up for  Challengers , and I hope it will help create positive experiences for him with physical activity.  When we went into the lunchroom for lunch, Joey sat at the end of the table, near a window, so he could watch the other kids still playing. He spoke briefly with one of the other children, but was otherwise by himself, even in the crowd, chewing on his sandwich and watching. I sat with him, but let him have his time to be quiet and watch, especially since we came from a near-meltdown, even though we were giving him lots of breaks. How talkative the other kids were, even the ones in the self-contained class! Some of the regular-ed kids joined us for lunch, so there was a very happy buzz throughout the room as everyone (well, mostly everyone- food issues were far more prevalent than motor or speech issues) ate. Joey sat there, collecting himself, watching. We talked about the kids playing with the parachute, and the kids running a sack race. I gave him lots of kisses and hugs.  I do worry about what Joey thinks of Field Day. If you ask him, he gives you the rehearsed \"I had fun.\" To see the other kids doing the activities- hopping in the sacks, jumping the ropes, turning the hoops, tossing the rings- so easy, so fun, so full of laughter- how does that feel to him, having just stomped off in frustration? How can I better support him, help him understand that everyone has challenges and strengths? That being good at reading and math is as important and valuable as someone else's strength in running or jumping, even if it isn't as readily visible?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S4UqIPQPMXI/AAAAAAAADME/cUcSdQqoOeY/s1600-h/03_joey_ringtoss.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S4UqHume-SI/AAAAAAAADL8/xTzHs-TwoHQ/s1600-h/03_joey_parachute.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S4UqHZvvAVI/AAAAAAAADL0/jH2_Roxo7Yo/s1600-h/03_joey_parachute2.jpg", "http://www.eteamz.com/spotsyll/news/index.cfm?cat=507442", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S4UqG5JvgeI/AAAAAAAADLs/1sZelsCKJOw/s1600-h/03_joey_sackrace.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S4UqGsz7mUI/AAAAAAAADLk/UpSyqooMaQs/s1600-h/03_joey_notcrabbing.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/02/field-day-2010.html", "title": "\nField Day 2010\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 05, 2010", "body": "\nWe've had a few dips in the road lately around here. As we enter IEP season, its always a good idea to up my meds and crack out the wine, keep to the positive and gird ourselves with understanding of Joey's strengths and weaknesses. Since we will be changing schools, it's time to put together another powerpoint about Joey, a solid assessment to present to people who are new to him, new to us, and vice-versa. It's time to lay out those strengths and weaknesses in black and white, to voice concerns and make suggestions. I really do try to keep it positive, or at least even-keel.  But then we have Field Day. It is always a hard day for me, that wake-up spring call to remind me not only how far we've come, but how far we have to go. This year was particularly a shock as I was expecting to see improvement in participation and ability to complete the tasks, and I actually noted there was no progress at all, and even some (dare I say it?)  regression . Things he happily did in kindergarden, or at least gave it a good try, this year he tossed aside in frustration and tried to escape the whole scene.  Then came the Special Education Parent Advisory Committee. It was our first one this school year, which is in itself discouraging. That only one other parent showed up didn't really raise my spirits; I'm chair of this thing. Yet again, and by default. Funnily enough, it is really difficult for parents of special ed kids to come to and run meetings; they have these kids with special needs to care for, and respite ain't cheap. That aside, we were getting the rundown of sped numbers, when there was a discussion of three kids with PDD-NOS who weren't going to qualify for service. I blinked, and have been really thinking about that. I remember how close we came to not getting a diagnosis for Joey, even with his communication issues at age 3. He was too social, he was too mobile, etc. etc. etc. All the standard tests were coming back \"borderline\". It was the doctor,  Dr. James Blackman  of  Kluge Children's Rehab , who looked at those tools, looked at Joey, and said, \"These tools are guides and supports, they aren't absolute. This child is autistic.\" Dr. Blackman also noted that children diagnosed with PDD-NOS tended to be denied service (hence I support the  new DSM guidelines  of folding the subcategories of the spectrum under one diagnosis: autism spectrum disorder). If we had just gone with the early childhood educator at the center, or any of those tools, would Joey have qualified for service? Would he even have been considered autistic? And yet is it now obvious that he is autistic, there is no going around it with your tools or guides or what have you. The tracking, the clicking, the language issues, the motor issues, the social issues are now clear, far more than that day. We might say we were frightened and had seen the child slipping from us, but in fact, we intervened at the cusp of real manifestation of autism. Joey was born with autism, but we did see the changes that so many parents think herald the beginning of autism. In fact, they just become more obvious, as other children develop other skills, while your own child seems to turn aside from them. He hadn't just started. It just became more visible.  Back to the committee, where they are denying service to kids with PDD-NOS, reminding me that the attitudes of school are something I must reckon with. I have no idea why these kids are being denied service, specifically, but the shock remains. If they are visible enough to have a diagnosis, then it is time for early intervention for functional and social skills at the very least; yet these children's parents will be told the school system is not going to help them. Will they know where to turn next? I'm digressing again. The point is, Joey is more disabled than I ever think he is. Joey is just Joey to me, he is who he is, and he grows and learns, the miracle of a child growing up and becoming an adult, one step at a time. As mild as we might think his autism- and he is constantly described in official paperwork with things like \"mild autism\" (though when he was four and five, we did see it become \"moderate autism\"), \"high functioning\", and other such odd nomenclatures- it affects him in significant ways, in ways that cannot be pushed aside or ignored.  Then came the magic show last night. He sat with another friend from his class, another child described as \"mild.\" The child certainly speaks better than Joey, but has other quirks of manner and coping that are unmistakable to a parent of a spectrum child. That child's mother was concerned about staying for the whole show, and I agreed. Her child made it through, sitting in her lap on the floor. Mine needed two breaks, and was unhappy with the noise and need to focus even with those breaks. The reminder that Joey often needs one-to-one attention and care in group settings- settings where most of the parents just told their kid to go sit on the floor and enjoy the show with their friends, while the parents retreated to the back of the gym to talk amongst themselves- was a stark one; especially since I was a lone parent with two kids. One melted down if we stayed, the other melted down if we left. At least it was balanced, right?  When we put Joey into preschool, we had hopes that he would be \"mainstreamed\" by kindergarden. That didn't happen. Then there was talk of him being \"mainstreamed\" by third grade. The problem there was that our idea of \"mainstreamed\" and the school's definition of \"mainstreamed\" are two very different things. Except that for services, they want to go with our definition, while for practice, they go with their own. They're going to want to stick him into regular-ed classes, but they aren't going to want to give him an aide or a specialized resource room once he gets there.  Inclusion is a funny thing. That was supposed to be the big topic of the Sped meeting, but there was a hollowness, or perhaps a shallowness, to the whole discussion. School personnel spent a lot of time patting themselves on the back about how wonderful it was that kids could be included, and that inclusion was done on an individual basis. And all I kept thinking was,  No kidding! Of course you are going to put for LRE, that's the law. But I want to know what you intend to achieve by pushing these kids out into regular ed. What are they supposed to gain? And do they gain it?  Pushing Joey into the mainstream will look great for the paperwork, but what is he gaining? It isn't like peer models mean that much to him in teaching social skills or self-regulation. Is the goal to teach the other children tolerance? We could argue some success on that front, and certainly that is to Joey's benefit as well as the regular ed kids. Academic progress? That would need to be more specific. Some things Joey gains, some things he does not.  And I have other odd details to worry about. Joey is getting older. We are screaming at lightning speed towards middle school. I have to give thought to his social comfort and skills. The Upper Elementary bus is permitted to drop kids off at a designated bus stop without an adult there to meet them. Our stop is two blocks away and not in sight of the house, since the upper elementary bus does not stop at the corner that is half a block away. Would Joey be able to get home safe? Or could he wander off if he's had a bad day? Do I put him on the regular bus and hope the bus environment isn't overwhelming and trust him to walk down the hill and around a corner? Or do I keep him on the special ed bus, which will bring him to my door and requires my presence when he arrives, but begins to run the risk of having him be at the butt of all those \"short bus\" jokes? How much of a safety risk is it, and is it a good trade-off for his social acceptance?  See, the other thing noted in the meeting was that as the kids hit high school, they often refuse the accommodations they are permitted because they \"don't want to be different.\"  And the school personnel permit it.  There was no talk of getting these kids counseling, or working to improve attitudes and acceptance among non-disabled peers, or expanding understanding of accommodations and why they might be needed or why it would be inappropriate (or even mean and vicious) to make other feel they needed to refuse the supports they need to be successful and to learn. The balance between needs and realities is one that no one wants to talk about, far less  do  anything about. What happened to valuing diversity and acceptance? What happened to the dream of Martin Luther King? Is our understanding of these concepts so  shallow ? Yet this subtle exclusion in the world of \"inclusion\" is something I must think about now, to help Joey self-advocate later. The idea of balancing safety with social acceptance is absurd, and yet there it is- an issue that must be considered as Joey builds his social foundations.  It takes courage to get through a day. For Joey, it seems to take more than his share, and we must prepare him for the stores of courage he will need to get through puberty. He's only seven, and I have to worry about his life when he turns seventeen. How far will he have come? Will he be able to communicate his triumphs and tribulations effectively? Will he be valued for the beautiful person he is and is learning to be, or scorned for his social, communication, and motor skill challenges? How can I help him?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/people/dop/dopDetail.cfm?drid=35", "http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/pediatrics/kcrc/home.cfm", "http://www.psych.org/dsmv.aspx"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/03/discouragement.html", "title": "\nDiscouragement\n"},

He's dead.\" Joey is playing nicely, or talking about numbers or something, when suddenly he comes out, \"y fish died.\" Andy runs down to check the fish in the middle of the night. We haven't told them Henri is gone; we noted that sometimes he hides in the little statues in the fish tank, and have let the matter drop. Extensive conversations on the topic have yet to turn out well. Toys also kill each other, or \"died\" each other, only to come back and \"get better.\" We talk about death, separation, the permanence of death, the moving along of life and the natural aspects of death in life. We try to keep it simple all the same. I even pulled out a Mr. Rogers episode about a dead bird, trying to give them a safe discussion. We watched  Charlotte's Web . When it pops up and causes anxiety, the usual modes for diffusing anxiety just don't seem to be working.  Death is one of topics that mythology works best for, but when you have a child who prefers tangibles to metaphor, myth is not the best tool for communicating an idea. So we stick to the tangibles: the fish were here, and we loved them and took good care of them. Now they are gone, and we miss them. We will think about them, and remember them, and we can still love them. This seems to be the most help when the spiral begins.  Its still a little bit of a shocker when you are going along in a conversation, and suddenly the topic of the conversation is \"He died.

They sang about Mom making their snacks. We had a short squeak because Joey got so into the singing, he forgot to put on his shoes and it looked like we would be late to the bus stop; but then he got them on, and sang (with a very earnestly sad face) that he was late for the bus and might miss it and miss picture day.

The ability to sit and focus on something is a challenge; the only thing I have seem him sit and focus on is a new TV show, when he really, really, really tired. Even then, he likes to wander about the room.  Andy had the stomach ick last week. In fact, we had it together. The result was a day and half of missed school. The result of that was two thick booklets of worksheets to make up in our spare time. Oh, and we had another sheet to make up because one afternoon all he could do was run in circles around the house screaming about how he wanted winter to stay forever and hated the snow melting. It was a little disturbing to see, actually. Oh, and we had the homework sheets regularly sent home, because what is kindergarten without homework? As if I have nothing else to teach the child outside of school!  So over the weekend, we got started. Now instead of 5 minutes (one worksheet), we had 20 minutes to do each day, and I didn't want to miss too many days and have it pile into 30 minutes. Did I mention those \"new TV shows\" were only 20 minutes long? How long could I get him to focus on a worksheet?  It turns out that we did better than I expected. I mixed the sheets up, so he wasn't doing the whole math packet one day, the whole language arts packet the next. A little of this, a little of that, to hold some interest and break up the tedium. That he found most of the sheets tedious was pretty clear. There was one about money and showing ten cents over and over again, and the question was, \"how many cents?\" each time, to the point he'd just scream, \"TEN CENTS!!!\" before writing it down, in an exasperated tone. He liked a sheet that was a color-by number. The writing he finds difficult and tiring. He is still reversing his Gs, and mixing upper and lower case letters. One of the sheets asked him to write a sentence using spelling words, and he seems to like that.  But the fact that I could get him to complete worksheets in ten-minute intervals, twice each afternoon, was incredible. Amazing. Not easy, but amazing.

{"date": "Thursday, March 11, 2010", "body": "\nTomorrow is supposed to be the first pre-IEP meeting, that touch-base where I hit up Joey's case manager with things I think the school folks should be thinking about as we start to do the IEP jig. These things are still mostly vague nigglings of things being wrong. Some are more solid ground, some are harder to lay a finger on. These are things I am still trying to process enough to express, because time seems to flash by before I can get a grasp on  anything  these days. It is time to rev the processing a bit, and get moving on the new powerpoint, because Joey is going to a new school next year. The new people kind of know who he is, because I get titchy about playing phone tag with the school principal (which I am  still  doing!) and kinda complained to the director of student services, who kinda let it be known that balls better start rolling or heads would. I understand they have sent some folks over to observe Joey, and that's fine. But even if they spent the whole day with him, they have seen him for, oh, seven hours, max. They need to know who this child is, and who I am, and what expectations we have for Joey and for the school.  One thing about making a powerpoint, it brings focus to the processing. It also is an exercise in balance. We want people to know both the good and the not-so-good, the strengths Joey has as well as his weaknesses. We want folks to know what kind of grasp we have of the situation and of Joey. We aren't one of those parents who never shows up for meetings and uses the school to baby-sit the kid. We expect progress, we expect support, we expect education.  We have been pleased with Joey's team these last few years, and we're going to be sorry to lose people who not only know Joey so well, but have a solid sense of how to support him and keep him on the straight and narrow. We've also been lucky enough to have an aide who can sign, and that helps more than people understand. With all the good, I'm a bit in a funk about the bad. Its a shock to see Joey not doing things, unable to do things, he was doing, or at least trying, in kindergarden. There is a lot of frustration that need to be addressed. Social issues of group play and dynamics, skills he needs to get on in the world, need to be considered. How do you teach a child how to figure out what a group of kids is playing? The isolation needs to be addressed.  With the warm days, we have been playing more outside, and have more neighborhood children around. One of these children is an older child with Asperger's Syndrome. I was supervising the little group of children, watching their game. It had something to do with farmers and bunnies, and chasing each other, and being tossed into a stew pot. It was really amusing. Then Joey came home. Joey didn't understand about the rabbit thing. He reverted to the little game he's been playing this week, where he pretends to have a pet mouse in a cage. Our aspie neighbor didn't miss a beat- he was the farmer, the other kids were rabbits, except Joey was a mouse, no problem. The game continued, but it became clear that Joey couldn't figure it out, and in the end, though he was in a swirl of children, he was very much alone. Attempts to get him to join the game were met with blank looks and confusion. Even trying to shift the game to meet his own didn't work. Our aspie neighbor wasn't totally blended in, but he wasn't completely isolated, either. He worked with the kids around him, they worked with him to all play together. Joey can't do that yet.  I want to know why. That may seem very obvious to many of you, but for me in the up-close, it isn't. It isn't as simple as being autistic. And why am I concerned? After all, I remember wandering off from other kids at that age, not interested in what they were playing, feeling isolated from the children around me. If he wants to be alone, is that so bad? Yet I can tell you that this is affecting him in ways that need to be addressed. It feeds into the frustration. It is feeding into some psychological issues that are being expressed in negativity. It is heartbreaking to hear Joey suddenly yell out, \"I am a  STUPID  BOY!\" every time he thinks he has done something wrong. He  wants  to join the game. You can see him trying to join in, trying to play with the other kids, trying to figure it out... and giving up.  I've got to pull my brain together and figure out how to help him keep trying, how to help him learn how to do this. We can't give up.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/03/pulling-brain-together.html", "title": "\nPulling the brain together\n"},

You go to funerals for your older relatives, as the generations shift and your parents become the Grandparents and you become the Parents. Funerals are places where you see older people gathered about remembering the good old days. At my age, you can still count how many people are missing from your high school class, your college class. It stings to lose someone, but death is still something Over There, something that happens in a natural shift of the world in time. Then comes that first death when it really hits you, these people are gone, and its just too soon to start going to funerals for your friends. Seriously. I'm not old enough to be doing this.  I sat in the back, because to be honest, I'm not likely to be high up on this person's lists of People I Think About. When he graduated high school, I wasn't even there yet. He was in the band with my brother, who was in high school. He and his twin brother would sometimes come to the house; I was so young, I couldn't even tell you why they were there, probably something to do with band practices and stuff, and they were friends of my brother. I remember my brother thinking the world of them. I remember them actually including me, talking to me, joking with me, as if I wasn't just the Little Sister, but just another part of the Band Folks.  Think about your own high school days. Do you remember those seniors and juniors who took notice of you? Do you remember those kids who came after you? Did you even think about kids that came in to high school after you had  left ? Yeah, I doubt I was very high on the list. My brother, possibly; there was no forgetting my brother once you had met him, especially then, when his zany humor was at its zenith.  I went alone to this one. Bringing the boys would not be a good idea,  spring fever  is upon us. I sat in the back with another woman who was also alone. She was a few years older than me, so likely that she went to school with the twins. I scanned the room, wondering why there weren't more young people my age (well, slightly older than me, but close enough) in the room; everyone looked to be at  least  forty.  Did you just palm-slap your head in my honor?  So much for the amusing part. It was a really nice service, but it was really wrenching to see the family in so much pain, people I have such respect for, people I have looked up to since I was just becoming a teenager, people who, to me, embody the kind of people I want to be- loving, inclusive, welcoming, honest, honorable people. This was a loss of a hero. Did I really know these people now? Not really. But the memory of who they were, of that feeling of being a part and not an outsider at that moment, its one of those things that help you through the rough patches of growing up, and you think about it. A lot.  I think about these people every day, from the time I get up to the time I fall asleep, even though they hardly know me at all.  Rest in peace, David Cross.

On another tree, the beds were opening into leaves.  I was suddenly reminded of  Helen Keller . I have always been struck with the story of her learning words.

Words meant something, and a whole new world opened up. Kind of like Andy understanding the sign for  candy .

{"date": "Monday, March 22, 2010", "body": "\nIt's been Garden Week here in JoeyWorld and AndyLand, and we have been working on our garden. I got it turned over Friday, so we were ready to go! Woo-hoo! So we took a trip to the garden center.  The big attraction at the garden center is not the gardens. It's the fish. They used to have a beautiful, lovely fish pond in one of the green houses, but I guess they got tired of being a favorite rainy-day activity and have moved everything outside. Oh, and expanded to a larger pond with more fish. After our fish adventures, I can't imagine folks spending huge money on outdoor ponds with carp, but maybe they are easier than indoor aquariums. Or whatever.  The boys cooed over the new fish pond and the fish, and then Andy ran around the back to look at the trees. He wanted to know what some of them were, but I expect he'll be more interested when they really start flowering and leafing. They were more interested in running through the narrow aisles, touching the different barks, and singing. Yes, indeed. Spring is here.  Then came time to Pick Out Seeds. Its still the first breaths of spring, and we're not usually ready this early to get planting, so we had to explain the concept of Spring Seeds and Summer Seeds. We can't plant squash or pumpkins right now, we have to plant things like turnips, spinach, and swiss chard. That sort of thing. Andy selected lettuce, Joey decided on carrots, and I got turnips (well, the boys decided I would get turnips). I sprung for the overpriced organic seed packets instead of trying to explain the them the concept of bulk seed, since we were using the little packets to explain the kinds of vegetables we could plant. Besides, it's helping the economy, right? And this was a local store, not a big chain thing.  Anyway, we proudly got to plant our garden yesterday. We had made an attempt at the park, but Andy cut his foot pretty badly (but not a stitches situation), so we went home early and got our garden planted instead. Now, our garden is only about 4 feet long and 2 feet wide, so I divided it into zones, which the boys designated colors. Andy is Zone Red, with his lettuce seed. Joey is Zone Green with his carrots. And I am Zone Yellow, with the turnips. I had each of them plant their own seeds. Andy got to spread his and lightly pat the soil over them. Joey got to do rows, which he found really exciting, since it involved digging with a stick. Then I let them both spread mine, and pat them in.  It rained over night a little, and is supposed to rain today. Wish us luck!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/03/planting-seeds.html", "title": "\nPlanting Seeds\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "body": "\nSometimes, when I am out with the guys, I get the feeling of being in a fishbowl. People sometimes notice my kids are different. Sometimes people look at Joey askance. Am I dreaming it? Am I over-sensitive? Is it just me?  And every time I start thinking, maybe it is just me,  I find stuff like this.**  And it isn't just the post- its the preponderance of comments supporting the post. It's not just one person being ignorant and judgmental, it's a whole crowd of them, who think it's funny. The point about teaching kids manners? I'm all over it. Making fun of someone who is teaching those manners, simply because they are in the middle of the lesson instead of at the end of it? Not. Cool.  And it is one of the reasons we don't go to the library much, to be honest. After all, Joey does a similar thing- he notes his small steps to success. \"I'm being patient, Mom!\" \"Look, Mom, I am keeping my hands to myself!\" \"Mom! I am being nice to my brother!\" But let's leave that aside, and instead come to the park with me and the guys. The sun is warm, there are people laughing, kids playing. A young woman, somewhere in her teen years, comes up to Joey and waves for him to follow her. The way she holds her hands, her head, the over-extension of her joints, her difficulty with speech, all speak of special needs. Joey doesn't understand, I prompt him that the girl wants to play with him. They start a game of tag.  Some other young ladies, these girls may be fifteen, join in. The girl likes to tickle people. We tickle back. She likes Andy's new toy, and they play with it for a while, before he is distracted by another boy his own age. There is more tag, some hide-and-seek. Joey goes over to a bench where two moms are parked with their toddlers, and they let him play with a baby doll with their daughter. There is more running, some frisbee-tossing attempts, more tag, more tickling.  Are people thinking less of this young lady because she doesn't follow social rules? Because she flaps her hands, wants to play tag, likes to squeal when a dog barks? No, even the other teenagers here just join into the fun. Are people thinking less of my Joey, even though they can tell his speech in unusual, his social skills not quite on par? No, they let him be himself and join into the fun.  Compassion is a wonderful thing; acceptance is far more fun; and sunshine is for everybody to share and share alike. Everybody wins. **Edit: If you really need to see the original post and comments, I have a PDF of the original post and comments, which have been removed from the original link.

We are changing schools again, so we head into a new world with new people, who really don't know Joey. It is time to think about his strengths, his weaknesses, and most of all... his human-ness. The point of this powerpoint is not only to help focus my own thinking, but to emphasize Joey as more than a number and a list on paper, but as a real, living child.  Both of my kids have after-school moods. I am sure yours do, too. Andy comes home, ready to bounce off the walls and chatter about everything. Joey comes home and is often out of words, out of energy, and ready to hop onto his computer and play games there- nice, predictable games like Wow Wow Wubbsy- complicated enough to be entertaining, but clear enough to be predictable and complete-able. He's going to totally rock at Sonic the Hedgehog when he gets around to it.  I sometimes wonder if I should allow the computer time after school. If I let him, he would play solidly from the time he gets home until bedtime (Joey does his homework at school while waiting for his bus to arrive). It can be a real challenge to draw him back into doing something else, especially if he has had a bad day. With the sunshine returning, playing outside does have appeal, which helps a lot.  On the other hand, letting him unwind is also important. The stress he must go through keeping himself together and focused all day must be incredible. That is one of the things I'd like to think about with the new IEP. The problems of regression I witnessed at field day is another.  I wonder how worried people get about such things when there isn't special education in the picture. That balance between meeting needs and micro-management is a fine line to walk here. Perhaps that line gets crossed with lessons and sports and what-have-you these days.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/04/letting-things-unwind.html", "title": "\nLetting things unwind\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 06, 2010", "body": "\n We support the  Team WhyMommy Virtual Science Fair , because WhyMommy totally totally rocks, and we want her to know: we love you. Thank you for being an awesome mom and a cool person. We haven't actually met, but you've been a huge help to me and to my family. Thank you.  I had out some other experiments to do with my guys for the WhyMommy Virtual Science Fair, and we'll do those, but it may be Thursday. Or Friday. Or maybe next week. Because today was too beautiful to be inside doing boxed science experiments- it was sunny, it was warm, and the petting zoo called to us. Oh, and  Yoder's Store . So instead of learning about magnets and stuff, we went out into the world and learned about some of our favorite things: goats, chickens, and ducks (and other assorted fowl).  What did we learn today? Well, we learned that goat tongues stick tickle when they lick corn off your hand. We learned that baby goats know better than to get in the way of big goats when there is a prospect of corn involved. We learned that if you feed enough corn to the big goats, they get full enough that they make room for the baby goats. Oh, and Andy decided he really  loves  baby goats. That's my boy! Joey learned that chickens make noise, and there are lots of different kinds of chickens; including one with feathers all over its head, like a big mop! He also learned not to throw corn at the chickens, but to toss it in. He learned that chickens also like to eat grass and chickweed (the boys also learned that ducks  LOVE  to eat grass and chickweed- much more than they like corn). He learned that if you bark at a rooster, it might crow at you. He also learned that it is not easy to pet a chicken.  Andy learned that if you put a quarter into the vending machine, it gives you cracked corn. He learned that Mommy is smart enough to bring a whole roll of quarters with her when she knows they are going to go feed goats. He also learned how to reach into Mommy's pocket himself when she was busy in order to get a quarter.  This place also has one of those fun goat ramps where you put the corn in a little cup and run it up to a platform where the goat awaits the feast. and get plenty of exercise and climbing in to get to said platform. Andy thought this was hilarious. My mom noted that a goat is supposed to eat about two cups of grain a day. The goat that braved the ramp while Andy was there got about two cups of food in about fifteen minutes.  We did learn that you pull on one side to the rope to send the cup up, and the other side to bring it back down, so we got to learn about pulleys. Kind of. Sending the cup up and down was the most fun ever. I finally had to encourage him to go feed some of the other poor, starving goats.  Joey is getting bolder about petting the goats and being near the animals. He loves animals, and he loves touching them, but they move in unpredictable (for him) and sudden ways, and that can make Joey very anxious. Today, he actually patted the goats' heads and ears without a lot of fuss, and held his hand steady to feed them without my help or prompting. That was pretty exciting, because tickling goat tongues on your palm can be pretty intense. Joey learned that some goats have soft heads and velvety noses, and that the noses of goats are not wet.  He learned that if you have a hand full of corn, the goats come over to see you faster. He learned that goats also like grass and chickweed. He was impressed that some of the goats had horns. He was very quiet and gentle with the animals today, not squealing and pulling back and making sudden jumps like he used to. We had  zero  tracking of the fences today! Andy learned that chickens are soft and feathery. When Grandma asked him what they felt like, he answered, \"meat.\" I assume that means they felt delicious... (?) He was very excited to actually touch a chicken. He also had a look at the turkeys and pheasants, though they are harder to get good pics because of all the chicken wire (to keep the foxes out). My guys are still a bit  traumatized by turkeys .  Hey mom, can I have another quarter?  Hi, Stimey!

{"date": "Friday, April 16, 2010", "body": "\nI don't often sign an IEP at the end of an IEP meeting. My usual  modus operandi  is to take it home, show JoeyAndyDad, discuss it with my mom, think about it some more, have some more conversations with JoeyAndyDad and mom, and then sign it, already compiling the issues for the next IEP meeting.  And I recommend this  modus operandi  to all of my readers. There is no hurry to sign an IEP, especially if the meeting was tense or ugly or uncomfortable. You can at least get a little of your own back by making them wonder if you're going to sign or sue. If you know what I mean.  But Joey has a case manager who rocks. She's got his back. She knows what to insist on, and insists on it, which has a heck of a lot more weight than me insisting on it, because she's school personnel and knows what she's doing and has been working with Joey for three years and has a pretty solid grasp of what he needs to access the curriculum and an appropriate education. What am I going to do next year without her? (Yes, I know I'll step up and get it done, but it sure is a lot easier to have someone in that room batting directly for Joey whom the school recognizes as an authority). She looks at the stuff I send her, she thinks about what I am saying and what I am observing, and adds it in to what she knows and sees and thinks about. She makes sure the bases get covered, the dots and crosses get where they need to be, and that what Joey needs is in that IEP.  I'm a little less enthused about the people we are going to, but that is not a surprise, and I am certainly willing to give them the chance to be trained in Joey. They are unprepared for his needs, but we knew that. They are not prepared for his learning style, but we knew that. They seem caught off-guard by autism generally, but we kind of knew that, too. So I currently plan to spend a lot of time at school in the fall.  I also will have a meeting in the first six weeks. Our glorious OT is going to try to release Joey from OT direct service in October. Sensory issues? Ha! Social skills? Why would  that  be under OT? Met his daily living skills goals? Um... only  she  has witnessed him independently buttoning his own clothes or tying his own shoes. No one else in the room has ever seen him do these things for himself on his own clothes (and buttoning someone else's buttons is very different than buttoning your own). Bilateral coordination and crossing midline? Why would anyone need to be able to do that? Gross motor activities? He can walk, can't he? Why should I expect more?   Right. Already have the independent eval in the works. This. Will. Not. Do. However, it is just a matter of getting the evals in hand and presenting it in the fall. Or even in a few weeks. I can call a meeting any time I feel like it. Yay, me.  But Mrs. H wrote a solid IEP, and insisted on certain levels and types of service that got put in the IEP itself, and accommodations for things (including SOLs, which we had been warned they might not give accommodations for), so I think we're on the right road to where we need to go. We'll take a few steps and then take a look around and see where we are.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/04/iep-signed-sealed-delivered.html", "title": "\nIEP: Signed, Sealed, Delivered\n"},

{"date": "Monday, April 19, 2010", "body": "\n With all the exciting things happening and moving and shaking in the world, and a blog called \"Life with Joey\", my writing often overlooks the other half of the world, that veritable bundle of giggles and bounce we named Andy. Joey had an IEP and a baseball game and a lost tooth and lots of things going on, but Andy has lots going on, too.  When I made my first blog, eons ago and now long gone, I took the name Joeymom, because there was no Andy. That's how long ago it was. It becomes second nature to answer to it, as often in store or school or sports event field, the call of, \"Hey, Joey's Mom!\" means me. So it was kind of odd but lovely to have an event this weekend in which I was \"Andy's Mom.\"  Andy was invited to a birthday party. This is a regular occurrence with Andy, at least more so than with Joey. I'm always amazed by the awesome parties people give for their kids. We had one at Toddlin' Time quite a few years back, and it was awesome. But this one? Holy Cow. This was at a place called the  Paragon , and its a gymnastics center. I didn't get a lot of good photos, though I got some fab film I might get together for you, because it was dark and the kids moved constantly for about, oh, two hours. Constantly. On trampolines. This was definitely Andy's kind of party. It was so great, Andy actually  ate the pizza - crust and all- and the  cake , not just the icing! How awesome is that?  What was really hilarious was that this party was for Andy's good friend K. K is a little girl, and we realized they were in Andy's first preschool class together- and she adored him then, too. See, they're both into dinosaurs. Yes, at 5, that is a  huge  attraction between two little ones. Apparently K calls Andy her \"husband\" at home, and has already announced their impending engagement. (Other than the dinosaurs, she's very... pink. Adorable. And pink. So it's really, really cute.) We arrived at the party slightly early, because I'm like that, and the birthday girl arrived shortly thereafter with her family in two cars. As we watched them park, the mom almost leapt from her car to get K out of the other car- the child was so excited she had apparently tried to open the car door before the car had stopped- and K almost flew across the lot to Andy, squealing \"Andy! Andy! Andy!\" and upon reaching us, both of them bounced upon their toes and hand flapped in unison.  Please note that neither of these children is autistic. They were just  that  excited to see each other. They bounced in unison, then started running up and down the landscaped grass strip in front of the gym, which both I and K's mom were wise enough to allow, lest both children explode.  K followed Andy around the whole party. As long as Andy was doing it, K was into it, sometimes to her mom's apparent surprise- jumping, climbing, tumbling, off they went. Yes, she played with the other guests, but Andy had to be there. And Andy's height was only matched by a child four years older, who was there because his sister was there, and they were apparently cousins of K. A glorious time was had by all.  And did I mention Andy actually ate the cake?  I think I'm going to be in big trouble in, oh, ten years. Give or take.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S8xHiIM2rXI/AAAAAAAADUM/m-qD2woI5bY/s1600/04_boys_busstop.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S8xHhtEUnrI/AAAAAAAADT8/z3u7Q4oZvGA/s1600/05_andy_cake.jpg", "http://www.paragongymnastics.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S8xHhxbbyuI/AAAAAAAADUE/Fh54BioqJEI/s1600/05_andy_game.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/04/small-doings-of-weekend-being-andys-mom.html", "title": "\nSmall Doings of a Weekend: Being Andy's Mom\n"},

Only they have never screened, nor offered to screen, Joey.  I worry when one of the teachers in Andy's room says things like, \"He's such a delight!\" because it implies that if he was disabled by his ADHD, he wouldn't be (especially in the context in which it is said). And the reason right now that he isn't disabled by his ADHD is because he had a totally rockin' teacher in there- the  other  teacher.  I worry when teachers at Joey's new school react to suggestions for Joey's program with \"Oh, we've never had our teacher do  that  before.\" I especially worry when the suggestion is about providing him with social skills and language training- two fairly common needs for educating autistic kids.  I worry when the school SLP praises Andy's speech skills, when I have now seen and heard in him the company of whole rooms of peers, and can still hear how very different he sounds. Heaven forbid he get excited or upset, because then you can't understand him at all. (Did I mention the child has ADHD? Excited or upset happens a lot).  I worry when the discussion of ESY includes a program that had field trips every week, when every time he has a field trip at school, Joey gets off-kilter... often for days. Oh, and one of the weeks without an aide, in a room of 40 kids. I worry a  lot .  I worry when the reaction to having IEP goals about coping with teasing are scoffed at (\"we don't have  that  problem with  our  kids!\"), only have a serious teasing incident not a week later. The kind you have to really mull and process before blogging about.

Courtland played Spotsy at Courtland this evening, so Joey and I went to cheer on our friends. Now, this was a kind of odd situation. See, Joey's team is obviously Courtland, since all his helpers have been from there (and really, they have been fabulous!). But I went to high school at Spotsy. So it was very, very, very strange to be sitting in the Courtland stands, cheering for the boys in blue instead of big red. Very odd indeed.  We did get to see one of our friends make a home run, and another get on base. Joey was very excited about the home run. The game started after Joey's usual bedtime, so we only got to see a couple innings, but he insisted on getting a Courtland cap. It's always a good thing to support your friends.

{"date": "Saturday, May 01, 2010", "body": "\n Some time ago, I mentioned one of the haunts of my childhood, a place we called  the Emerald Walk . It is a stretch of bank along the river covered in moss, where I grew up. The entrance to the Emerald Walk was an outcrop of rock we scrambled over, and it ended just before the island in the river began, walking upstream. I spent many hours along this little stretch of bank when I was young, and the world moved more slowly, and life was a lot more lonely.  This was the world before widespread computers, before internet stretched into homes, before cell phones were attached to many ears. None of those thing, by the way, make the world less lonely. Just more noisy.  The world of the Emerald Walk was one where summers lasted forever, and you could spend whole afternoons stretched out on the cool moss and watch the leaves turn in the eddies, minnows flash through the current, river grass bob and sway as if in the wind, and if you strolled a little way down to the stream, there were frogs and tadpoles and fool's gold, and nice fine sand for making mountains that looked like melted sugar. The sun sparkled on the water and danced on the moss, filtering down through a shifting coolness of thick green canopy. Places like this are disappearing fast in a world that prefers Walmarts, cell towers, and asphalt.  I took the boys to the Emerald Walk today. I wish I could say it was a glorious introduction to a world of peace, or at least boyish adventure, to my little guys. At least it was something new for them to think about, a place that, to me, still spoke of dragons and fairies and all manner of wonder.  Joey did discover the joys of throwing things into the river, including a few clumps of moss. He howled at having to deal with the saplings and brush and steep slope down and up, though. I need to recut the old deerpath down to our old starting point, so that the descent to the river is a little easier. They could then enter as we used to, by way of the rocks. I'm not sure how well Joey will rock-scramble, though, even at this rudimentary level. I also couldn't convince them to actually step into the water.  They did do some playing, too. Andy brought his box of plastic frogs with him, in anticipation of finding real ones, and real tadpoles. And Joey threw things into the water. Perhaps they did recognize a little of the magic of the greenworld, after all. At least so long as we weren't scaling the steep slope or having to press through brush and trees and slippery leaves. Or walk through spider webs.  It might have helped if we had actually found some pollywogs. Although there were many, many changes to the river- there always are- there was still a nice spot in the stream for a tadpole nursery, though we appear to be between clutches, or at the very start (where the eggs would still be small and hidden in the algae and stream vegetation). The boys did get into the spirit later, when I pulled out their wading pool on the deck, and they played \"I'm an egg! Now I'm a tadpole! Now I'm a froglet! I'm a frog now!\"* However, it also did not help for me to look down on this end of the bank, beyond the Emerald Walk, and realize all that green around our feet is actually poison ivy.  And I can't deny that seeing your children play in places you loved does hold some kind of magic, a look back to echoes of a past that now is lost. Or perhaps found.  *Yes, we thought of you, Team Stimey.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S9zQhuSc6JI/AAAAAAAADWM/WjtST0t3sn0/s1600/emerald+walk.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S9zQo6VnRVI/AAAAAAAADWU/iCRrlJh5w5M/s1600/emeraldwalk2.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S9zPPU05uiI/AAAAAAAADV0/lHMs8z3hUaw/s1600/01_boys_emeraldwalk2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S9zPFDqwXMI/AAAAAAAADVs/geQ6g9C0paE/s1600/01_joey_emeraldwalk.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S9zPAGByidI/AAAAAAAADVk/RDMeDIyqUks/s1600/01_boys_emerald_play.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S9zO7bBwDkI/AAAAAAAADVc/pADAisWDebQ/s1600/01_boys_swimhole.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S9zOz39i4NI/AAAAAAAADVU/8N-wC_8rN8U/s1600/01_boys_emeraldwalk_far.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/05/on-emerald-walk.html", "title": "\nOn the Emerald Walk\n"},

{"date": "Monday, May 17, 2010", "body": "\n This week's adventure was a trip to the Renaissance Faire, which opened at the Lake Anna Winery this weekend, and runs (weekends only) through June. It is $8 per person for everyone 6 and older, free for under 6 (Andy was free! Last time!), and we had a roaringly good time. Maybe a little bit of a roller-coaster, but what did I expect for taking two kids who decided to wear long sleeves to a strange place full of people wearing funny clothes?  Andy started shy, but Joey jumped in with both feet. He learned about sword fighting, and then played tambourine with the wandering minstrels (who really do stop and sing to you!), and then got right down to business learning to write with a quill, and showing off how well he can already write with a quill. That's my boy!  Andy started warming up when he found the toy box and dress-up center. The Faire is arranged in a large ring of Stuff to Buy around an open field, but there is a back walk in the woods, with more Stuff to Buy. Among the Stuff to Buy are various stages with something always going on, and in the field, they are playing Renaissance games (you can join in!) or dancing (you can join in!) or putting on impromptu naval battles (yep! Join in!). For folks who remember the old Virginia Wine Festival, it isn't as big, but very similar set-up, and yeah, it works very well for the Ren Faire, too. :) The back woods also had stages and things to do, including some games (throw battle axes, 3 throws for $2!) and a lot of the children's stuff, and the Queen's Court- really smart, as it was shady and lovely. The kid's section (Poppet's) included crafts that changed every half-hour or so, and could be done for free (though donations for materials accepted).  We did catch the Archery Show (there are folks who wander around in costume telling you what's going on when, and what shows are about to start and where they are), and the boys liked the arrows and the shooting. The archery guy wasn't too impressed with us, however, and seemed to have minimal experience with children. He kinda got annoyed that JOey was moving around and asked questions over and over.  We started off as the only ones there, which worked OK, but when more folks came and he basically restarted the program (which was understandable- it was a cool trick shot with four arrows!), we took our leave and got out of the way. Andy wanted to toss axes, so we did that instead.  We got some ice cream and a drink, and then wandered back over to the armoury to take a peek. This was out in the sun more, and it was getting pretty hot, but I hoped the ice cream would hold them until I could scout around for food stalls, which were not immediately apparent. Joey got interested in the helmets.  So this is what I saw: a happy Joey trying on helmets and giggling, and a gentleman enjoying watching him giggle and trying on the different helmets. Happy child. Not ten feet away. Lovely.  Let's turn to the other child, who is busily pestering the guy talking about the pikes and spears. What's that one? What's that one? Oooh, why is that one all spiky? Happy child, not ten feet away, but ten feet away in a slightly different direction. What could go wrong?  Both of these photos are prelude to a melt down. I have no clue what happened. I was taking the picture of Andy when the Wail of Warning went up, and I turned to find Joey making a break for the woods at top speed. Much to the annoyance of the staff, I darted into the woods after him, with Andy on my heels, both of us calling for Joey. Oh, and several folks in funny clothes right on  our  heels, explaining to me none-too-patiently that we weren't allowed back there. No kidding! I finally had to stop and explain that Joey was autistic, that I would get him, that I understood we were not allowed back there, this was not me allowing him to run (what idiots are these?), and could they please back off, they were scaring him?  I managed to get him back to a tent and calmed down some, and Andy went back to the pikes (and the folks, once they understood, were actually very helpful), and one of the folks who hadn't run after us, but remember Joey from earlier, came over and sat down to talk to him a little and help calm him down. After another brief melt, I figured out that Mom the Idiot needed to feed her children lunch.  So we found the food, bought some, and headed back to the woods to consume it. Corns dogs, fish and chips, cold drinks, yay! With everyone feeling better, we returned to Poppets to see what craft was happening and take a breath. They boys rediscovered the toy area.  Since they were happy, I let them dress up and play to their heart's content. Andy became a cowboy. Joey was a \"boy princess\", which I explained was a prince, so he became \"Doctor Prince\"- who helped animals who are sick, and wears a beautiful crown. Happy boys.  Joey talked to himself in the mirror, and announced himself to all and sundry, as Andy played on the horse and explored the other toys. At one point, we had a good crew of dressed-up kids running about, though most of the kids (and most of the adults!) came already in full costume!  Then we had a puppet play, and the boys now want me to make a stage and puppets. I have a surprise.  They  are going to make the puppets.  Then the craft of the hour was making dolls, and the boys wanted one, so they got busy making dolls. That was lovely, though Andy wasn't so keen on knots, and wanted his doll to have a red hat. I made him one when we got home.  Then came the Knighting Ceremony! Joey was knighted by the Queen, along with many of the other children. We got cool certificates and Joey got a pin, but Andy was too nervous to be knighted at the ceremony. Too many people in funny (but gorgeous!) clothes. Oh, and there was a real sword involved.  After the ceremony, we were permitted audience with the Queen. Joey got up and let everybody know he liked math, and the very gracious Queen chatted with him for a minute before sending him to the treasure box for a present. These people knew what they were doing with this. During the Knighting, they knew where parents needed to stand to get good photos, and insisted on waiting until parents were in position and ready before doing the knighting. Then they made sure everybody was happy with the photos before moving on. She did the same for the audience, making sure everyone got the \"portraits\" they wanted with their \"faerie boxes.\"  Joey picked a coin from the treasure box. He was very pleased with it, and ran about showing everyone in the glade. Seeing a treasure box made his brother bolder- a chance for a toy! Wow! We were all about that!  So up brave Andy went, and even gave the Queen a hug! She talked to him for a while, then asked if he was ready now to be knighted. He said yes, so the ceremony commenced! So I now have two Defenders of the Realm, Sir Joey and Sir Andy! Andy was also fascinated by the jewels on the Queen's gown, which she thought amusing.  Huzzah, Sir Andy! For being so brave, he got to pick two prizes- a red glass pebble and a coin! (He didn't get a pin, because he  didn't get knighted in the first ceremony, and the girl with the pins was gone).  We went on to play more games, and buy wooden swords. I couldn't take pictures because I was holding two iced lemonades and handing out money.  So overall, a good time had by all. Put on your medieval duds and head over there. Oh, and they serve beer, wine, and hard cider, they card you at the front and give you a bracelet, and the pub looked lovely, and had lots of singing and stuff going on. The folks at the front laughed when I explained I didn't want a bracelet- I had two little guys to keep up with, I needed my wits. Definitely worth the $8. Much better than a movie.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E9HpJlSNI/AAAAAAAADbE/JfmqejQSoNg/s1600/01_joey_sword.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E9HfCZhSI/AAAAAAAADa8/Pu2yVFfUFwk/s1600/01_joey_writing.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E9HB12OeI/AAAAAAAADa0/qcUHODUExHQ/s1600/01_andy_toysbox.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E87S3e-fI/AAAAAAAADas/8zwl4YlessM/s1600/01_boys_archery.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E87GLtrqI/AAAAAAAADak/TFuHRucBLpI/s1600/01_andy_archery.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8686-7CI/AAAAAAAADac/EzbJdtG4nlI/s1600/01_joey_helmets.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E86pUHdTI/AAAAAAAADaU/nM3y1jAN1uA/s1600/01_joey_helmettry.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E86RN_mPI/AAAAAAAADaM/kHYbh70zl_o/s1600/01_andy_pikes.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8rxlKEXI/AAAAAAAADaE/lMV5tu_oBdw/s1600/01_boys_toybox.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8rvi938I/AAAAAAAADZ8/URKcjPDZzNI/s1600/01_boys_toybox2.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8rQ5XTdI/AAAAAAAADZ0/fA2_yu13Xk4/s1600/01_boys_toybox3.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8rB-uM4I/AAAAAAAADZs/S3H-j7YTrvA/s1600/01_boys_puppets.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8qw6EBmI/AAAAAAAADZk/nnevQodMGxU/s1600/01_joey_sirjoey.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8afLxN_I/AAAAAAAADZc/yfv_eekUp3w/s1600/01_joey_sirjoey_queen.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8aFWRjaI/AAAAAAAADZU/K9W8e5tACIA/s1600/01_joey_sirjoey_prize.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8Z5MIh_I/AAAAAAAADZM/HdKPHAf5dPw/s1600/01_andy_queen.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8ZpU7sNI/AAAAAAAADZE/PmVy4NDGp2M/s1600/01_andy_sirandy.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/S_E8ZWp3V7I/AAAAAAAADY8/scSNvavqrHw/s1600/01_andy_sirandy_prize.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/05/renaissance-faire.html", "title": "\nRenaissance Faire\n"},

Apparently the Courtland baseball season is coming to a close (Courtland is first seeded!), so the volunteers are now thin.  He had a nice game, even hitting a ball to the outfield! He's becoming one of the big hitters for his team! He's also running better. It is amazing what a little focus on a skill can do for Joey, and a little motivation. He is losing that toddler trot and even leans forward a little to run to a base.  It is striking to see all the Challenger kids working so hard, even as they are having a good time. I suppose all play and activity is really \"therapy\" for everyone, but most folks don't call it that, or even think about it. Joey gets upset when he doesn't get to field a ball, but he's still learning to pay attention to the game enough to know when it is coming-  before  one of the other kids gets the ball. We have a child who goes around the bases in a walker, their dad cheering them on every step of the way. We have a child learning to pitch, working on coordination. We have a child in a wheelchair who likes to play shortstop, and lets folks know it. We have a child who can spin the bat around their hand like a fancy sword move. We have a child who is a runner, and just being out there playing a game is a challenge. We have kids who have been doing this for four years, and some, like us, who are new. They are, each and every one, absolutely amazing. Maybe I ought to write a play. Joey and I worked on playing second base, but that wasn't really good for him, not enough balls coming his way to hold his interest. JoeyAndyDad had him more in the infield later on, and that was better in some ways- more balls hit his way- and not in others- more kids up there trying to field the ball and crowding Joey out. He also doesn't like getting tagged (he knows from school that when he's tagged, he's supposed to be out).  We still encourage him to steal home.

He can handle a variety of settings and an elaborate schedule, have 15 different teachers and four whole different classes of schoolmates, but he has to know exactly when he will go to which place and what to expect there. In trying to piece together placements, I get a lot of comments to the tune of, \"Oh, let's put Joey here, he'll be such a big help to [someone else's kid]!\"  Riding out to Grandma's, the boys are already hot and tired, and its not even 10 am. Andy is screaming for silence. Joey is chanting, but there are no words there, no soundification, just odd tones and squeals. It isn't his usual stim. The more Andy squeals for quiet, the louder Joey chants.  \"What's up, Buddy?\" I call back, a cue to them that Mommy has had enough of the noise and bickering.  \"I wan Doey t'stop dat NOISE!\" Andy complains.  \"I'm being Ethan*!\" Joey giggles, and goes into another round of the chant. I frown. Ethan is a child in Joey's class, and it hits me how exactly Joey is copying the non-verbal child. I know Joey gets upset when he knows he is being mocked; but this isn't exactly mocking, it is taking on another's oral stim, though he has taken it on partly because the sounds amuse him.  Joey helps Ethan. He is a good model for classroom behavior, for oral communication, for regulation, compared to where Ethan is in his development. What does Ethan do for Joey?  \"We need to be respectful of our classmates and friends, even when they aren't here,\" I remind him. \"Please find something else to say.\" But there are no current chants to redirect him, and he soon lapses into Ethan Sounds. He's hot, he's tired, the sounds are amusing and comforting, and they vibrate his mouth in a way I know he particularly likes.  Last year, there was a parent who complained about Joey being in a mainstream class with their child. They were unaware that I was the parent of \" that  child\", standing next to them as they demanded what my child did for theirs. If teaching their child acceptance and patience wasn't enough for them, perhaps Joey also taught their child math? After all, Joey's a shining star in the subject. But what do other kids teach other kids? Social skills? Language use? The latest cultural trends? Can't my child have something different to offer? Another way of thinking about the world and expressing those thoughts, maybe?  Yet we face the issue of Ethan Sounds, and often the behaviors of other children. Just like normal kids who pick up bad habits and bad words from school, Joey picks up on what his classmates do. Only to be honest, if a regular kid grows up to say \"damn!\" (or worse), they won't become a social pariah, even if we find the word crude. But a child who picks up biting, or soundification, or a plethora of ritualized and repetitive behaviors to then ritualize and repeat, will find themselves in a difficult position to find employment. When a non-autistic child picks up a poor adult behavior, it blends in with the crowd of poor adult behaviors that have become social norms. When an autistic child picks up on poor adult behavior, it appears to be magnified and make them stand out all the more.  Yet we must weave together strengths and weaknesses, create a fabric of services and educational models that can hold everyone, and act as a safety net when they stumble. Everyone has something to share. That is what inclusion is all about.  *Name changed.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/05/all-for-one-and-one-for-all.html", "title": "\nAll for one, and one for all\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 18, 2010", "body": "\nJoey graduated from second grade today. He will be moving on the upper elementary, that new school where the idea of teaching social skills and increasing language development seem to be alien concepts, and waxed floors trump all else. Today, Joey finished his life at the lower elementary, and we said goodbye to the team of Ms. H and Ms. Macy, who have supported him and had his back for three years.  The second graders presented what they had learned in a serious of songs, by class, to the school. Joey's class did social studies, singing about China and Egypt (Joey's half of the class did the Egypt Song, and he was so happy, he loves Egypt stuff). Then they has a slide show of their year, each class showing a few pictures and set to music; Joey had some darling pictures there. The kids got excited to see themselves on screen, and sang along with some of the songs. It was adorable.  However, you can imagine the hub-bub when the lights came on. The noise crescendoed when it was discovered one of the classes was left out, and it was announced that the missing slides would be fetched and the children all get to see them. Joey was unhappy, and came to me to sit in my lap and be hugged. The noise was too much. Ms. Macy came for him, asked if he needed a break, and he said yes; and even after more hugs, and some wistful looks in my direction, he decided he still needed to get out of the noise and be quiet for a bit. I was so proud of him when he told Ms. Macy he still needed a break, that it was too loud. As the rest of school- including his other two autistic classmates- got to their feet in an impromptu celebration dance and sing-along while waiting for the missing slides, Joey and Ms. Macy slipped quietly away from the auditorium and the din.  My baby is growing up. He's leaving second grade. He can control himself, ask for hugs and accept a break instead of melting down when overwhelmed. He can stand in front of his school and sing and sign about Egypt. He's doing so well. But he can't join into an impromptu celebration, and dance with his classmates, and squeal and wiggle with them. In the midst of such progress, there is also that reminder of the gulf that stands between my child and his ability to live in a society not made for him. Will the next set of school folks understand? How long will it take for them to understand, to pick up on the communication and cues he gives us that are not words? How much will he suffer until they do?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/06/end-of-era.html", "title": "\nEnd of an Era\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 19, 2010", "body": "\nHappy summer, everybody! School's out, and it is time to celebrate! We kicked off our summer season with a trip to the pool with our  across-the-street-neighbor we adore , a rousing success. Then we got to stay up to watch a few extra Looney Tunes, before bouncing to bed. They were so excited, it was well after 9 before they dropped off.  Then we had Andy's game this morning. Coaching the T-Ball has been an adventure. The other team look snappy, but they are handling things in ways I just think aren't good for 6-year-olds. Encouraging base-stealing in T-Ball? Trying to play through a thunderstorm? Seriously, there are ways of teaching competition without teaching to put others down or that you're so-all-that and better than the other. Our team is learning about respect, teamwork, and having fun. We're working on hitting the ball and what the different positions are. We change up and let kids try different things, and rotate who is in the busier parts of the field so everybody gets a chance to make a play.  \"You need somebody else on first base!\" the volunteer-parent-umpire pulled me aside to whisper. Yes, we have a kid who is a great first base player. We decided to put him back on first base for the third inning, but let a couple other kids try it out for the first two innings. And yeah, they needed help and work and instruction and practice. So we gave them some.  It isn't like we're keeping score, people!  Then there was the irate parent who had a kid who was supposed to be on the other team, but was then told they had moved him to our team, but the wasn't on our roster, he was on the other team's roster, and naturally the parents were upset. I solved that one quickly. \"Thank you, Ma'm; he's now on the Red Team, and we're happy to have him. Here, dear, put on this shirt. You're number 6. Go Red!\" Yes, the kid needed lots of extra help today. He actually hit the ball on his second at-bat, and was so proud. In the third inning, he made it all the way to homeplate. He was almost as proud of himself as I was of him!  Respect, Teamwork. Fun. It will take them much farther in life than \"screw the other team.\"  Then we got Joey to  Toy Story 3 , and I believe my son is in love. He went with his Daddy, just him and his Daddy, and saw the movie he has been waiting for... for months. Dreams can come true, people.  Andy and I went to Walmart. I am making some trellises for my morning glories and I wanted paint. He wanted  Zhu Zhu Pets . He settled for a couple new beds for the new pets Grandma just got him. We will not discuss how it might take me about 15 minute to stitch one up at home, and be a tenth of the price. No, we will not. We then went home and let him play with his Zhu Zhu Pets while I made fruit salad for a picnic-party for some folks I knew in high school.  Now, I must say the point of me going to this picnic was a little complicated. For one, I had actually been invited. I was never invited to anything when I was in high school. For two, the person who invited me was not only the person setting it up, but it is a person I would actually like to see and speak to, and there aren't many of those from high school. If you remember me mentioning it before, I hated high school. There was also a possibility of there being plenty of other kids there, since most of the folks I knew who had been invited to the party has micro-blogged about having kids.  So  picked the boys up from the movies, picked up JoeyAndyDad's shiny new toy (a blue Jeep!), and then after a nice spin in the new car, we were off to the party. I am sure most of you are screaming or moaning at the screen already. How much of an idiot can I be? All that in one day? And Joey at a party full of people he doesn't know, after having been to the movies? Please don't break your computer screen bonking your head against it. They're expensive to replace.  So the picnic was Epic FAIL. Joey was hot. He was tired. They had a DJ, and the volume would be normal for most of us- we were having conversations without having to raise our voices or anything- but it was too loud for Joey. Andy made a little friends, but that was the only other child there over the age of, oh, two. I tried taking him to the far side of the house, to increased shade and muffling of the music, but it was already too late. I should have known when to pack it in. Poor JOey was completely overwhelmed, and the meltdown as dramatic as I have seen in a long time. My friend who invited me kindly helped me get Joey to the car, with our chairs and cooler, and grab Andy, and everything, to facilitate our hasty retreat. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  We stopped at Grandma's for hugs and kisses and regaining our bearings before heading home for dinner and bed. The boys played with their Zhu Zhu Pets in the nice quiet, cool basement for a bit before being dunked in the bathtub and passing out. I then proceeded to read Joey's eval report that came in the mail today. Eep.  Ups and downs. And that was just the first day of summer.

We actually had a harder time with the heat than we had at Jamestown, partly because they guy who usually sells water in the gardens didn't show.  Joey took his Zhu Zhu Pet, to make sure they got to pet the goats and stuff.  So we did some goat petting, and some looking at the peacock and the chickens and the pigs. Then we wandered into the zoo, to see the bears and stroll through the gardens.  We stopped at the pavilions along the way to stay rested and cool. We also joined up with another little family who was equally disappointed by the lack of water in the garden. Fortunately, the stand in the zoo opened up.   Joey got hot the quickest, as he is heavier and doesn't like heat at all in the first place. He actually handled things very well.  We did enjoy the Japanese garden, which has a waterfall and lots of shade to keep things cool. When Joey tripped, the other mom got to him even faster than I did (that's saying something!) to help him, and all was well, no melting. Thank you, other mom! Andy and our neighbor enjoying running about the rocks and over the stepping stones in the pond, though we had no cracker to feed the fish and the ducks. Most of the ducks were wisely sleeping, anyway.  After the hot walk, even with snowcones, we cooled off at the nature center and watched the otters play for a while.  Maymont is unfortunately no longer free. This isn't a big deal for us, as we are members, but it was sad to see admission, and that the nice gift shop had been dismantled. Another casualty of the recession. But they had done a lot of upgrading in the nature center, lots of maintenance, and things were looking good. It was also quieter than usual, which makes a big difference for my little guys.  And so our summer has begun. Next week: Andy heads to Hazelwild, and Joey and I have Science Camp!

{"date": "Monday, August 16, 2010", "body": "\n There is no place on earth Joey loves better than the beach. He looks forward to our beach trip every year with enthusiasm. Say \"beach\" to Joey, and if he hears you, he smiles. So the boys' grand arrival at the beach was, as always, a hit. First we put our feet in the sand, no camera so we could just enjoy and not worry about the camera getting wet.  Then the next day, it was time to hit the boards- and Trimper's, of course! The boys were so excited- better than Christmas!  Andy's favorite is the fishing the game, which is kind of a fancy version of pick-up-a-duck. Getting a stuffed toy every time helps its popularity, but fishing really clinches it. Now that we are home, Andy wants to set up a carnival of his own, and a fishing game is to be the centerpiece. (Stay tuned).  Joey also joined in the fun of fishing, and caught two sharks, so he got a bigger prize. Joey prefers the rides. Andy prefers the games.  Joey was so happy, the noise of the rides and the people were tolerable, if not exactly comfortable. Joey has had a huge uptick in noise sensitivity. Even at home, he prefers the TV set to a volume I can barely hear, and is increasingly unhappy about going into places that used to be only minor irritations, such as Walmart or the grocery store. I had his earplugs along, just in case, but he was fine without them.  We got the boys wristbands, so they could ride as often as they liked. They both would take several spins on their favorites, and tried a few others. The roller coasters are now a great favorite, even with Andy.  One problem with Trimper's is a lack of shade. They have benches, but almost all of them are in bright, sunny locations, and are therefore of limited use. To get cooled off, the best option is to slip into the indoor section, where the kids' rides and the carousel are, and sit on a bench near the door to take advantage of cross breeze.  One of the rides the boys tried was a pirate ship that was something like a funhouse. You go in and it rocks, and there are little sections of things to walk through, like big rubber bands or moving floors, and on either end are little rooms with fake pirate scenes in them. Then you go up onto the deck and slide down a big moving slide. Andy wandered in while Joey was taking an extra turn on the roller coaster, but he decided it was too scary and he didn't like it.  The boys then played games and won lots of prizes. Joey's favorite games are the water pistols- he seems to beat Mommy a lot at those. Andy like the frogs ponds and Whack a Mole, both of which require you to beat on things. Hmmmm... While Andy was taking a turn at a game, Joey decided to check out the pirate ship. In he went, and I directed my attention to the slide, as Andy had not been in the ship long, and I figured JOey would probably run right through, too. However, the film of them sliding down stuff is often nice, they like slides.  Only he never appeared.  I started getting nervous. He had been in there a while. Alan had the brilliant idea of asking Andy to go look for his brother, even though he thought the ride was a little scary. A minute later, he came down the slide and said Joey wasn't there.  Baffled, I bought the required tickets and went in myself. Sure enough- no Joey. Can you say, \" panic \"? I came back out to see Allan leading Joey over to Grandma and Andy (having that extra set of hands is a godsend, I can tell you)- he had decided he was hot, and gone in to the shady indoor section to cool off, smart little guy. Nearly gave us a heart attack, but we were cheering that he was recognizing his needs and thinking of ways to meet them, rather than melting down. And besides, he was OK, and we now had him.  We all went in and let the boys ride the carousel to their hearts' content. Joey rode it six times. Andy went four, then wandered over the the bumper cars (the kid ones- he's really in-between the kiddie ones and the big ones, but he's definitely NOT ready for the big ones).  When Joey finally decided to change animals, he gave his giraffe a hug and kiss.  Andy first rode a deer, then fell in love with the sea dragon. We were impressed with him voluntarily riding it. Remember, two summers ago, we couldn't get him on anything at all! Carousels are actually a lot more exciting than they look- the speed and passing all the lights and colors and people, it can be really something.  Joey rode it until he almost fell asleep. And so ended our first Trimper's adventure. But don't worry. We went back.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TGmdnRfLblI/AAAAAAAADnM/ice0B3vC_FA/s1600/01_boys_boardwalk.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TGmdnIMDYGI/AAAAAAAADnE/aIiV3qm1oYI/s1600/01_andy_fishing.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TGmdmxoATdI/AAAAAAAADm8/6Y8XVOsvrjE/s1600/01_joey_fishing.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TGmdanZAzyI/AAAAAAAADm0/HcAdV5L9BkM/s1600/01_boys_rollercoaster.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TGmdafMa63I/AAAAAAAADms/AOtafZLe-c8/s1600/01_boys_waterpistols.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TGmdZ-O73rI/AAAAAAAADmk/wBBrx-hcKE8/s1600/01_joey_giraffe.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TGmdZrJ1aZI/AAAAAAAADmc/r37uykJazi4/s1600/01_andy_dragon2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TGmdZT9x0NI/AAAAAAAADmU/sp876NqiAYg/s1600/01_joey_chariot.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/08/arrival-beach-part-one.html", "title": "\nArrival: The Beach Part One\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 19, 2010", "body": "\n Not every side attraction was a complete disaster. The ride to them, yes. The destination, not always. For example, we decided to take a ride to \"North Ocean City\" to see the  Discoversea Shipwreck Museum  (which is free!). Joey was not fooled. He knew we were driving, and it was longer than ten minutes. Chaos reigned all the way to Fenwick Island.  When we arrived, the museum is actually on the second floor of a schlock shop. We got a little nervous, and Joey's anxiety was almost overwhelming, as the shop was crammed with... schlock.  Then we managed to get upstairs, with much coaxing and promises of pirate gold. It's a darling little museum of items found in the area from shipwrecks. The labeling convinced me that the curators are either bad at labeling, or are not really sure what they have, but the objects are actually pretty decent. They also had quite a bit of information about actually collecting items and how underwater archaeology is done, including a really cool model showing what a shipwreck looks like compared to the boat exploring the wreck above. That kind of caught Joey's attention, enough to keep him in the room. Andy was fascinated (he's discovered a love for  Time Team,  too. That's my boy!) Andy spent a lot of time looking at the objects, including this \"mermaid\" (which he knew right away wasn't real, smart boy). He liked all the sparklies (I did mention this child is my son, right? Like there was any doubt now...) and the pirate stuff, since he had been on something of a pirate kick and even on a pirate adventure (to be blogged about later). He wasn't quite as interested in the china and pots as I was, but the coins and jewelry rocked his world.  As I prefaced this, the trip was not a complete loss. Although mildly distracted by the shipwreck model, what really caught Joey's eye was the baby blue crab and fish in a small, floor-level tank, He plopped himself down in front of that sucker and stayed there happily for half an hour, while Andy explored the museum. Then he happily went downstairs and picked out toys and a bag of tumbled stones with his brother, and complained about the ride all the way back to the hotel.  He liked that tank so much, when some of the stones got broken on the hard tile floor and the boys were antsy in gray weather, we actually drove back and went again!  We also had a much-anticipated yearly visit to  Hooper's Crabhouse . This is just across the bridge, so no long ride to complain about; and JOey had been talking about wanting to go from the time we announced the date we would be arriving at Ocean City. Strangely, neither of them ate much. Andy staunchly refused to eat crab (wait, did I say this was  my  child? How can any child of mine not eat  crab ?), except the legs, since he could smash them with the hammer (ok, I'll still claim him).  Joey got too frustrated to pick one. However, he did not refuse any crab meat offered him until he got too full to eat anything at all. That didn't actually take that long; anxiety slows Joey's stomach way down.  So crabby boy because something of a theme through the trip, to the chorus of \"Let's go back to the hotel!\" (said in a sing-song, \"Let's go to camp now!\" sort of voice). Oh, and those morning trips to the surf? The first morning we went out and the sun hit his eyes, and he he had to walk all the way back to the hotel room to use the restroom almost immediately after reaching the waves, that was the end of those.  So how did we manage to get him out of the hotel room? Stay tuned...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TG3sIUuFm3I/AAAAAAAADo8/sWSCvnoF8Hc/s1600/07_andy_jewels.jpg", "http://www.discoversea.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TG3sIPzk_tI/AAAAAAAADo0/1EYocWXgcdM/s1600/07_andy_divemodel.jpg", "http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TG3sHzWNkQI/AAAAAAAADos/pRlksQwZE4I/s1600/07_andy_treasurecase.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TG3sHrGqxZI/AAAAAAAADok/wew-TwV6rKI/s1600/07_joey_tank.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TG3sHmSWF3I/AAAAAAAADoc/LqczkqSQksY/s1600/06_boys_hoopers1.jpg", "http://www.hooperscrabhouse.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/08/crabby-beach-part-three.html", "title": "\nCrabby: The Beach, Part Three\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, August 31, 2010", "body": "\nWell, when you have a child who suddenly dashes out the door, the best thing to do is call the school in blind panic and in tears, with words like, \"bolting\", \"safety issue\", and \"HELP!!!!\"  OK, seriously, we had one of those meetings I was hoping would never happen today: the one where you discuss what to do with your child who fright-flights into the street when his school is 1. new and 2. near a major highway. The school doesn't like these meetings, either, because it screams \"potential safety hazard\". One thing school folks want, it's  safe  kids.  I spent the morning basically crying, reading over the letters I had from the OT and thinking about the incidents we've had this summer, and basically panicking. BUt I pulled myself together, got the children fed, and headed out with both in tow to the school to get this sorted out. I want Joey's first real day at this school to be far better than anything he had over the summer. And I want him to be safe from Day One.  I learned a few things. For one, Joey has been moved to a different set of teachers than we originally planned. I really liked them. They asked a lot of good questions, made a lot of intelligent and meaningful comments, and kept things really focused on what would be best for Joey from all fronts- academically, socially, and of course, his safety. Ms. H came, mostly because I begged her to help because I wanted somebody I really trusted in that room. This is not an issue to tackle in a room full of people you don't know, I can tell you. She always says very important things, and sticks with realities. This is good, because our admin person was a little bit panicked and suggesting we put Joey in self-contained sped, with much \"assurances\" that kids \"don't get bored here.\" But the reality is that the vast majority of kids in self-contained environments need them not just for behavior, but for academics; and being a restrictive environment, Joey wouldn't have the kind of contact with his peers that he had before. In other words, it would be a serious setback, and mark a major regression.  But then, this is a major regression and serious setback.  However, the committee prevailed in understanding that Joey's needs and goals were best met in the inclusion environment, so another solution had to be considered: a 1:1 aide. The admin tore out of the room when she knew this was the direction we were heading. An aide in this system is like the Holy Grail of Services (we already have the other Holy Grail of Services: ESY). Aides are expensive, and you can't just stick anybody in a classroom and call them a para; and a 1:1 needs to click with the student. It is something they avoid like the plague.  However, sometimes you find yourself here, with the aide on the table.  Joey needs to be in a safe environment, and that means he needs a lifeguard in the room- one dedicated to his needs, and ready to take to their heels when he does. We should have the paperwork done in the next 48 hours.  Next on the agenda was showing joey his classrooms. We visited his homeroom (which will be the resource room, since we are now thinking the cafeteria isn't a safe place for him to eat, with all the noise). Ms. J runs that room, and served as one of his aides over the summer. She seems cool, and I think she's the case manager now. Then we went for a stroll with one of his new teachers, saw her classroom, as well as the regular-ed teacher's classroom (they split the class up for small groups; the rooms are across the hall from each other). He started getting antsy, so we decided it was time to go. The teacher was walking us back to the office (where the main door is), getting to know Joey a little. I stopped to thank Ms. J, and ran into another teacher I knew and said hello.  I glanced down the hall to the boys and the teacher, now well ahead of me. Beyond them was a stairwell, and a glass door to the outside. They were framed there, haloed silhouettes against the bright sunlight streaming through the glass into the much darker hall. And there was frozen moment, when you know what you are seeing is not right. The teacher was calling his name. He was headed to that door. Andy called. I called. He was still moving toward the door. I broke into a run. So did the teacher- right out of her shoes, to run the faster.  I must say, I was totally impressed. She caught him outside. But it was the speed and efficiency of her action that really caught my eye. She wasted no time- she was already on the move when she called his name. She knew she couldn't run in those shoes, and they were off her feet without breaking stride. The instant understanding of the danger, and the effort made to help my child were, to be honest, stunning.  I hope we all expect each and every teacher who works with our children to do no less; yet I remain grateful to see caring in action. Combined with the efforts and comments she put forth in the meeting, I say we're in for a good year, or at least have the best opportunity possible for one. I think we're oriented now.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/08/school-changes-and-new-teachers.html", "title": "\nSchool Changes and New Teachers\n"},

I didn't really blame him this round. JoeyAndyDad wanted to sleep in, a luxury equated with things like hot showers and glasses of wine to many of us, and the boys were up and bouncy. We had a coupon, and I thought if I managed to shuffle the boys out, the other adults could have a nice, quiet morning. But then Joey staunchly refused to go, so he got to stay in the room with Dad, and Grandma came with us on our adventure.  In the rain.  Fortunately, it wasn't pouring, but it was grey, misty, damp, and by the end, definitely raining.  As usual, we took a ride through the fishing docks to look at the boats, then out to the island. In past years, we've had really good sightings of the ponies. This time, we learned that ponies are smart, and know not to wander around scrubby little points of island in the rain.  So we grabbed our net and went ashore, where Andy promptly ran off and mixed with the tons of other people who had come. There was an unusually high tide, so there wasn't a lot of space in the area we were permitted to wander on (much of the island is protected, so you can't just roam anywhere).  We did manage to see a hermit crab, and Andy found some bluecrab shells that were probably shed by growing crabs. One very excited young woman actually caught a small fish in her net, so Andy got very happy about seeing a real live fish in a net. Mostly he liked wading around with the other people and trying to catch stuff and talk at the same time. He actually got a bit grumpy because he didn't get to catch a live crab or fish himself.  He did, however, catch himself some seaweed. And insisted we take the crab shells home. They're downstairs somewhere...  Then the rain started rolling in at a decent clip, and we washed off our feet and got back on the boat for the ride back to port.  On the way back, the guide shows off aquatic life, having the kids help by showing live creatures to the rest of the audience. We got to see spider crabs, whelks, clams, starfish, and a horseshoe crab. Andy got to help with the starfish. He was a good helper, and very proud of himself. He really liked the excursion, despite it not having toys or pirate gold involved. Unfortunately, the picture they take when you get on the boat, we didn't get to buy, because the guy can't print and stuff in the rain.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/THXOZraqx_I/AAAAAAAADqk/TZHn4hOkZPc/s1600/09_andy_boat.jpg", "http://www.assateagueadventure.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/THXOZIGRQ-I/AAAAAAAADqc/LVe2PTgXIRU/s1600/09_andy_exploring2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/THXOY4TsluI/AAAAAAAADqU/owKBfs5hA6A/s1600/09_andy_exploring.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/THXOYqOm1hI/AAAAAAAADqM/qwJfAqc-gkE/s1600/09_andy_seaweed.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/THXOYfX3JnI/AAAAAAAADqE/eN_hUs-bo80/s1600/09_andy_seastar.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/08/nature-adventure.html", "title": "\nNature Adventure\n"},

It is a half-day, so I am going to pull them both and go adventuring at the St. Mary's County Fair instead. Happy happy boys.  In talking to Andy, we do have a teasing issue at school, a child who was in his class last year. Fortunately, the child is not in his class, but apparently he sees him enough for it to be a problem. But I armed him. The child is calling Andy a silly name Andy doesn't like, so I told him to say he wasn't that name, and to say he was one he likes, even if it is silly. And if he kid insists on teasing him, informing the child he doesn't like that name and is going to go play with someone else, and turn his back firmly on the child. Andy's got enough to worry about, he should be spending his time with nice kids, not mean ones. I think Andy caught on.  No tears getting on the school bus today.  Joey is a little more complicated. He is saying he is all alone at school, that he has no friends. He relented and said there was a little girl who was friends with D, and that she was nice. But then it was right back to \"its just me and Ms. A and Ms. C and Ms. W.\" The isolation is something I see a lot more with Joey, and it is all the more poignant because he loves people so- he  wants  to socialize. Also, I remember that feeling. It haunted me through most of my school years, and is likely to become a self-fullfilling idea. You can't force kids to socialize, and Joey is really running into roadblocks in initiating social contact. The anxiety about school isn't helping that.  Want to know why appropriate placement and service, including ESY, is so vital?

The school OT insisted the IEP go back to consult-only because she \"can't deal with his behaviors in 1:1\". She's right. She can't. Because she doesn't have the skills to provide my child with appropriate OT. And I said so. I don't think I beat about the bush, either. I'm not happy because my child clearly is in desperate need of OT services, but this lady definitely does not have the skill set to provide them, and there is no other OT in the school. Is that clear enough?  We tossed around some strategies for dealing with Joey's issues, because I learned at this meeting that 3 weeks into the school year, and the inclusion folks have been able to do zero academics with him. The school folks asked how long it took for Joey to settle in at the last school. They were a bit unhappy when I noted he was settled in within a couple weeks there. We're not even close to settled here.  But in the end, what actually  happened ? We flipped his schedule. Woo. Hoo.  It may help. It may not.

{"date": "Monday, November 01, 2010", "body": "\nMy son is autistic.  He repeats words and phrases to comfort himself and make himself laugh. He sometimes picks up on words when you least expect him to, and then repeats them for weeks.  He uses language to communicate emotions by attaching emotions to words, even when those words may make no sense out of their original context. He often repeats blocks of words and phrases he has heard before, modifying them slightly to fit what he wants the words to do.  When frustrated or angry, he often runs out of words and cannot process language effectively, either expressive or receptive. The result can be a meltdown or an attempt to escape the painful emotions.  He loves people, but is unsure how to talk to them or react to them, and finds them confusingly unpredictable. He also loves and fears dogs for the same reason.  He reads beautifully, but hates doing it because it \"hurts\".  If someone is hurt, he is the first to be in at their side and trying to make them feel better.  He loves math. His favorite game is to think up math questions to ask and giggling over the answers.  If someone teases or bullies him, he does not have the social skills to manage the situation or the language skills to effectively report it to someone else. He is hurt and sad, but cannot explain why. He gets grumpy and touchy, but can't express the connections to the problem.  He understands you better if you use sign language while you are speaking. If you show him \"I love you,\" he will say, \"I love you, too!\"  If you ask him about his day, he will recite his schedule, or script an answer. But he gets grumpy if you don't ask.  I remember the silence. I remember the days of wondering what was brewing in that golden head, and eagerly awaiting every sound, every word. My son's voice may not be what anyone expects, but if you listen, he is filled with the joy of the world around him, and is sharing it the best he can- and has insights to share in seeing the world through his eyes. You just have to take the time to listen.  So listen up.

This is the meeting you have when your child's behavior is challenging and disruptive, so the school decides they better figure it out quick. Let's not get into a discussion of the meaning of \"quick.\" Personally, from the time I agreed to the FBA to the time of meeting, in school terms, I think they did really well.  This was one of the better meetings I've been to. After, how cool is a meeting that is specifically for sitting around brainstorming about what is possibly causing behavior, and how to help him learn to cope with those antecedents? I took my mom with me, which always helps, because she tends to cut right to what we are seeing from home without beating around the bush, and she has no fear of our school psych. Fortunately, the school psych was actually helpful this time. Oh, and the OT? Nowhere to be found. We'll count that as a positive, too.  So we had a room full of Joey's teachers, all of whom are interested in helping him. This last couple of weeks I think has really helped Joey- not only have we gotten his anxiety levels into his normal range, but his teachers have gotten a chance to see what Joey is really like. This has given people a chance to fall in love with him. Or at least in like. Or at the very least, see what he is really capable of if he is supported properly. Any of these three things can make a huge difference, because it gives these teachers a chance to realize they can  make  a huge difference. That's why most of these people went into teaching in the first place. Hey, I teach, too. I know how much more fun and awesome it is to teach a student who rocks, even when they need support and lots of attention. When you see the potential and the determination is there, you are more ready to go for it. Joey has potential and determination. And he's squishy into the bargain.

Such was today.  It was my turn to have the Joey-Boy all to myself. Joey has been too overwhelmed to be able to actually pick out a nice pumpkin or enjoy the pumpkin patch, one of his favorite activities. I was so glad when he said he wanted to go for his activity. Off to  Snead's  for a fun-filled afternoon of chickens, hay, and pumpkins! I didn't take a camera. I just spent the afternoon enjoying being with my son.  As part of the treat, he got to sit in the front seat with Mom. We drove through the fields, looking at the growing Christmas trees, the overgrown asparagus fields, and of course the pumpkins. We drove through the ford to the back fields, a very exciting moment as we were in my little neon, not the jeep, and it rained yesterday. We took our time picking out pumpkins. He picked a green one, of course, and then we picked out a really big orange one together. We wandered back to park near the barns, so he could play in the hay. We patted goats. We hugged baby cows. We giggled at alpacas. We even touched a baby chicken! Then we went for a hay ride. The lady who runs the tractor saw us and laughed about us being return customers. Something to the effect of \"you should get bulk rates!\" But she didn't give us bulk rates. Besides, it was just the two of us today. Our hay ride was a small group. Joey bounced around the cart- looking through the floor slats at the ground passing beneath and the wheels turning, checking out the different places to sit in search of the best view, trying out laying down, sitting up, laying on his back, laying on his tummy. He called out random words to the pumpkins and to the people we passed. He giggled. He leaned against me. He wrote in the air with a stick. He looked at me like I was crazy when I pointed out the pumpkins and the trees and the horses. He was busy.  We played in the corn teepee for a while. It really needs some restoration now; it was really lovely when it was first done, now it is about to fall over. We wandered past the alpacas again, and picked out some gourds. Then he found the golf cart. Folks from the farm use it to tool around and check on things. Apparently, they leave the keys in it. Joey loves golf carts. He wanted to get in it, but I managed to get him over to the gourds to pick some out. He liked ones with lots of colors and bumps. When I was young, the popular gourd was a little white one that looked like a shmoo. I like those, but you don't see them anymore. (If anybody remembers them and can tell me what they are called, I would be very happy. It is not a white cushaw, they are too bumpy; these were smooth).  As I was paying for them, I heard the golf cart start up. I looked up to call Joey so he could see one of the farm people riding in it, and wave... to find that it was  Joey . One quick call and he stopped, thank all goodness! But it also was a good signal that it was time to go home. Joey started on his \"I'm a stupid boy\" routine because he was upset (and probably embarrassed) about his golf cart adventure, so I softened it a little by letting him look at the baby chicks one more time (they were right next to the car). Then we had a talk about safety and how you have to be 16 to drive a golf cart as we started for home.  He said he'd like one for Christmas, anyway.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sneadsfarm.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/10/enjoy-ride.html", "title": "\nEnjoy the Ride\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, November 03, 2010", "body": "\nSome time ago,  Mom-NOS came up with the perfect metaphor for autistic kids in the neurotypical world.    Here, I present a lame imitation, because I have been watching  A Wish For Wings That Work , and it so fits our world.  We live in a duck world. The world is full of ducks- versatile creatures who swim, dive, and fly. They can soar magnificently through the skies, then plunge into the depths. Nobody worries about the waddling, because hey, everybody waddles. So its cool.  My kid is a penguin.  The difference between ducks and penguins is not so great as between toasters in hair dryers. You would never mistake a hair dryer for a toaster. But with ducks and penguins, they are both birds. It might take a minute to point out differences. After all, they both waddle. They both swim. They both have feathers. They are both  birds .  At the same time, a penguin is not a duck. Penguins waddle, but they walk upright. They swim, but instead of just kicking with their feet, they use their wings as well. Penguins are excellent swimmers, and they get the waddling thing done in their own way.  But they cannot fly.  Penguins living in a duck world spend their lives being ridiculed and pushed  about not being able to fly . After all, they are birds, they have feathers, why can't they fly? Teachers push them to fly.  Peers tease them about not being able to fly . There is an obsession with flight in their families, because after all, this is a world where birds fly!  Penguins cannot fly. They are not made to fly. They're penguins, not ducks. They can swim far better than ducks, but that is ignored by ducks in a duck world.  What is great about  A Wish For Wings That Work  is it shows us that it is important to have a variety of talents and gifts in the world. A duck and ice water don't get along, but penguins swim beautifully in it. We need penguins.  Just in case Santa falls into an icy pond and needs to be rescued.   Another interesting sideline is how Opus treats Bill throughout the film. The rejection of others who are disabled by people with their own disabilities is something we are noticing more and more. On the surface, Bill has no talents to share. But look closer at the clips. Bill has loyalty, he has the brains to know who can help. He may smell of brussel sprouts, but he is not useless. He's trying to live in a duck world, too.  And best of all, Opus does fly at the end. With some help and support, some appreciation for the talents of others and support for their challenges, we can all live in a duck world. Or perhaps, just  the  world.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/03/on-being-hair-dryer-kid-in-toaster.html", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103272/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QI4ESioUM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7T70O7GgwU&feature=related", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3emUZ64OeY&feature=related"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/11/living-penguin-life.html", "title": "\nLiving The Penguin Life\n"},

However, I am also looking for gardening, crafting, and kitchen/cooking info, tips, recipes, etc. for all year round! After all, after the winter issue comes the spring issue... then the summer issue... then the fall issue... then we start over again...  Just to get folks thinking, I am looking at a variety of topics that are seasonally connected, and I'd like to build up a repertoire of material that I can include in these sections, instead of it being just my own voice. For the last issue (Fall), we did tomatoes (including canning) and corn, because we had a couple of recipes and ideas, and I just added more material to fill out the spreads and bridge between late summer and fall. Next year, I am hoping to do pumpkins and gourds and a second (as yet unknown) fall ideas spread.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 16, 2010", "body": "\nLast spring, we designed Joey's big IEP for the school year. IEPs here are now not school year-to-school year, but are to cover 12 months from implementation. This wasn't a big issue, as Joey had mastered his goals from his previous IEP, so he was ready for new goals and new work. So we thought hard about where we thought he could go between April and April, and wrote it up.  I admit we've had some setbacks since then. Joey's mental health deteriorated significantly. The result was a huge explosion in behaviors to communicate that deterioration, the most significant being downright dangerous. We have had to put a lot of energy into getting him settled in his new school after the disastrously inappropriate summer program. However, all those problems were rooted in poor transition planning and implementation; in other words, lack of appropriate support.  Now we are in a school with no autism specialist, no resource room, none of the things that made Joey's school experience work for him. His teachers are busting their butts trying to figure out how to help him; but that also means they are not spending all the energy on actually helping, they have to spend it on thinking, experimenting, and reinventing the wheel.  I just saw Joey's first official report card. His midterm reports were pretty good, all A's on his academic subjects (which we thought a little odd, to be honest, considering that the teachers were telling us they hadn't been able to provide him any instruction due to behavior issues).  The new C's were not the most startlingly telling thing about this report, however. It was the IEP.  When you have an IEP, part of it is a section evaluating progress towards the goal. The scores are M ( mastered ), SP ( sufficient progress  made to complete the goal on time), ES ( emerging skill , but may not meet the goal on time), IP ( insufficient progress  to meet the goal on time), and NI ( no instruction  provided).  For the May and June reports, where he was in his old school with all his supports, everything was SP.  For the September and November reports, none of them are.  NONE . We even have an NI. Two ES. Mostly IP.  That, my friends and readers, is the difference support makes. Remember this as you go into your IEPs, your teacher conferences (even with your non-disabled children), your meetings and plannings and everything else. Support=success. Without it?  IP.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/11/difference-support-makes.html", "title": "\nThe Difference Support Makes\n"},

Oh, and because Joey has been running to the principal's office, he is thinking about just setting up a corner in his office for Joey to run to, thus making Joey's paths more predictable when he bolts.

{"date": "Thursday, November 18, 2010", "body": "\nWhen I win the Big Lottery, I am opening a school. It will be open to anyone who wants specialized and individualized instruction for their kids. It will have a good size campus, with the main area fenced (but plenty of other space to explore as needed). The staff will include teachers with specialized training in a variety of needs and abilities, a small army of well-trained paraprofessionals, fully trained administrative staff (not just in administering, but also in the needs and abilities being served by the school). It will include a number of specialized spaces, such as OT gyms and specialized classrooms, as well as more flexible spaces which can be opened or divided as the students grow and change. On-staff will also be specialized support staff, including a contingent of occupational, physical, speech-language, communication, behavioral, and mental health therapists.  In other words, each child will have a team of experts working with the family and the child to determine what is needed, what is wanted, and how to best support and teach the child. Since this school is not just for \"special needs kids\", there will be opportunities for education in a wide variety of settings and environments.  The school will include residential opportunities, so academic instruction timing can be tailored to the child. Do you have a little one who is a night owl? Cool. Is morning their best moment? Great. Do they prefer to sleep late and get things done in the afternoon? Lovely. Working around sleep issues and those little nappers? No problem.  The school will also offer opportunities for families who decide to send their child to \"regular\" schools: before-care, after-care, etc. These students will be evaluated for needed supports and additional instructional needs (academic, social, functional, etc) so that their needs for instruction are incorporated into their individualized program, and they are treated as students, not just as warm bodies (as they might be in a daycare or \"regular\" before- or after-care).  The programs will take into consideration the interests of the individual children, using strengths and interests to spur learning and overcoming challenges. Staff will understand how to use, say, Pokemon to teach math and history.  The school will teach 7 days per week. If you wish to take your child out on specific days, that will be worked into you child's individual program, but consistency is considered key. It will also meet year-round. Taking your child out for vacation- and when, and for how long- is up to the family and the needs of the child. Staff will be available to provide home support for families, so go ahead and leap on that opportunity to take your kids to see Grandma, or go to DisneyWorld.  The curriculum will include a number of things seen as beneficial generally, but that are not usually offered in public schools. Sign Language will be part of the general curriculum, just as many schools now teach Spanish. Instruction will include lessons on respect, human diversity, kindness, and being thoughtful and considerate of others. Social skills will be part of the actual, planned curriculum for all students, tailored to their needs. Families will be offered the option of having religious or spiritual instruction for their children. Cultural instruction will be another important facet of the curriculum.  Transition into the \"real world\" starts from when you begin at the school. A child's strengths and aptitudes will be considered and encouraged from the start. The school will provide a variety of avenues to employment or further education, based on the needs and desires of the student. Apprenticeships, mentoring, vocational instruction, self-advocacy instruction, fieldtrips and fieldwork opportunities, etc. will be available for experimentation and support of the child right from the start. Your budding paleontologist at age 6 might strike up and interest in other kinds of detail-oriented logic-heavy fields of interest by the time they are 20; but encouraging them to explore logic and focus using dinosaurs at age 6 is a great way to introduce them to wider opportunities by the time they are 20.  Age is not a deciding factor for when they will graduate for our school. Hopefully by the time the kids who enter our kindergarden reach the age of 18, our school will have garnered support and funding to open higher learning opportunities to continue to support the needs and instruction of our students. However, focusing on educating all the students who come to us, we know that we will have students who will require support for learning independence and functional skills beyond their 22nd birthday. That will not be considered a problem at all. We will hopefully continue to instruct and offer support for our students well into their adult lives, even those without \"special needs\".  However, the goal is to teach these children to support themselves independently, to effectively self-advocate, and to be able to hone their own skills and interests as adults. The vast majority of our students would leave us after they complete high-school level education to satisfaction, and go out into the world.  But hopefully, they will be stronger, better people for having spent their precious childhood days with us, in an environment that understood and supported them, and taught them how to understand and support themselves.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/11/if-i-ran-zoo.html", "title": "\nIf I Ran The Zoo\n"},

The boys were good, patient, and actually entertained themselves for a good chunk of time. Grandma just cleaned her basement, revealing a lovely concrete floor- perfect for chalking. I found some of JoeyAndyDad's old Star Wars figures (mine are mysteriously missing), so Andy was thrilled. We brought Joey's computer with us, making him happy. We even got them both to come in to the living room to see Santa arrive in Herald's Square! They were very excited about eating turkey and stuffing and potatoes, and Andy even had shrimp. Yummy.  The bird this year was 27 pounds. It took about 5 1/2 hours to cook. The last hour, I slapped bacon on top. Yummerific. We discovered the bacon trick a couple years ago, when I found a bacon turkey online and slapped bacon on the turkey as a joke for JoeyAndyDad. It turned out to be really super delicious. I also tried a new sweet potato casserole this year, which turned out pretty good.  Evan arrived in the early afternoon; he had to work until early in the morning. Unfortunately, he also has to work tomorrow, so he didn't get to stay over, which means we didn't get to drink and I don't have updates on all the books he's read, and the headache I sported most of the day meant we didn't get to talk much. But we all watched some football and The Empire Strikes Back. Watching a Star War movie is getting to be a tradition when Evan comes. I bet we see Return of the Jedi on Christmas. Which would be awesome. I'll be sure to grill him about his reading, too. He always reads interesting books.  The fun part was he arrived in a garbage truck. He's working for a company that picks up and hauls garbage, and he got to use the truck. Joey was thrilled to see a garbage truck up close, though we didn't have time for a ride. Maybe next time.  So, I'm thinking turkey casserole for dinner tomorrow. And the next day. And possibly the day after.

He is not receiving appropriate OT support because the OT is incompetent; she stated clearly at the last IEP meeting that there was nothing she could do for Joey, and insisted on a once-a-month consult status instead of direct service.

Oh, and people who just couldn't deal with the lemons life had handed them; but I found the folks making lemonade far more interesting. And then I discovered there were people handed lemons who made wine (the good sparkling sweet stuff) and just let everybody wonder how they did it. Amazing people. And their parents.  Nik  is about to be seven. So is  Jack-Jack . I think about these little guys, as well as many other children of my readers, every single day. But these two of are interest right now, because it sometimes occurs to me that both of them are older than Andy. Not by much- a few months- but older. And I think of these little guys, and I think of my Andy, and I think, sometimes life ain't fair.  These three little guys are hard-working, courageous souls. Yet the challenges they face, so very different, just aren't fair. Nik is starting to say words, using his new iPad, working hard to learn to self-regulate and communicate. Every new skill is so hard-won. Every day is so hard-won. I check often with bated breath, lest I find he is in the hospital again, knowing how hard that little guy works, how hard his folks work to support and help him. Jack is able to scoot about, is learning to use signs and sounds to communicate, working hard to be able to understand his environment and how the world works. Every skill is hard-won, every day hard-won.  Every time I talk to his mom, I prepare to hear he had a trip to the ER for a seizure, knowing how hard his folks work to support not only him, but his older brothers who are also seriously disabled. Both of these little guys are trying to hard to survive, while working so hard to thrive.  Folks who don't live with these families in their lives have no idea how hard these kids work. How much energy goes into getting to another day. It's not fair.  Andy's challenges are very different. His life is not on the line with every breath he takes. Yet he fights his own battles, ones that he shouldn't have to fight.  I awakened yesterday to a battle raging downstairs, screams of unhappiness rising up the stairwell. It was odd, they usually play together nicely in the morning now. I sprang up to intercede, and found the problem was about sticks. Joey is very fond of his sticks, which he uses for air writing, and has them about the house. Andy is also fond of sticks, which he uses as most children do: swords, guns, magic wands, whatever strikes his fancy. Apparently Joey wanted a long, thin stick Andy had, instead of the shorter (but still pretty long), thicker stick in his hand. He was screaming that Andy has stolen his stick. Andy was upset because he hadn't stolen the stick (for once), but it was one he had gotten from the yard the day before. In trying to be fair, there was little I could do other than inspect the stick and note that it was, indeed, the one Andy had fetched from the yard the day before- which, of course, settled nothing. Assuring Joey he could go out and get a similar stick was of no avail. Offering Joey another stick was useless. Joey's autism means he needs  this  stick, right  now . Wrapping his brain around getting a similar stick was not working, especially with all the upheaval from the holiday. Meltdown was immanent.  Suddenly Andy looked down at the stick, and over at Joey, and at me, and held the stick out to Joey. \"Let's trade, Doey,\" he offered. When this was amenable, Andy then reinforced the trade by noting the longer stick would write better, and the thicker stick made a better sword. But if you were there, you'd know that Andy did not want to trade sticks. He wanted his stick, but he knew. He could see the immanent meltdown as well as I could, heard the desperation in Joey's voice, the change of pitch that took it beyond a squabble. As long as it was a squabble, Andy held his ground. When it started turning into something else, he came up with a solution- one that got him all sorts of kisses and hugs and praise from his mom, who offered to get him another stick from the yard.  But it wasn't fair.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/11/different-worlds.html", "title": "\nDifferent Worlds\n"},

I ran inside, took some advils, and got some frozen peas on my knees. A few hours later I realized my knees seemed fine, even though I fell on them, it was my hip that was complaining. So I put frozen veggies on that. Now I realize I jammed my back. Great. But all in all, it could have been a  lot  worse.  The plan for the day was getting Christmas stuff up, round one. Mantle, kitchen shelf, and possibly the first garland. Two of those activities required ladders, and getting on a ladder by myself, having just fallen down the stairs, was not appealing. I got the mantle up, no problem, and some other Christmas knick-knacks went out. Then I remembered one of the light strings on my kitchen garland (the one with the cookie cutters) was kaput.

Nobody wanted to really help, they just wanted to stick her in with a bunch of stupid special ed kids and let her rot.\"  \"They want me to put him on meds, but I want him to learn to cope without them!\" I know these children. I have seen them once a week, some of them for six years, and started off seeing them two or three times in a week. I have seen them grow, and change, and suffer, and triumph. I have seen the hard work they do. The hard work their parents and grandparents and caregivers do. The hard work their siblings do.  They do what works for their families. And whether you agree or not (or I agree or not) with the comments I was hearing, or support their approaches or not, or wonder more about these children and wonder why these comments might have stood out in my head from the other jabber in the room... these are hard-working people, doing the best they can in a hard place.  I remember when I first found myself in this world of special needs and disabled children. I was shocked to find how I started off in a place of such utter ignorance. I'm an educated person. I had no idea. To find I had to come to terms with the needs of my child and the changes in my own life, that wasn't easy, and it wasn't quick. To actually come to terms, that wasn't easy or quick, either. We did try things, we spent hours researching things we had heard, theories handed to us. We went through the agonies of self-doubt, self-recrimination, the ugly side of discovering life isn't going to be as you expected it, as everyone assured you it would no doubt be- provided you did everything right, having it go this way, the wrong way, was a slim and distant possibility. The attitudes towards special needs kids and their families- the ignorance and venom of people who have no idea what it is all about, what it is like, can be overwhelming. Add in the venom of people who insist you should believe what they believe and do what they do within the special needs world itself, and it can be crushing.  Often I find people in these waiting rooms who are just reaching those terms. They go on about things they've tried. When I disagree with their approach, I often smile and nod and say, \"how interesting, I'm glad that is working for you guys...\" and then go on to note the latest triumphs the child has achieved, leaving why I think that challenge was overcome deliberately vague. I'm not there to add to the crushing weight of constant judgment.  I might note what worked for us. And some of those other parents smile and nod and say, \"how interesting. I'm glad that is working for you guys...\"  And that's OK. We'll all muddle through. It's good to listen. Sometimes there are new ideas to try, bouncing about a room of jabber.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/12/echoes.html", "title": "\nEchoes\n"},

And we had the most awesome seats- here we are watching the trains, and I can see our seats. Seriously. Totally awesome.  The boys liked the trains, but we didn't get to spend much time looking at them, because some official person threatened to \"squish folks in\" and take our seats from us if we weren't in them. At 3:30. According to the literature we had, we didn't have to be in our seats until 4:30. Besides, we weren't the only folks wandering around, or attempting to. But whatever. Mom waved us down in time for us to keep our seats.  Our adventure included a guest appearance by  Stimey ! So not only are we awesome enough to get tickets to the Christmas Tree Lighting, we are cool enough for Stimey to hang out with us. We rock.  So we took some photos of ourselves in front of the unlit tree while the daylight held out, and before we had to race back to our seats to keep some official person from letting someone else sit in them.  Joey and Andy were having a wonderful time, too. They were wonderfully good. Seriously. We pulled out a couple of our tricks from our bag, but they did the trick and kept everybody calm and having fun. I wish we had more time to look at the trains, though. They were digging them. If it warms up before Christmas, we might go back up just to see them. Or we'll wait until next year, if it is warmer.  Because you know what? It was Cold. Seriously. Cold. I was glad I thought to bring the tree hats. Not only did they get us on TV (woo-hoo!) but they are made of polar fleece, so they are nice and warm. And I thought to bring extra hats, extra gloves, extra scarves, and several blankets. All of which came in handy. Did I mention it was cold?  Yes, that is the beautiful and fabulous Stimey, and yes, our seats really are that close to the tree. It totally rocked.  We actually got to see the motorcade form in front of the White House, then pull away to come to the event (and joke about how he should have just walked, or used a  Segway ). I thought I took some film of it, but apparently, I didn't. :(  Did I mention I have a new camera?  So we waited for the dark to settle, the temperatures to plummet, and the president to show up. They started playing music for us about 4:30. The president showed up around 5. All in all, we did quite well.  I think they ought to have more ornaments on the tree, though. But that's just me. If you've ever seen my Christmas tree, you know I am not being facetious.  WE GOT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT!!! When one sees a president, one is required to cheer loudly and take lots of pictures, and hope the zoom on the new camera works. I think it did pretty well. The film I took looks amazing, better than the photos, even.  They lit the tree around 5:15, which made us very happy, because we didn't feel obligated to stay. Did I mention it was cold?  And it was pretty awesome, too. It just comes right on, and we were suddenly aglow! What was also cool was the whole First Family lights it, including the First Grandma. And since we were also there with Grandma, we definitely appreciated that.  Joey did fabulously. We did have some games for him- a little handheld and my iPod (he loved tic-tac-toe and loves Angry Birds). He didn't even need his earphones.  Considering he sat in a car for an hour and a half, then in a line for half and hour, then in a seat for almost two hours (after walking calmly through a metal detector!), and then into a show that didn't really interest him until Santa appeared, I think he ought to be sainted for his behavior. He did awesome.  The First Lady read  The Night Before Christmas , and that was fun for the guys. The little girls are adorable. I believe the other kids are from military families.  And did I mention Santa showed up?  That's when the guys  really  got into the whole tree-lighting thing. See the President? Oh, OK. Watch a 42-foot tree light up? Nice. Hey, look, there's Santa... WOWIE KAZOWIE, IT'S SANTA!!!! This is Andy watching Santa. He also did great. They were both so patient and so, so, so good.  Before the show started, Andy discovered it was warm under the blanket, so he was playing under it and under the chairs like a little tent. He was adorable.  We watched B. B. King perform, then decided the boys were tired, cold, and hungry. And we were tired and cold. Did I mention it was cold?  So we bid farewell to our beautiful and adorable and wonderful Stimey, who I didn't get to really talk to much, and made our way to the exit. Only they had closed all but one of the exits, and the open one was not the one we entered through, so it took a long time for poor JoeyAndyDad to find us and pick us up. (He drove us up so we could get really close, to help out my mom). That was a bit of an adventure unto itself. But he did find us eventually, and we did thaw, and we'll see how the boys are feeling in the morning. Overall, we had a wonderful time. How many times do you get to see the President and the lighting of the National Christmas Tree? And we got to see Stimey on top of that! Woo-hoo!

{"date": "Saturday, December 18, 2010", "body": "\nI have come across a very sad thing here in my little corner of the world: children who not only don't believe in Santa Claus, but tell others that he is dead. The parents of these children often are trying to move their children away from the consumerism they see in Santa Claus and towards a focus on Jesus in the holiday. See, these parents not only don't believe in Santa Claus, they don't even understand the point. They are themselves so caught up in the consumerism that they miss the real meaning of Santa Claus, and thus miss a wonderful way of turning their children to their spirituality and community in a way that children can readily grasp and believe.  If you believe in Santa Claus, you understand that St. Nicholas is about giving, not receiving.  You may remember that we're staunch Methodists (well, we believe in comfortable furniture and stuff, but there is no denying we're Methodist in a strain older than what I have seen in any of the Methodist churches I've tried around here, which seem very. very Baptist). We believe that God has given us many, many gifts: life, the world around us, friends and families and everything in wonderful Creation. He also gave us Salvation- that was a gift, and it is given, and it is up to us to appreciate it, be grateful for it, and remember to do our best with it. That idea of giving, of putting your best forth and giving to the world, spreading love and cheer and goodwill, that is what Christmas is for, celebrating God giving us this great Gift.  That is also what Santa Claus is trying to remind us to do. By giving without expecting any return, Santa gives us a model of being a giving person, a person who thinks of others and what they want, and tries to show love in ways others understand. It is a lesson that is often lost in translation as we succumb to the me-me-me of the adolescent age, and so many never seem to emerge from it.  Telling a child that Santa is dead is not only unfortunate, it dismisses the lesson he has to give us all, the very message of the joy of Christmas and of the Christ. It is the core of Christian belief, which is why St. Nicholas, patron saint of children everywhere, is so adored.  I believe in Santa Claus.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/12/when-it-is-ok-to-believe.html", "title": "\nWhen It Is OK To Believe\n"},

I am glad I am not the Loughners, who have likely been struggling to get their child the services he needs, and for whatever reason were unable to do so. There, but for the grace of God, go I.  Yes, we think about it. When Joey melts down and says violent things, we think about it. We could very easily lose him. He could be bullied to death (or worse). He could lose that line between speech and action and do something violent to himself or to others. As we scramble to get others to understand the need for service, the vital nature of those services, the potentially dangerous situations we face, we have these kinds of stories to terrify us into action.  That's not even counting in the autism factor. The autism factor just makes it that much harder to get our child help, because we can't just send him to any social worker with space on her schedule, we need someone who can work with an autistic child, understand his way of communicating and expressing his needs, his unique issues, on top of the angst. We need to find service providers who understand how autism amplifies the issues other children have with anxiety, depression, anger, frustration.  I had an appointment to see a psychiatrist in March, and we were going down the Charlottesville to see them. They cancelled. We haven't managed to get back on the schedule yet, as we sit on the waitlist for a client cancellation.

The language that hints at something deeper: a sort of slip, if you will. It is always to the advantage of the kids with disabilities to have inclusion programs. We forget there are also advantages to those \"non-disabled peers.\"  A couple years ago now, we had a parent in one of Joey's classrooms complain that one of \"those kids\" was in their child's classroom. Special ed kids are seen as a burden, a drain on resources and attention for their \"regular\" and \"normal\" kid. It is an attitude that must be fought. Until everyone understands the advantage it is for everyone to have inclusion, it will remain a seething issue for the majority of families who do not have kids in special education, who do not understand what special education is or what it is for.  After all, what's in it for  their  kid?  I know why it is better for Joey to be around his non-disabled peers. Why is it good for those same peers to be around him?  They learn a lot about caring about others. Joey loves the world, and has genuine compassion for others, expressing that freely. If another kid gets hurt, Joey is right there to comfort them.  They learn about accepting differences. This is a vital social skill that often gets pushed aside, especially in middle school, when kids get that urge to be like everybody else. Teach them early. Teach them well. We are all unique, and that is a  good  thing.  They learn a lot about math. That's right. Remember academics? Joey even helps with academics! I could go on, but the point is this: inclusion is about sharing strengths in order to meet challenges. Everyone has strengths to share. Everyone has challenges to meet. With inclusion, we all get those strengths, and learn to meet those challenges, often in ways no one expected. We strengthen the content of our characters.  Until everyone understands that, inclusion is under threat, because so many do not understand what inclusion is. They don't see how it is to their advantage, so they assume it is not. That assumption is backed up by media articles on inclusion, which stress the advantages of inclusion to people with disabilities, without noting the advantages to  everyone . Inclusion isn't important because children with disabilities gain important social and academic skills. It is important because  everyone  gains important social and academic skills.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/01/inclusion-attitude-part-of-dream.html", "title": "\nInclusion Attitude: Part of the Dream\n"},

I think my little buddy was trying to get some rest.  He was super-glad when Grandma arrived with soda and snuggled him on the couch- yes, a very snuggly boy.

He stuck it out, spelled his words, and would have won the whole thing if they didn't change the rules for the last round. But, they change the rules for the last round, so he wasn't the Grand Champion. He totally, totally rocked the house.  The long story... well, it was one of those experiences that have ups and downs and odd moments and great moments. This was the third grade spelling bee, so all the third grade came to watch it, and most of the parents of the kids actually in it- 24 of them (two from each class). For their \"practice round\", each child stood and spelled their name. Most of the kids got up, precisely spelled their name, and sat down. Joey did this Joey Style, which was a lot more fun, with a lot more awesomeness. He got up there with enthusiasm and relish. And then the whole room laughed. Most of the parents laughed because, hey, he was cute. But the laughter from the kids, that was different. You could tell by the little undertow of jeer and imitation, that there were an awful lot of those kids laughing  at  him, not  with  him. All the talk about teaching kids about diversity, about respect, about creating supportive environments... these are the kids Joey had to deal with all summer, or the ones that didn't know him at all. Some of the parents, who didn't know me from a turnip, whispered something about wondering why \"that kid\" was up there. I knew they wouldn't be saying such things an hour from then.  By the time Joey was the only one to spell his word correctly of the final four, those cheers were  for  him, not  at  him.  But in the final round of a spelling bee, the rules change. When you spell your word correctly, but everyone else does not, you then have to spell  another  word, or everyone else gets to come back and have another round. Unfortunately, Joey's word was \"dignified,\" and he mis-spelled it completely (it was not a word he had seen before, it's not on the spelling word lists). Everyone got to come back, and this time, he was discombobulated enough to mis-spell the next word (\"salute\"), so he was out. The two kids who went on? They  both  mis-spelled their next words, before finally the one child spelled two words correctly in a row and was proclaimed the winner.  Joey was a little upset, but I brought a prize to reward him for even trying the bee. He ran at first, saying he was a loser, that he lost. Mrs. C got down and looked him right in the eye and told him that he was winner, that he was the best speller in the class, reminded him that he had spelled the words correctly when everyone else had missed theirs, and told him how proud she was of him. We sat with the other bee contestants and let him have his present, and all those kids were cheering him and saying things like, \"you know you really won, Joey- you were the first winner!\" and telling him how great he was. And his class? They lined up and everyone insisted on giving him a high-five, and cheering.  Parents stopped me in the lobby and the parking lot to say, \"To us, he was the real winner! He was the one who really won that spelling bee!\" If nothing else, he earned his respect, and showed a lot of his peers (and their parents) that he was no pity participant, but a true contestant; one who had, by all rights of the rules of the majority of the game, won. He showed them what true diversity means. We all have strengths. And it is awesome to be unique.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TUD7E2B4mLI/AAAAAAAADzc/nGMs83jKmF8/s1600/joey_final4.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/01/changing-rules.html", "title": "\nChanging the Rules\n"},

My baby was reading my squirrel post yesterday, and he noticed my avatar icon. \"Why you have your hand up there, Mom?\" he laughed. I told him it was Uma. He didn't remember Oobi. It was his favorite show. So fast. So fast.  I took the old art down from his closet door. The closet door is coming off; Andy's room is quite small, and that little extra floor space will actually be a big improvement. I put the old drawings and pastings in a little box. There a cow, and a spider, and a sheet of dinosaur stickers that were rewards for training that he adored. He wants Star Wars posters now.  I put Joey's Toy Story toys in one bin in his room. I sorted out the Cars toys, but I am wondering if they go in the Basement pile or the Donate pile. Cars with eyes are apparently for little kids. What does Joey play with? Play for Joey is not usually like other kids. He likes wooden spoons, writing tablets, and sticks better than dolls or toys. But then, he and Andy played Toy Story all day yesterday, with his Woody and Buzz. Scripted pretend play is still pretend play. I leave the Cars stuff a little longer; Andy might still want to play with them, and having him go into Joey's room to get them may encourage him to engage Joey in the play. Good for both of them.  The Fisher Price bus? Donate. It's a wrench to put a bus in the donate box, as Joey loves buses. However, it is not  Bus . It is a baby toy, a toddler toy, and it is still in decent shape. He hasn't played with it in ages. He's more into space stuff now. It is time to move on.  My babies just aren't babies anymore.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/01/in-which-momma-realizes-her-boys-arent.html", "title": "\nIn Which Momma Realizes Her Boys Aren't Babies Anymore\n"},

It isn't just too much of everything everywhere; there can also be an intensity of sensory input that can send him into Red Cheek Wonder. Combined with his naturally pink cheeks, he would be an excellent poster child for Campbell's Soup.  He's just like his Mom.  I have to be careful about going to movie theaters. The overload can give me a high fever, and almost always gives me the cheek flush. The other thing that drives my blood pressure to flaming? Meetings. Trying to listen to not only what is being said, but what is being said between the lines, what is not being said, what is being meant but not actually said, the implications of the ideas being said, especially in a meeting where all those things can have consequences for my Joey or my Andy?  Overload.  So I sat there this evening trying to pretend my cheeks weren't burning and my temperature was not going through the roof, listening intensely to the changes being proposed for the middle school here (where Joey will have to be in two more years). Then I got in my little tweets into ears about the miscommunications about Joey's therapist coming in for observation, and that I would like to come in for observation next week. I sometimes wonder if others can tell when I am in overload, or if they just assume I have very red cheeks like Joey all the time. I bet they don't know that the red cheeks are a sign of overload. They probably think it is something else, like being nervous or not being truthful.  I wonder how often Joey goes through his days as I went through this evening, trying to function through the overload, trying to follow everything and process it without being fully overwhelmed. Only he has processing issues I don't think I have, making it that much harder for him to get through.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/02/sensory-overload-and-red-cheek-wonder.html", "title": "\nSensory Overload and the Red Cheek Wonder\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 27, 2011", "body": "\nThere is definitely something wrong in a society when people with disabled children have to choose between paying their rent or paying for the care of their child. I have a couple of friends in this catch-22. Technically, so are we, but we manage to bring in enough to not have such a touch choice. The people I know really caught in this crack are children with very severe disabilities, where the children require a lot of medical care and equipment as well as therapies and other specialized care. The way the system works, they can't make any more money- one parent needs to be home for the child(ren), and if they make over a certain income, their children lose important medical support and services, such as Medicaid or Social Security. Parents self-train because they cannot afford nursing or to hire care, some have to homeschool because the special education system takes too long to fix serious issues that threaten the health and education of the child who is already severely challenged and endangered. Respite care costs money. Wheelchairs cost money. Alternative communication costs money.  I certainly understand reserving government assistance for the neediest families. The problem is that no one in the private sector picks up the slack. The system is made is actually  create  needy families. It becomes a vicious cycle for families who make too much to qualify for assistance, but not enough to pay for both household expenses and therapy. What happens to them? They have to move back in with their parents,  if  they have that resource. They have to quit jobs to qualify for the assistance, instead of continuing to support themselves as much as they can and stay off other assistance programs, just getting the assistance they actually need. They drain any saving they have, trying to keep their children off those same assistance programs as much as they can. They spend their days being nurses, caretakers, lawyers, advocates, social workers, coordinators, therapists, educators... because no one can afford all of these services, and yet they are all needed because of the way our society views and treats people with disabilities and their families. Even with families who step up to the plate, no one wins a game on their own.  The attitude of the general public seems to be \"sucks to be you.\" The idea that someone might need assistance means that person is somehow less, somehow a parasite. How very Victorian of them. Instead of being grateful for good fortune, opportunity, and talents, too many in society are spiteful. We need to advance as a society, and look at the basic ideas that move societies beyond the every-man-for-himself attitudes of might makes right: that we are all in this together, and none of us make it out alive. When we stick together, and support each other, everyone's needs can be met and everyone can contribute. Everyone has talents and challenges, and we can all do the best we can if we all help, and don't leave anyone shouldering their lot alone. We can't just assume those who need help are somehow not as good as those who have the opportunities to not be in need. You'd be amazed how quickly those tides can be turned, and the one who thought themselves self-sufficient suddenly and unexpected becomes one in need.  It's a simple rule, folks. Treat others as you would wish to be treated.

The child has appeared from nowhere, materialized into my space.  \"You're my sweet goo goo,\" he half-whispers, a sort of stage whisper he has acquired for these kinds of moments. Perhaps he means to whisper, but is instead using the tones demonstrated to encourage him to whisper in certain contexts. I could go into the origins of the odd intimate-title, but it would be pointless, the origins have no meaning into his use of the words now. He pauses for the expected and anticipated reply.  \"You are my sweet Joey-Boy,\" I complete the exchange with a kiss on his cheek. He rubs his face on mine, nose-to-nose, cheek-to-cheek, then brushes the lips again.  \"My sweet goo goo,\" he repeats. He leans his head against me a moment. Then he is gone, back to play his  Poptropica  or with his Toy Story figurines.  In the midst of anxiety and craziness, Joey has also hit a lovey-stage. He wants lots of hugs, lots of attention, lots of closeness. He is doing this to one of his teachers, too. As Andy has hit the \"Mom-leave-me-alone\" stage, having Joey to smooch on is lovely; but like so many other shifts in behavior and attitude, I worry. Is he feeling lonely, or left out, or needy, or somehow downtrodden? Does he need the deep pressure, or the attention, or both? Is this another sign of depression?  I try to make no snap assumptions, but try to give him what he is asking for- lots of hugs and kisses, lots of assurances that he is still a sweet, handsome, intelligent person. I take the opportunity of having him so close to my face to give him specific praise (\"I was so proud of you for getting dressed so nicely this morning!\", \"Thank you for throwing out your chip bag, that is so helpful!\", \"I saw you got a 100% on your math quiz, great job!\") I let him run his hands and face over mine, an exploration that he has delighted in since he was a babe.

But my audiology tests came back perfectly normal, so obviously I can hear, right? Right?  What? I didn't catch that.  I took my mom with me. I'm glad I had a witness, or I would have thought I was crazy. The ear doctor sure seemed to think I was. The only suggestion he had was that maybe I was having trouble with \"background noise\", an auditory processing issue; but he didn't want to give me that test, because hey, what could we do about that, anyway?  What? I can't hear you. Can you repeat that again?  I'm not saying there isn't some possibility for this theory. I thought about when I have the hardest time hearing. After a summer of fluid in my ears (which the ear doc says couldn't have been fluid in my ears, because it is really rare for adults to have fluid in their ears, it must have been hair or wax or something like that, even though I had a doctor check out my ears and apparently my ear canals are particularly clean), I started having trouble. During, in fact, but I attribute the during to the \"fluid\" (which, by the way, hurts, and can cause my ears to become sensitive to high-pitched sounds like boy squeals. It was a long summer). My mom noticed it. She found talking to me in the car, I sometimes didn't even know she had spoken. My students noticed it. They have to repeat themselves a lot, which they find annoying. When my doctor checked my ears, I think she thought I was being silly, too, until she tried to tell me something while she washed her hands, and it was obvious I didn't hear her.  What's the connection there? Sure enough, noise. The staticy white noise: the rush of the road and wind in the car, even with the windows up, plus the heater blowing. In my class, I am video linked to another classroom, and for reasons unknown, they placed the microphone next to the heater/air conditioner, so that there is a constant sound of blowing air or static in my classroom. The sound of the running water with the aerator. Like TV snow.  It may not explain the occasional pain, why it seems to come and go (I have days I can hear better than others, and sometimes it is one ear, sometimes the other, sometimes both), or why it suddenly appeared.

Which for us are report papers. But whatever.  Andy's \"grades\" are based on the Satisfactory System. It works like this:  S- Satisfactory.  P- Progressing with Effort.  N- Needs Improvement.  Apparently, this school system assumes kids (or their parents?) can't handle real grades until third grade. Andy got all S reports this time! Even in handwriting! Woo-hoo!!!  Joey's reports ar a little more complicated. First, we have the grade report. This mixes real grades with the Satisfactory System grades. Academic subjects get real grades. Other benchmarks, such as social skills and specials (music, art) get Satisfactory System grades.  How accurate is it? He has a C in science and a B+ in spelling.  Excuse me? The boy who won the spelling bee has a B+ in  spelling ?  That probably has more to do with the N in \"turns in work on time\" than his actual grasp of the subjects. Or his N in \"self-control.\" Which means that the report card isn't very useful for gauging much, other than, hey look, my kid is autistic and needs support in turning in his homework! Really? No kidding!  The other part of Joey's report is his IEP report. Not much has changed. Again. Which really does make me angry and continues the frustration. This is ridiculous. It is frickin'  FEBRUARY , people. This time, no one bothered to put in comments except the speech therapist. We have another \"no instruction\" for dealing with teasing and bullying. I'm sure the excuse will be \"it doesn't happen here!\" I now think the only answer for that from here will be, \"and what have you observed during PE and recess? How much observation has been done? And why were people laughing at him at the start of the spelling bee? How have you helped him to cope with people laughing at him in large groups like that?\"  Middle school is closing in fast.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2011", "body": "\nWe just had our second triennial. Has Joey been in school so very long? It was a fascinating meeting. We had all four of Joey's teachers there, the speech therapist, my private occupational therapist (the school one didn't even  try  to come!), and the school psychologist. Oh, and me.  We started with classroom updates. Joey has a regular ed teacher and a special ed teacher in his inclusion room, who spoke about his improvements, his setbacks since Christmas, what he is doing well and what is still a struggle for him. He is spectacular in math and spelling, not so much in reading. Since Christmas, he has been able to be in reading group only a handful of times due to behavior and sensory problems. (Remember this was a child in a reading group in a REGULAR classroom last year). It has been interesting watching these teachers realize what Joey can do, and how he is actually disabled. The one teacher has figured out that Joey's reading comprehension is not the problem, it is his ability to communicate what he comprehends, and to answer questions. She spent the meeting correcting folks every time it was mentioned that he was having trouble with reading comprehension. \"It's not the comprehension- it is what he is able to communicate that he comprehends!\"  He is doing better with noise and assemblies- the bigger problem is boredom.  Joey spends a good part of his day in self-contained, and that teacher is new. There was a whole different attitude towards teaching from that facet of the team. Mr. T takes his kids as they come, and works to make sure they are learning. He seemed surprised at some of the problems and concerns in the inclusion room, which he simply saw as not a problem, but just facts of the child. Joey likes to walk around and needs movement. The inclusion room attitude is, \"how do we get him to sit down?\" The self-contained attitude is \"how do I give him opportunities to move?\"  Then we went to look at the evals- except there weren't any. The last speech eval was done by my private therapist, and we were about to renew it when the office was closed- so it was from 2008. The last developmental? 2005. We had some info from his gifted and talented screening which placed him in the superior range, but the intelligence test they gave him- and they only gave him selections from any of the tests- only put him at 58%. The math part? Only \"high average.\" Well, we knew those tests were inaccurate.  The speech therapist stepped in and gave an overview of her experience in lieu of a formal eval. It was interesting to hear how different her assessment of concerns were from those of the classroom. The classroom teachers noticed trouble with communicating understanding of the feelings of others, ability to express narrative sequence, and expressing the main idea of a passage (Joey tends to place equal emphasis on all the details instead of being able to capture the larger picture in reading a passage; I understand this is pretty common in autism). The speech therapist was interested in his struggle to make predictions, create or understand narrative, or answer complex questions. Sounds like IEP goals to me...  Then my private OT stepped in with her eval, which was from the spring, and yet still a good snapshot of Joey and his abilities for functioning. Funny what info you can get from appropriate evals done in a timely manner.  We decided to update all the evals, do some cognitive testing, and have him take the complete tests provided by the gifted and talented people, even though he \"doesn't qualify\"- we want to understand why these tests are not accurate, what skills he does have, and how to support and teach him to help them be accurate, with the goal of having him graduate with a regular high school diploma, not a provisional/special ed one. He needs to be able to take SOL tests to get a \"real\" diploma (what? a special ed diploma is a piece of pity paper? Do people have  any  idea how much work these kids do?) Then came the good part.  My OT piped up to ask a few questions. Or drop a few bombshells. Whichever.  Since Joey needs to move to learn, he will do it whether given appropriate opportunities to do so or not. What appropriate opportunities were being provided? Math is done in centers- plenty of opportunity to get up and walk around. Reading is done seated in a group... no wonder he has a harder time there! She provided some suggestions, such as allowing him to read standing up. Mr. T apparently was doing that already, and hadn't really thought it odd that Joey likes to read standing up. I remember when he had to stand up to eat. (I'll never forget it, as we were accosted in a restaurant once because of it!) Yep, different attitude.  Then we discussed Joey having communication alternatives for when he is excited, angry, frustrated, upset- times when he is likely to lose his ability to access language. This is a sticky point for me. I have a terribly difficult time getting others to understand that just because Joey is verbal, doesn't mean is he is verbal  all the time . His ability to access language and use it effectively plunges when stress and anxiety come crashing in. I think that is true for most kids, but for Joey, it is an extreme. We talked about cards and items he can take with him from classroom to classroom, and items that can be copied for each classroom. He likes to carry things on his head. The notebook made for the self-contained was being used in the inclusion. Many of the interventions we had developed had faded into the background and needed to be reinstated. When Joey doesn't need a certain support for a long while, it can be easy to forget to leave it in the toolkit- but when he needs it, he needs it NOW. Our OT also suggested training Joey to use a card to indicate when he is processing and needs extra time to respond. It can take Joey up to three minutes to process through information to the point he can answer a question. Teachers expect answers within 5 seconds. That is a huge gap, and there is concern he is being upbraided for not listening or responding when he is processing. The card would be cue to the other person that Joey has heard them, and needs time. Apparently, our OT went to a conference with an autistic woman who used these cards to great effect, and she instantly thought of Joey.  Then came the Big One. We know Joey is gifted in math and spelling... so what gifted programs are available for him?  Gifted programs are not made to be accessible. They assumption of being \"super-able\" pervades our attitudes, and that of society. The gifted program is designed \"for kids who are generally gifted... kids with pocket talents are handled through differentiation.\" In other words, the program is designed for super-abled kids, not kids with specific gifts. Hmmm.  I doubt I will fight this battle, though. The gifted program is another pull-out, another transition, and not designed to meet Joey's needs. It is another set of people to train, who probably have even less interest in learning what is needful or dealing with disability in their program. A program where kids are given a project and just told to \"go for it\" would be an anxiety-ridden disaster for Joey at this point.  Yet the issue remains hanging there. Why can't someone like Joey participate in the gifted program, when he is clearly gifted? Why is he cut off from that social circle? And how can that be addressed? And if boredom is a problem, how is that being addressed?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/02/triennial-again.html", "title": "\nTriennial again\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2011", "body": "\nYou may remember last spring I took the boys to see some of the sights of our town, including the  Hugh Mercer Apothecary , and was very pleased to find the docents patient and willing to help accommodate us. The boys were off on Monday, so we fished about for President's Day stuff to do. Joey was not in a good mood for a long ride to Wakefield, and Ferry Farm was closed (why is the farm where George Washington grew up closed on President's Day? I have no idea). So I settled on another go at the apothecary.  Unfortunately, this time wasn't so pleasant.  When you enter the apothecary, the front receiving room includes a wall of medicines and a counter of jars filled with interesting herbs and such. The tour starts in the next room, which was apparently the doctor's surgery. There may be a couple more rooms in the tour, but I don't know, we've never gotten that far. They spent a very long time in the surgery, explaining what medicine was like in colonial times, quite graphically. It's a pretty nice little presentation for adults and children who can easily sit and focus.  When we arrived, the tour was well underway with a room full of children in the surgery. Since you have to pay for the tour ($5 per adult, $2 for kids 6-12), I thought it a good opportunity to let my guys try to settle and see if the tour would be a good idea. The docent was not the one there before, and she immediately started badgering us about how it was a paid tour and much to the effect of \"pay up, lady.\" I explained that I would pay in a minute, as I was trying to get a handle on my guys. Andy was asking questions about the counter, Joey was asking questions about the furniture, and I didn't particularly want either of them running about the room while I was trying to get money settled. Both boys were being pretty good about their voices, so I didn't really see why the woman started fussing about us being in the room, but she did- \"its a paid tour, and you're disturbing it\" sort of comments.  Why isn't she going to let us wait for the next tour, since it was a paid tour and already well under way?  I wondered.  I started having my second thoughts, and quickly explained that my child was autistic and I wanted him to get used to the room for a moment. I think had the woman given us a couple of minutes to settle, we would have been ok, as I had gotten them both sitting on a bench and was working to determine if this tour was going to be something we could handle. But she didn't, so Joey picked up on the mood and decided he was done. He announced his wish to leave in a fairly loud voice- one that I would readily say was disruptive to the other room, where they were still going on about pulling teeth- and I was by now quite sure we were not welcome. Andy wanted to stay and ask more questions about the herbs and hear the tour, but we weren't getting the minute we needed to pull Joey together.  \"Come on, we're not welcome here,\" I explained to get him out the door. Now the woman started saying things like, \"I was a teacher for 29 years and know something about...\"  and \"I'm just trying to help you...\" and \"You don't have to be so nasty about it!\"  A teacher for 29 years? And you don't know an autistic child when you see one? Or offer to help accommodate a disability instead of running your mouth? This was getting worse by the minute. I finally got Andy gathered and out the door, and Joey made a break for the library just down the street.  Now, you'd think once I had removed my children from the situation, it would be done. She had her silent front room back, but was she happy? No. In her full colonial costume, this woman actually came out and followed us a way down the street, making similar comments about how rude and nasty we were being and how \"some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed in the morning!\" No kidding, lady. You just made it that kind of day for us, that's for sure.  And guess what else is closed on President's Day? The library.

I got the questions the kids offered this morning, so I don't have a lot of time to prepare and think. I hope my talk with Joey's class goes even half so well.  We are a very small school system. In fact, there is only one school per level. We have one lower elementary, one upper elementary, one intermediate, and one high school.The kids that Joey sees in class today are likely the same kids he saw for the last three years, and he will still be looking at them nine years from now.  I was surprised to find how many kids did not know Joey this summer; or, perhaps I ought to be more accurate there. Everybody knows Joey. Not everybody has had to work with him in their classes, or are familiar with his differences. Since he is not in the mainstream classes right now, even fewer are getting to know him and learn to accept those differences. It is likely at this point that Joey will spend the majority of his school time in \"inclusion\" classrooms, where he will have access to a special education teacher all day. The majority of those kids are hand-picked to be supportive and benefit from that environment as much as the special needs children. Therefore, it is likely we will be seeing this particular group of kids for a long, long time.  I need to get this right.  I'll keep you posted.

Connecting with people, for me, is about having new eyes to look at the world and new views of experience, and sharing them. I don't mind if we disagree, even on some very big issues. There is nothing so much fun as having involved conversations where I present my evidence and views, and get to hear and see someone else's, even if I don't agree.  Apparently, I am very weird.  I have some really excellent, intelligent friends. I love to talk about religion, and politics (though that is harder for me, because I always feel like I should more information). If we vary so very widely and vehemently that it would cause a problem, I'm probably not friends with you (for example, I don't believe you have the right to kill another person for any reason, though I will tolerate a difference in opinion as to defining \"person\"- but you probably aren't going to change my mind about my own definition). It sometimes takes me by surprise that others are shocked that I don't agree with them, or see the world a they do. For example, I was having a conversation with a friend the other morning, and she suddenly interpreted something I said as a personal comment. When I thought about it, I realized how I said what I said could very well be taken personally if you were taking the whole conversation very personally- and I apologized. I didn't mean it as personal, and I didn't want to hurt my friend's feelings; I just was trying to get a good look at her point of view, since we have very different political views and values, and she has a lot of information about her views that gives me something to think about (after all, media outlets all have their biases...) But I was surprised to realize that to her, it was personal. To me, it was just a discussion of possibilities, problems, and various possible solutions.  Religion is another topic I love that gets me into trouble. The fact that I am religious is potentially offensive to some folks. The fact that I don't take any religious narrative dead-set literally is very offensive to some other folks. Religion, by its very nature, tends to be interpreted personally. Take my post about how I believe in  Santa Claus . What a variety of responses, opinions, and attitudes I got, and not just in the comment section! My head spun, especially with how personally so many people took the whole post... which missed the whole point.  To me, such conversations help get you thinking. It allows for connections, weaving thoughts and information together with a focus on a topic or hypothesis. To draw on a myriad of sources, thoughts, facts, and observations is the whole point of having discussions. You can't do that if everybody agrees with you all the time. Well, not very well.

When we last met, it became glaringly obvious that completing such evaluations had been overlooked by the school. He hadn't been properly evaluated since he entered the system... six years ago. There is a big difference between a 2-year-old and an 8-year old.  One of the section that had been done was some intelligence and talent testing for the gifted program, because I insisted it be done. I was told he didn't qualify. Yes, he was excellent in math and above-average in reading, but his intelligence testing was only 58%.  Right.  How do you test a child with a communication disorder?  I know there are many \"non-verbal\" tests out there, but we need to consider how those tests are administered and what they are testing, especially in a child with communication disorders. Showing Joey a picture instead of words and then asking him questions is still testing his disability rather than his ability- because for Joey, it is expressive language and processing  questions  that causes a problem.  How do you test someone who has a problem answering questions?  For many of us, solutions may seem obvious, as many of my readers deal with their child's communication disorders every day, and we fight to get needed information from them. We know how to win those battles, at least some of the time. And many of us know the tricks: rephrase the questions, make the question into an instruction, try a different activity where the skill must be displayed, use visual cues or language to elicit response, give the child plenty of time to process and respond, pay attention to the responses as a whole. I could go on.  Did Joey's test administrator know these tricks? Did s/he use them? To what extent? How much processing time was permitted? At what disadvantage was he put, and still come out at 58%?

We started with the disaster summer program, and spiraled into disaster from there. We have been \"in the system\" seven years now. This is the first year joey will meet none of his goals.  None.  We've had all sorts of promises made about next year, but nothing on paper yet. We have a meeting next week about all the updates to his evals and his testing and that sort of thing. We know what was working for him. We now can say clearly what does not.  Knowing that he thrives in a model offered at another school, is it \"adequate\" if he only survives in a new model? What if we think is not, in fact, surviving? And what do we do if all those promises are not worth the air moved to suggest them? What if we walk into that IEP and there is no new autism resource person to help for the next two years? Even delaying it a year would be a disaster we would need to reckon with.  If I need to pull Joey out of the school because of his deepening depression and deteriorating mental health, what options do I have for support and education for him? I had started a gameplan for having to do that when we hit middle school. Not now.  Having alternatives is not just about being prepared for the possibilities; there is also something of having a fallback position that strengthens your current one. It is easier to fight a school when you know you're ready to pack up your toys and go home if you need to. There is something to be able to say, \"Give him what he needs.

{"date": "Monday, March 28, 2011", "body": "\nWhen we had our last school meeting, we all noticed that Joey's evals were all woefully out of date, or oddly inaccurate. So we ordered a bunch of testing done, and on Wednesday, we get to look over what Joey looks like on paper.  In many ways, I love evals. They give me a little snapshot of what Joey is doing, what he isn't doing, hat he can do, and what he won't do. It also tells me a lot about the folks evaluating him, as they interpret what they see (and don't see), and how numbers on a paper relate to real actions and skills. Since Joey has so many splinter skills, it can tell me a lot when people act surprised, or talk about the problems of the testing tool, or what they think ought to be done based on the numbers. Some folks are brilliant evaluators. Some are mediocre. Some are idiots.  In many ways, I hate evals. To me, Joey is so brilliant, so creative and intelligent, so hard-working and really pitching, that seeing what that means on paper can be startlingly depressing. When you see how far he's come, and how hard he's fought to get there, to see those low percentiles and scores really takes the wind out of you. Oh, right, he's still disabled. But wow,  this  disabled? Really? And when I see how many kids are in worse shape than Joey, I wonder what their evals look like. And how their parents feel at these meetings. I get the feeling it ain't pretty.  I worry when I can be reading a story and have Joey just stand up and walk away, as if I wasn't even there. Andy asks questions, wants to look at the pictures, wants to talk about what might happen or what he knows is coming up in his favorites. Sometimes I think Joey is listening, but then he abruptly leaves. Or I think he's busy wiggling, and he comes back with something parroted from the book (so at least he's hearing me!) He has a lot of trouble remember what happens in a story from page to page. I think when I write my Joey Story, I am going to put him in it (to give it appeal) and keep it on a single spread (so we don't have to turn the pages).  I worry when he can't find an object that is right in front of him, or when he can't hand me something I am pointing to. Joint attention remains such a challenge for him. Following instructions in a set sequence is so frustrating. Using a button is still impossible. He's eight years old, and can't tie his shoes or button a pair of jeans. He can't follow dynamic pretend play. He can't maintain a conversation. Answering questions is still a challenge. Communicating events in his day is a distant dream for us.  What will the numbers say? Will they reflect his abilities and disabilities? Or even worse, will they  not  reflect his abilities and disabilities?

{"date": "Tuesday, March 08, 2011", "body": "\nYou may have noticed that last week was Read Across America. And this week is some other reading-encouragement problem. And next week will be another one. And there was one a couple weeks ago. We're a literacy society- specifically, written literacy (as opposed to oral culture), and reading is a highly regarded life skill. Reading, writing, arithmetic. With al the emphasis on this in educational programs, I'm often surprised how little of it my students have when they arrive at college. But that's for a different blog.  Joey reads. There is no ifs, ands, or buts about that. I would go so far as to say he is hyperlexic, reading far above what he can understand. Trying to figure out what he can understand is highly problematic, as he has processing difficulties that make answering questions a huge challenge. I have learned to listen for comprehension in many ways, in many observations, many of which his current teachers have yet to understand or notice. With that kind of difficulty, I'm not too fussed about him having a B on his report card for reading, as those report cards throw him into the general stream, and that means he's above-average/strong even among the whole of his class peers. I'm a little fussed because I don't think it tells me much about his actual reading and comprehension skills, though.  The real problem, however, isn't evaluating what he can do. It is getting him to do it. Joey hates to read.  No, that's not exactly right. Joey hates to read  stories .  He loves reading dictionaries. He's had a couple of books he reads, but he reads them a couple times, and then he's done with them- I suppose he has the story memorized in his head, so why read them again? Sometimes I can get him to read a science-fact book. Reading history, narrative, stories? Pulling teeth would be easier.  There are a number of problems with stories, especially fictional stories, that made them not fun for Joey. The whole narrative sequencing thing is trouble. Being able to remember what order events took place so that they make any sort of sense is a challenge. With no reference to reality and immediacy, the story sequence loses meaning.  Joey doesn't connect with most narratives. WHy should he care what Fluffy the Bunny did or said? Why should he care that Sally and Tommy went to the store? The store isn't one that he's ever seen, he's never met Sally or Tommy. Its just a jumble of strangeness with no connection to him or relevance to his life. He sees nothing of interest there.  I don't think Joey is able to form images in his head to see the story unfolding, either. This is something many of us do, as we hear the words of a good book. Most picture books are too abstract for Joey to follow the illustrations, and he takes one glance and has them, so that he spend no time exploring them. The information is recorded and catalogues and done. Using that catalogue to create new pictures is not something his brain seems to do.  The definition of \"cold\"? Excellent stuff. Useful. Catchy.  We tried mysteries like Encyclopedia Brown, trying to give him connections to characters and a puzzle to solve. We tried Wow Wow Wubbzy books, thinking his favorite character might intrigue him. We've tried science readers, picture books, chapter books, books in a series he caught any interest to at all.  Joey once said that reading hurts. We don't know what that means. Is he in physical pain? Does it hurt his feelings to be nagged about a task he doesn't enjoy, or finds useless?  His teacher was so excited last week when he voluntarily read a book for her, she actually emailed me with the news. A few months ago when he voluntarily read a book at home, I emailed her just as excited. They are email worthy incidents because they are so rare.  I am thinking about getting hold of some encyclopedias for Joey. Not kid ones, real ones. I want to see if he finds them interesting, like his dictionaries. One must remember the goal: we learn to read in order to gain access to knowledge. Not everyone is interested in social relationships and history; some want just the facts, please. If he'll read them, I'm all for it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/03/trouble-with-books.html", "title": "\nThe Trouble with Books\n"},

{"date": "Friday, April 08, 2011", "body": "\nSo Joey has stood up and taken his stand.  Now it's Andy's turn.  We've been having trouble with Little Annoying Dude (LAD) for a while now. He was in Andy's class last year, and proved himself Totally Annoying to Andy. He delighted in calling Andy names that would seem innocuous to adults (Andy Apple was a favorite), but drove Andy nutso-bonko. There were other small issues, little annoyances that suggested the child simply doesn't like Andy, finds Andy's reactions funny, and isn't very nice. Once of LAD's favorite modus operandi was to act really nice to Andy for a while, and play with him, and then start in with the annoying bits.  We spent some time with Andy talking about staying away from LAD, even when LAD was pretending to be nice. Find other people to play with, tell him that he's being annoying and mean, reporting to a teacher, that sort of thing. Things seemed to be going along as normal, everyday, playground antics. You know, kids, who don't always get along sort of thing. No big deal, right?  Welcome to this year.  Andy has been doing the \"I don't want to go to school\" dance for a while now, with the excuse of \"there's too much work!\" This sounded odd to me, and he was resistant to our advice that learning was supposed to be fun and makes you smart. But this week, the tune changed; instead of being too much work, it was too much LAD.  LAD is no longer in our class, but we still see him in the cafeteria and on the bus. Far more concerning is the widening of the stakes: LAD has recruited his little friends into the game. Some of those friends  are  in Andy's class. And on Andy's bus. And in the cafeteria. And on the playground. And...  Its one thing when you have one kid who is annoying you. It is a whole new problem when you have a whole group of kids who pop up throughout your day pulling the same annoyances, playing with you until LAD appears and then they turn away from you, poke you in the back of the head with pencils, I could go on.  We took several steps in quick succession. We made sure Andy told the child to stop. Andy felt if he went to the bus driver, the group would make it worse, so I stepped up onto the bus and said something myself. I then emailed Andy's teacher to warn her of the issue, as well as the guidance department.  And Andy had another hard day. So the next morning, we \"missed\" the bus, and I marched around to the office to write a note to the guidance counselor who had worked with Andy before in all his testing. Sometimes emails end up in the spam filter here- but notes go directly into the mailbox. I made the note fairly detailed- more than I have given here- and asked for help for Andy. I was unhappy that he was being bullied in this way, and that it had gotten worse. I was unhappy that he felt he could not go to an adult at school for fear of reprisals. I was unhappy that this had apparently gone on for a fairly long time with no one at school noticing.  Bullying is hard for adult radar to pick up. Innocuous names get shrugged off. If children suddenly change playmates in mid-recess, it is shrugged off as a new game. A child who might cry out in annoyance is told to hush and not interrupt. It is easy to miss the signs, to ignore them, to sweep them aside. All of these signs point to a very serious situation for the child being bullied and trying to get through their day.  Within an hour, I had an email from the guidance counselor. When I called another hour later, she had already pulled in the teachers- for both kids- and started identifying the other children involved, and was about to start pulling them in individually for a discussion of the situation. She was planning to get on the bus and make sure the kids were broken up. The cafeteria was re-arranged to keep LAD away from Andy. As our counselor said, \"This is bullying. We don't play this. If you start seeing these signs again, don't wait. Call guidance in immediately.

{"date": "Saturday, June 04, 2011", "body": "\nJoey's school had an awesome end-of-year Beach Party yesterday. They had crafts, two moon bounces, an area for chalking up the sidewalks, a raffle, free drinks and snacks, and a DJ for dancing (who did an excellent job selecting music and being appropriate and silly). Party it up for summer!  Joey enjoyed the chalk. He liked drawing  Angry Birds  and writing things like \"I love Dad\" and \"For ages 7-12 with adult.\" Whenever it got overwhelming inside, he did a pretty good job of going out and bouncing or writing. He also made himself an ultra-cool  Angry Birds  pinwheel. Self-regulation win! Our only brush with a real meltdown was right at the start. There were some super-sized beachballs for the kids to play with, and Joey was playing with one. Some of the bigger kids came along and knocked it away from him so they could play with it all over the dance floor. Joey was, naturally, upset, especially since the bigger kids were not interested in letting him play, too, but were concerned with knocking it away from each other. Hence, the distraction of making the Angry Birds pinwheel, and our first trip outside to discover the chalk and moon bounces.  With the dance floor so loud, I was very pleased to see the school also have quieter areas for the kids to retreat to, such as the crafts and the outdoors chalk and bouncers. It worked perfectly! I won't say it wasn't hard to watch him, though. All the other kids were dancing, laughing, shouting at each other, tangling and mingling and getting into groups. There was lots of line dancing, which Joey showed some interest in but clearly couldn't keep up with (I may track down some of the songs and see if I can teach him the steps, though there was one called the \"Cha Cha Slide\" and that, when they told you to \"cha-cha\", the step everyone did was  not  a cha-cha, but a cross box-step. Kinda weird.) Anyway, otherwise, Joey pretended the floor was sand and that he was a dunebuggy or a car, with his pinwheel as the steering wheel, and walked circuits around the dance floor, ignoring everyone (including his best buddy who followed him around trying to get him to dance). One exception- early on, about half a dozen little girls saw him, squealed as if he were a rock star, and joined into a huddle of hugging him. Over the course of the evening, these young ladies each did their best to get him to dance, made sure he met their parents, and often gave him hugs if they found him (and he's return the hug quickly before driving off).  I let him know that if he wanted to leave, he was welcome to do so. He did go outside a few times. However, he spent most of his time doing circuits in a room that was clearly overwhelming for him- dark with flashing lights, lots of people moving, and incredibly loud music. He knew his friends were there. He knew that is was a party, and he was supposed to be having fun. He wanted to be there. He wanted to see his friends, and be part of the party. He did his best to cope and be a part of the party.  Towards the end, as he got very tired, he and his buddy grabbed a hula hoop, sat down, and pretended to be Porky Pig at the end of a Looney Tunes cartoon. They laughed. They enjoyed themselves.  I won't say it wasn't hard to watch him doing circuits when everyone else was dancing and interacting. It was hard to see him ignore the world and be alone in a sea of people.  But he had friends, who tried very hard to include him. They were happy he was there, and he was happy to see and be with them. Joey had fun. He was happy. His way.  We are SO going to this thing next year.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FEUr_KDtOKo/TerZA8wbgJI/AAAAAAAAD8A/8EYT6u42P50/s1600/joey_chalk.jpg", "http://www.rovio.com/index.php?page=angry-birds", "http://www.angrybirds.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cOzKr3F4LGE/TerZAg7WUGI/AAAAAAAAD74/cnQ9eANGBaE/s1600/joey_dancefloor_marked.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D07JMrLMRaE/TerZASAxNyI/AAAAAAAAD7w/aoqRV6Qqvqc/s1600/joey_thatsallfolks.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/06/good-is-in-eye-of-beholder.html", "title": "\nThe Good is in the Eye of the Beholder\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 04, 2011", "body": "\nWell, the meeting wasn't nearly as horrible as we planned for, and we think... we think... we got the bottom line straightened out. We're futzing with the different environment possibilities for Joey to try to find ways to keep him small groups with few distractions and as much in the \"main stream\" as possible (where his academic needs can be better met). These changes require that he have an aide, the kind that knows when to stay in the background, and when to intervene: a \"lifeguard.\" Understanding what we wanted was easy. Figuring out how to word it in an IEP was not.  The interesting resistance we got was about the use of sign language for visual cues. There seemed to be resistance to the use of signs from the speech therapist (how odd is that?) and resistance because \"combining signs and picture cues might be confusing.\" We thought that odd, too. Joey is a smart little guy. He knows what he can access and use at a given moment, and he does very well with signs. It helps his speech and auditory comprehension immensely. Why would adding in using pictures for certain choices (such as what type of activity he wants for a break or what object he needs for sensory issues) to using signs as prompt (such as \"listen\", \"wait\", \"ready?\" etc) be confusing?  Whatever.  We are currently going over the IEP, because it is a lot of information and a lot of goals and a lot that could be misinterpreted by the next team, and we don't know yet who will be the teachers on that team. These teachers have had all year with him, and when they have a goal, they know what they \"mean.\" But is this written to make it clear to the next teacher? Not sure.  Ah, IEP season. Just what everyone needs to lift their blood pressure and get the cobwebs swept from the mind.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/04/doomsday-averted-we-hope.html", "title": "\nDoomsday Averted (We Hope)\n"},

{"date": "Friday, July 08, 2011", "body": "\nMy bestest girl friend and old college roommate is in town, and I am so excited I am going to get to see her in the morning, I could just go SQUEEE!!! And I am so nervous that I can't sleep.  I haven't seen Sue in a few years. Her son is about six months younger than Andy, and she has a daughter who is a preschooler. The last time I saw her son, he was just walking. I have never seen the daughter at all.  Sue's best quality is she tells it as she sees it. She doesn't allow for excuses in facing problems. She's not afraid to tell you when she sees a problem. She's not shy about helping you fix it. If you need to brainstorm ways of coping with an issue, she's the one to call. She's awesome.  On the other hand, with our family, what one sees is all too often the tip of a mysterious iceberg. A day with Joey might  look  like one thing, and  be  something completely different. The usual ideas and fixes, or the ones that may  look  like they work or might be helpful, often are nothing of the sort. The strategies that work with a lot of kids only escalate the anxiety for Joey. And there is no getting around it: tomorrow is going to be a hard day for Joey. It won't be his schedule. We don't know what we are going to do when we get to Northern VA to see Sue and her kids. I suggested the Reston zoo, but apparently she took her kids to the National Zoo today, so they may be zoo-ed out. (Zoos tend to be good to take my kids, because there is flexibility but familiarity- they know what a zoo is and what to expect at one, so if I have one little guy out of sorts, the other is still entertained).  I think a great deal of this woman. She is a powerful, dynamic person of dignity, character, and high respect. What she will think of me and my guys when she finds my back-up parenting plan is to bring iTouches loaded with Angry Birds and am not afraid to use them to get us through lunch? That my way of letting Joey get comfortable is to let him be Quack or Buzz Lightyear, and play along? When she finds my best trick for getting Joey's behavior under control if he starts to melt down is to hug him instead of just putting him in time out or whatever other method people use these days? We have differed and butted heads about differences in opinion in such kinds of matters before.  So many people react to Joey in so many different ways, and to how we handle Joey. Sue has not really seen Joey or had to deal with his autism before. Though I have faith that Sue, being Sue, will not love us the less or turn away from us, I simply don't know how this will play out. It is likely to be a long day for Joey, so I have lots of extra prep to do in a few hours to mitigate and support him through it. And though I know few people really understand the energy and work that goes into such a day for us, I at least hope she'll understand, no matter what happens, that I am doing my best for my guys.  And I wouldn't miss it for the world.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/07/visit-in-morning.html", "title": "\nA Visit In The Morning\n"},

ESY is \"Extended School Year.\" These are the services Joey receives during the summer from the school system because having an 11-week break in services turned out to be a bad idea, even in the eyes of the school. When we first got ESY, it was one of the Holy Grails of Special Education here. The school personnel fought us with everything they could, and I am still convinced that preschool ESY is a Holy Grail in this system. Which is, of course, stupid. Many special needs kids require year-round schooling to retain skills. I think it would be a good idea for non-disabled kids to have year-round school to retain skills. But that's another post.  Last year, the  summer was a disaster of epic proportions , leading to a school year disaster of epic proportions. Joey was anxious, depressed, wild, angry, and a general mess all year. The school personnel were not properly trained to deal with his needs, or understand his disabilities. The result was a lot of bolting, acting out, and general display of Unhappy Grumpy Anxious Depressed Joey.  Then came Monday.  We jumped up and down and stomped our feet and screamed and fussed in our way, and the school decided to put Ms. H and Ms. Macy in charge of Joey's ESY this year, and Ms. H will be managing Joey's school program come fall. Ms. H and Ms. Macy know Joey, they are well acquainted with autism and the needs of autistic students, and they are both talented educators. Does it make a difference? Oh,  hell yes .  Yes, we started the first day with a bolt. We had prepped Joey for the return of his beloved Ms. H and Ms. Macy, and he was so eager to get to school- something I had not seen in a year- that he bolted down the street to get there when the bus was a little late. This morning, I made him wait at the door. He stared out of it, saying, \"Bus! I am waiting for the bus. Where is the bus?\" until it arrived, right on time.  And when he had gotten off the bus the last two days, I saw someone I haven't seen in a year: Happy Joey. Complete with words to tell me about his day, and who was in his class, and that they played games, and he saw \"the twins and Jack-Jack\" and wanted to go visit them this afternoon (\"Let's go see Aunt Christina and the Twins and Jack-Jack, Mommy! After the pool!\"). Happy boy telling me where he wanted to eat lunch and tidbits about his morning (he's still not good at self-narrative, but he's trying!) and missing Andy and wanting to get a shovel at the dollar store and we were going to the pool after lunch and... babble babble babble, happy babble of a happy boy.

{"date": "Friday, September 09, 2011", "body": "\nI'm having one, the slow way- via email and facebook and twitter and stuff. And its the old one: would I rather my kid have autism or measles? And you know what? Its a completely stupid argument. Measles kills kids. No, not often, but often enough. It can lead to severe mental retardation/intellectual disability, and so can autism. But measles is preventable. So far, I'm not convinced that autism is, or at least we don't know how to prevent it. i can prevent measles with 99% accuracy.  My  good friend from down the street  is in Richmond today. In fact, she's been there all week. On the first day of school, we went out for chai, and it was a good thing- as I was dropping her off at her house, the school called to have her pick up one of her boys. By that evening, they were once again in fear of losing him- after ten seizures. And as far as they can tell, the only reason was he got a little fever.  I'm worried about her, and him. I'm worried about him, because hey, he's a little guy with lots of issues including seizures, and seizures are no joke. I worry about her sitting by him every time he gets a little cold, or a sore throat, or anything that might put his temp up a little, because it could trigger seizures, and they could lose him.  His brothers are also severely disabled, and have autism on top of the other issues of severe hydrocephalus they all share. This lady takes care of them, makes sure they get their food, they keep clean, they get time to play and move around and practice their walking and their swallowing. She is part of teaching them to feed themselves and communicate with modified signs. They laugh, they cry, they squeal, and the little guy even says hi.  And I come back to stupid arguments. Would she rather they be as they are, or possibly dead? And I can tell you what I would pick. I love those boys, as they are. She faces the possibility of losing one- any one of the three- at every moment. She works hard to keep them not only alive, but happy, growing, and learning. She is not interested in them suffering through measles on top of everything else, or risking death from it. Or seizures.  Stimey had a friend l ose a son  recently. I don't know what happened. But it wrenches me to even think about the possibilities of pain that Stimey's friend must be going through. It is unimaginable. May I never, never, never know what that feels like.  Which would I prefer, autistic or risk of dead? I'll take autistic.  Eleanor: There is everything in life, but hope.  Henry: We're both alive. And for all I know, that's what hope is.                              -James Goldman,  The Lion In Winter \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stimeyland.com/2011/09/heartbreak.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/09/tired-old-arguments.html", "title": "\nTired Old Arguments\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 07, 2011", "body": "\nI have done my best this summer to keep to a very strict schedule: Activity-lunch-pool.  In the past, Joey was a fairly flexible little guy. As a baby, he was happy a clam until he got really hungry, and since I was pretty regular with the food, he was all good, no matter what was going on.  Then he got a little bigger, and he needed to know what was coming. So we would talk about what would be happening that day, but we could be fairly vague. \"Going on an adventure\" was fine, he knew something fun was coming and it didn't much matter what. As long as the food came on time- not just \"eventually\"- he was all good.  Then he shifted to his obsession with clocks. However, as long as he knew where he was going, who would be there, and when to go, he was good. And life rolled merrily on for school. Not so much at home.  Here, life is more fluid. That is OK when you're only awake and home for, say, four hours; but when that fluidity becomes an all-day venture, it overwhelms Joey. His anxiety from his wild school year hasn't ebbed one  scunce . So to help him out, I have a very strict schedule.  Activity- lunch-pool.  Deviations result in increased anxiety, for better or for worse. Today we had a movie party with one his old classmates, and he was a bundle of nerves all day. He hs a birthday party to attend on Saturday, but kept insisting it was today. Nothing we said or did would change his view: the party was today, and it was today, and today was the party, and there is a party at D's today, and he was going to  miss  the party... and from there, the world started ending. Only we had discussed in detail what today would be, since rain was in the air: relax with Peep and Angry Birds, lunch with Grandma, movie party.  But it wasn't activity-lunch-pool. So all was doomed.  He was happy at lunch. He was happy with his friend here. But all the minutes around those events? That poor child worried himself into a frenzy. On top of that, Andy is having a hard time.  We have a lot of trouble getting Andy to eat. He is very picky with his food (though we are definitely back to \"picky\" and not in the realm of \"food aversive/neophobe\" anymore, hallelujah), he has a slow-emptying stomach (so he gets full fast), and on top of that, we're having a growth spurt. That child has no reserves left. If he fail to eat, if I don't push the water and the snacks, he get terribly thin and get headaches fast. He's already sound-sensitive, so you can imagine what a headache does for that child. Screaming ball of flesh. Without much flesh.  I am in a Catch-22 world of food here. Andy needs every calorie I can pack onto him and into him. Joey, with his movement and stamina issues on top of inheriting my gloriously bad metabolism, needs fewer calories than most kids his age, and is already having weight issues. We're working on creative ways to sneak Andy food, but it isn't easy. If Andy has food, Joey wants it to. Trying to explain to them both why Andy needs food and Joey doesn't hasn't really helped. I'm sure I'll get plenty of suggestions, but trust me, we've been through most ideas and failed miserably with them all. Andy is sensitive about being \"skinny\" and Joey is sensitive about being \"fat,\" That's quite enough to create a roller-coaster ride without anything else going on.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2011", "body": "\nThe sun was shining, the leaves are turning, one simply cannot waste such an afternoon. The boys did their reading, then off to the park! woo-hoo!  Usually, the park is a mixed success. Andy finds himself some friends, runs around, and has a grand time. Joey prefer to walk in circuits, look at the babies, and wander up to people at random and try to talk with them.  As an interesting side note, I can tell a lot about people by watching how they react to Joey. Some folks play right in. Some smile and try to participate. Some tolerate. Some shun. Some even get nasty. The gauge has yet to be wrong, either.  Today was looking pretty typical. Andy found some kids about his age, and starting running about with them, letting the slightly younger ones join in. He's good at that. They spent the afternoon playing Star Wars all over the park. Andy looked a bit like the Pied Piper, as he apparently was the leader of the battles; so everybody was running after him (and he's a head taller than all of the others, even the ones his own age).  Joey found the babies. One of the families questioned why he was in that area of the playground since he was \"clearly older than five.\" (So are you, dude. It isn't like Joey is blocking your kid from playing on anything, or bouncing on the spring animals. He's trying to play with your kid.) Joey picked up on the nasty right away, and gravitated towards a couple other babies with nicer parents.  And then it happened. A group of four kids appeared; they looked about Joey's age. Two girls, two boys. They looked so much alike, they must either be related (siblings? cousins?) or see a lot of each other. A clique, coming to have fun in the fall sun. Joey noticed them right away, and pulled himself away from the little ones to go check them out.  He didn't directly approach them at once. He found a stick, and wandered over to that section of the playground, the one with the bigger slides and the new seesaws. He walked about the area for a while, seeming absorbed in his stick, writing in the air, making a careful circuit. But I realized he was checking those kids out. I wondered how much he really saw in his peripheral vision; I suspect he was using it heavily to observe this interesting little group. How to approach them? What to say? What to do? They didn't wait. One of the girls called him over. One of the boys recognized him. They asked him to play- to get on the seesaw with them, help them take turns. They even had him help one of the girls, who was skittish about the seesaw; he kept the boy on the other end from taking her too high, and he patted her hand. And when it was time to go home and get dinner? They gave him high-fives, and told them they were glad to see him.  They were glad to see him, happy to include him, the one girl said she was happy to meet him, and hoped to see him again soon. He was beaming. So was I.  I can tell a lot about people, by how they treat Joey. We so did not want to ever, ever leave.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/10/i-so-did-not-want-to-leave-park-today.html", "title": "\nI So Did Not Want To Leave The Park Today\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2011", "body": "\nChristmas is a-coming and the goose is getting fat. And I like to have my shopping done by now. Once again, I have failed; such is life with children.  Yes, the children. I have started putting off the shopping completion because I have children; notoriously fickle, it is better to wait a little closer to the holidays to be sure what will interest and delight them. A child into blue and Star Wars today may want green and Ninjago by Christmas. And this is October.  Fortunately, I can go ahead and get some things, hitting the sales of the pre-Christmas clear-out, because my kids are not as fickle as some. I usually set aside some budget, though, for December. You never know.  Andy is easy. Up until now, if it had a dinosaur on it, you were all good. This year, ninjas and Star Wars reigns, and he is becoming interested in superheroes. Get him some toys in theme, grab some Mario Brothers knick-knacks for the stocking, all set and ready to go. Easy-peasy-lemon-squeasy.  Joey, not so much. The themes, I can do. Toy Story, Mario Brothers, baseball, a touch of Obi-Wan Kenobi. But what to buy? Joey doesn't play much with toys. He never did. Now he's nine, he plays with toys even less. I think if I filled his stocking with wooden spoons, his cup would runneth over. Never fear, I will have some for that purpose. After all, Christmas isn't about giving people things, it is about thinking about them and trying to bring them joy, about sharing and letting them know how much you love them. I could toss a lot of Star Wars toys at Joey, and he would be fine with that; but they would then just clutter his room or be co-opted by Andy. He already has an entire bin of wooden spoons and sticks, and five calculators. What to get the child for Christmas?  Of course, just when I find myself in quandary, we get snippets, little glimpses into that head. I took Joey with me to the auction on Sunday. I was surprised he wanted to go; the first time we went, he clearly was uncomfortable with the pace and the crowds, and last month he made it clear he did  not  want to go. This time, he asked to go, so we went. He was happy to play with his brother. Then things got started, and he wasn't as happy. He showed interest in a box with some toy trucks in it, so as they neared it, I grabbed him and tried to teach him how to bid. He seemed very pleased, especially when he bought the trucks (whole box, $4). Then he wandered off, and didn't so much as glance at them again.  I brought them in from the car Sunday night, and put them in the hall, and forgot them (if you've seen my hall, you know how that can happen). No notice was taken of them. It dawned on me that he went because Mommy was going and he bid because Mommy told him to. Oh, well.  But then, Tuesday morning came. The trucks were noticed.  \"The trucks from the auction, Mommy!\" Joey chimed, touching one.  \"Yes, dear, they're yours. You bought them, remember?\" He picked one up, held it a minute, put it down, moved on. Oh, well.  Then Tuesday afternoon came.  \"The trucks from the auction!\" He seemed joyful, pleased. He took the box into the livingroom, started playing with them- lining them up, arranging them in the box, using them to drive his little Obi-Wan Kenobi figure over the carpet. He showed them to Andy, who also commenced playing with them. Happy, happy boys. The babble began. \"The auction trucks! They are here! Someone donated them to the auction. Look, the trucks from the auction!\"   Maybe I'll go ahead and get some of those toys after all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/10/presents.html", "title": "\nPresents\n"},

I hope this year's opportunity doesn't slip through my fingers like last year.  Our director of student services handed out a very nice article about person-first language. Language is a tricky thing, since it is so powerful, yet so flexible. Language is a tool for us to communicate ideas, knowingly... or unknowingly. Showing respect should be of the utmost importance, and person-first language should absolutely be the choice, particularly in professional contexts. A professional, not knowing me, my family, or my children, should refer to Joey as a person with autism. The emphasis when speaking about Joey should always be Joey; just as you would probably prefer that anyone speaking about you should emphasize you, not some facet of you, large or small.  You may have noticed that is not how we solely refer to Joey ourselves. In fact, I get emails about it regularly. For us, Joey is autistic. Autism is not something separate from Joey as a person. It simply is a fact, one of many ways to describe Joey. When it is the important fact in the context, then it becomes the adjective of choice as appropriate, just like any other: Joey is tall. Joey is happy. Joey is squishy. Joey is intelligent. Joey is handsome. Joey is autistic.  The great thing about using person-first language is that it emphasizes the person, something that gets lost in a world of labels and misinformation. Or more properly, some one  who gets lost, especially when they are surrounded by people who are intensely ignorant of disability, ability, and special needs. It become important to communicate to such people that  everyone  is a person. It is vital to emphasize to our children that they are who they are, to highlight their ability rather than disability, and that their disability is a neutral factor in their existence; they are not poor, afflicted, suffering victims. They simply are who they are, and we start from here.  Yet there is something in acknowledging that they are who they are, and that some disabilities are intrinsic to who people are. Joey would not be Joey if he was not autistic. He would be a completely different person. I don't even know who that person would be, or would have been. They don't exist. Joey is not, to me, just a \"child with autism\", because there is no such person as Joey  without  autism.  But far more importantly, we are paying attention to how Joey refers to himself. He is not yet talking about autism. Just as when he was small and I had no name, I just  was , for Joey, autism just  is . One day, he will process that the way he thinks and understands and experiences the world is referred to by the rest of us as \"autism.\" Then comes the true test of person-first: referring to Joey as he prefers to refer to himself. Will he be \"me, with autism\", or will he simply say \"I am autistic\"?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/10/person-first.html", "title": "\nPerson First\n"},

In the morning, I read and teach sign language to two of the special needs kindergardens and the classroom that has the autism resource kids and the tier 3 self-contained kids in it (it covers all three grades). And we all have an awesome time. Then i grab some lunch, and head over to Joey's classroom* to teach sign language.  In Joey's room, when I am teaching, I have Joey as my awesome Sign Helper. He knows most of the signs, even if he doesn't do a lot of signing, and he loves being the \"teacher.\" He also loves looking up signs on my phone when someone asks for a sign I don't know. And looking up signs he fancies. He's getting good at looking stuff up.  Today, we did \"outside signs\" because most of the afternoon group are boys between 9 and 11, and I could show them signs for sports. I've shown them before, but memory is not the forte of most of these kids, for various reasons. So we did football, soccer, baseball, basketball. Then we needed hockey. I don't know hockey, and it wasn't in my faithful app. So I showed Joey how to use the Safari app on my phone, and we googled it, came up with it, and went on.  Next thing I know, he's uploading videos of the classroom to You Tube! How does he DO that? (How did he get my password???) Then he starts teaching his fellow students all sorts of new signs, looking them up and announcing \"This is hamburger!\" (shows sign) \"This is cereal!\" (shows sign) \"This is bird! Angry... bird!\" (shows signs). \"Ticket! This is the sign for ticket!\" (he shows the sign) Of course, tickets are what they get to save up for rewards. So everyone starts giggling and getting out of focus.  \"Careful!\" I say, \"or I'll show you the sign for 'homework!'\"  \"Homework!\" Joey calls out gleefully. \"Home... work!\" (he does the signs) \"Homework!\" And dutifully (and happily), his classmates learn the sign.

Then I got smacked in the face with yet another  report of despair dragging a defenseless autistic young man to his death at the hands of his primary care giver : his mother. It is the kind of story, the way it is being currently presented, that makes me cringe.  There are certain details that make me downright red in the face. The young man had been in a day program with an adult component, and the mother pulled him from it 2-3 months ago. Why? And when she had trouble getting him into another program, why didn't she contact the old center? We need more information there. Why was he pulled without having another place to go set up? That's about as wise as quitting your job without another lined up when you live paycheck-to-paycheck, then wondering why you can't pay your rent. Was there a problem at the center? Had she tried to get him in the adult service and been denied? What happened there? It doesn't make sense. Then to break down in only 2-3 months of care? There is something wrong there, too. I know lots of folks with severely disabled kids who do the day in-day out thing for years before they even start pulling their hair out. Again, not enough information. Was she completely unprepared for the responsibility and effort? Was his behavior particularly challenging? The descriptions of the young man do not suggest that, but we simply do not know. (And challenging behavior is still no reason to kill someone.) And in the end, who has the right to pull out a gun and kill another human being, for  any  reason? Call me cold, but the whole murder-suicide thing? I'm not very sympathetic to the murderer. It is one thing to take yourself out- that is tragic enough, and serious enough. I have very definite thoughts about suicide, and I am with those who say people do not \"commit suicide\"; it is more appropriate to talk of someone being \"lost to suicide.\" To take someone out with you? You are moving into a realm beyond any reason. Obviously, when you are in a state where you are suicidal, you are already not in a \"typical\" rational state. It is bad enough to lose someone to suicide. To lose your family to suicide and to murder at once? My brain goes scrambled-eggs just trying to wrap it around such a concept. You never have the right to kill anyone, unless they are about to kill  you . And I mean directly. The whole thing makes no sense. We lost two people in this incident: a young man who was doing his best to live his life, and his mother, who decided to end both lives for reasons and purposes unknown to us.  But it is something that sets me thinking, as I watch Joey and think about his upcoming IEPs and his needs and progress and \"current level of performance\" etc etc etc. There is much talk about kids \"aging out\" at 21- but this is only if it is decided that the school is still supposed to be supporting your child with educational service after age 18. With kids like Joey, who are academically on grade level or beyond, it is a much harder fight to keep them in the educational system beyond the age of 18, when their typical peers are graduating. And either way, what happens to Joey after graduation, if he is not able to live independently (yet)?  Yeah, I haven't gotten much sleep lately. Thanks.  Most of my plans and counterplans and back-up plans consider this possibility. What if Joey cannot go out on his own yet? Or, since we have no clue what the future holds, ever? Am I ready for him to stay with us forever? We aren't talking about the kid who never gets it together to move out of mom and dad's basement (though that is also a possibility- for either child- you never know). I'm talking about the possibility of Joey needing extra support, and enough of it that putting him in his own apartment would not be a good option. What other options might be out there? Am I ready for him to stay here?  I don't know too many parents who have adult children or adult loved ones with need for support to the point that living independently is a limited option, or not one. I have a friend who started a group home for her adult daughter- she had the resources to do that, and it has worked out nicely. I have a colleague who surprised me one day when my Joey was first diagnosed by revealing they had an adult child with neuro-developmental disabilities living at home (and that their adult child brought much joy to the family! Thank you for sharing that part, too!) We have a neighbor with a younger adult child who has a job with a local company and still lives with them, and that seems to be working out well for them. Would it then be a disaster if Joey remained here with me?  Hello- no. I love Joey, I love being with my Joey, and we are very very very fortunate that 1. he is Joey- a delightful and wonderful human being and 2. he functions currently at a level where the issue of supervision is not as dire as many other families I know. Yes, I have to keep the doors locked, and we have our wild days, but for the most part, Joey is Joey, and he lives in a world that fits comfortably within the family scope and understanding, just like all the other family members, no problem. In fact, if Andy develops needs that meant he couldn't live independently, I'm ready, thinking about how we would all live here together as four full adults; but I know the possibility is higher with Joey than with Andy.  Then, what happens if something happens to me? Or more correctly,  when  something happens to me, and to JoeyAndyDad?  And that is when the planning goes into overdrive.  Joey is nine years old. We're over halfway to 18. We don't know what the world will look like in nine years. More like 8 years. What plans can I be considering and implementing now, to be sure when Joey ages out and I prove to be mortal like everyone else, Joey will still be able to enjoy his life and live it? That he will have resources to recover from the loss and move on? A better plan than \"Andy will have to take care of that\"? Yes, its time to start thinking about what balls might need to be rolling to prepare for the future. after all, they aren't little long- and once you are an adult, you are an adult for a long time (we all hope). We all know adult services are seriously lacking, everywhere.  Seriously  lacking. Or non-existant.  So it is time to get started, since I doubt I will be winning the lottery anytime soon to start my disability school and family center. Though I admit to buying tickets. After all, that money goes to fund the services we already use.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_20120852"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/03/long-term-plans.html", "title": "\nLong Term Plans\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 04, 2012", "body": "\nAnd you know it is going to be, when the OT comes out and cheerfully informs the parents that today's session was about \"dealing with disappointment!\" And then, just as cheerfully, tells you that they had an egg hunt, but when the kids opened the eggs, they were full of stuff like paper clips and crumpled paper, and the kids then had to practice saying something nice about the object.  Yeah, I know why this is done in a social skills group, and the point, and all that. I can pull apart the layers of it like an onion, and go on for several blog posts about how great this exercise is supposed to be in teaching this lesson and that lesson. Blah, blah, blah. But for us, what it meant was I was heading straight into Hell.  See, Joey managed to hold it together for the therapists and his friends, but once we got in that car, it all broke loose. Yes, I know its because he trusts us and was tired and think about how difficult the OT was and blah blah blah. That isn't going to take the bruise off my arm or the tooth prints- his own- off his, thanks. And Person at McDonald's Who Forgot To Leave Off The Ketchup, Mustard, Onions and Pickles From Our Sandwich? Yeah, a big thanks for nothing to you, too. Oh, and that regular coke you gave me? You could have killed me. But that's for another blog post.  We didn't quiet down until i gave him the pom-poms to shake at Andy's soccer game. But don't worry. We fired right back up when we hit the car, even after being so very happy to see some neighbors Joey adores and running around with them for a few minutes.  Yeah. Long day, packed into the four hours we have after the school bus drops him at my door.  Then I read about  Daniel Corby . The idea that it would \"unjust to let him continue living\" makes me want to run screaming into the night. Unjust to allow another person to continue to live? Why?  Oh, right. Because this four-year-old was autistic. {*insert ugly word of choice here*} I selected the particular article to link to about it because when I linked, there were no comments yet. And I didn't want there to be comments, because when you go to ones with comments, you run screaming into the night to jump off a cliff. I don't care what resources you do or don't have, what culture you are part of, or what society thinks of you.  There is no justification for taking another innocent human life . To take a life that is trusting you to protect it? What, you think disability is worse than  death ?  It is shocking how many people do. And not only do they think it is worse than death, they think and firmly believe that people with disabilities are less than human, and deserve death. That people with disabilities have no rights, no feelings, no skills, no purpose, no value. They are less than objects, less than dirt. Some people are more subtle about it than others, but the feeling rises to the surface in ugliness that is so insidious and horrible that it is hard to know what to say or how to fight against it. Our culture, our language has difficulty communicating counter-concepts in a way that makes it clear how wrong and ugly and evil such ideas are, and yet how ingrained they have become. What would I have thought before I had Joey in my life? Sometimes I find it a terrifying thought.  Another exhausting vein of comment is people who complain that people with \"high functioning\" loved ones have no clue what it is like to have \"low functioning\" loved ones. I have news for them. The problems are different. Am I lucky to have a child who can speak? Yes. Even when he is screaming at me, \"I hate you! You hate me! Just kill me now!\" and beating on my arm so hard I worry that come day he might break it? Yeah- different problems. But dismissing my point of view in discussing the murder of a child just because he is autistic, simply because my child is \"higher functioning\" that yours? That is low. Very. Low.  I've been fortunate in being able to spend more time this year in Joey's classroom, and volunteering for several of the special ed kindergartens this year. I've seen a good range of \"functioning.\" I am still convinced that several students would be able to \"function\" better if they were given more understanding and people \"listened\" to them better, instead of imposing their own ideas and wants upon the kids. I have seen a range of problems, issues, challenges- and strengths, gifts, and hard work- but each of these kids, each of these families, is unique, meeting their challenges and lives with varying degrees of grace and success. Special needs means special efforts, no matter what the challenges or the strengths. Judging another family because their child is \"more disabled\" or \"less disabled\" is just another way of dismissing someone else's hard work and challenges. It is assuming you know more about that other person's life and experience than you do.  And none of those challenges justifies murdering a child. Period.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/del-mar/carmel-valley-mother-pleads-not-guilty-to-drowning--year/article_ed5ac378-852e-50a0-b3b0-f6413471cd10.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/04/it-was-very-long-day.html", "title": "\nIt was a very long day\n"},

It's cool and breezy, and we have no place we have to be-- no school, no sports, no therapy. I so wanted to go to the zoo today. When the boys were small, this was the kind of day that would find us on an adventure. We'd pack ourselves some snacks and drinks and spare clothes, the rest of the travel kit, hop in the car, and go explore the world. Zoo, beach, museum, mountains, Jamestowne, park, aquarium, Dinosaurland, somewhere new and interesting and fun. We'd look for shark teeth or find sheep at Wakefield or ride out to feed the goats or chase chickens. No, these outings were not the same as one might have without an autistic child in tow. Joey might not see as much or understand as much or even care as much; but we were out and about and doing. It is a life we have left aside the road. With bolting, I can't go with two boys anywhere by myself anymore. We must have a ready set of hands and legs to run in case of a sudden anxiety attack. Going anywhere outside a 20 minute drive now involves huge preparation for both boys, with very limited possibilities for success even so. Anything interrupting comfortable, predictable sameness risks major consequences. It is no longer safe for my boys to have only one adult with them.  Even when they were little, not every outing was a picture of perfection. We have pulled Joey about a zoo  in a wagon when he refused to walk. I have sat on benches with Joey and had Andy wait for calming or hunger to be appeased. There was the infamous bolt at the Renaissance Faire, when Joey was being chased by fully costumed knights. Thank goodness some kind soul managed to watch Andy while we got Joey out of the woods.  But there was also the trip when the budgies landed on our sticks and we got to let them, and feed a giraffe. There was that beautiful first time Andy saw dinosaurs, and his face was alight with dreams. There was the trip when we watched rays glide through the water like birds. There were happy lunches in Williamsburg, smiling faces on 15th century boats, and happy watching of orangutans and playing on giant pizzas. They may not have all been rousing successes, but at least we learned to try. Now, I think hard before I even take them to the park. Joey wanders about with a shovel or spoon, writing in the air and occasionally shouting things at random, or roaring like Bowser until the other kids steer clear of him. Taking him to a different park can be overwhelming, as he displayed all too clearly just yesterday. Is it worth all the anxiety and stress? There was a time when I answered yes. That was before anxiety meant Joey might run into the street. Still, I so wanted to go to the zoo today.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/04/adventures-and-realities.html", "title": "\nAdventures and Realities\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, May 12, 2012", "body": "\nI am totally sorry about not blogging. I have a ton of stuff to splash across the blogosphere, and a ton more stuff that I can't, but is really super important. I have to take care the stuff I can't put out to the public first right now, but I'm getting there. So I'll put out some stuff that is perfectly public-worthy. \n \nFirst, the bad news. We had another major personnel shift at school- very suddenly, with no warning. We knew right away at home. Hence, roller-coaster city. Joey's anxiety has skyrocketed, and so he is barely holding it together, all the time. The smallest of upsets can put him over the edge. \n \nWhen he came home from school yesterday, everything was in an uproar. Being early dismissal day, the schedule was, naturally, all screwed up. I had two edgy boys bouncing and screaming, so we gave up and went to the park to bounce and scream. It was working beautifully. The boys are especially fond of the section of the park with the new equipment. I will say up front this section of the park does have a sign stating that it is designed for the 5-and-under crowd. However, it is very typical to find kids of all ages on all the equipment, and my kids are very aware that they have to be extra gentle and extra careful in this section of the park when there are little kids about. Besides, they love to be in this section because the love to play with the little ones. The equipment is perfect for Joey's not-so-obvious mobility challenges, and the smaller kids are easier for him to play with. He also likes being the \"big kid\" to the little ones, and he likes how they are gentler (because they are younger). Andy also likes the little ones, and being the \"big kid\" leader in games. Both adore babies. They spend a good amount of time playing all over the park, including the \"preschool zone.\" Hey, my kids still love Shaun the Sheep. \n \nThere were lots of younger ones out and about yesterday, and my boys were loving life. I was watching Joey closely as he was helping swing a baby and talking to a mom, when suddenly Andy comes running past me, with his crying face on. His smaller friend came after him. It took a few minutes for Andy to recover enough to come back from behind a large tree and talk to me. \n \n\"What happened, baby?\" I asked, giving him a quick hug as he broke into tears again. \n\"That man said I can't play here!\" he wailed, pointing. Sure enough, there was a dad, with a small boy, and a person I later realized was his wife, with a little girl. I encouraged Andy to go play with his friend, and the pair assiduously avoided the usually-favorite area in favor of running among the trees. All seemed fine, just a misunderstanding, no big deal. After all, there were several other children on the equipment in the 6-8 range, and nobody was being rough or unruly. \n \nBut as I watched, Joey finished his conversation and headed for the equipment. Sure enough, the man stopped him and started speaking with him, and Joey bounced on his heels a little, a sign he was unhappy. I got up and headed for intervention. As I closed in, I heard the man say, \"This area if for the babies! You're too big to be here! Go on!\" Joey repeated back, \"It's for babies!\" in a tone I knew was bad news. \n \n\"Go on and play, Joey,\" I addressed Joey firmly as he turned to me, and emphasized my words with sign,  Play . \n\"The babies don't like me,\" Joey frowned at me. \n\"It's OK, go play,\" I repeated, and repeated my sign. \n\"This area is for the under-fives! He can't play here!\" the man shouted at me. \n\"Excuse me, sir,\" I replied firmly, \"but this is a public park, and my children need this kind of equipment. Joey,\" I repeated my sign to Joey, \"go ahead, sweetheart.\" Joey climbed up on the equipment, and the man threw his hands up, clear exasperated. \n\"What, is he retarded or something?\" \n \nNo, I didn't deck him. Sorry. \n \n\"Sir, this is a public park, and using that word is very offensive.\" He huffed off instead of answering me, saying something to his wife that made her frown and pick up the little girl. I did not pursue the point. In this state, he could easily have a concealed weapon, and I had made my point clear. I watched from my usual seat as he gestured and I could hear he was still saying things. Whatever they were, the other families were now all glaring at him. Joey called something to him, trying to include the man in his game- something Joey often does when adults are about. The man ignored him. At some point in the proceedings, another father turned to the man and something. From the sudden desist of ranting, I assume it was something to the effect of \"shut up.\" \n \nI should note here that neither Joey nor Andy did anything to hurt their children, block the slides, push them, or anything else that might have been dangerous, intentional or otherwise. When the little ones wanted to get down the slide, Joey moved aside and let them go, cheering when they made it to the bottom, offering encouragement when they were at the top. Joey waved at the man's little boy, that's the only contact even attempted with these particular children. \n \nThe couple finally decided to scoop up their kids and go away. Neither glanced in my direction as they went out, which was just as well. \n \nThat is when the families started coming over to me. \n\"What jerk.\" \"Are you OK?\" \"We sure love your boy, he's so sweet.\" \"Is your other little guy OK? He looked upset.\" \"What was that guy's  problem ?\" Several were upset that he had referred to Joey as \"retarded\" in his stream of criticism of my parenting choices. \n \nSometimes when we run into people like that, I sometimes wonder if it's me. I won't say he didn't have a point. I will say there were more constructive ways of communicating it. \n \nSo we need a good Ryan break. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HSw1VvHoHOg/T68W9yjPo5I/AAAAAAAAEeo/AQ9IavFtcw8/s1600/ryan14_2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-swkYpCMBhz0/T68W6dRp7oI/AAAAAAAAEeg/OvXwySbLeU4/s1600/ryan14_1.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/05/riding-roller-coaster-and-ryan-break.html", "title": "\nRiding the Roller Coaster (and Ryan Break)\n"},

That's part of the \"fun\" of being special needs moms.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nThank you for being awesome, Aunt Nancy! \n \n \n \nA big hug and plenty of sugar for my Aunt Nancy.

Don't you think of  Maddy  as a goldfish, too?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI can never think of awesome moms without mcewen coming to mind.

And lending me some of it when I needed it most.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHugs to  Mommy Dearest ! \n \n \n \nSeriously, this woman is raising a kid with autism to play the baritone/euphonium. Just like me. How awesome is  that ? And her little goth girl icon makes me giggle every time I see it. Giggles are important in life. Lots of hugs.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat? You can't see the resemblance?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOne of my other beautiful sisters; thank you to Sue, who stands by me through thick and thin and everything all around and in between. I know I don't call you enough. But I think of you every day, and send love and hugs and wishes that Texas wasn't so far away. Sue is my go-to when I need a problem solved, or a kick in the patookas to get it solved. Thank you for not letting me be a total slacker. And putting up with living with me in college. That was huge.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFew moms totally rock like  Sunday .\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen the going gets tough, the tough get Ryan Gosling to take care of business and cheer us all up.

(And yeah, this is how I think of you).\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt wasn't too long ago that I made the attempt to at least try to be a part of the old high school crowd. It was a bit of a bust, but I got to find out who was still a real friend after years of being out of sight, out of mind. I mean, more than i was when I was actually  in  high school. Thinking of you, Kim, and someone who knows how to offer help in the middle of a meltdown.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo mom is as awesome, and fabulous, and magical as my mom.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nEver need that extra sparkle to make something extra-special? Or a helping hand to keep things even-keel? That one great idea to take a good thing and make it great? That's what my mom does every day. I hope to be as good a mom and as good a grandmom as she is. Whenever things get tough, I can always do the best I can by asking, \"what would Mom do?\" Thank you, Mom.

Adding the \"again\"? Holy frijoles. \n \nJoey has been having a resurgence of fight-flight behavior. In other words, he's been doing a runner. His favorite moment is PE. After all, movement takes extra energy, especially when you have vestibular issues, propioceptive issues, and problems with bilateral coordination and crossing midline. \n \nPart of the problem is, of course, that most folks don't recognize that he has this issues. He just looks like a clumsy, chubby little guy who isn't very good at games. Consequently, they don't expect him to move very fast. They also just let him flounder in a game. \n \nPart of the problem is Joey wants to do well at everything he does. Since his disability is being dismissed, he isn't getting appropriate support to be successful in PE. This becomes a horrifying spiral. Note the \"chubby.\" \n \nPart of the problem is the games they are choosing to play. I never liked dodgeball. Can you imagine Joey being smacked in the head or back by a ball? How is he going to react? How is he going to feel? Not to mention the swirl of children such a game involves, so that Joey i already overwhelmed with crowd, noise, motion all around him. \n \nNaturally, he gets frustrated, upset, confused, and... runs for it. \n \nBy now, I would think everyone was aware that PE is a Danger Zone. We have had an aide hired to help with such moments, and this is the prime moment when Joey may need support. \n \nUnfortunately, our aide is having some difficulties grasping how to speak Joey, how to read his cues and signs and understand how he communicates. Consequently, he escapes. \n \nThen, remember that \"they don't expect him to move very fast\"? That may be true if he's trying to play a game. When bolting? He's like lightning- unpredictable and gone in a flash. \n \nThis time, he got halfway across the parking lot. That means halfway to a major state road. He didn't get farther because of quick thinking by two of his teachers, who were more accustomed to him. Both are now pretty rattled by the experience, but they did what they needed to do to calm him enough to stop him from getting to the road. \n \nNow, note the \"again.\" \n \nJoey has resumed bolting at school in the last few weeks, corresponding to the arrival of the new aide.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 12, 2012", "body": "\nI have gotten a variety of responses to my decision to pull Joey from the awards ceremony, instead of having him attend without getting an award. I wish more people would just comment here, but I'll just give folks a rundown of the email, comments, and other snippets from the various sources where I have mentioned, spoken of, posted about, or otherwise brought attention to the fact that Joey, despite being able to run rings around any student in his school and most of the adults when it comes to math, is not getting an award, and I am not sending him to the ceremony: \n \nThe vast majority of the comments have been more or less supportive of the decision. \n \nA small, stinging minority have been negative, questioning my reasons for not sending him, and many of these also seem to think Joey should go to \"learn to take disappointment.\" Why this stings is because, having seen how the world at large thinks about such things, these people are actually in the majority of opinion among the general population, though thankfully, not my own circle. I still find it deeply disturbing that people would feel this would be appropriate for Joey, especially in his current state of anxiety and depression. \n \nI have a wide variety of reasons for not wanting Joey to be at that ceremony. Some are good reasons. Some you may not think so good. Just because I have one reason you may disagree with, doesn't and shouldn't discount all the other very excellent reasons for not sending him. \n \n1. Safety. This is really the #1 A big reason I am taking him home. With Joey's current patterns, it is dangerous to send him into that ceremony. The school has amply proven they cannot keep him safe under these conditions- a large crowd, a huge and very frustrating disappointment, overwhelming emotions, embarrassment, and noise... he's going to bolt for that door. And they have proven they will not stop him. In the end, this trumps all other considerations, as far as I am concerned. \n \n2. Depression. I want awards and award ceremonies to be positive, motivating events for Joey. When you are child who knows you can run rings around everyone you know in math, you likely expect to receive a math award and be recognized for such a talent. When you see other people, who you know you can run rings around, getting awards (which I believe firmly they have earned and should definitely get), and you don't, that is devastating and embarrassing. Just what we need is for Joey to think his talent is worthless, or that he's \"the worst at math! he'll never get a math award!\" Great idea. Not. \n \n3. Pain. I find it not only painful for Joey, but painful for me. I know what it is like to have your hard work not only go unrecognized, but basically get punished for doing the extra work or taking on the challenge of higher levels. Selfish? As you like. It wouldn't be a big deal if I thought it was all projection; but when I see the anger, frustration, depression, and disappointment explode from my child, what I see and feel is the pain. I'm still bitter, and I would rather keep Joey from as much of the gall as possible. \n \n4. Coping Skills. Joey is still learning these skills. When he was still learning those skills and he was 6, it wasn't as big a deal if he made a mistake and melted down, he wasn't alone. People are less understanding of a very large 10-year-old who melts down when his name isn't called, and he has no way of containing the overwhelming emotion and depression. \n \n5. Judgement. I will never forget sitting in that spelling bee, listening to parents laugh at my child... only to see their faces an hour later when he almost won. It is good for people to understand that kids with disabilities are also intelligent. It is very important for some families whose kids are in Joey's classes to realize he is an asset to that room, and academically capable. By ignoring his strength in this way, they also ignore his value, and leads to people dismissing him and even complaining about why one of \"those kids\" is in the classroom \"distracting\" their kid. There are many, many people in this world who think Joey is stupid and a drain of resources, and should not be allowed in a mainstream classroom. He works hard to overcome his challenges in communication to express his talents- more than other kids do,  plus  being able to do the work. But now we find ourselves back at our last post, and whining about how awards are determined. \n \nIn other words, Joey's school awards appear to gauge how  well students make toast, when my kid is a hair dryer.  They ignore the fact that Joey dries hair better than everyone else, even in drying class, because he isn't drying toast. \n \nIn the end, the fact that Joey will not get an award is wrong in so many ways, it isn't a joke. Joey is not stupid, and knows he is the best math student in the school. He knows what awards are, and that they are badges of honor for being good at something. He's going to notice when his talent and hard work is overlooked. \n \nThe school is just way too close to the highway.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/03/on-being-hair-dryer-kid-in-toaster.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/06/reasons.html", "title": "\nReasons\n"},

Joey was often doing higher level assignments or extra work, often on the 5th grade level, for a greater part of the week of each lesson. \n \n2. There is a limited number of awards permitted per class. Hence, the reliance on #1. \n \nIn other words, by ensuring he was challenged in class, we put him at disadvantage to be recognized for those efforts. It is a common enough discrimination displayed towards students with gifts, and one that results in the spiral down to mediocrity and the lowest denominator. \n \nMy plan is to simply skip the ceremony and keep Joey with me, when we will be vociferously celebrating his accomplishments in math in a way that makes it clear how proud we are of his strengths and perseverance.

We simply cannot take the chance of having him realize that he is again to be ignored, and have him run out the door.

{"date": "Saturday, June 23, 2012", "body": "\nBeing ten, Joey has discovered the glory and power of language in a way that young boys often do. That's right! He's discovered the word f#@%. \n \nYay. \n \nWe've actually worked up to this gem, in a very usual way. \"What the...\" has been bouncing about for a while now, occasionally completed with the more tame \"hell\". \"Holy crap!\" has been ringing through our halls (in an excellent imitation of my own inflection). Kids at school thought it was funny to teach him \"bitch\" a couple of years ago, but it didn't really catch on, especially after he discovered it's a real word for a female breeding dog. But then came the power of f#@%. \n \nNot much turns heads in a room like a ten year old shouting it out to the world, I can tell you. \n \nWith Joey's communication issues, and the potential for bullying and whatnot, and hey, he's TEN, we made the executive decision to curb this behavior. I mean, who wants their ten-year-old swimming in the pool, yelling \"F#@%!\" at random? This isn't an autism issue. This is a being ten issue. \n \nIgnoring it didn't actually help. When you ignore Joey, and he says something that he wants attended to, he just says it again. And again. And again. And increases the volume. And then adds, \"Mommy, I said _____________!!!!\" That wasn't going to help. We were kinda silly thinking it might. \n \nAnother choice for changing behavior is to try to replace it with another, more appropriate behavior. This is something that can be very difficult, because replacement is not something that can be always controlled. For example, if we had Joey stop sucking his thumb, he would replace that comforting behavior with something else; and what would it be? We might try to train him to chew gum instead, but that doesn't mean he will do it. He might find it more satisfying to bang his head or spit. Now you've replaced the behavior, but not with a more appropriate behavior. Whoops. \n \nWe got lucky. Or maybe someone at school picked up on the problem and made a suggestion. Or maybe an angel whispered it into Joey's ear. Whatever happened, he came into my bedroom one morning, and instead of yelling \"What the  hell ?\" (yes, it became a common routine), he yelled out, \"What the  cow ?\" \n \nAnd I laughed. Joey loves the idea that he might be funny and make others laugh. He picked right up on the positive reaction. We had a winner! \n \nWe are totally replacing the bad words with \"cow.\" As in, \"What the cow!\" and \"I don't give a flying cow!\" and \"This job is completely cowy.\" My apologies to offended bovines everywhere. \n \nNo, we haven't yet eliminated the foul language, but we have the first step- an alternative, which gets him a more positive reaction, which is more pleasing than a negative reaction. Our job is to reinforce the behavior we want, not the behavior we don't. Listening for words and signals is a constant thing here, teasing out what we need to know from the stream of babble. And we like this approach, because it doesn't negate Joey's need for exclamation and communication of extreme feeling. \n \nAfter all, sometimes you just gotta let out a big ol' \" COW !\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/06/having-small-bovine.html", "title": "\nHaving a small bovine\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2012", "body": "\n\"Joey, honey, your twenty minutes is up,\" I announce apologetically, the last of a string of transitioning prompts to get him off his Mario games and onto...  anything  else. He was doing OK with it, but when he got the five-minute warning, he switched to the level that usually sets him screaming; I think it might be level 8-4. I flinched, knowing how this has been ending lately. My shoulder throbbed at the very thought. \n \n\"I  can't  beat this level!\" he shrieks- not at me, but at the computer screen. He bursts into tears, his already-pink face going beet red all over, a sure danger sign. He screams at the game, heartbroken. \"First rule, Joey cannot beat all the levels! Why did the designers put a hammer bro  there ? I can't beat this level!\" \n \n\"One more try, darling,\" I assure him as the all-too-familiar death music rings out. \"Then it is time to put Mario away for today.\" I pat his shoulder to remind him I am there. To my surprise, he shuts the computer off instead. I brace for impact as he empties his lungs. \n \n\"I'm  ANGRY ! I'll  never  defeat Bowser!\" The house might not shake with it, but my own heart is wrung to its core. I step away, for a tautness in his shoulder tells me the chair is about to be flung back in my direction. He pushes back hard as I expected... then begins to stomp through the house. \n \nI wait for the ugly words to come, the colorful metaphors, usually directed at me, being a safe target. Instead, he rolls on with his game talk. \n \n\"Stupid Bowser! I  hate  Bowser! I'll  never  save the Princess!\" he yells, at the top of his lungs, as he stomps up the stairs. I hear him reach his room, and scream that blood-curdling soul-wrenching scream that often sends people at school scurrying to his aid. The one he uses for pain. \n \nI reach the top of the stair, the door of his room; I must have flown there, I don't remember my feet on the stairs at all. I expect to see a child with a shattered arm or at least a paper cut or a stubbed toe. He is in his favorite chair, wailing about the game. The hurt isn't physical. \n \nAnd I stand there and ponder as he screams out the hurt, gives it words, and slowly, painfully, loudly, subsides. I stand there, amazed, almost in shock. \n \nHe knew he was done, stopped the game himself, went to his favorite chair in his room, and was working on regulating himself. All without lashing out at anyone, other than the noise. The worst word that emerged from his mouth was \"stupid.\" Holy cow. \n \nHe comes to the door, wanting a hug. I give him one, I whisper that I love him. He goes on about Bowser. He goes back to his chair. We repeat this a few times until the sobs stop, and he sits in his chair, drawing and air-writing, his fish light on. \n \nAnd I realize,  he did it . He finally did it, after months and months of  not  doing it. He managed to calm himself out of a meltdown, himself, without lashing out to hurt anyone else. He did it. He made it up the stairs to his space, and calmed down. \n \n He did it.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/07/frustration-regulation.html", "title": "\nFrustration Regulation\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, June 21, 2012", "body": "\nSo I went up to clean the boys' bathroom. It is not a job I relish, that is for sure. They need a fan in there, and I screwed up painting their washcabinet. The walls are textured, because the idiots who lived in the house before us thought that was stylish. \n \nI am about to take a sander to them. Not because I'm ready to, but because I have to. You can't clean texture. Especially texture that has been smeared on. \n \nI know I haven't been in there for two weeks, which is bad of me. I rely over-much on bleach tankcakes, lysol spray, and the fact that the floor is mopped daily after baths by necessity. So I am partly to blame for the disaster. But seriously? I thought we had left smearing in the dusts of fears. \n \nWhat it tells me is that Joey is having trouble getting clean properly. Downstairs, I have trouble with each of them using a whole roll of paper every time they use the toilet. With the sink so close at hand upstairs, I was assuming they had the sense to wash their hands instead of wiping them on the wall. I was so, so wrong. \n \nThe question now becomes, why is he having this problem? And what can we do to fix it, and fast? For one, how uncomfy to not get the job done, then have to go out in summer heat. Poor buddy. For two, what has happened to decrease his abilities? How can that be addressed? And third, the social stigma would be incredible if we can't move fast. \n \nMy current thoughts are to return to wipes- you can get kid wipes that are even flushable, and may help get him cleaner than paper in the first place. Second, you can wipe the wall clean with them fast. And its one of those things that, if he spends the rest of his life using wipes- well, so what?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/06/uh-oh.html", "title": "\nUh oh.\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 06, 2012", "body": "\nWhen Joey was smaller, I made videos of him, trying to fight against an idea about autism that was driving us crazy. It was remarkably common for people to ask us if we were sure Joey is autistic, since he doesn't \"look\" autistic. The whole spectrum idea was difficult for people to grasp. That Joey needed support, even though he was \"high functioning\", was an idea even people in school system were having trouble grasping. This was coupled with the idea that having a child with autism, that being a person with autism, was somehow a tragic disaster, period. Joey is not a tragic disaster. He is a beautiful, wonderful, remarkable person. Autism and all. \n \nYou can view some of those videos at the bottom of this blog page. \n \nIt is becoming increasingly difficult to get a solid portrait of Joey into a 5-minute video, to capture even a glimpse of him with a single theme. As he grows and his world and personality become, like a growing snowflake, more beautiful and more complex, it becomes more difficult to really give a good idea of who he is. The true talent of a real portraitist is capturing that little glimpse in a single piece. \n \nIt is almost more difficult because I increasingly understand that the roller-coaster of his mood and expression is so much part of who he is. This is a difficult thing to understand and to communicate without it sounding or looking like something completely different, and something people judge harshly in our society. To capture the anxiety, and communicate how that molds who he is, who we are, and yet make it clear that we are not going to let him drown in it, that's hard. It's trying to explain to someone you can accept your child as autistic and still get him speech therapy and OT, when they see acceptance and intervention as diametrically opposed; its something that some people just don't get. I don't want to expose Joey to that kind of hard judgement any more than needful. Yet to leave this part of him out seems to make things far more Pollyanna-ish and rose-colored, and leads to other misunderstanding. \n \nI wanted people to understand how unique everyone is, including my Joey. I wanted people to understand that he is who he is. And he is autistic, And he is unique. I wanted to get the message out there somewhere, that Joey is wonderful and joyful and fabulous and unique and... autistic. That what autistic is for us. This is, for us, what autism looks like. \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is definitely  not  an insult.  50Cent can kiss my cow .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2NQ2_TeSPjM/T_ZmL21pEwI/AAAAAAAAEo4/BhGfztuHYYM/s1600/joey_legos.jpg", "http://www.hollyrod.org/huddle/dear-50-cent-3/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/07/what-autism-looks-like.html", "title": "\nWhat Autism Looks Like\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2012", "body": "\nI have no clue how people do it. \n \nI poke around and see what people are doing all the time. Its is easier now that we have Twitter, Facebook, Google, blogs, more blogs, etc. etc. etc. I see what other people are managing to get done. They have kids, special needs kids, families, jobs- they write, not just for their own blogs or magazines or whatever, but several of these. They lecture and publish and still cook dinner. They have hobbies- knitting, baking, gardening, reading. They have fresh news stories to post, which I assume they have read, as they have comments to offer on them. Life goes on, and things get done. \n \nAnd it is all I can do to say my kids get to bed still alive and fed at night. \n \nI got up this morning. Having been kicked out of bed by sprawling boys, I had spent most of the night in the big recliner. There was a boy in the bed, so I snuggled and smooched on him until we absolutely had to get up if he was going to eat before leaving for school. \n \nI don't drink coffee. I didn't get a shower. I was lucky to get my clothes on before going out to the start of my day. I forgot to brush my hair, but did manage to take my meds and put on deoderant before putting the clothes on. I thought I might try to write a letter to a friend later today, they aren't online anymore because they live on a farm and various other reasons. I have the thought every morning. \n \nIt was a lazier morning than usual, because Andy didn't have vision therapy this morning, so I just had Joey to get together. I made him some breakfast- which consisted of putting two danishes on a plate and pouring him a glass of milk, because we snuggled so long- and made sure he got his medicine down. I fed the cats. I packed Joey's snack. I looked outside to check for the bus, and noticed the fledgling on the porch. I quickly flipped open my laptop to make sure I didn't need to try to get him back in the nest, but everything I found said he was OK as long as he wasn't hurt, which he wasn't. I tried to get Joey to look at the bird, but he was already on a Mario spiral. The bus came. I got Joey out the door as calmly as possible, so we didn't frighten our fledgling. I noticed the sunflowers still need to be staked (they are all crooked form the derecho that came through) as I waved my \"I love you\", and the bus pulled away with a little bit of my heart on it. \n \nAndy had awakened and was coming down the stairs, so no snuggle time for me. More breakfast, then I popped on Twitter and Facebook and the news to make sure the world wasn't falling apart. My friend sent me a message about services for Joey she had discovered, awesome. I told Andy about the fledgling, and we watched him for a minute before heading out to his OT group. We saw the mama bird come land on the porch with a bug in her beak. \n \nAs we drove, Andy chatted about his nerf gun needing new darts and missing his vision therapist, and we thought we might get to the Bug Box this morning after we stopped by mom's office. I got Andy to OT, and got the session paid for, then hopped over to the CVS to see if they had nerf darts. They don't. I got a beach chair on sale, because we would be at the McDonald's later, and this McDonald's doesn't have the nice tables with the separate chairs, and the attached benches are the perfect size for skinny preteens, but not for a fat middle-aged mom. I got back to chat with one of the moms from the group, she's having some issues we've seen before. Swapped some info, gave her some names of folks to call, all good. The other mom homeschools. I think she thinks we're nuts to have our kids in public school. As the kids came out, she asked about when the fall session would be. It was thought it would be Tuesday or Thursday, about 4. I noted Andy's bus often arrives at 4, another mom had a similar issue. The homeschool mom proudly noted she didn't care, since she homeschooled. Consensus voted for 4:15, and I noted I could sign Andy up for soccer now I knew when therapy would likely be. Well, his, anyway. His 1:1 therapist is going on maternity leave, so we didn't know when 1:1 would start back up, or what slot we would get. We were supposed to practice \"whole body listening\" by asking the Andy about cues he could get from body language, what he thought people were thinking based on how they were holding themselves or gesturing for emphasis, and we were supposed to talk about how to learn the \"secret language\" of social interaction. I pondered how I would also help Andy understand that Joey doesn't \"speak\" that \"secret language\" very well, and see if he could figure out Joey's \"secret language.\" I think he can actually \"read\" Joey better than I can. \n \nWe got in the car, and went over the plan for the rest of the morning. We needed to pick up mom's medicine, then go to the office, then perhaps the Bug Box? But Andy didn't want to go to the Bug box anymore. He wanted to go \"somewhere fun\", then decided he wanted to go home because it was hot. And mom didn't get nerf darts, so he was extra grumpy. \n \nWe got mom's meds, and headed to the office to see if the phones got fixed and catch mom up on work stuff. Andy got a soda and a snack, the phones were only sort of fixed- we need to replace the phonesets, and business phones are expensive. Mom's computer monitor was also toast from the storms. \u00a0I got mom up to date on stuff and showed her the stuff I had photographed to put up in the Etsy shop. I lost track of time, getting things settled. I got a text from Joey's teacher, he was OK until a game started going wrong for him, then he had pulled out his verbal arsenal and let it fly. Andy played quietly, pretending he had a bookstore. Suddenly, we had to race home, and we got there just in time to get Joey off the bus. The fledgling was chirping in his nest. \n \nWe had a quiet lunch, sandwiches, grapes, chips, sodas. Joey had me watch him play one the Mario levels he had designed. Andy was being grumpy because he was still out of darts. I forgot to make myself a sandwich, I got distracted by the begging for me to watch a level. Andy wanted to watch a Shaun the Sheep episode, so I got it on. I checked my email, but there was nothing interesting. I posted something about the nice check I got yesterday from my Cafepress shop. I glanced over Facebook to make sure everybody was OK. Someone had published an academic article. Someone got a new job in a museum. Someone was in London, lecturing at a conference. I remembered I needed to start re-vamping my classes for Fall, we have a new texbook. I checked my email and classes to make sure the students were all good. I answered a couple of questions. I thought about the school supplies that were still in the van, and they needed to come in and be sorted. I talked to my mom, who had a brilliant idea about getting Joey some quiet space, since he's been a little anxiety- ridden lately. There were a couple articles posted in the newsfeed I wanted to read, but they would have to wait. It was time for Joey's vestibular and core group. \n \nJoey chatted about Bowser and Mario and Luigi and then the boys bickered as we drove. They bickered in the waiting room. Andy brought in his gun and a stuffed doll, and pretended to shoot zombies. Two of the kids in Joey's group played along. Joey ran and got an exercise ball out of a therapy room, and I reminded hi, that he needed to ask to use equipment. He ran off with the ball, but apparently the answer was \"no' when he asked, because I jumped up to sounds of a scuffle and \"Joey, put the ball DOWN.\" A therapist was wrestling the ball from him, then he shot past me and raced down the hall, \u00a0kicking off his shoes as he bolted. The therapy office is set up in a big circle, but there is a back door; fortunately, he decided to do the circuit rather than the door. I think the therapist said something as he went past and I ran past her, hot on his heels lest he now go out the  front  door. The words were not helpful, something like, 'Joey, go wait in the waiting room\" or something like that. The hall was narrow enough she could have put out an arm and caught him, but she didn't. IT was Andy's voice that drew Joey past the front door instead of him bolting through it. The waiting room was a dead-end for him, I got him to sit and have a hug. Another of the group kids came in, and I tried to talk to him, but got rebuffed- he was too anxious about group already. I didn't push it. Group started, and away Joey went. \n \nAndy and I headed to Target to get darts. The end of July is clearance season; the summer toys are cleared out to make way for Christmas merchandising. They had a huge nerf gun on sale for $7. It got purchased, making for a very, very happy boy, who chattered about all the cool things it did all the way to the car.\u00a0We also got a present for Andy's therapist while we were in the Target. We got back to the OT office, with an agreement that he needed some targets to shoot at in the yard. \n \nAndy shot at his zombie, a parent from Joey's group chatted about a listening program she was trying, and how it was going to cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars to get the equipment in her house, plus the cost of the sessions. The program we did consisted of the cost of a set of really really good headphones, a good CD player, and at most it would have been the cost of the CDs, so about $250 all together- only we rented the CDs from the office, so for us it was only about $150 plus the therapy sessions themselves. I wondered what the program was like that required hundreds and hundreds of dollars just in equipment. I hope it works well for them. \n \nThe therapists tried to tell us something about the session, but these folks aren't as good at controlling hub-bub of released kids as Ms. Lisa, the main therapist in the office, is; so we didn't learn much. Apparently, there had been a lot of spinning, and Joey was unused to it, so there was some advice about counter-acting possible side-effects. I caught \"suck through a straw,\" but the rest was lost in the general din and the clacking of the nerf gun. \n \nI got the boys gathered and over to the playplace at McDonalds, as we had 45 minutes to kill between sessions. I sipped a coke in my new chair and listened to some Sherlock Holmes while the boys played- well, what I could hear over the squeals and yells. Some other kids arrived, and there was a rollicking game of hide and seek. \n \nThen it was time. Back to OT we went. Joey saw the temperature according to the car was 101, and started to freak out: \"too hot! It is too hot to swim! I'm going to burn! There's hot lava everywhere!\" \n \nJoey got happy when Ms. Lisa appeared. Off he bounced. Andy and I hopped back in the car, and headed to a small hardware store. We picked up some reflectors and things to use as targets, and some stakes for the sunflowers. Andy chattered about the targets he was going to make, and how different colors were good or bad, about whether Lego or Nerf would win the Epic Battle, and a smattering of chatter about Smash Brothers. We headed back to the office, where he could shoot at his zombie doll (which is actually a Genie from Aladdin doll). \n \nOne of the \"targets\" is a large screw eye, which I took in and proceeded to screw into a thick dowel for him, and he then merrily used as a target (go figure). I chatted with one of the other moms in the group about some of the trouble she's had with the schools, and she talked about going back to work. Her husband is the one that usually is home, though he also has a job and is a big-time advocate-activist out in the county. We talked about how we are both locals- I grew up in the county, she in the next county over. Her husband is local, too. She chided me for not having  a gps anklet  for Joey yet. Her son has one, and I know its been invaluable to them. We mention something about how different life was going to be. THe boys are now 10 and 8; we're supposed to be trekking all over India now. She also says something about travel, but having to work for the health insurance. \n \nMs. Lisa came out, and explained what the kids had been doing this session, learning about social cues and that other people think about them, and cues for determining what people are thinking about. We are supposed to practice at home, asking Joey what he thinks we are thinking about while looking at objects around the room, to see if he can follow another person's gaze or line-of-sight (joint attention skills). \n \nThe kids then appeared. Joey looked tired, and practically crawled into my lap. We got him into the car, and decided we should go home and have spaghetti and meatballs for dinner. The boys then commenced bickering. They bickered all the way home, all the way into the door, all the way through the living room. Andy started to watch a video of a Smash Brothers game, but one of the teens in it started using foul language, so he had to turn it off. He got grumpy and stomped into the livingroom, and started shooting Joey with his nerf guns. Joey started screaming about being shot. Ten minutes later, we were back to playing games on the computer and shooting zombies, so I started the meatballs. \n \nThe bickering continued, so I screwed up the meatballs, since I was only half- attending to how many crumbs I was adding. Joey gets so upset over his game he sobs uncontrollably; I try to hug him, but everything I say or do seems to just make it worse. My shoulder takes a good knock, but I've had worse. \u00a0The noodles goet cooked, the meatballs get cooked, and after another screaming fit over a game and resistance in going to his room to calm down, both noodles and meatballs are consumed. \n \nI started checking my computer. A couple of students had questions. I clean up the photos of the stuff for the shop. I check my social media. A friend was posting about a fabulous article they had written. Three had new blog posts. I noticed my brother had some kind of mention in the Huffington post as a lawyer who also gave lectures and wrote books. I have one of his books in my case for special books, but I haven't gotten to read it. Someone else commented on reading a new book. Another friend had gone for a 12-mile bike ride after work. Another friend was apparently made a member of the Order of the British Empire for their work on Autism. Another friend just finished the quilt she's been working on this month. It's beautiful. Another published article, a published book, a lecturer noting their tidy little honorarium. Another friend has put up a dozen articles- I want to read them all, but when? I think about a video on crocheting I want to watch to try to learn how to do it. My Uncle Lou crochets beautifully. I think about the friend who just came and I got to see her, I wonder how her kids are today, I should call her more. I should call everybody more. I start getting some of the new stuff up online. It's after 7. \n \nJoeyAndyDad arrives home shortly thereafter, and reminds me that I need to get some things from the office. I run out, I try to get something at a store, but I get the wrong thing. Thinking it is possibly the right thing, I happily go to the office and get what I need- a book I need to get in the mail, a monitor. Some yarn that was given to me is still in the floor there. I toss it in a box to send to my friend on the farm, who was teaching herself to knit when I saw her last. I'm not likely to learn to crochet with it, so I should send it up to her and let it be put to good use. I load everything into the car, and I am off. I stop at the grocery on the way home, picking up something I forgot. I head home. \n \nI finish getting the stuff into the shop, but I still have school supplies to sort. Its getting late. I decide it can wait, even though the stuff is all over the livingroom and front hall, along with bins of other stuff I pulled form the car a few days ago. It all needs to be sorted. I have no room to just stick it in the basement anymore. I go upstairs anyway. \n \nThe boys want hugs. I get undressed, and a boy comes in for hugs. I try to read some of the articles I wanted to read, but another boy wants attention. I start writing, when I normally would be trying to catch up on blogs I read, grade some papers, maybe get in a few articles. Boys come in wanting attention at intervals. I realize it's almost midnight, as a boy plops between me and JoeyAndyDad. We were supposed to talk about something when we came upstair, I forget what it was. I wonder if we remembered to talk about it. We send the boy back to his room, and I am finishing up this post. \n \nIt is now 12:21am. \n \nI have worked on no articles to publish, done no research, not even read the articles about autism other have posted today. I didn't read any blogs. I gave no lectures, nor even started writing one. I didn't even write a letter to my friend... again. \n \nI have no idea how people do it. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.projectlifesaver.org/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/07/thoughts-from-morass.html", "title": "\nThoughts from the Morass\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 03, 2012", "body": "\nYeah, I know, I suck at blogging these days. See, its summer, and well, there's this thing called life happening, and you know, I'm really really tired. And you know I'm serious when I'm so tired I am not whining online. \n \nJust to give you a sample... \n \n \n \n \n \nThere was this storm that came through our neck of the woods, very suddenly. They were calling for scattered thunderstorms... no, wait, it was \"isolated thunderstorms\"... on Friday. The boys had been visiting Grandma after Joey's  show  and going to lunch. The  cat  got out, and we spent a long time trying to find him. In the search, and various other activities of trying to get the boys inside so they wouldn't scare the cat, the TV remote got misplaced. With no success finding either item, we scampered off shame-facedly and headed for the pool. A couple of kid swims later, we were trying to get food into tummies. The cat had returned, but the remote had not. A decision was made that it would not do for my mom to be stuck without her remote, so I returned to the scene of the crime to help find it. This time, I successfully located it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThen we took a peek out the window. And it looked... weird. I decided to go home.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI had never seen a  derecho  before. I can tell you it was one of the strangest, scariest, most beautiful things I have ever seen. There was lightning in the sky, all different colors- but no sound. The flashes backlit the rolling clouds of the front of the storm, giving the sky a magnificent, rolling quality. Then the wind came. I was about halfway home, wishing my camera was good enough to record the splendor of it, when I had to take action to keep my van from blowing off the road. The wind moved straight across the road, making a sort of smoky haze from picking up dust and dirt from the parking lots of the stores at  Four Mile Fork . Between the odd lighting and the sudden, odd wind, I knew something was seriously wrong. I briefly considered turning back to my mom's, but realized I was closer to home, so I pressed on. I picked the route more likely to be sheltered from that wind, because fighting the van was not what I wanted for another ten minutes.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nBy the time I got home, it was fully dark- because the power was gone. Everywhere, everything was dark... except for my block. We still had power, and it seemed like the whole rest of the city did not. It was payback time. We were one of three houses in my entire neighborhood without power after Isabel for nine days. Now, it appeared we were the only ones  with  power.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt is a good thing we have power. My mom doesn't. It looks like it will at  least  Sunday before they even  start  to work on her lines. See, years ago, when my very smart parents built our house, they paid a lot of money and had the lines buried. They did this because we were the last house on the line, and so if our transformer ever went out, we'd likely be the last priority of the power company. Add to that, we lived in the woods. The best way to take out a transformer is to have a tree take out your lines. Hence, bury them and avoid the whole tree thing. Yes, we had more power outages than most people, but they usually weren't very long. I don't remember ever having it out for days at a time. Then, along came some folks who wanted to build some homes, and the power company decided it was cheaper to run their lines from our house than to run it down the driveways of those folks. And none of those folks paid to have those lines buried, and so the company went on the cheap and strung them on poles. This, of course, completely eliminated the entire purpose of our burying lines, because now there were strung lines through the woods to these other houses. And whenever we have a mild zephyr, a tree falls on those lines, and takes out the transformer. And because there are only five houses effected, we are the last to get service and get our power fixed. And no, the electric company did not give my folks their money back for having the lines buried, thank you very much. Idiots. What many people have to say about PEPCO in Maryland, I could say about Dominion Power in Virginia. And it isn't pretty.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo we rescued my mom from the heat and have brought her to sleep on the couch at my house for the duration. Good news: Grandma is here, safe, and available for boy squishing. Bad news: I don't think my couch is all that comfortable for long stays.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThen came days like, say, today. Andy had vision therapy and OT appointments, so we ran to those. We had to stop by work to get caught up on payments and paperwork and stuff. That filled the hour between appointments. Then, my cat has been waxing all over the house, so she had an appointment today. The vet office doesn't have power yet, so they called and asked if I could come in earlier since they had to cancel a bunch of appointments because apparently those cats needed power, and my cat didn't. Now I needed to find my cat four hours sooner than I had been planning. So I drove home from OT with Andy chiming, \"follow the barf, and find the cat!\" (which I energetically quelled before we got home to the echolalic one). I found her under the kitchen table (thank you,  Uncle Evan !) and managed to get her to her appointment. I was worried that her diabetes was revving up, but she had better blood glucose than me. Well, that's not saying much, but you get the point. We now think it might be a thyroid problem. We sent off the blood work and gave her a shot for nausea. So $267 later, I can say that it is probable that I will not awaken tomorrow to cat barf all over the kitchen, bathroom, or stairs. But I am not putting any more money in on that bet, thanks.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI got home to make lunch and referee the meltdown over  Mario Party 9 .\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe then proceeded on our day's adventure: the Search for Fireworks. Yep, we live in a place where we can set off our own. Our challenge to find some free of whistles, as the boys- and I- hate whistles. Too loud and screechy. We have learned we cannot block the sound even with  tomatoes in our ears . So we tumbled out of the car on a couple of unsuspecting fireworks stands with the question, \"which of the big ones don't whistle?\" I am pleased to report that TNT makes several fireworks without whistles, including Pink Diamonds and Hurricane, both of which I highly recommend. They also make a small one called Shark, which is very quiet.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe also recommend safe fireworks handling if you are settling off your own:\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 1. Have all fireworks ready to go before you start. Remove plastic or paper from fuses, have fuses upright and ready to light.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 2. Soak the lawn area with a hose before setting up. The area should be 20-30 feet from the audience area and any other hazard, such as trees, bushes, or buildings. \u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 3. Set up by creating a flat space on the lawn. A wide, flat board is good, and we prefer to place a couple of bricks on top of the board. Soak the board.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 4. Use a long lighter or punk for lighting, so you can stay as far back as possible. DO NOT EVER HOLD A FIREWORK IN YOUR HAND.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 5. Be sure to have a bucket of water at hand. Also, have a hose on and ready for use. Have a soaked board or long pole for knocking aside used fireworks and duds.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 6. Keep the unlit fireworks 20-30 feet away from the lighting area, in the direction OPPOSITE the audience.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 7. Light the fireworks one at a time. Remember that there can be a delay. After five minutes, if nothing has happened, you have a dud. Soak it with the hose immediately, and knock it aside with your pole. Soak it some more.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 8. Light the fireworks one at a time. After the work is finished, douse it with the hose, knock it aside, and douse it some more before setting up the next firework.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 9. Never let children touch or light fireworks. Ever.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 10. Fireworks and alcohol do not mix. Never light fireworks if you are impaired by substances- including cold meds.  You are literally playing with fire.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI have also seen suggestions to wear cotton clothing (it doesn't burn as quickly as synthetics). In our state, fireworks cannot leave the ground (no bottle rockets).\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAnyway, we picked out some big ones, which always makes the vendors happy. Our local  Knights of Columbus  are highly active in supporting the local disability community, so we always get some from them; and a few other stands here and there selling bigger fireworks.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThen we stopped at the grocery to be sure we had ice cream and whipped cream and cherries for the holiday, and ran home to jump into our bathing suits and get to the pool before the bickering got to my blood pressure. Then I dunked them in the pool, brought them home hungry and exhausted, fed them, and send the bicker brothers up to bed. Where they promptly stopped bickering, since Mommy was not in the room anymore.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOh, and I have classes going, and midterms to grade. Yay.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo, in begging forgiveness for the scant postings, I leave you with a picture of beautiful, wonderful, awesome boys, in a bicker-free moment.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNow... how to keep them engaged tomorrow?\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x-DYIp_4V6s/T_OuyamAdQI/AAAAAAAAEog/eQgnUSvGGHo/s1600/IMG_2223.JPG", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/derecho-behind-washington-dcs-destructive-thunderstorm-outbreak-june-29-2012/2012/06/30/gJQA22O7DW_blog.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Mile_Fork,_Virginia", "http://marioparty9.nintendo.com/", "http://www.kofc.org/en//index.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qqgXgOIBDiQ/T_Ou0vE3-II/AAAAAAAAEoo/b78RmYoOPyk/s1600/boys_redrobin.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/07/blogs-on-backburners.html", "title": "\nBlogs on backburners\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 29, 2012", "body": "\nI was upstairs for a few minutes; I had been playing with Andy, looking at \"silly kitties\" on the computer, part of a lazy Sunday. We don't have many of those, so it was just nice. Andy bounced downstairs, I checked into my online life and went into the bathroom to start dressing. \n \nAndy popped back up. \"Where's Joey?\" he asked. I don't know, did you check his room? Is he in the bathroom? I replied something to that affect. \n \n\"Joey!\" Andy called, as I finished up business. \"He's gone!\" \n \nStill unperturbed, I headed out to peek into his room myself. Andy had gone back downstairs, and started wailing, \"Joey's gone! Joey's gone!\" \n \nThe front door had the key in the lock, and was open. He hadn't slammed it behind him, we would have heard that. He was just gone, his game still playing its music. \n \nHe was just  gone . \n \nJoeyAndyDad lept into the Jeep and started tracing the path to the pool- the path of greatest danger, as it had water on the other end. Andy and I called for a moment outside. How long had he been gone? \n \n\"Andy, when did you see Joey last?\" \n\"Downstairs on his game.\" \n\"When, Andy?  When ?\" \n\"He was downstairs!\" Andy was getting scared. He knew this was not good. \n\"Was he there when you came upstairs to watch kitties?\" \n\"Yes.\" OK, so we were talking in the 5-10 minute range. It was still too long. We hopped into the van and made the block, the second favorite path of frustration. He was no where to be seen. \n\"Maybe he went to D's,\" Andy suggested, a great idea, only two blocks over. We drove over and knocked at the door, but no luck, he wasn't there. I called for reinforcements in the form of Mr. Wesley, \u00a0then the police. Time was of the essence. \n \nThere is something surreal in giving a description of your child to a police dispatcher. How tall is he? Weight? What is he wearing? Autistic- how will he react to police officers? Will he yell? Will he run? Is he violent when stressed? Does he have an item he would find comforting? \n \nI managed to get a bra on while I was talking, I have no clue how I managed it. I ran back down the stairs with instruction to call again if he was found. After giving Andy the job of searching the house again, more to give him something to do than with any hope, I stood outside on the sidewalk, caught because I had Andy and couldn't search, couldn't leave him. I called my mom, she could come watch Andy while we searched. The path to the park was being ridden now by JoeyAndyDad. Wesley was canvassing the downtown grid, as he could have gone anywhere at this point. Twenty minutes. He had been gone twenty minutes! \n \nAnd then, as I was telling my mother he was missing, the nightmare ended. I could see him, at the end of the street, he was walking towards me. Where had he appeared from? \n \n\"I see him! I see him!\" I told my mom, and ended the call, walking towards him; but Andy! A neighbor was outside. I asked him to make sure Andy didn't leave the house, I'm not even sure he understood me. I stopped; Joey had sat down. Was he hot? Did he see me coming and melt completely? Would approaching him make him run, or encourage him to come home? He started walking again, I met him, asked him where he had been. \n \n\"I got lost, so I came home,\" he explained as if nothing unusual had happened. He babbled about his game.  \n \n\"Good job,\" I said, emphasizing the positive, \"Good job coming home, buddy, that's what we need you to do if you get lost.\" \n \nThe police officer was waiting for us, and as I stopped to thank the neighbor and call JoeyAndyDad and Mr. Wesley, the officer chatted with Joey, praising him for coming straight home, too. He had JoeyAndyDad take Joey into the house.  He was safe. He was home.\u00a0 \n \nWe got the name for  Project Lifesaver in Fredericksburg . \"You may not remember me,\" I heard him say, \"but I was the officer who came a few years back, when Joey had to go to the hospital.\" When Joey turned blue. Yes, I remembered the face. He told me the department was aware of him- I had taken him over to the station and explained Joey a little to the officer who was there. He asked again about comfort objects, about the stick Joey was carrying. Now they knew he was a bolter, it was definitely time for a tracking anklet. \"We can find him in seconds,\" he explained, giving me the card. \"She comes on at nine. Just give her a ring.\" \n \nBecause now, we know what the trigger was, and he's still young. We know his paths. But here comes adolescence- and we may not know what is going on, and why he goes off. He may not know himself. We are going to work on setting some of his frustration paths a little more, but ultimately, he's going to go his own way. And while he remains vulnerable, we need to be able to find him- fast. Even when he doesn't yet know he is lost.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fredericksburgva.gov/Departments/police/index.aspx?id=318#Project_Lifesaver"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/07/then-day-comes-when.html", "title": "\nThen the Day Comes When...\n"},

The social skills groups my guys have been in for the last year are no longer considered \"occupational therapy\" by the insurance company- they have to go private pay only, because they are now considered \"educational.\" But trying to get the school to pay for this \"educational\" but vital program is going to be... impossible. According to them, Joey gets plenty of service already- and certainly \"appropriate.\" And we have learned how far \"appropriate\" and \"adequate\" are from what we consider the definition of either term. \n \nWe find ourselves in a war of semantics and a labyrinth of language. Part of the problem is how people view Joey and autism, and the goals different folks have for him. We always make sure to include our long-term goals for Joey in our IEP presentations: we want him to be happy, we would like him to independent, we want him to be able to live as an autistic person in what is a non-autistic world and be able to self-advocate. His therapists want him to be able to self-regulate, communicate, and move. His teachers want him to be able to read, to write, to be able to consider concepts and analyze information effectively. These may all seem like worthy goals- more or less- but they are all  our  goals for Joey. That is an important distinction. Keep that in mind for a moment. \n \nBecause Joey speaks and has made solid progress towards all of these goals, he has a number of labels added to him, in reference to autism. Mildly/Moderately autistic. High functioning. Low impact/mildly or moderately effected. With these labels come judgements, comments, ideas. And though some, such as \"he is doing well!\" seem benign, I sometimes wonder what kind of value judgement that entails. Does that mean a person who is \"severely effected\" or \"severely autistic\" is not \"doing well\"? And what is \"well\"? After all, we had an entire year of regression and missed goals, from which we have never recovered. When I see how children around Joey's age function, act, and respond, and see what Joey can and cannot do, how \"well\" is he really doing? Or am I drowning in another morass of labels, semantics, and language? \n \nAfter all, Joey is Joey. He develops at his own pace, in his own time, and I'm just here to help as he needs it. And like my buddy Snail, he does things in his own Joey way. He's been Joey a long time now, he's gotten pretty good at it; but its nice for him to get help when he needs it. \n \nSo how much does help does he need? And doesn't that depend not on my goals for Joey, but Joey's goals for Joey? At what point do we transition from raising a child and helping them form a plan, to the plan they form for themselves? I worry when I see other fifth graders who seem to be able to self-advocate and have goals for themselves, and I'm still trying to play the super-sleuth in figuring out what Joey thinks, feels, and understands. I worry about getting caught up in words and goals and losing sight of Joey being Joey. \n \nBecause Joey is not the words, or the goals, or the thoughts we have about him. He is himself. And that is a  very  important distinction.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/08/descriptors.html", "title": "\nDescriptors\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, September 06, 2012", "body": "\nMiddle school is coming. \n \nJoey started the fifth grade this year. He's ten years old. We have long been in the process of preparing him for the next step, the dreaded Middle School, where kids get nasty, life gets harder, and social circles dominate the school life. As such, my ears have been pricked up more than usual for stories and information about autistic and other disabled pre-teens and teenagers, especially how they are spoken of and perceived. Fortunately, I am not reliant on mass media, or I'd be running screaming into the night. \n \nUneven development is often mistaken for far greater disability than it actually is. When I see masses of comments about autistic people \"with the mind of a 5-year-old,\" I worry- there are far too many of those comments. Yes, intellectual disabilities do appear in autistic people, just as they appear in people generally. On the other hand, I still have a book I received from the doctor's office when Joey was diagnosed, saying that 75% of autistic kids are \"mentally retarded.\" I realize now that this is how we feel about people who communicate differently and develop differently- whether they have actual intellectual challenges or not. \n \nI got Joey's SOL* scores yesterday. I don't understand them at all. We are talking about a child who, at the start of the third grade, passed the end-of-year tests in math for fourth and fifth grade, and yet barely passed the math SOL. His reading score... the child who can read anything... \"Fail- below basic\"(yes, that's very bad). History? Fail. He can recite all the facts about Jamestowne at me, but can't pass a test on it. And why? \n \nWell, since understanding questions and how to answer questions is one of his major issues, that could certainly explain it. His differences in communication and language use make learning to take tests a serious problem. When you have a variety of ways to \"show what you know,\" you have more opportunities to prove you understand material and can apply it. When there is only one way- and one you find particularly difficult- then what you show is that you are not very good at that testing format. (Yet his school's funding and his teacher's pay are both tied to that testing format... something is very wrong here.) \n \nJoey stands out socially, too. Everyone knows Joey. He's a cheerful, friendly person who likes to connect with people.** We have already seen both the good and the bad that goes with his semi-celebrity at school. Most of the kids know him, and he is very likable (hard not to like someone who greets you with cheerful smiles and fusses over you like a mother hen if you get hurt). There are the bad apples who think he is funny (not in the good way) and taunt him, teach him foul language, and try to get him to exhibit his deficits for their own sick amusement. My job is to teach him how to identify these people, avoid them, and manage himself when they try to bully him. \n \nBut there is something more, harder to lay your finger on. He is not intellectually challenged, but his emotional development is definitely different. Other ten-year-olds run around playing active, dynamic pretend play- with boys, that tends to involve guns and bad guys. Joey's idea of a \"bad guy\" is a  Thwomp . Ten-year-olds around here are into \u00a0Transformers and Star Wars and fancy video games. Joey is in Mario Brothers and Angry Birds, but more in the way a younger child might display such a liking- imitation, echolalia, and obsession. For example, most ten-year-olds do not wander about the house and the grocery store in a full Luigi costume. Just saying. \n \nMost ten-year-olds are also not interested in hugging their teacher. Or quoting Little Bear. Or actively giggling hours upon hours about Shaun the Sheep. Most ten-year-olds read chapter books, like The  Wizard of Oz  or  How to Eat Fried Worms. \u00a0Joey isn't interested in all those words at once (I still think if I put one sentence per page, he's read them fine). His friends are noticing. The world is noticing. \n \nWe are entering an age when Joey's volume control issues and repeating are getting more stares than knowing smiles. He's grown out of many of the \"oh, well, my little one does that, too\" comments, because Their ten-year-old stopped doing these things when they were six. Why does it bother people to have a ten-year-old in the grocery store telling his mother about a Mario Brothers Level by reciting it step-by-step? What was cute when he was four is no longer \"cute.\" \n \nBut it is who he is. We have come to the point of the tight-rope walk, balancing social acceptance with comfort. We all have to wear fancy itchy clothes sometimes, because it is expected that we not show up at a formal occasion in a t-shirt and jeans. Yet if the clothes are  too  itchy, the occasion becomes not just a chore, but torture. How to balance comfort with expectations? How do we balance out teaching Joey what is socially appropriate without squashing who he is? \n \nIt is a knife's edge in parenting, and in growing up. Andy seems well-balanced on it. For example, he loves Timmy Time, a preschooler show. He finds it funny and comforting. But when choosing items to take to school for show-and-tell, he chose to leave his Timmy doll at home, telling me he knew quite well it was a \"baby show\" and that it might be embarrassing to talk about it in front of his friends. Then he sat down and gladly watched it. Hey, I still love my Disney movies, and I'm 40. But I also know not to dress up in a blue Cinderella dress and dance around the Walmart singing the Work Song at the top of my lungs. \n \nIf I think this is a narrow path for me to tread, I can't imagine the anxiety it may be causing Joey, or about to cause Joey... if I let it. He is the real tightrope walker, I'm just down at the bottom holding the net. \n \nAnd my breath. \n \n \n \n \n*SOLs are \"Standards of Learning\", the standardized testing for our state. \n**For folks new to the blog, yes, you read that correctly. He is autistic, and likes to connect with people. He always has.

{"date": "Thursday, September 20, 2012", "body": "\nWelcome to a new school year. Andy is transitioning OK to his new (rocking!!!) teachers. We've had a little trouble getting them to understand that \"dygraphia\" means \"please don't send home long writing assignments or you will drive both he and I to eat large quantities of ice cream all night\", but other than that, we're good. \n \nJoey, on the other hand, is in the grips of anxiety. Everything is new again. New teachers. New schedule. New para support. Autism program only twice a week instead of every day. Lots of new testing. He has all but completely refused to have anything to do with books. He will let me do small amounts of reading to him, but his auditory processing and focus means we have to read passages several times before he grasps what is going on, and that drives Andy to distraction (\"Mom! You've read this part  FOUR TIMES!!! \") I've gotten him to read one picture book; aloud, but independently, and one page from  Encyclopedia Brown . Both are books I know he can read easily. The problem is something else. \n \nOne facet is definitely the Anxiety Monster. One night this week, he was up and down, in and out of my room all night, to the point I woke up and asked him what was up. \n \n\"I didn't throw up on anything!\" was his cheerful reply. \n \nYeah, you  bet  I was up in a hurry and checking bedrooms, bathrooms, hallways... but no sign of waxing. He said he didn't feel sick. He tried to sleep some more. I listened to him toss for a while. Then he got in bed with us, and tossed for a while. That brain must have been going like mine- a mile a minute, revved to the full. I could nothing more out of him to help try to ease whatever is bothering him. \n \nThe next night was the same story, with the same proud explanation: \"I didn't throw up on anything!\" Naturally, this makes him tired at school, so this week has been even worse than the last two- which have been predictably roller-coaster wild. \n \nThen the Anxiety Monster struck at school. \n \nMath class. Joey's best subject. No one really expects him to freak out in math. However, boredom is not our friend, and we have a whole new crew who are not used to speaking Joey, and without the excellent team communication and ready resources we had last year. Joey had the work done before the teacher had even finished explaining the lesson, and there was nothing else for him to do. Naturally, he started messing with stuff and getting into things, and so was told to stop. With nothing else to occupy him, and stress already at the full, he melted and bolted. The new para (who is a sub while we look for a new para to replace the one who was dangerously bad at the end of last year) leapt into action (yay!) and managed to cut him off from exterior doors. He ran to the principal's office. \n \nThis used to be a safe haven for Joey. The principal we had in third grade had football stuff all over his office, and Joey found that comforting, so he soon started running there. The old principal even had a little pillow and rug for him, in case Joey needed a corner while he was away from the office, which was  totally  so cool of him. But this principal doesn't do that. Joey didn't really need it last year, he was pretty comfy in his classroom or the autism room (which doesn't exist this year). \n \nJoey hit that office, had no corner, and lost it. Loudly. With choice colorful metaphors and words. An admin tried to step in, and Joey responded by saying he was going to shoot him and kill him, so there was talk of suspending him. (Hey, folks- most stuff geared toward ten-year-old boys involves guns. You know, cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, Star Wars, G.I. Joe... what do you EXPECT an echolalic child to say when he's upset with you???) They had him corralled back his classroom by the time I arrived, grumpily shouted at all and sundry to... well, to suck his balls. A glorious term he picked up from one his classmates last year. \n \nAnd now, I think the new team knows what I mean when I say, \"boredom is not our friend.\" \n \n \n \nMeanwhile... JoeyAndyDad and I have been stressing over the coming of Middle School. Yes, a year away. Yes, already trying to figure out what to do. We crunched numbers to see about homeschooling, and that made us feel like we had an option, though it would mean a major shift in how and when I work, and for which jobs. But it is an option- perhaps an important one, because as he gets bigger, people no longer think the echolalia is cute. They understand it less, and have less tolerance for what he is saying. Joey is big, he's smart, and people readily forget what his disabilities really are. He appears to speak so well, you can forget all that good grammar is echo and script. When he uses a script someone doesn't expect, it can be startling. We worry about it being catastrophic. If he gets to middle school or high school using words that sound like a threat of violence, we are going to have a huge, huge problem on our hands. If he lashes out at someone like he lashes out at me, we'll likely have to homeschool, anyway. \n \nAm I really ready for that? \n \nSo I've been spending a lot of nights listening to the wheels rev in my head, like wheels stuck in the mud; listening to a boy who is not throwing up on anything, creeping in to find some comfort in Mom and Dad's bed, trying to find some rest.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/09/things-that-dont-wax-in-night.html", "title": "\nThings That Don't Wax In The Night\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, September 29, 2012", "body": "\nYep, apparently the majority of the training of Joey's new para is falling on me. So I put together an awesome powerpoint, starting at the beginning (\"What is autism?\") and tossing in all sorts of awesome tips for Speaking Joey. He actually had a decent day on Friday. I should do this a few times a year! \n \nThe first thing about my Speaking Joey guide is to remind the viewer that they should toss anything they picked up from pop media and culture about autism. None of it really applies to Joey, or not in ways you expect if you are stuck in the pop media model of what autistic people are like. \n \nDr. Grandin's idea of thinking in pictures and attaching every example she has ever seen of a noun to that word may seem a fascinating insight about autistic people- and it is. But with Joey, you need to apply that not just to word labels. He uses this technique of filing every word and sentence and paragraph he's ever heard or seen, and using them as placemarkers in language. When he needs a word or sentence, he zips through his catalogue and comes up with the one he wants, and puts in the relevant words as needed. The result at least sounds relevant, if not exactly what you would expect him to say. If he has no sentence in his arsenal to use, what comes out as he tries to construct one himself is an odd word-salad that has to be untangled. \n \nAutistic people are often portrayed as needing sameness and ritual. This is mostly true. But for Joey, that translates to needing to know what is coming in terms of what the activity will be, when it will be, and who he will be doing it with. He tolerates subs at school really well if I know the night before that there will be one. He likes routines in his days as most kids do. However, when there is a sudden change, he can't process and recover as quickly as most kids. \n \nThe presentation goes over how to keep Joey participating and coping smoothly. Safe spaces, breaks, maintaining engagement/avoiding boredom, paying attention to his cues and communication style. It then goes into what to do if something goes wrong- how to handle different kinds of meltdowns, different types of bolting, and how to redirect him and de-escalate a situation. He goes through his strengths and specific issues, his likes and motivators, and things that we, as his parents, just know to do and say and think about, every minute of every day or every situation. \n \nI understand this has now been printed out, studied, and distributed not only to the new para, but to all his teachers, with plans of distribution to the admin. \n \nI should do this a few times a year. He had a  fabulous  Friday.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/09/training-para.html", "title": "\nTraining the para\n"},

Also, teaching classes and trying to get stuff up in my  Etsy shop . And clean my house, which still looks like a tornado blew through after the bomb went off. Oh, and there's baseball. And my ETS job. And some other stuff. And trying to get Joey transitioned. Yay, me. \n \nTomorrow is the first day I was really going to take some time off for just me, doing me stuff, while petting cats. The morning would be spent working my ETS job, and then the afternoon I was going to sit on a couch, playing autumn favorites like Disney's  Ichabod Crane  and maybe a bit of  Harry Potter  or  Fellowship of the Ring,  I hadn't really decided yet. I was going to finish making hair scrunchies and maybe bake some cookies. I was going to clean the front hall. \n \nAnd none of it is going to happen. \n \nInstead, I will be at school, sitting in on Joey's math class to figure out what the cow is going on in there. He keeps bolting from it- sometimes twice in a single lesson. The new para they tossed at us yesterday, without warning, has no experience with autism or even working in education (her parents, yes. Her, no. Apparently her college degree is in business). I feel for her. She's about to have an unhappy parent come crashing into her life on Day 3 of her first real job ever and give her what-for. That's what happens when your boss tosses you into a job when a child's safety and life are on the line, without training you, transitioning you, or even informing your new co-workers that would be arriving. Talk about \"no support.\" Sheesh, poor girl. \n \nMy first priority, however, is my Joey. He needs appropriate support available to him at all times, and he needs it three weeks ago- well, five months ago, actually, but let's start with where we are. If he can run out of a classroom and across a hall, he can just as easily run out a door to the parking lot. He needs his academics to be brought back up to par. We started at this school reading four grade levels high; now we are \"below basic.\" They never bothered to hire an autism specialist for the school, they just borrow the one from the lower elementary. \n \nI can't let him lose more time- academically, functionally, emotionally. We're already trying to dig our way out of the pit he's already fallen into. We've worked too hard to let him down now.  He's  worked too hard.

My stomach hurts. \n \nHe got off the bus morning- he was quiet on the bus- saying he was going to slash people. This was blamed on a game, but I don' know any game he plays that includes slashing. I suppose it could have been worse- he kept the nasty words to himself. I know the bolting is avoidance and attention, but this threatening needs to stop. I got into the car, and drove to Staples, grabbed some cards and markers and binder rings; maybe having those old picture cards and schedules would help again. There is so much for him to worry about. I could make the cards while observing his class. \n \nBut I am stopped at the front desk, told I am not expected. But I am expected.

Puberty is upon us, he knows how to get attention, he explodes from anxiety then turns around and explodes to just not have to do work. It gets difficult to know if this spiral of self-deprecation is depression, or an attempt at control, or an avoidance, like so many other ten-year-olds. How much does the repetition of material he has already mastered annoy him (how many times can you answer a seemingly inane question- one that you know the asker already knows the answer to- without going bat-shit crazy? Some subjects definitely seem like that to Joey). How much energy can you expend before being exhausted? And if a strategy for communicating exhaustion or frustration result in calming, feels-good activities, why not try to use those strategies for other times of discomfort- like time to get work done, or try something new, or cope with minor frustrations? \n \nHow have I managed to totally fail him, to not get him to understand the importance of self-regulation, to love learning, to want to know about the world. How have I managed to sabotage all the work we thought had been done? \n \nI sit home, and stare at the computer, the blank TV. I manage to get down to the Farmer's Market and pick up some sweet potatoes for dinner. They are sitting on the counter. I'm not sure why I bothered. Andy will look at them and pretend to retch. Joey is just as happy with hot dogs or McDonald's. JoeyAndyDad doesn't like sweet potatoes. \n \nI talk to my mom. I think I managed to get her upset because I'm upset, but not much else.

We have four at our stop for this bus: Andy, JJ, G, and C. They have become a little friendship knot, with varying enthusiasm from each of them but they sit together, and ride the morning bus together, and it is awesome. \n \nAndy is the only boy in this group. This is about to be important information. \n \nSee the title? Well, it turns out there is another little posse on the bus. It is three boys, and I don't know all the names, so we'll just call them Bossman, Thing1, and Thing2. Andy told me about them Thursday evening. They sometimes sit in his seat when they aren't supposed to. The sometimes push against him when they go down the aisle. Sounded like rough kids to me, and I suggested telling the bus driver. Andy said he had. \n \nHe was more upset Friday morning. He didn't want to go to school, or get on the bus. But off he went. I decided to have a longer discussion when he came home. And so, Friday, evening, we had a long talk about the bus. Bossman was mean. Thing1 was the pushy one, Thing2 a little less energetic but definitely in the group. They were bugging him, they were bugging his friends, and they were definitely calling D (Joey's friend) nasty names. The bus driver had done nothing, so he was telling me. I decided- and told him so- that it was time to tell other adults, such as his teachers. \n \nI sat with him until he was asleep, then I swung into action. I emailed Joey's teachers, since D is in Joey's classes, and told them. I told D's mom. I shot off emails to Andy's teachers, and asked them to forward these concerns on to whomever they felt they needed to forward them to. \n \nMonday morning dawned. Andy complained about going to school and riding the bus. \n \n\"You know,\" I told Andy as he ate his breakfast, \"you don't have to get on the bus if you don't want to. At least, until we get this bully thing cleared up.\" \n \n\"Oh, no!\" Andy's eyes got wide. \"If I don't get on the bus, who will protect JJ? And I gotta be there to help G and C!\" Knowing these young ladies, I was both concerned and amused. Chivalry is apparently not dead. However, G ad C were definitely a tough little team, and kids rough enough to try to target them were definitely trouble. And likely to meet trouble, in the form of G and C. \n \nJJ is a different story. She's more likely not to realize there is a problem. She's a roll-with-the-punches type of laid-back kid, partly because she's been raised with a brother with is also ASD. That can teach you to roll with a lot of punches. She's also Joey's age- two years older than Andy. You know, I might be in a lot of trouble in a few years... \n \nAnyway, when they got on the bus, I huddled up the parents and informed them of what Andy had told me, and what actions I had taken, so folks wouldn't be broad-sided. Bus bullying is something that often goes unreported in Kid World, as it is often accepted as a norm. Everyone agreed to talk to their kids and find out what was going on. \n \nBut my emails quickly made the rounds. They were sent up to the Vice Principal, who forwarded them on the Principal. Everyone on the bus was interviewed. I received a series of emails as steps were taken, information gathered, and conclusions met. Bossman was a known problem, and all three would have immediate consequences. Sounds good, doesn't it? We will see how it plays out. \n \nIn the meantime, I got the skinny from the other parents, who had spoken to their kids. It was worse than I thought. Apparently, this trio was stealing items from kids, including JJ. Andy was getting them back, especially for JJ. They were saying nasty things about any kid who was \"different\" and forcing kids to do and say things that were inappropriate. They were especially hard on anyone they thought was \"gay.\" They pulled JJ's hair, too. They had been moved to the front of the bus, to no avail. And that was what the kids would  talk  about. \n \nI am so proud of my Andy, who stood up to these bullies and insisted on helping his friends. I am proud that he took a stand and told and adult. And when that adult's interventions were unsuccessful, he came to me. Tell your own kids to stand up against bullying. Tell an adult. And if nothing happens, tell another. And another. And another... until someone steps in and does something. Don't back down, and don't give up or give in. \n \nWe love you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/10/bullying-part-iii.html", "title": "\nBullying: Part III\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 01, 2012", "body": "\nSo we have an IEP next week to \"address\" Joey's recent ISS and the issues around it. In other words, a new FBA and BIP, lots of nodding, probably some Scolding of the Mom for being a helicopter parent who won't stand for her child being \"disciplined\" and for spoiling him, some smiles and nods up front while heads are shaken behind my back, some genuine attempts to help Joey frustrated by attitudes and misunderstandings and some outright sabotage. I'll witness teachers trying to voice realities and being shot down by admin and \"support personnel\" who have little or not real contact with or understanding of Joey. There will be desires to scream, throttle, and cry. Just the way I want to spend an afternoon. Perhaps I should bring cake.  \n \nIn the meantime, I was in my mom's office today. We haven't been in there much lately, as the contracting we do is between-jobs (we finished one project, and are awaiting the next project to start up... provided the right person is elected president and continues to fund the project at all. Yay.) The office is actually quite large, as we used to have several folks working out of it. Now we get a break on the rent, since I think the building manager breaks out in a cold sweat with thought of trying to re-rent it. Besides, we're quiet, we pay on time, and right now, we aren't even really there. When we do appear, we are pleasant and have plenty of new gossip to share in the main office. Perfect tenants.  \n \nI have a room converted for my new Etsy business, we still have our main office, I have one room as storage for for stuff from the old shop and for packaging and shipping supplies. We have a front room sublet to another little business that is also quiet and rarely present. There is one room left over, which was originally JoeyAndyDad's office, and then it was supposed to become my office- but Mom and I figured out we worked better when we were in the same room. So right now, it is filled with the computer modem-router-stuff-I-have-no-idea-what-it-is-but-it-blinks, my desk with a scanner for scanning in our old family photos, and... stuff. Old computer books. Old merchandise from the old shop that never sold. Some old display pieces that I don't even know why we moved. Some spare chairs. Six tubs of toys from the boys' rooms that need to be gone through and thinned. You get the idea. A room filled with hoarded crap.  \n \nI have big plans for this room.  \n \nOnce I get the crap cleared out and the blinky boxes in some kind of ordered cabinet, Ill have a nice, clear room, of reasonable size- bigger than the rooms at Joey's speech therapist's office, and they get all sorts of stuff done in there, and the materials to do it with stored in there. It would make a lovely homeschool room. Should we, you know, need one.  \n \nI could move the desk to the window, so we'd have space to spread out to do larger projects and games. I could get a smaller table area together for seatwork. Perhaps a nice comfortable area for a computer, and a reading corner. I could set up a bookshelf for the latest books on our latest learning themes, and have a small cabinet for supplies and materials. I could fill one wall with bulletin board, to post up our latest work, and maybe a board about what we were learning. I have plenty of friends who also homeschool, so finding a group wouldn't be too hard. We'd still have speech therapy and occupational therapy. Taking Joey places 1:1 would be mostly do-able. With a spare set of hands, I would probably be able to bring Andy in on it, too- though he'd probably be happier at school, where he has friends and a life of his own that is pretty successful, overall.  \n \nFunding this project would be the hardest part. I would obviously have to give up work hours, perhaps even a whole job, because not only would have Joey to attend to all the time, but I would need all the time I could lay hands on to teach him. Speech and OT still must be paid for, perhaps even more so, as we might need to increase the time at private practices to make up for lost school services. Plus, I would need more supplies and resources for teaching.  \n \nIf I can get this room cleared out, I have this option, whatever sacrifices would need to be made to choose this path. In the shadow of a desperate IEP, it would be an anchor to keep despair at bay. To be able to speak from a place of strength and choice is far better than a place of panic and resignation. To be able to stand here and say, \"My child will get what he needs in order to access his education\" knowing that he will not be sacrificed, that may be what we need to get through a meeting without, you  know, throttling anyone. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/11/making-plans-in-shadow-of-iep.html", "title": "\nMaking Plans in the Shadow of the IEP\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2012", "body": "\n \nThis afternoon was the school parade. I dressed up and headed over to see my Squirtle and Luigi show off their costumes. They were adorable. Joey was especially cute- he almost walked by me, but recognized me at the last minute... \"Mommy! You're a witch!\"  \n \n In fact, he had no clue I was going to be a witch, because when he left for school, I had no costume. I got our porch ready in record time, and realized I had time to make one, and a need to go to the fabric store to get Joey a mustache. A few yards of different sparkly webby fabrics and a couple hours later, and bingo! Witch costume to go with the awesome hat my mom bought me.  \n \nWe've found a little niche in our neighborhood. A family around the corner has kids a little younger than mine, but in terms of interests and energy, they are a total match. And they LOVE Joey and Andy.  \n \nThe mom is Italian, and so she is discovering American holidays. She did a great job with decorations and dressing up, and getting into the holiday spirit.  \n \nBetter yet, they decided to have a little Halloween party. Her kids came around the corner to invite my kids! They were so excited- their first Halloween party! The excitement of having friends around the corner who make effort to invite them over and get excited to see them was already the treat of the year- but to be invited to a real neighborhood Halloween party was the  best . \n \nAnd the kids enjoyed it, too.  \n \nPizza, cake, and offers of beer (I didn't take the beer because we still have trick-or-treating ahead of us) is an amazing thing. Seriously.  \n \nThen it came time to go out and raid the neighbors for candy. Andy realized he was going to get to go with his friends, as a group, and he was beside himself with happiness. Adults stationed up and down the street, plus two adults with the group, plus me... heaven opened and shined upon our town. Even better, as Joey started to lag, one of the adults turned and said, \"Don't worry, you guys take your time, I've got the Squirtle!\" Andy didn't have to chomp at the bit waiting for Joey, he could just go with his friends.  \n \nSee, this family, though their kids are not special needs? They get it. They understand that kids have different needs and stages and development, and that you do what is needful for each one. And they think Andy is awesome. And they think Joey is awesome. And what is super awesome, is that they are absolutely right. \n \nAnd they get it not just with my kids, but all the families of the neighborhood. They are glad to have everybody tumble into their house and enjoy themselves, and be together, and be themselves. They wouldn't have it any other way.  \n \nSo Joey and I got to do what Joey needed- methodical house-to-house, with prompts as needed and a few moments to talk with each person. Joey loves to tell each person he visits something- commenting on their pumpkins, or that Halloween is fun, or that Luigi is Mario's younger but taller brother, or... each time, not just \"thanks, bye!\" but an attempt to connect. And thankfully, everyone in the neighborhood has learned to just take it in stride. Even the new folks- college kids that change every year, or new houses we hit- they all were patient and happy to meet Joey. Not a single one tried to dismiss him or hurry him off their porch this year. Not. One.  \n \nHow awesome is that?  \n \nAnd when Joey got tired, I walked him home to Dad and Grandma, and then went back to get Andy from the house around the corner. WE stayed and let him play for a few minutes, and I talked with the adults for those few minutes. You know, adults. Grown-ups. With grown-up conversation. It was awesome. \n \nSo this definitely wins best Halloween ever.  \n \nI think the kids enjoyed it, too.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZervJJLGtFk/UJHJy_uNQoI/AAAAAAAAFAQ/vw1Zzl1jNoA/s1600/costumes.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Qr3jiiYcxRs/UJHJzZCNTLI/AAAAAAAAFAc/I2XgB_eTie4/s1600/witchy.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/10/best-halloween-ever.html", "title": "\nBest.

{"date": "Saturday, October 27, 2012", "body": "\nI am so tired sometimes. I look at what is happening in Joey's world, and the issues being created by the adults in it- or simply being left unaddressed- and it makes me tired. No wonder Joey is exhausted. The constant anxiety in which he lives his life, and the ways people react when he expresses it, would be enough to leave most people ready to... well, jump in front of a car. Or run screaming into the night. We shouldn't be surprised when he attempts to do just that, really. Sad and angry, but not surprised.  \n \nLet's take yesterday for an example. I'll start in the immediate middle of the story- Joey returns to his mainstream classroom and finds a good friend has been assigned \"silent lunch\"- that is, he will not be able to sit with them at lunch, and he understands they are being punished. Despite the friend's assurances that this punishment is merited, this causes Joey serious anxiety.  \n \nThe expected response in society is that the child \"stew.\" That is, they might be angry about the situation, but they keep it to themselves. This likely makes the child appear peevish or grumpy, but they keep their thoughts to themselves, letting the anger rattle about in their heads without coming out their mouths. Interestingly, we all too often go on to berate a child in this situation for being grumpy and irritable, instead of giving them time and support to work through the emotions for which they have no available outlet without getting into even more \"trouble.\" Should the real anger and frustration come out, we often punish the unexpected behavior to silence the child.  \n \nJoey does not have this coping mechanism. We have taught him- gone to great pains to teach him- to speak. Additionally, being autistic, his use of language is different- for Joey, he attaches emotions to words and phrases, and so when those feelings arise, those words come out of his mouth. Unfortunately, discomfort, embarrassment, and anger have been attached to words and phrases that make him uncomfortable, embarrassed, and angry, and those words are not ones we use in polite company. Taken with a 10-year-old's increased emotional load and anxiety due to normal development and the onset of puberty, you can imagine that Joey might get quickly overloaded in this situation, and revert to fight-flight mode.  \n \nWe have strategies in place to keep him safe from flight. We have people to block doors, places for him to go, signs to remind him when he enters blind panic or rage to stop and give him that breath of time to recover enough to be functional, even if minimally so. Enough to stop the flight.  \n \nApparently, we have not done such a good job if his brain decides to go with fight.  \n \nJoey became increasingly verbally abusive, and I am actually surprised he did not become physically abusive. Something was different, it was wrong, it was a horrible ugly rent in the fabric of the universe for him. He got angry, and he dealt with that anger in a way that society views as unexpected- he communicated it verbally. And loudly. And without appropriate and proper intervention to help him work through it, he spiraled out of control, and into a dramatic meltdown. Probably about a level 4, since there was minimal physical damage. But enough that I think the teacher freaked out a bit, never having seen a real meltdown before. There was no one in the school with solid autism experience or understanding of behavioral responses to intervene and support either Joey or his teacher.  \n \nHe finally returned to his self-contained classroom, where he started to lash out at the adult before him- his teacher. And she reminded him- prompted him- that she would not have it, and that his reaction was unexpected. The short walk to the classroom, and being confronted with a new person, likely gave him that half a breath he needed to start pulling out of the anxiety response- he remembered himself, and stopped. Unfortunately, this was used as evidence that he could stop- if not in the official reporting of the incidence, certainly in the minds of the adults dealing with the situation.  \n \nAnd so the mainstream teacher wrote him up. And the admin awarded him the glorious consequence of an in-school half-day suspension.  \n \nAnd now comes the kicker. See, this is the middle of the story. This was the trigger event. This was the behavior and the consequence, but I haven't given you the whole antecedent.  \n \nWhen I spoke with the teacher, I asked about his day. I learned two important things:  \n1. His schedule had been altered to include a morning activity of writing. Although he did well with the activity, and seemed fine, it was a schedule change. It was unexpected. But perhaps we can assume this was not feeding into the problem...  \n2. But being teased at lunch probably should not be ignored. Most of Joey's classmates are now very, very familiar with him, but there is a new child who is still learning. Apparently, New Kid somehow goaded Joey into bolting from the cafeteria at lunch. It is unclear whether this was deliberate, or whether Joey's lack of filters meant he overheard something the child was unaware Joey would act upon or even hear, I don't know. But the result was that Joey understood he was being goaded into leaving, and he left. Joey knows when he is being targeted and teased. Imagine how you would feel. \n \nConnecting discomfort to the lunch period, he then went back to class and found that a comforting person would not be having lunch with him. You know an uncomfortable situation is looming, and now you are shown evidence that something that makes it bearable is being taken from you. How would you feel? And how would you react? I'll bet \"uncomfortable\", \"anxious\", and even \"angry\" would be in that list, my friends.  \n \nNow let's go back and review how Joey copes with these emotions... in unexpected ways.  \n \nOh, and now let's punish him for it. That will help make him feel safe and comfortable, right? Right?  \n \nI am sure I will get email, and possibly comments, about how to \"take it from the admin's point of view.\" Or the teacher's. Or anybody but Joey's. Save your breath. I get it all the time, I see it all the time, and it is time these \"professionals\" started seeing it from my child's point of view- and started offering him (and dare I say, the rest of the kids in their care) appropriate support and understanding, even when it is difficult. Hearing \"we are very accommodating to Joey here...\" on the phone made my blood pressure jump. Yes, accommodating, until you aren't. Like \"accommodating\" a kid in a wheelchair, until there is a step you haven't bothered to remove from their path to get to class. \"But we put ramps everywhere else!\" is no excuse. You have to put a ramp here, too.  \n \nUnless, of course, you have no intention of that child actually being able to access their education all the time- just when you feel it is convenient to allow it.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/10/suspended.html", "title": "\nSuspended\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, November 04, 2012", "body": "\nAs the election looms near, I start working out what battles I will fighting, whether one candidate wins or the other. And I get to sit here and whine about it, because I vote.  \n \nBut what if  I  were voted in? What would  I  do? It is a game that is kind of like \u201cwhat if I won the lottery?\u201d Because I am not a multi-millionaire/billionaire, and so will never be able to run for president, I can play all I want. There something sad in the idea that you have to be wealthy to be given a chance to run the country, but that's a discussion for another time. After I win the lottery.  \n \nSo here is what I would do.  \n \nI would have a huge census project completed, pronto. Not of citizens- of the government itself. What does each office do? What does each worker do? What is the job description, and how does that compare to what the person actually does? How much money does each program have, and how much of that money ends up back in the hands of citizens? An in what form (how much is actual cash, how much is service, how much is infrastructure?) Which law dictates each program, office, position? A nice database would make the information quickly available and analyze-able.  \n \nWith this information, the goal would be to simplify programs so that access to services would be streamlined. We probably would not lose many actual workers in this streamlining, but the rules for accessing government and programs would be clarified and simplified. Instead of having to beg for support from five different agencies in three different departments to try to find services and support for your child or your aging parent or your farm, you would know the one office, which could determine your need and meet it. The time savings all around would be huge- and time is money.  \n \nNext, we have to decide what services the government should be offering. That is a more difficult thing, because different people hold different views of the role of government. Having studied many ancient and modern cultures, and see which ones were successful, I would suggest that government\u2019s roles are these:  \n Common defense of citizens. This includes defense against invasion from others countries, but also defense from disaster, crime, etc.  \n Infrastructure. Roads, schools, communications, etc. Make sure you can get information, people, and resources where you need it, when you need it.  \n Standards and commonalities. This includes things like money- a dollar in Maine is a dollar in California; measurements, definitions, and quality.  \n Social care. We all have ups and downs. Every successful society in the world had means for ensuring its citizens were healthy, fed, and housed. That way, they could work towards other things, like commerce, self-improvement, and progress. Also, since I am of the view that we are all in this together and none of us get out alive, a government should ensure care of its vulnerable citizens through education, health care, food assistance, and housing assistance.  \n \nPrograms would then be considered in light of these roles. Programs and benefits f programs would be for citizens. Programs and services for non-citizens can be paid for privately- a government is set up to protect and serve its citizens.  \n \nThe entire tax system would be overhauled. The federal taxes would include current \u201cpayroll tax\u201d (supporting Medicare and Social Security) and the income tax, and custom duties/tariffs. I wouldn\u2019t have an estate tax, because that money had already been taxed- it isn\u2019t really income for the family.  \n The payroll tax would not be capped. I believe that is currently at 13.3%, capped at the first $106K. Let\u2019s put it at 10%, but no cap.  \n The rest of the personal income tax would also be flat-rate. Everyone would pay the same rate, period, on income, period. I would have to have more data on the needs of federal programs to know what that rate would be. Let\u2019s say, for fun, it would\u2026 12%. That would means everyone would be at an absolute rate of about 22%. Yes, some folks would see a tax increase with that, but most of those folks would be the ones used to getting out of paying any tax at all, because of fancy tax accountant deductions.  \n Corporation income tax would allow for losses for be deducted. This would otherwise also be a flat rate. Let\u2019s say, 15%. Again, for companies used to taking advantage of lots of deductions, their taxes might go up. Also, it would be for income. You operate in this country, you pay. I don\u2019t care that your factory is in Tahiti, because you are being taxed on your income. All income must be accounted for, including foreign income (as a private citizen, if I make money in France, I still have to pay US taxes on it).  \n \nIn this new world, immigration would be different, too. There would be very clear guidelines about how to gain citizenship. They would be very simple- learn the history of the country, obey the laws of the country, learn the language of the country, etc. In other words, take the time and effort to become a citizen. Then you get a chance to actually become one. When I was growing up, I was taught this process took 7 years- about the time to get through, say, a graduate program. That sounds about right. Persons who apply to be on this track to citizenship will be provided certain benefits of citizenship in emergency situations (ie, emergency services, etc). Children of those registered as tracking to citizenship would be permitted services of citizens (ie, they could attend public school) if the family chooses to also pay citizen taxes during their immigration period. At the end of the seven years, with the simple and clear goals met, these people would be considered citizens, and go through the brief ceremony of swearing their new allegiance, etc. Anyone born in this country remains a citizen of this country. In case of marriage, the newlywed may choose American citizenship, provided they immediately pay citizen taxes, take the allegiance pledge, and can otherwise function as a citizen.  \n \nYeah, I know, down and dirty, and too many details left blank, right? But hey, I\u2019m also not likely to become the President of the United States any time soon. I\u2019ve got plenty of time to think out a lot of unaddressed issues and possible scenarios. But if I ran the zoo, it would definitely not take a week for helicopters to bring aid to hurricane-stricken areas of our country, when we had a week\u2019s notice of an impending hurricane. Babies in need of medical care to survive would get it, period. So would you, as you get older, and need services and care. Bridges would not be crumbling, anywhere in our borders. And all citizens would have access to free and appropriate public education- and \u201cappropriate\u201d would never,  ever  be synonymous with \u201cminimal.\u201d  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/11/if-i-were-king.html", "title": "\nIf I Were King\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, November 08, 2012", "body": "\nI know some folks find the whole warrior metaphor ugly and inappropriate- but I'm not battling autism. I'm battling the need for Joey's autism to be accepted, understood, and properly supported in school. We have been bitterly reminded of the consequences of losing that battle lately. Joey cannot afford for me to fail, and it becomes increasingly clear that other folks trying to help him have limited capacity to fight, for a variety of reasons (including, unfortunately, job security).  \n \nThe good news is that we have been mostly blessed with awesome teachers, not just now, but all along the way. A school is only as good as the teacher in front of you. Unfortunately, we are also stuck being something of a pioneer through our system- insisting on services, having a child with Joey's communication issues and social difficulties in \"mainstream\" classrooms, and even having a child like Joey who doesn't fit what people expect of an autistic child- these things work both for and (mostly) against us. We have teachers who love our Joey and are willing to try. That willingness has proven to be essential and vital to Joey's success, but also reveals basic discrepancies in training, understanding, and experience in many situations. Like the general population, school faculty far too often have limited exposure to and understanding of autism. And then they find a child like Joey, and it completely blows all of their basic training on the subject  out of the water .  \n \nPeople forget the Joey has disabilities of a nature that are not readily apparent until need for support becomes dire. Or they miss the meaning of what Joey is trying to do and say. It makes for misunderstanding, surprise, and broad-siding that can have drastic consequences.  \n \nAllow me to conjure you an example.  \n \nOne of the exercises at school is to give the children a \"prompt\" and have them write about it. Some weeks ago, the \"prompt\" was about Your Saddest Moment. We can discuss elsewhere why this might be a challenging and inappropriate writing prompt to present to my son, especially in the face of the difficulties we are having with him and his emotional well-being and coping, but hey, I wasn't there. To get the children started, the teacher offered her own example: her fish died.  \n \nJoey had a fish, and it died. He often perseverates on this in bursts, and has a great deal of trouble processing the idea of death. In fact, I can say with some certainly that this assignment was likely about three weeks ago, when Joey came home with perseverations on historical figures and the birth and death dates, their means of death, and then started looking up obituaries of random people on the internet.  \n \nSo her fish died. Joey has a fish that died, and it made him feel sad. I bet the class talked a bit about the death of the fish and why it made the teacher sad.  \n \nNow she is surprised that he sometimes come into her room and tries to open up conversation with \"I'm sorry your fish died.\"  \n \nThe other day, when he did this, she attempted to seize the moment to show Joey why this might not be a good way to open a conversation. She reminded him that the subject made her feel sad, and asked if he was wanting her to feel sad.  \n \nHis response? \"Well, you can just kill me, then.\"  \n \nHe picked up on the fact that the teacher was trying to tell him he had made a mistake, and that the mistake had hurt her feelings. HIs attempt to connect and capitalize on common ground had failed. His instant response was to be sad himself, and try to make it better by suggesting a phrase that he associated with being sad and feeling depressed: \"Kill me now.\"  \n \nIn shock at his words, she responded by arguing with him- she wasn't going to do that, etc. And so he moved on to a new shock phrase, to get her attention and make her stop... and unfortunately, that phrase was, with a smile of sorts still upon his face and a conversational tone, \"Then I'll just kill you.\"  \n \nYou can see where this might get ugly.  \n \nFortunately, the teacher did not over-react and take this as a real and immanent threat. However, it was also fairly clear that she does not speak Joey, and had no idea how the conversation had gotten to that point. She had no clue that she was teetering on the edge, and playing with fire- that such a response, even with his apparent calm, was a huge bonfire signal of \"DANGER, WILL ROBINSON! DANGER! ALERT! ALERT!\"  \n \nI assume at that point it was time to start the day and the natural distraction of having to attend to the schedule and daily tasks averted disaster, since the meeting was the first I had heard of this incident. That such an exchange might have been important enough to report to me and to the other staff immediately was something that seems overlooked even in the midst of the meeting.  \n \nYes, we are starting on an FBA, which will take at least a month to complete, and who knows what might happen in that (very busy with schedule changes) month. But somehow, it is incidents like these that ring in my head with the potential for disaster. It is stark reminder that I could win every single battle- go in and throw fits and stomp my feet and get the school to do study after study and make plan after plan- and still lose this war to their basic and profound ignorance and lack of training, understanding, and experience. And BIP only works if it is just right, and followed with understanding and acceptance. And I have no magic wand to wave and get people the experience and exposure they need,  right now .  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/11/after-battle-are-we-losing-war.html", "title": "\nAfter The Battle: Are We Losing the War? \n"},

We were up there to check out some issues Joey has been having, but also to get our foot into the door for support as he gets older. We could certainly have gone back to  Kluge , but various issues, including the current upheaval at the center, made it seem not a good idea for the long haul. And we are now hitting that long haul.  \n \nThe Kennedy Krieger building is impressive, with an airy reception and waiting area that has an aquarium and a playroom as well as a cafe upstairs. We were scooted in upon arrival (with free valet parking- yay!), registered in a jiffy, and soon munching bagels and waiting to be called. Everyone was totally nice to Joey, letting him start up conversations in his way, responding to him with smiles and comments and answers to encourage him in his interactions. Joey was happy as a little clam.  \n \nDr. Rubenstein was also awesome. We went through the entirety of Joey's tale, in detail, starting with him being a non-verbal two-year-old. The tale of the First Speech Therapist, getting him into school, getting him into therapies, getting his diagnosis, etc. etc. etc. Joey was diagnosed with autism by Dr. James Blackman at Kluge when Joey was about two and a half- in November, no less. The name apparently holds some weight, because upon mentioning this fact, the conversation shifted into a different gear. It made me wonder how many people go in to him with a lot of assumptions but no actual facts... or evaluations. I also think Joey was his usual surprising self. He does not present the way people expect an autistic child to present, especially if you have only known him for five minutes. As Dr. Blackman once said, Joey has a lot of classic autism symptoms, but not a classic combination.  \n \nWe got into sketching our current issues, and Dr. Rubenstein was definitely thorough and thoughtful, considering what we were saying and seeing, and what he could see for himself. In the end, we got no answers today, but an acknowledgement that 1. there is a problem and 2. we are going to try to figure out what it is, so we can help Joey. Also, we're going back to see the nutritionist. Let's see if we can get Joey eating more vegetables. ;)  \n \nI'm always anxious when trying to sketch out our experiences to doctors. You never know what they are going to say, or think, or even if they are going to believe you. Especially when they have Joey in front of them, being his happy little self, descriptions of problems and meltdowns seem so... bizarre. Unlikely. Out of character. Strange. Besides, I seem more and more surrounded by snake oil, and finding it more and more offensive... and more and more afraid of falling into the snake oil trap. When you start talking about Andy as well, and his issues, I often catch those sidelong looks... after all, these people don't know me. Am I serious and sincere, or a crazy lady who over-diagnoses her children, possibly to drug them into oblivion or get attention? On top of that, am I going to prove to be some batty woman who follows the latest in humbug and snake oil? Some of those folks who are into the quackery can be very... insistent. Every virulent. Dr. Rubenstein clearly had plenty of these types to contend with, from his reaction to mentioning a real doctor giving us our original diagnosis and to the therapies we have been providing. When he got to the part where he was explaining he wasn't going to be prescribing us any medicines, you could see the eggshells beneath his feet. It definitely made me wonder how many parents demand pills.  \n \nWe were very pleased, and look forward to getting the clues together and solving our current little mystery.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kennedykrieger.org/", "http://uvahealth.com/directions-locations/clinics/kcrc/kluge-childrens-rehabilitation-center-kcrc"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/11/our-morning-at-kennedy-krieger.html", "title": "\nOur Morning at Kennedy Krieger\n"},

I think about the possibilities of where we could be going, if I can't get the school program to function. I think about the needs Joey has, and the possible avenues he could take, especially if we can't get the depression in hand and the frustration under wraps.  \n \nWhat's on my mind? The other day, when Joey imagined that one his grandfathers died. The pain he felt, as if really had happened- and the breakdown he had in school over his inability to cope with raw emotion... even in an  imaginary  circumstance. That's on my mind.  \n \nThe long road ahead to get the school to understand that inclusion isn't working for Joey. He's being lost- socially, academically, he's drowning. The little progress he makes still leaves him lagging behind at an alarming rate- even as he steps forward, he is falling farther and farther behind. We've never recovered from our major third grade regression. I have to make sure I have every scrap of paper in order, ready to go. I'm not doing this one alone. How am I going to pay a lawyer? No clue. But it must be done. That's on my mind.  \n  \nHaving to admit to myself that inclusion isn't working for Joey. Sitting here thinking about it, I could just cry. We want him to be able to function in the world. We had been doing really well with it. But then third grade came, and it was sold to us as \"well, things are different.\" Guess what? In middle school, they are different again. To have to sit here and say, \"This environment is not supportive enough. He isn't safe there.\" I don't think many people understand how hard that is. What makes it harder is knowing those kids are at least used to him. There is some social value to having those kids learn beside Joey. There is also the future to think of- Joey's social future, after being pulled out of school.

There was also a craft fair nearby, so we wandered over there for a while. It was in my old elementary school, so I got to show him where I had classes and things. I hadn't been in the building in eons, so that was kind of surreal, but it was just as I remembered it.  \n \n \nThis year's theme was something about tropical or Hawaiian Christmas, which is really weird, too, since we aren't tropical. And I hate tropical theme Christmas stuff. The point of a parade is to get us into the spirit, and it is cold here, so having people wear hula costumes and put up palm trees- it just doesn't do it. Fortunately, there were plenty of non-float stuff to see.  \n \n \nThe other weird thing they do now is have all the high school bands just combine whomever wants to march in the parade into one band- so there is only one band. It is a shame, because parade bands are awesome. Also, hey, we pay for their uniforms and stuff, and it is a marching band, so come march. We all marched separately when I was young, and it was part of the deal of being in the marching band. Buy long underwear and know you are going to be in the band. We also memorized our music. And though we only had 28 horns at my school, we still rocked, even in parades.  \n \n \nJoey loved it all the same. He loves baton twirlers and bands and tractors and baton twirlers and ladies in costumes and trucks and baton twirlers...  \n \nAbout halfway through, he started singing Christmas carols at the top of his lungs. He even got some of the younger ones around him to join in to Jingle Bells. His favorite, however, is Joy to the World.  \n \nAs in,  Jeremiah was a bullfrog . \n \nEveryone around us was in hysterics. That's my boy.    \n \n \nHe did manage to catch some candy, but it was the folks giving out pencils that really made him grin. I think if I filled his stocking with sticks, he would be the happiest kid on earth. Pencils make great sticks. \n \nI also liked the folks who were giving out paper bags they had decorated- so kids could have a bag for their candy and pencils.   \n \n \nOne had to love parades, especially since Joey loves them, too. He was a little more reluctant this year, with the call of the Wii, but having some 1:1 MomTime turned out to be not such a bad thing, after all.

{"date": "Friday, December 07, 2012", "body": "\nYou may have noticed we've been having a lot of dips in the roller-coaster lately. In fact, the past three years of Joey's schooling have not been the rosy, well-progessing days of the three years before that. Even with teacher we think are excellent in the last two years, we have lost ground.  \n \nIt really struck home the other day, when his current Awesome Teacher, Ms. F, was praising gained ground. Joey is now independently walking from the bus to his classroom in the morning. Woo-hoo! Independence! Yay! \n \nBut wait. He was doing that in second grade. We're just now regaining skills we had in second grade?  \n \nI haven't said anything yet. I need to chew on that some.  We're just now getting back to some of the independence he had in second grade . Some. Not all.  \n \nYes, we have had some skills move forward. And he's grown up some. Not at the pace of his peers, but some. And yet, there are still these moments, whole days, whole weeks, when I feel like we're trying to regain lost ground. We had it. Then we lost it.  \n \n \nThis fall, we may have the opportunity to get Joey into a new school- one that seems designed just for him. Academics in the morning, tailored to the child's skills (so if Joey wants to go gangbusters in math, he can! and if he needs help in reading, he can get that, too!). Afternoons dedicated to movement, therapies, and specialized education (social skills, extra speech and language work, fine motor work, etc). Movement and sensory breaks throughout the day. Classrooms of 5 students, with one teacher and two paras. Plus full-day OT, speech, and vision therapists on site (and perhaps PT, depending on who the students are). All of these people would be trained not only in special education, and not just in autism, but specifically in Joey.  \n \nSounds like a dream come true, doesn't it?  \n \nBut here are the cons.  \n \nWe've been lucky to be in a small school system, and many of Joey's classmates have gotten used to him. They know him. They can at least tolerate his quirks, even if it is more in a mother-hen fashion than a friend fashion. Interaction with non-disabled peers would plummet, restricted to activities I could arrange after school.  \n \nI have an answer for this one, though. We are entering middle school. Much of that tolerance is about to evaporate in the world of the selfish, nasty pre-teen hormone rush. We are already seeing bullying and nastiness; it is about to get serious. This may be the time to rethink inclusion, which is already looking shaky. It is no longer a safe space for Joey to learn to interact with non-disabled peers, or for them to learn to interact with him. It is about to become even less so. This may be the moment to go ahead and give him more controlled environments to practice the skills he is being taught, and spend more energy on carefully controlling the \"on the job\" interactions he has to deal with- after all, it isn't just his classmates that are about to hit Hormone Central.  \n \nThe other con is the price tag. At $40K/year (which is a bargain, by the way), we have to put together the data that supports our observations: that as we move away from the model we were using, and that the new school will use(with morning academics and afternoon pragmatics and highly trained staff on site at all times), Joey's ability to access both his academic and his functional curricula plummets. When he is in those reg-ed math classes, he's supposed to be being instructed how to function in those classes; yet it seems that the school's idea is to just toss him in there and hope he \"picks it up.\" He needs a lifeguard to help him practice his social skills, but his para is green from school and untrained. And note how little I just said about learning math. We've seen his reading go from being at \"above 6th grade level\" in second grade to \"below basic\" in fourth. No one seems to be able to even tell me what progress he's made in reading. I've seen none. In fact, I've seen major regression- he won't read for me. He is again tolerating me reading in the room, but is not paying any attention to what I am saying/reading.  \n \nI worry that putting this down in black and white will somehow be considered a reflection of the teachers he has. What I feel is that we do have the A-team; these are the best teachers this school has to offer. And here we are, even doing our best and working our hardest. This isn't working for Joey. He's falling behind more and more, even as he moves forward, because everyone else is not only ahead of him, but they are moving faster. Yet his strengths get tossed to the wayside and left to stagnate, unchallenged or minimally challenged. He already passed the end-of-year test for this grade- two years ago. Has he moved forward at all? \n \nSo it is time to start gearing up for battle. This is going to be a tough, nasty one, which could be all for naught if we can't 14 others to win the battle, too. 15 students are needed to open. What a disaster it would prove if I can prove the schools are failing, yet have no where for him to go. Burned bridges are tough to recross.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/12/weighing-options.html", "title": "\nWeighing the Options\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 09, 2013", "body": "\nOur private social skills \"group\" has hit a snag. I put the \"group\" in quotes, because until next week, it is only two kids- Joey and \"Buddy.\" Next week, an old friend returns to our group, \"Mr. Man.\" (I hope to have some more posts up with Mr. Man in them, because he and Joey have a very interesting relationship.) The two currently there were matched up by our OT, who works closely with them in a program called  Social Thinking . They are learning about important things like body language, expected and unexpected responses, and how to tell when someone is talking to you, etc. etc. Buddy has some similar language patterns to Joey, but in some ways is more verbal, but in some ways far more inflexible. Both have difficulties with processing, and need a lot of external processing support and time. I was told this pair was a good match for the group, and Joey likes to go.  \n \nOver the two-week break, Joey informed me that he doesn't like Buddy. He was so clear about this that I decided the OT needed to know, to head off any problems.  \n \nYou know you are about to have an interesting new conversation when you pull your OT aside after group, and say, \"Miss L, Joey told me... he doesn't like Buddy...\" and she cuts you off with a cheery, \"Oh! Good!\"  \n \nOften enough when we have Joey in groups, it can be very difficult for us to figure out exactly what Joey is getting from the other children. He seems to be modeling for the other kids, but not having much modeled for him. I know things are working because of the improvements we see, but I haven't figured out exactly  why  it works. What's in it for Joey?  \n \nIN our little pairsome, Joey is again the model. Joey is very good at learning the proper way to do things, and modeling that in controlled settings. Buddy is not. He needs the foil of Joey to work on how things are done right. Hence, he often makes \"unexpected choices.\" Buddy does not respond in the ways JOey is being taught he should be responding. For example, if Buddy is sitting in the middle of the hall, and Joey wants to get by, we have taught him to politely ask, \"Can you please move over so I can get by?\" He then expects the response of the child moving aside so he can get by, because the other children have been taught that when someone asks you to move aside so they can get by, you move aside.  \n \nBuddy ignores him, and stay right where he is. Sometimes he may be playing a game in his head, and says something that seems arbitrary to Joey, like, \"Pow! You lose a turn!\" This is very confusing for Joey.  \n \nHowever, this is a common issue to think about in any social skills or anti-bullying campaign. You are being taught to react to situations in certain ways, do certain things, with the denouement being the bully starts being nice and everyone lives happily ever after. Right?  \n \nAnd yet we have all figured out it doesn't work that way. People do unexpected things. The bully keeps being mean. The co-worker keeps stealing your lunch. The neighbor keeps letting the dog bark. Mom still doesn't buy you the toy. Now what?  \n \nFor the past three years, Joey has had in his IEP a goal to deal with bullying. It is an unfortunate truth that bullying will likely be a fact of life for Joey, and he needs to be specifically taught the coping skills most of us learn just by having to deal with jerks all the time. What do you do when you do everything right, and the situation is still wrong? Or unexpected?  \n \nThis is one of the things Joey has been discovering and learning in group this year. How do you deal with the anti-social behaviors of others? If people make you feel uncomfortable, what is the appropriate and expected way to respond? What is a proper way to resolve an unexpected issue or response? Buddy stays put; Joey has to learn how to step around him, and perhaps go do something else. When Buddy says something that seems not to make sense, Joey is learning how to respond. When Buddy isn't nice to him, Joey is learning what to do. He is learning that not everyone in a class or group is a friend, and that it is OK that not everyone you meet, or who is in your classroom, is not your friend. You don't have to be friends with everybody. People who treat you in mean ways are  not  friends, and you do not need or want to be friends with them. He is learning to deal with people who are not friends, without being rude or unexpected- and how to be safe in dealing with people who are not your friends.  \n \nThese are skills the school keeps saying they can't teach Joey because \"no one bullies him.\"  \n \nI call hockey pucks.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://socialthinking.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/01/social-skills-arent-just-about-doing-it.html", "title": "\nSocial Skills Aren't Just About Doing It Right\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 05, 2013", "body": "\nI have been reading a few new blogs lately- ones that caught my eye in hopping about looking at other folks' blogs, or Facebook comments, or Twitter feeds. Without the massive mounds of time I would love to have, I am forced to be selective, so this is big news. Most of these new blogs have something in common with the experiences I'm having here- blogs with late-elementary kids, kids that seem to be at the same place Joey is in experiencing and understanding the world. The mix of eager emotion that rolls about my heart as I catch up on these new worlds, as well as keeping hold of the ones I already know and love, was something that seemed to be holding me to the ground as we take the latest hill of our roller-coaster.  \n \nI thought I was looking for some kind of understanding, some kind of familiarity, some kernel of how others are understanding their kids and perhaps hoping for a glimpse into what Joey is thinking and feeling. What I think I was really looking for was that \"I'm not the only one here\" that I hope my little blog lends to others. Standing on the edge of unknown territory, I so want to get a sense of what lies before my feet, and understand that others are at this same place.  \n \nJoey is in uncharted waters, and I don't want to fail him and have him drown... or not learn to swim.  \n \nAnd there are snatches of that out there. I'm not the only one with a 10-year-old who is still into preschooler characters, especially for comfort. We're not the only ones with ups and downs of echolalia, frustration, and discomfort. We're not the only ones walking that knife edge of being age-appropriate, yet letting Joey be himself. And Andy, for that matter.  \n \nBut there is something I have not found- I know it is out there, but we aren't talking about it in ways that I can gain insight on- for helping Joey. We can't be the only ones.  \n \nDealing with overwhelmingly intense emotion is difficult for most folks, but for Joey, who spends his life on the brink of an anxiety attack, the boiling-over can be explosive. Lately, Joey seems to have almost no defenses against intense emotion, and even immediate triggers can be difficult to discern. In November, we had the strange episode of the  Not Dead Grandfather , where just imagining the loss of a grandfather- none of which he knows particularly well, and all of which I am happy to report are alive and well- totally overwhelmed him, to the point he even had his teachers upset. The pain he displayed was as if the event had occurred- it was so real to him, he had no defenses to cope with the emotion of it.  \n \nLast week, he told everybody he had to give a \"last concert\" of  Signing Time  songs because he was going to move to my hometown and go to a new school the next day- and no amount of reasoning would deflect him. Even confronted with the fact that he was not moving didn't help; he was in such a state that the principal called me in the middle of lecture to ask me what to do. (Why did he not call the school autism resource teacher? Because she is split with another school, and was not on campus). I finally struck on using the social skills language he has been practicing in his private OT to try to give him some words he understood to calm him and re-calibrate himself; and that seemed to work. He was at least able to go to class.  \n \nI could identify the script sources (Signing Time, plus Quack the Duck from  Peep and the Big Wide World ), but I could not for the life of me figure out what made him so unhappy and uncomfortable that he would invoke them.  \n \nA few days later, he said a friend on the bus had bitten him- certainly that would be an immediate trigger. But in investigating the matter, there is no support for it. The bus attendant and the driver have no clue what Joey is talking about, the friend he claims bit him sits far away from him on the bus and, though an unpredictable child, is not known to bite.  \n \nI honestly find myself at a total loss. Was he bitten or not? And if he wasn't, what triggered a two-hour meltdown of echolalia and imagined upset? Is he having trouble drawing lines between imagination and reality? How can I help bring down his anxiety level so that \"imagined\"* stress does not overwhelm him? Is it the imagined scenarios he is feeling the pain and upset about, or is he hiding other stress (just like, for example, when he pretending to be Buzz Lightyear instead of Joey)? Is it a whistle in the wind, like when he loses something and starts screaming that it is \"on the roof\"?  \n \nI just don't know. But we can't be alone in this. Please. Not that I would want other families having issues, but... please don't let us be alone.  \n \n \n \n \n*Although the scenarios he is describing in his speech are not real, the stress is.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.signingtime.com/", "http://www.peepandthebigwideworld.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-rows-we-hoe.html", "title": "\nThe rows we hoe\n"},

We got a draft sent home to look over, and we were ready to go. We got to the meeting, and we talked about Andy, what he has accomplished, what he will need to succeed in school, and we got down to writing the IEP.  \n \nAll was going almost party-like, until the admin looked at the screen and brought it to a screeching halt. See, Andy's official special ed category is LD- writing disability (dysgraphia). Apparently, instead of being able to consider the needs to the child as an individual despite the specific labeling, we instead can only address items directly related to the label- ie, to writing. As most folks are apparently ignorant of dysgraphia and do not understand it is a pervasive disability, and as it was written specifically as a \"disability in writing\", the IEP can only address problems with writing at this time.  \n \nAnd the entire team choked, coughed, and sputtered, and then turned to me and said, \"well, we need to get his ADHD officially diagnosed...\"  \n \nAnd I had a bovine. I pointed out that not only was he officially diagnosed, the school had the record of it. Although not mentioned in the eligibility meeting that was successful, it was recognized in the pre-kindergarten child study  when we were turned down . And I said flat out that I believe that had we been given appropriate and adequate service then, we would not be having these meetings now. Early intervention really does make a real difference.  \n \nSo without missing a beat, the other folks said, this is wrong, and it needs to be fixed. Immediately.  \n \nWe closed down the meeting, and set up the next one. We put in requests for evals and testing. We return to eligibility, and get this made right, so that we can write his IEP properly, and his needs can be met. The organizational goals and sensory supports we had discussed could be put into place. This needs to happen, so he can access his education.  \n \nThis is how it should work- the teachers and therapists see there are needs, the parent sees there are needs, and the paperwork is fixed to be sure it reflects those needs and the required accommodations. The case manager steps up and says, \"this needs to say this, let's get it done.\" And then we put the cogs in motion to get it done. The team works as a team, not as a battle.  \n \nYes, folks, this is the way it should work.

With comes the Light It Up Blue campaign, bringing awareness to anybody who is actually paying attention or cares even the slightest bit about why your porch light is blue all April, and no other time.  \n \nI have noticed that the autistic adult community is a little torn about Light It Up Blue. There is a gambit of feeling towards it, from antipathy to appreciation. I can't please everybody- nobody can. But will I light it up blue?  \n \nYes, I will.  \n \nChanging my light bulb actually started conversation in our neighborhood, especially since I was not alone in doing it. I think some of our neighbors were genuinely surprised to see so many porches go blue for April. They wanted to know what was up. And once you get someone to talk, you can get the reins of that conversation and start some folks thinking.  \n \nFor me, it isn't about Autism Awareness. It is about Autism Understanding.  \n \nMany folks in our town know Joey, and they know he is autistic. Few know what that really means. They are surprised to find he loves to be around people, and loves to talk to people. They are surprised to find he is intelligent and observant. He laughs, he chats, he pretends. Part of the surprise is how many \"autism awareness\" campaigns teach people to look for kids who are aloof, withdrawn, or even violent. Kids who burst into meltdowns at the drop of a hat, who make weird noises, who flap their hands, who don't talk at all- those are the kids many of these campaigns push into the public eye. Any of these things can apply to a person with autism. Or not.  \n \nSeizing a campaign like Light It Up Blue and using it as a tool is an important way to educate the majority of folks out there, who have  no clue  what it means to be autistic. The majority of folks who have no clue even what it means to care about or be a person with special needs or disabilities. I always go back and think, what were my attitudes and opinions before I knew Joey? How do I get people around us to understand? How do you remove ignorance (the only real was to remove fear)?  \n \nIf my blue light bulb makes even one person stop and think, stop and ask, stop and understand, then that is one more than had done that yesterday.

{"date": "Friday, April 05, 2013", "body": "\n Conversation tried  \nAnd tried and tried and tried and \nWhy do they walk away?  \n \n \nI think social thinking and social skills should be incorporated into the general curriculum of every school, at every level. I think even college students need to be required to take social skills classes and training. If people really gained these skills, really got a chance to think them out and practice them before being tossed out there to flounder, the world would just be a better place, all-around.  \n \nAnti-bullying programs are a joke. They don't work. Kids seem to regard them as some sort of irritating adult thing, like South Park's Sexual Harassment Panda. In the abstract, people know you don't beat on other people and make fun of them. On the ground, the lines are apparently not so clear. The idea of treating others the way we want to be treated just completely goes over most people's heads. That other people have feelings to hurt, that it might be a bad idea to insult people even when they are not standing in front of you, that being included means being inclusive- these things are apparently harder to learn than they appear.  \n \nBesides that, kids who are already serious bullies don't care about anti-bullying programs. They aren't the ones really being targeted. They need a whole different kind of support- someone needs to take them aside and figure out the root of the problem, and address it. Now. Denying that bullying exists in your school, and that no one knows who the bullies are, suggests you might need that kind of intervention yourself. Turning a blind eye is a type of abuse that absolutely requires intervention.  \n \nThe over-use of the term \"bully\" isn't helping, either. Is turning a blind eye \"a form of bullying\"? Perhaps. But let's call it something with more specific implications: abuse. It may seem a passive thing, but really, anyone who has ever worked with people on any level knows that bullying- the direct pressuring of one person trying to exert power over another- happens, and you have to watch for it. If you teach kids (and I mean really teach them, not just note it and move on) early what the pitfalls are that result in bullying, they can at least watch for the traps. When you teach others not only how to act social, but to actually think about social interaction, to think about the other person as well as being self-aware- that gives people the tools to not only avoid the pitfalls, but know what to do if they fall in to one, before it becomes a serious situation.  \n \nAll too often, people on the spectrum are criticized for \"lacking social skills.\" If we actually thought about social skills and were socially aware and socially thinking, we might realize that it isn't just \"an autism thing.\" Today, I watched Joey in the park. Joey loves babies and little kids, and he wandered about much of the time, trying to interact with families and small kids, play with the babies and get involved with the little ones. No, he's not good at opening interactions, but that's no excuse to hurt his feelings- especially if you an adult, since he is so clearly a child. I could tell you a lot about each and every adult out there in about five seconds, watching their faces as Joey walked up to them and tried to open conversation. And tried. And tried again.  \n \nSome of the adults smiled and joined in. Some of them wrinkled their noses and ignored him. A couple families actually picked up their kids and walked away, only to return when he had moved to another part of the park. A group of college kids actually remarked, sitting right next to me, \"Someone ought to take that retarded kid home. He's making everybody uncomfortable.\" You can imagine their faces when Joey came over to me, and we did some signing and playing together, then I gave him a kiss before he returned to his  attempts at play. I didn't look. The few seconds of silence before they wandered away was deafening.  \n \nThis is what passes as social skills?  \n \nImagine how different middle school would be for everyone if social thinking was part and parcel of the curriculum. If kids on the brink of huge social changes and questioning were given the tools to be both self-aware and to understand how their own actions and feelings might affect others, they might have the tools to navigate the social world they are creating. They might understand the real value of diversity, and find the challenge of inclusion far less daunting. With safe, controlled situations to practice in, kids might find going out and making realities a familiar thing, and do it with real confidence and strength in experience, instead of trying to strike out with no idea how to do it.  \n \nIt's amazing how much easier it is to do something when you have an instruction manual and can practice a bit before going out and doing it \"for reals.\" We know we need to practice skills to get them right. Why do we think we can just go out and use social skills without practice? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/04/autism-understanding-day-5.html", "title": "\nAutism Understanding: Day 5\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 16, 2013", "body": "\nThere are many challenging behaviors that can present in any person, but this week we have been keenly aware of one that Joey has been displaying for three years now: \"eloping.\" This is in the original sense of the term, \"to slip away\" or \"escape.\" With Joey, we have noticed variations in the behavior, and it can be important to note the difference in them when trying to help Joey. I call them bolting, escaping, and running. All three are stress responses. There is also wandering, which we don't see very often, and is more of an impulsive behavior than a stress response.  \n \nBolting is actually the most dangerous, a severe impulsive fight-flight response to stress. In bolting, Joey is in blind panic. He doesn't know where he is, where he is going, he is just gone. When we first had trouble with eloping, this is what we had- a child so in the red zone and out of control, he just ran for it. Probably the most dramatic incident we had of this kind was at the Renaissance Faire, when he became overwhelmed, and then has a horde of people in costume chasing him through the woods. It wasn't pretty. We have recently been seeing more of the flip side to this coin, the fight mode. Joey was suspended this week for choosing fight instead of flight.  \n \nBolting is dangerous because Joey has no sense of place or space, he's just barreling ahead. He could run into a street or become lost. Also, it is very scary for him, creating a dangerous spiral. As he begins to realize what is happening, he becomes even more upset, starting the spiral again.  \n \nEscaping is a more cognizant response to a specific moment of stress, or a moment when the stress becomes overwhelming. Usually, Joey know where he is going, either vaguely (I want to go home!) or specifically (going to hide in the car). He is usually displaying anger, and recently, aggression. Escaping occurs when he feels scared, unsafe, and overwhelmed. It is often unexpected, unless you are in the middle of a direct confrontation with him. An escape can escalate into a bolt if he is not contained quickly and supported effectively. He can also be very sneaky about it- edging towards the door, finding a key to a lock, or climbing over a fence.  \n \nEscaping can be dangerous because he can be gone before you know it. You think he is in his room, and he is down the street. It can also accompany a major meltdown, and if stopped inappropriately, can also regress into a fight response.  \n \nRunning is a more deliberate attempt by Joey at a calming technique. Going for a walk tends to help his head clear, and sometimes he will attempt to do this if he is feeling stressed and just wants to get away from a specific person or place. This one is dangerous because it takes you by surprise- you don't realize how stressed and anxious he is. He usually knows where he is going, and often is ready to respond by teh time you find him.  \n \nWe don't get wandering very often- an impulsive movement towards something of interest, or away from something not of interest. It can be a little nerve-wracking to have that sudden \"where's Joey?\" moment, because often you are someplace new or in public, and thought you had eyes on him.  \n \nWhat is terribly important is that all of these manifestations of eloping can be dangerous, even deadly. Joey can talk, but his unique and non-typical use of language places him at risk. Not only could he get lost, but if he is bolting or escaping, he might use threatening language that would be (understandably) misinterpreted by a stranger as a serious and immanent threat. Joey is big. If he barreled at a stranger, that could also be misinterpreted. In Virginia, where people can carry firearms in public, the threat of being a deadly behavior increases to horribly deadly probabilities.  \n \nWe have been waiting for Project Lifesaver to help us since August. We've looked into other options, including purchasing a GPS, but none of the devices available to the general public are reliable, and there is no way to keep them on him. As Joey's challenges at controlling emotion and response become increasingly apparent, and incidents such as the one at school this week- ending in a suspension- become more frequent, our fear is also on the rise. There are just so many ways this could end up wrong.  \n \nDead wrong.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/05/on-run.html", "title": "\nOn The Run\n"},

The good news is, I love teaching, so I'm all about the slog. Shame they did it so they don't have to pay as much.  \n \nThe other good news is the change is likely to keep the grubby paws of academic hotshots off my job. Most academics aren't really into teaching. They are into their research, the world of publish-or-perish, the slog of conferences and journal publishers. They don't want to have a 6-7 course load each semester. And hey, since I haven't published anything, I'd be at serious disadvantage if it was a  real  prof gig.  \n \nSitting in the park, I find myself in a sea of talk about therapies, strategies, methodologies. Our little group is planning how to get through the summer with our little group of kids. They have been together all year in a social skills group, but the facilitator left at the end of the program and won't be replaced until the fall. Andy is ADHD, the other kids are autistic, all of them less affected in oral communication than Joey. We are at the park, letting them play together with one of the attendants the one mom hires through her Medicaid waiver (though for the two hours we are in the park, he's being private-paid, since we're all using him), and the guy is awesome. Meanwhile, we are looking at our options, reviewing programs, tools, ideas for getting us together through the summer.  \n \nI'm fond of the program they have been using,  Social Thinking , and we're going to adapt the  Movie Time  curriculum for abbreviated summer. The table is scattered with other tools. They all look awesome. There's a whole kit for emotion recognition, complete with velcro charts. There are lesson plans for programs, including the one we're going to do. There is talk of websites and camps and programs designed for our kids.  \n \nI wonder what parents of kids without special needs talk about.  \n \nI've never gotten to write my article about pilgrimage, I think sadly. I have all of this to learn about now. I don't even have time to think about India or stupas or ancient inscriptions. I now have to be an expert occupational therapist, speech therapist, behavior therapist, and psychologist. Oh, and a lawyer, teacher, and intervention specialist. It's a good thing I'm trained to research and analyze; and even so, I find myself drowning in a sea of information. I have to sift through the sands to find what works, and separate it from the woo and semi-woo. Instead of traveling to conferences and writing about art, I spend all my energy traveling to therapies and listening in waiting rooms, trying to understand why certain strategies work and think about whether or not they would work for either of my boys. I try to find energy for putting the strategies and programs in place, or get my boys to the opportunities to grab their attention, focus their energies, and allow for growth. Or at least a taste of something good, a break from the constant challenge and work that encompasses their lives in meeting their challenges. Respite is good for the soul, even for the kids.  \n \nOnce upon a time, my plan was to be in Varanasi this summer. Joey is eleven. Andy is nine. It would have given them a good taste of the world, a new look at their lives and their values. Such avenues to open and look down and wonder about, new ideas to think about, new visions, new smells, new sounds, new foods. I would take them over to the silk shop and have kurtas made for them. They could watch the geckos on the walls at night. We could dip our feet in the Ganges. There are plenty of children there, new friends to meet. We could have taken a ride in a motor rickshaw out to Sarnath, or just wandered along the ghats.  \n \nBut that's not my life anymore.  \n \nI'll be super-happy if I get the full-time teaching gig. Even though its just teaching 101 and 102, maybe 106 (Modern/Contemporary art), I'll still be opening up eyes and minds to the new world of art- observation, analysis, and communication. There's plenty to do with that, too, keeping abreast of the latest ideas about Michelangelo or Archaic Greece. And maybe I can get it together and take the boys to the Freer/Sackler one weekend. At least give them a little taste of what Mommy dreams.   \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.socialthinking.com/", "http://www.socialthinking.com/books-products/books-by-age-group/k-5th-grade/movie-time-social-learning-detail"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-different-road.html", "title": "\nA Different Road\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 18, 2013", "body": "\nThe meeting about Joey's suspension just didn't really go well. Our principal is very nice, and I think generally, he is a very good school principal. However, I don't think I got across what was needful. I get tired of trying to communicate in formal letters where every word is oh-so-carefully-vague and meetings where there i no time to process, no time to sift through and say what is needful, to bring in the references and ideas that I think would make things so much clearer. I get tired of having to think and communicate in words all the time. No wonder Joey gets exhausted.  \n \nSo I started working out the kinds of things I wanted to say. And then I cleaned up the language, because I really do try to avoid cussing here. And the latest I came up with was this:  \n \n \nHow do you make Joey feel when he is trying so hard to communicate, and interact, and control his anxiety, and you ignore him, or use too many words, or he finds himself out of control without the skills he needs to get back into control? Because you don\u2019t know how to help him, your attempts at helping him become not only futile, but frustrating, aggravating, insulting, and even inflammatory.  \n \nTo him, you appear to be mocking him.  \n \n It would be like having a bunch of dead fish, but no one around you will acknowledge that the fish are dead. Instead, they offer to help you look for the fish or try to help you figure out why they disappeared.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe problem might not even have a solution. But you aren't necessarily looking for solutions. You're maybe just looking for someone to say \"sorry about how dead your fish are\" or \"wow, those are super dead. I still like you, though.\"  \n \n \n \n- Hyperbole and a Half \n \nAllie was describing depression. I don\u2019t think that is a coincidence. Being treated this way for so long, by so many people, has resulted in severe depression.  \n \nWe need to start with acceptance, and that is not something that was demonstrated here. Tolerance, yes. Acceptance, no. We have to first meet Joey where he is, instead of expecting him to meet us halfway. Or in this case, the whole way. You are the adult. He is a child.  \n \nJoey is eleven years old.  However, he has a developmental disorder, and that disorder is pervasive. That means there is nothing about him that is not part and parcel with his autism. There is no Joey-without-autism. There is no behavior-that-is-not-autistic that Joey does. There are no non-autistic motives. There is no separating threads out, this one autistic, this one not. Trying to treat him in that way is not only ineffective, it is ignorant, and even abusive. It will make the problems we are facing worse, not better. Reinforcing those problems isn\u2019t helping, either.  \n \nOne facet of autism is an inability to control emotions. And like many children, Joey can feel, but he can\u2019t always express his feelings in a way that is clear or correct. He can\u2019t translate feelings into words the way an adult without autism can. He can\u2019t just walk up to you and say, \u201cI need help.\u201d He can\u2019t just go to someone and say, \u201cI\u2019m in the red zone.\u201d Expecting him to do this is inappropriate. He is being trained to do this, but it still involves a level of control of emotion and language that is out of Joey\u2019s reach.  \n \nIt would be like standing in front of a kindergartener and saying \u201cOne apple plus one apple makes two apples. Got it? Good. Now you can run this cash register, and you\u2019d better not be off at the end of the day.\u201d Then, when we come to the end of the day, punishing them with progressive severity depending on how many days we have done this to them, and how off the cash register drawer is, and how much stock is missing.  \n \n \n \nI feel like we got a lot of this from you. Instead of understanding what I was trying to tell you, you were busy trying to defend punishing my child for being autistic- and punishing him in a way that was not even helpful in changing the behavior you found offensive and unacceptable. You insisted on labeling him as a discipline case, instead of trying to understand his needs and what really happened from a constructive and accurate point of view. Now he is branded, he is likely to act this way again because it was successful in getting his goal of going home, and you still don\u2019t know enough about autism or my son to intervene appropriately should more problems arise. I would call that a lose-lose situation.  \n \n729 students, and you are the crisis manager. You said you can\u2019t possibly know all 729 students. That keeps bouncing about my head. I was told a very similar thing some years ago, when we were having trouble before, and trying to get Joey some proper and appropriate occupational therapy. If you are the crisis manager, and you do not have someone specialized in the needs of each and every one of those 729 students, then it is your job to know each and every one of those 729 students, and what they need. It is your job. You are supposed to be the professional at this. If you don\u2019t, then you need to either get trained, or have someone there who is. That is simple, straightforward logic- especially when we are talking about crises- moments that are potentially dangerous.  \n \nI\u2019m an art historian. Every semester, I have 170 students. I am expected to be able to respond to the learning styles of those 170 students. My students change every 3-5 months, for a nice total of about 400-500 students a year, all new (you have some new, some you\u2019ve had a year, some you\u2019ve had 2 years). Additionally, I have to know thousands of works of art from all over the world and their cultural context, and be able to recall that knowledge at a moment\u2019s notice. That\u2019s my job. I have never told anyone that this was impossible, especially my students and colleagues- because it\u2019s my job. I get very tired of people telling me they can\u2019t keep up with all the knowledge they need to do their job. I don\u2019t expect you to start giving spontaneous lectures on the role of ashlar masonry in medieval vaulting and clerestory construction on a moment\u2019s notice to answer a question. I would, however, consider it reasonable for you to expect me to do this. You can then go ahead and give me the third degree on Picasso, and I should be able to at least handle the concepts involved in Cubist and post-Cubist art. You should also be able to pull up a current student and be able to discuss their work and learning style, and I should be able to give you a sense of their skills and successful ways to support their learning in the classroom environment- and to make clerestories and Modernism relevant to them. It\u2019s my job.  \n \nSince you know, and knew beforehand, that suspending my child was not in his best interests- your words- you should have, long before this crisis, determined what intervention and consequences would have been in my child\u2019s best interests. You should have consulted your resources, and come up with an appropriate answer to the question, \u201cwhat should we do to prevent this?\u201d Unless your goal was to brand my child a discipline problem, preventing a repeat of potentially unsafe behavior would, I should think, be our immediate goal. AS the crisis intervention person, that is your job. Asking me to come up with such a solution, on the spot in your office, and then insisting that this discipline write-up and suspension will stand since I could not come up with an immediate answer and solution is not only unfair, it is counter-productive, and shirking your responsibilities. Tossing your job on my shoulders? Totally uncalled-for. \n \n \n \nI realized that you know my son\u2019s name, you know his face, but you haven\u2019t bothered to know him at all. Trying to intervene when he is in crisis without knowing him is a huge mistake, because he is not like most of the kids in your school. You have 729 kids in your school, but only a handful of them are autistic. Trying to intervene as if they are not autistic will always result in disaster. You come up with the solutions to the wrong problems. The concepts you are using do not match up to the situation at hand. The result is a swift spiral into the chaos of frustration, anger, confusion, and depression\u2026 for Joey. He does not have the tools to deal with those emotions in ways you expect, ways you find acceptable and appropriate, ways you want to reinforce and promote. Instead of dismissing him as a discipline problem, trying actual discipline, not just punishment. Don\u2019t break him. Teach him.  \n \n \n \nWhen I posted this online, I think most people assumed I meant me. I meant Joey.  \n \n Children with autism often have a very uneven profile of skills \u2013 e.g. they may be relatively able with numbers, or art, or using the computer, but may find relating to others difficult. Even if your child has lots of other skills, if they do not have those early interaction skills, you may need to teach those skills through engaging in the type of play you would use with younger children. Start where they are.  \n\u2013Autism Sparks \n \nI am tired of people who are supposed to be professionals not being able to handle Joey. He\u2019s really not that difficult. His skills are uneven. We are perfectly glad to \"accept\" and acknowledge his emotional disabilities when it means that big smile on his face, his willingness to accept others, his need to please, his desire to be hugged. It\u2019s all good when we get the giggles and the silliness. But when that lack of control goes sour, instead of meeting it with the same acceptance, the same understanding, we freak out. Instead of containing him and helping him through, we forget everything we learned about how to deal with an overwhelmed 5-year-old, simply because he is in an 11-year-old body, and we know he can do a lot of 11-year-old things. The uneven skills, the splinter skills, the gaps we see in academics are ignored and forgotten, and we place expectations on him as if he were in the same place as his age-peers in development. We try to compartmentalize his autism, and address what we see as if it were a mixture, not a solution. But once you mix the egg into the cake mix to make batter, you cannot extract the flour back out and put it aside. I\u2019m not even sure why you want to.  \n \n \n \nI don\u2019t think you learned anything from this situation. If you had, you would have understood how the whole situation was an act of discrimination against Joey. You would be working to break those old habits of thinking, look closer at my child and see that this whole situation was completely preventable, had there been appropriate supports and resources in place- the supports and resources we have been begging to have in place since out first IEP meeting with your school.  \n \nJoey, however, learned a good deal. He is echolalic and echopraxic, but has learned to use these as tools- cataloguing each and every word and action, noting its use as a tool for his own agenda and needs. He learned that these actions and words do indeed give him a vacation from the stressful, high-anxiety environment of school. He learned that the people around him are not to be trusted, as they are not able to help him when he is feeling panicked and is out of control. He learned he has nowhere to turn, no safe space- either physically or emotionally- in that building, and that if he acts out in ways he has seen others act out and get to go home, you will send him home. Where it is safe.  \n \nThe consequences of this lesson will continue to reverberate. Just as we never recovered from similar trauma in his third grade year, it is likely we will never recover from this.  \n \nWhen I was about Joey\u2019s age, I had a meltdown, not quite the intensity I see in Joey. It had been a bad day at school- a myriad of small things that felt like being pecked to death by a duck. The day was warm, and I had a mile walk home from the bus stop. My body ached, I was exhausted, and I went into fight-flight- for me, that involved a sort of swirling, moving forward, and crying. I realized I needed help, and turned up the driveway of one my well-known neighbors, with the goal of asking them to call my mom, or at least sit down in a cool room for a moment. My neighbor had a dog- not a big one, and fairly old, I had played with it a hundred times before. As I turned up the driveway, the dog ran towards me, barking. There was no threat. The dog was likely barking because it was happy to see me. However, in my exhausted frame, it was terrifying. At first I stopped, panicked; and then I ran, crying harder. I made it home. The neighbor had seen me, and called my mom, who just couldn\u2019t understand why I would be suddenly terrified of this gentle, well-known animal. Nor could I explain it- I had no words for that experience, and no way to explain to my mom that it wasn\u2019t about the dog. ** \n \n \nBut to this day, I remember it. And it still makes my stomach knot up, and I can remember the blind terror of that walk home. To this day, I do not like dogs. I tolerate them, but I do not like them. That moment was thirty years ago. Imagine having that kind of trauma every day, or even just once or twice a week. My child goes through his whole life on the brink of it. Every step. Every breath. Every moment.  \n \nFor emotional development and skills, your school has not only been a total loss for Joey, but marks a severe regression in skills and ability to cope, reinforced by lack of support, inappropriate response by \u201cprofessional\u201d adults, and reinforcement of undesirable behavior and strategy. Joey arrived at your school able to be with his nondisabled peers for the majority of his day; now he cannot even consistently handle the few minutes before school begins. We have experienced repeated and complete emotional breakdown.  \n \nAnd for that, you decided to \u201cpunish\u201d him, and place in his record a brand of being violent.  \n \nIf you had been through what Joey has been through, and trying to deal with the anxiety and frustration he deals with every minute without a break for three years, and have every \u201cappropriate\u201d strategy you had been taught turn out to be unsuccessful, you might get violent, too.  \n \nIf that is the only way you can be heard, you likely would reach a breakpoint to go for it. Joey reached his.  \n \n \n \n \n**(I was fortunate- my mom understood me. Although I don\u2019t think she had any clear way to explain it to me at the time, I think she understood pretty quickly that it wasn\u2019t about the dog).  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yaQP8CgaSaE/UZg4uy7Gd6I/AAAAAAAAFaU/oXX6GBsqDgI/s1600/ADTWO16.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z-35W8wKIh4/UZg4u6IoFRI/AAAAAAAAFaQ/s18VCqkzC-I/s1600/ADTWO17.png", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jB8wm5_8vlA/UZg4vJkPlRI/AAAAAAAAFag/Vr_VIVfF4ys/s1600/ADTWO18.png", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_IFYDHuOtU4/UZg5IwiUPqI/AAAAAAAAFao/cDAuhyPNiXs/s1600/ADTWO19.png", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u_tFEMQJ_r8/UZg5JH6G9UI/AAAAAAAAFaw/KTlSZznVUDE/s1600/ADTWO20.png", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-trgbeXF2VGU/UZg5chj4GrI/AAAAAAAAFa4/4iXjuFROhEM/s1600/ADTWO21.png", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xIu_vEVR0kk/UZg5nOYZT1I/AAAAAAAAFbA/hHMk4kDRa_s/s1600/ADTWO26.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9UwmydIEW08/UZg5n1iSY7I/AAAAAAAAFbI/zBwbVivoG5E/s1600/DEPRESSIONTWO48.png", "http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--HSI2MzlAUM/UZg6BjquY1I/AAAAAAAAFbQ/4YnhcUrPDE4/s1600/68596_591434454214039_6675032_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-99vrv-O80GY/UZg6HRiRXVI/AAAAAAAAFbY/1PIq-bheSzY/s1600/408946_410799305653570_2038314749_n-1.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--4zbKaTn5rs/UZg6NWpN01I/AAAAAAAAFbg/hA_c-oOL1Mk/s1600/969612_454615264624910_341586752_n.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NZA0-j5M_AA/UZg6aJv7auI/AAAAAAAAFbo/C9gG0Ah81II/s1600/547276_10151610517229917_1622721120_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dQjlEtXu0kE/UZg6hK5MFAI/AAAAAAAAFbw/I19c_GBjbso/s1600/69094_409492055783478_739341328_n.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0l7cXXmT7gA/UZg7yN91fqI/AAAAAAAAFcA/Si-DpqsddnE/s1600/IMG_4279.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/05/having-failed-miserably.html", "title": "\nHaving failed miserably\n"},

{"date": "Monday, June 03, 2013", "body": "\nI got a big reminder today of something that had been faded into the background for a few years for us. A big reminder of something that should always be remembered.  \n \nToday, Joey started his day non-verbal. For a good twenty minutes, he was unable to speak.  \n \nIt was a little startling. I noticed he was quiet, but he had woken up grumpy, so I just thought maybe he had calmed down and was thinking or something. So I asked him how he was feeling. This question has become part of routine for us in the last couple of weeks, and it refers to a color chart associated with emotion; I was expecting a color word (red, yellow, green, blue). I was particularly interested in this particular zone system because color words are something Joey tends to retain, even when he has few words to use; and this has been so since he was very small. There were a few early months of speech when he would answer questions with colors- especially if he didn't understand the question.  \n \n\"How are you feeling?\" I asked again, realizing I had gotten no response, even though I was searching for his raincoat. I waited; processing can be a little delayed in the morning, especially a grumpy morning. I stopped searching. I looked at him. He was looking at me, his face slack, but his eyes... I remember that look. It was the one he used to give us when he came home from school, and was silent for 20-30 minutes because he was out of words. I blinked.  \n \n\"Are you in the blue zone, baby?\" I prompted, trying to feed him a word he could cling to and echo for me. Instead, he turned away, picked up his backpack, started playing with the door.  \n \nThis is a phenomenon we have trouble getting Joey's teachers and friends to really understand. I know Joey could speak ten minutes ago. However, he cannot do it right  now . Trying to force him is just going to overwhelm him. This can be true of any number of skills, but language is particularly crucial- and notable. He understood what I was saying, but he could not answer the question. He had no language for that. I still don't know why.  \n \nWith the raincoat MIA, we sat outside together, me clutching an umbrella, he with his head on my shoulder. Often in the morning, we chat together for these few minutes. I let him tell me anything he wants to say, ask me anything he wants to know. Sometimes we just script, sometimes we have real conversation, sometimes he wants me to read something, sometimes he wants to sing. It's all good. Today, we sat in silence. I didn't want to burden him with words. He nuzzled my shoulder, silent. It was the \"I love you\" script, just wordless.  \n \nWhen the bus came, I opened the umbrella, and out we walked together. Halfway, his words returned.  \n \n\"The rain is getting on me!\" I moved the umbrella, but the usual stream of script I would normally hear was absent. We reach the bus door, and as he climbed up the stairs, he called out, \"Thank you, Mommy!\"  \n \nYou'll be happy to know the rest of his school day was green.  \n \nSometimes, you just have to have some time to be silent and get that brain together. No problemo. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/06/starting-day-non-verbal-way.html", "title": "\nStarting the Day The Non-Verbal Way\n"},

My soil is better, so I have high hopes for mine. \n \nThen I went out into the yard this morning. The planting turned quickly into an emergency garden rescue. Virginia creeper has completely overrun everything, with its choking broadleaf cover and strangling vine.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 25, 2013", "body": "\nJoey was awesome last week in his Production Camp with  Stage Door Stars . He rocked it, they rocked it, the week was awesome and the play was fabulous. He was Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book. You  know  he rocked it.  \n \nSo he was totally excited this week to be in Dance Camp. After all, Joey loves to dance. \n \nNo, wait, let me type that properly: Joey  LURVS  to dance.  \n \nGet him up on stage and let him dance? Oh, yeah, he was all about it. The theater productions are so inclusive, and wonderful, and fun, we were very, very excited to be doing a dance routine. Joey was all grins. \n \nBetter yet, we got the awesome young man who was Joey's assigned aide last year as his dance camp aide. Huzzah! Mr. Dan rocks the house! I watched him beam all the way to the auditorium, and then dutifully left to let Joey do his Joey thing.  \n \nNeedless to say, I was confounded and saddened to be met at the door at five o'clock by the camp director and a person I believe was the special ed person for the camp, telling me Joey had refused to dance. He had been upset, refused to do anything, and finally they let him do some painting with his buddy in a break room. In fact, he had painted for a good half and hour. Did I mention that Joey isn't much into art projects? \n \nWe talked about making schedules and breaks and other stuff, and decided to just try again the next day. Today. I found out from another parent who had seen the initial issue that he seemed to think he had been teased, and that's where it all started. And I noticed as we were leaving that there was a little girl in the dance camp with whom Joey does not particularly get along. Hmm. \n \nI should be more specific about that. I noticed the little girl's mother. (And I should also note that these are very nice people, and the little girl is just fine, she and Joey just don't mix well).  \n \nHe wasn't so happy about it when I dropped him off, but I sent him in reinforced with a checkers set and a extra bottle of water. \n \nThe call came just before 3. Could I come get Joey? He was not participating and was being \"defiant.\" Cussing under my breath that people who work with special needs kids don't know the difference between a defiant child and a stressed out over-anxious child trying to communicate, I left Andy with Grandma and headed over to camp to see what the flying flip was going on. \n \nThey were awaiting me at the front desk, confused. They know Joey loves to dance. The dance teacher came over, and insisted Joey could do all these things, he was just refusing to, and there was just something about her attitude that made my ears prick and set off me \"doesn't get it\" radar. One thing we have learned is that people who work with special needs kids often don't really understand autism. They can work with a lot of other kinds of disabilities, and completely miss how to work with an autistic child.The very wordiness of her manner put me on guard. When I asked if we could teach him his routine for the show one-on-one, she said something about not being fair to the other students. Something was not right here. I decided it was time to ask Joey what was going on, and I wanted to do it while we were still in the building, to see if we could fix the breach.  \n \nHe was in an art room, pretending to drive a car and making rings out of pipecleaners \"to pay for treasure!\" He seemed actually pretty content, with his buddy, making stuff. I made some inquiries. They showed me a dance move- a Travolta-esque point, where he had to cross his body with his arm. Joey started getting upset when he saw it. I tried to get him to show it to me, but the cross-the-midline move was not helping whatever was wrong. Then the young lady from the dance class (not the dance teacher, but a helper-teacher) said something about \"popping\" her knee- ie, to bend it out in a quick motion. The word bothered Joey, and honestly I think it confused him. But I did get him to make the move, and asked if we could now learn the next one- perhaps I could help break it down and teach him. The dance teacher was called. \n \nShe came in, and said the next thing to do was a  pli\u00e9 . Now, if you have never had a dance class in your life like me,  this is what that is . Actually, if you go to that page, note that what they wanted was technically a \"demi-pli\u00e9.\" Anyhow, after the young lady explained it to me, and the teacher fussed about how she had told Joey what it was yesterday, and how awkward it was for me to do, I can understand why Joey might not be happy about this. What happened to fun stage-dancing and learning a little routine to enjoy being on the stage? Joey squealed that he would fall over, and the teacher said they had done it with a bar yesterday, and he could do it with a chair. Only she used a lot more words than that. I couldn't get her to be quiet while I tried to delve the mystery and perhaps give this a try. \n \nThen the next bomb dropped: Joey was going to be the star of the show, because he was the only boy, and the next dance move was going to be with a girl! \n \nOk, seriously? He's an eleven-year-old boy who has never had a lick of formal dance training in his life. So they sent him into a room full of girls, and then wanted him to dance with one, right away? But wait- it gets better. Because the class trooped in to do an art project for the stage set... almost a dozen young ladies, ranging from about eight to about fourteen,  and all wearing adorable little dance leotards and stockings . \n \nAnd they thought Joey would not feel something was amiss here? \n \nNobody mentioned to me that he should have special dance clothes. I am sure he was  not  expecting to walk into what, to him, looked like a ballerina school; and it is likely that those young ladies  did  find him amusing.  \n \nNaturally, Joey fled to the hall, and we had a chat. We talked about not having people laughing at you stop you from doing something you love. Then, we talked about being the only boy in the room, and that made him uncomfortable. Finally, we talked about art camp- perhaps he could do dance next year, and do art camp this year? \n \nBecause you know what? I wasn't going to force Joey to go back into a room full of giggling girls and try to learn to dance in front of them, when he was telling me he didn't like them watching him learn to dance. Especially when he was  telling  me so. As in, with  words . He was pulling together the words to express what he had been telling us for almost two days. I am so, so proud of him for being able to do that, and work it out between us and find those words:  I'm uncomfortable. They are laughing at me. I don't want girls watching me learn to dance . \n \nThe art class was working on Matisse collages- cutting out shapes and pasting them to paper. It was much more relaxed. We got Joey some orange paper (he's very into orange right now), scissors, and there was a box of markers. Cutting out the shapes directly made him anxious, so we let him draw some. I showed him how a random cut could look like something, l ike looking at clouds . Dan showed him that after you cut out a shape you've drawn, when you turn it over, its just a shape. We ended up with a masterwork: a bear with fruit, which Joey is calling \"The Bare Necessities.\" \n \nI can hardly wait for the art show on Friday.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stagedoorproductions.org/stage-door-stars.html", "http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/ballet-moves-demiplies.html", "http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/it-looked-like-spilt-milk-charles-g-shaw-iii/1100010292?ean=9780064431590"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-sovereign-child-and-change-of-plans.html", "title": "\nThe Sovereign Child and The Change of Plans\n"},

He is getting older, and I worry that each visit he makes to India- and each letter I get from him- may be his last. You know I would totally get a ticket and go, if I had the money. \n \nThe invitation included the boys. \n \nI read it, and re-read it, and turned it over. How much I wanted to be taking the boys to India now! The boys are old enough for the trip to really mean something to them, to be a watershed moment of their lives, for good or ill. But life has intervened on my plans. I am just now getting a full-time gig, and it isn't a permanent one (its a year-to-year contract- the new \"trend\" in academia). And then there are the boys' needs- Joey and heat don't mix well, and there is one thing India is- hot. Even in the coolest part of the year- which would them bring in the problem of crowds- it would be, for Joey, hot. Not to mention the new, the unexpecteed the unpredictability, and the shear overwhelming different-ness of India... \n \nBut I also know my friend has a child of his own, now grown, with special needs every bit as great as Joey's. I don't know if he has ever taken his child to India, but somehow, I suspect he has. \n \nAnd he invited my boys to go to India. What an opportunity, to have my boys be in India with my friend and I, and exploring India... \n \nSo I put it to them: would you like to go to India some day? Not today. Not this summer. But someday. And Joey came back without skipping a beat, \" Yes!\" \n \nAndy put in some rambling no-ness, which was distracting. Had I really heard Joey say he wanted to go to India? Did he understand what it meant? We talked about India being a different part of the world, a different country, and what travel might mean- a long airplane ride (my kids have never been on an airplane), a stop in London (they love their London Olympics video game, so I thought this might perk interest from Andy), and... the heat. \n \n\"Yes,\" Joey chimed in cheerily. \"I would like to go to India!\" \n \nThat's my boy. I know what I'm saving up for this year. And we may not go this year, or next. There are a lot of challenges to be met and considered. I know there will be challenges we won't think about until they appear before us. But Joey wants to go to India.

{"date": "Friday, July 05, 2013", "body": "\nWe returned to speech therapy today after a three-week hiatus. Last day of school was a half day, then Joey had two weeks of camp that interfered, and there was no day to do a make-up. The appointments went OK. Joey had a few minutes of not so good, but they both got done what they needed to get done, so we'll call it a win and see them next week. \n \nAs I was waiting for them, a gentleman came in to make an inquiry about his own appointments. As I have a hard time blocking out voices, I soon learned that he was deaf, and was there to help with his speech so he could better communicate with hearing people. I smiled politely as he turned from the window and sat down to await resolution of an issue, and he smiled back, and we returned to ourown activities. \n \nThen Andy came out, and his therapist told me he had done a great job. Out of habit, and as part of his praise, I signed to him, \"good job.\" The gentleman perked right up, and caught my eye; he asked if Andy was deaf. I felt a bit awkward, as I suddenly could not put together the signs to tell him that we use signs to support speech, but I did manage something (and fortunately, the gentleman was very good at reading lips, and could fill in for my not-so-great signing). I think I signed something to the effect of not-deaf-signs-learn-talk. Yeah, not a great performance, but I find it really hard to sign and speak at the same time- and the gentleman figured it out. \n \nThen Joey bobbed out. He realized I was signing, and the man was signing, and I said something like, \"Joey, this gentleman signs!\" and Joey was so excited! He turned and started a little conversation while his therapist tried to tell me what he worked on today. I know the gentleman asked Joey's name, and Joey asked his, and then there was something about orange- not sure if it was the fruit or the color. About halfway through, Joey turned and sang with great enthusiasm, \"he really can't hear me!\" and I managed to sign (and I am a terribly slow fingerspeller) that Joey is autistic, but I was pretty sure whatever Joey was signing to him probably seemed as random as Joey's conversation openers are to most everyone.  \n \nI will never be able to thank that gentleman enough for his patience with us. He was totally awesome. I am totally writing a note to take with us the next time we are up by the speech office to thank him, and let him know how happy he made Joey. \n \nJoey was so excited that he actually could  talk  with the man, even though the gentleman could not hear him. In fact, he was so excited, he talked about it all the way home. I might even take him over to the local Deaf club, which meets once a week (they welcome hearing people who are learning to sign to join them). If Joey can handle the social part, I think he would really like it now. \n \nEven Andy, who has been a bit put off by the signing lately, went over and seemed interested. \n \nI want that gentleman to know what he did for us, because we certainly know what it is like to be a \"teaching moment\" for others, and know it can be uncomfortable. And whether he was comfortable or not, I just think he ought to know he gave somebody some joy just by being himself, and being there. People need to know those things. And maybe the next time we see him, we'll have some more conversation. After all, that's how friendships start.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/07/good-signs.html", "title": "\nGood Signs\n"},

I've quite a collection now). We made our list of needfuls, got ourselves to the store, and proceeded to the adventuring. Joey was happy to pick out his own grapes, bananas, and apples for the week. He was excited to discover we were also shopping for Grandma, and he got to pick out her weekly treat (coconut danishes!) There was a train to watch for a while, and people to talk to, and the cart to push. \n \nHappy boy. \n \nBut also anxious boy. People to talk to means people everywhere, and not all of them are happy to talk. Some might bump into you. You might bump into them. The store has high ceilings and wide spaces. The lighting is odd, high and flickering, dimmer some places, brighter in others. The din of the people and carts and music is constant. You are surrounded by a new place, full of unexpected surprises. \n \nWhat better way to get through this than by singing and dancing, right? \n \nSo my boy and I sang \"Bare Necessities\" through the store, together. And sometimes, Joey did his Baloo dance. And when he started getting tired, he started making up sillier lyrics for the tune. I took the cue, got in line, and got us out of there, even though there were a few more things I wanted. Success for Joey- a pleasant trip to the grocery store- was far more important. \n \nSo I leave you with a new image- my boy and me, singing away as we thread through the supermarket aisles.

I think often people is just how much Joey relies on scripted language to get through, and think he speaks a lot better than he actually can; but it is still quite noticeable that he has trouble with language. \n \nSo the teacher thought it appropriate to send home a worksheet where Joey had to change \"Plain Jane\" sentences into \"fancy\" sentences. This would require Joey to make up his own language, based on a sentence given- a task that is, to be frank, impossible for him.

I watch. \n \nAnd I hold my breath. \n \nThere are several families at the corner, they are waiting for the school buses from the elementary and the upper elementary. Andy is on the upper elementary one, and Joey declared he is going to go pick up his brother today, just as Andy often used to \"pick him up\" by meeting Joey's bus as it stopped at our door. After all, Joey is the Big Brother, he reminds me. He's eleven years old, now, and has to take care of his Andy. \n \nHe wants me to stay on the porch. He wants to do this himself. He wants to go to the corner and play with the smaller kids waiting there for their big brothers and sisters, talk to the moms and dads. He wants to be himself, with other people, with his friends. \n \nSo I stay on the porch, and watch, ready. Triggers can be so small, so sudden. I cannot let my guard down, especially with him half a block down the street. I know the adults there know not to let him run, but I would not want the burden to be on them. And though I am ready, I am optimistic. If I didn't think he could do this, I wouldn't let him walk across that road, down that street, all by himself. In my heart, I know he won't run.

Joey was edgy, knowing he had an hour wait in front of him, echoing away with his script of math problems that made him giggle. We had been there a few minutes, but the coach wasn't there yet. Another little boy, much smaller than Andy, was running about in antsy frustration as well. They were like two peas in a pod, though Andy is always oldest (his birthday is a week after cutoff), and this boy was probably among the youngest. I let Andy run. It was better than the brittleness I knew was coming. I didn't have any snacks in the car, I hadn't made it to the grocery store. \n \nJoey did was Joey does, especially if he is uncomfortable and knows I am trying to work with Andy. He walked up to a complete stranger and started talking. \n \nThis stranger was soon barraged with math questions, liberally sprinkled with Joey's favorite, \"What is eight times zero?\" But Joey says it like this: \n \n(Giggling madly) \nWHAT is EIGHT times ZEEEEEEEEE-RRROOOOO? \n(More mad giggling) \n \nYep. That's scripting. And the answer, as you know, is Zero. Every. Single. Time. \n \nAndy started to break down. I couldn't break off to pull Joey to a chair. I could hear the patient answers, each question answered in a soft, factual voice, calm, as if this was an ordinary game one played with 9-year-olds you didn't know. \n \nAndy was on the ground. Done. Tears. I managed to get him to the car, a short distance, but far enough to make me cringe. Joey was still bolting, and could do it at any second. To let him out of my range, out of my sight, with a complete stranger. I was becoming overwhelmed myself. \n \nI ripped open the car, tore it up looking for something, anything. Crackers. There was a package of crackers. I coaxed Andy into eating one. And some water. It wasn't enough. He screamed, he hid behind a tree, he was totally out of his own control. Another cracker. Another sip. We might have to go home. \n \nHow many times do you think you could answer the question \"What is eight times zero?\" without starting to go a little kooky? A little batty?

Especially if you have a child who is also starting to show signs of frustration and boredom. \n \nThe coach arrived. The practice started. \n \nI never found how many times that gentleman would calmly, quietly, patiently answer math questions, liberally sprinkled with \"WHAT is EIGHT times ZEEEEEEE-RRROOOOOO?\" But I can tell you it is many, many times. And more than an hour. Because soccer practice lasts an hour, and he calmly, patiently answered Joey the whole time. \n \nHis name was Matt Wilkerson. His was the other child with the issues on the field. But he wasn't really aware of the extent of his child's issues yet, they were just figuring out something was up. He had an awesome wife and new baby twin girls. I got to meet them the next week. I got to hold those babies at a moment I so wished I was having another of my own. But more importantly, this was not yet a Special Needs Dad. \n \nHe was just a Dad. And he accepted my boys, immediately, patiently, without question. He laughed and was happy, answering math questions, listening to my child giggle hysterically over the words. And this became a regular ritual for Joey, when he would see Matt (though not for the whole practice). Patiently, calmly, Matt would give him those answers, as if this was normal conversation. \n \nHis wife is the same way. They were simply born part of the Tribe. Some people are just born Awesome. \n \n \n \nOn January 24, 2014, Matt was driving home early from work. He had a bad cold, one that had been spread in his house for the week before. He wanted to get home to his family, and take a rest, and get better. A car in front of him hit the jersey barrier at 75 MPH. That car flipped. \n \nIt landed on his. He was killed instantly. \n \nI don't think he ever knew what those practices, those calmly answered questions meant to us. I don't know how much he knew I considered his family to be part of my own, or if he did, he probably didn't really know what that means to us, either. I hope his wife and beautiful children know. \n \nWe miss you already, Matt.

Because he was responsive when they stopped him (across the parking lot!!!), so they decided it was a discipline issue, and were counting the day as OSS. Because it makes total sense to punish a kid for having a nervous breakdown, especially when you can't keep him safely in the building.  \n \nI think the light that shot from my hair follicles as I had my conniption fit could be seen in London. And that loud screaming that rang in your ears Wednesday afternoon? That was me.  \n \nThat was the easy part of the week. \n \nOur neuro, Dr. Rubenstein, is a very interesting gentleman who, I am convinced, thinks I am nuts. We managed to get moved up the appointment queue because of the incident a couple years ago, where Joey had a massive meltdown and was completely unresponsive (he was suspended that time, too). We were worried about seizures. Apparently, saying \"I'm worried about seizures\" moves you up the wait list.  The doctor was very good at listening , but when I got the report back, I suspected from the wording that he thought I was nuts. After all, the incident I was describing, with a thrashing, violent, screaming child who destroyed a classroom, seemed little connected with the happy, chatty guy he was seeing in front of him. We were sent home with a renewed prescription for Lexapro and another appointment in six months, by which time I was to send him all of the evals we had ever had done. \n \n \n \n This is not the face people expect from a severely depressed, seriously anxious child.  \n \n \n \nI digitized them, because sending them printed out would have taken a large priority mail box. And to be honest, we have less paper than many, many special needs parents I know. I then sent the whole mess as a CD. When we arrived, I have to admit being impressed again: he had meticulously gone through every single report, pulling out ones he thought significant, and asked me about them. He was very happy that we had been \"on top of things.\" Yet, there was that feeling of, \"but I still think you're nuts\" that I was getting from him. Oversensitive? Maybe. But... wait for it... \n \nHe decided Joey was in such good shape, we should work on helping him focus. We tried Adderall, but it didn't do anything but keep him up all night. We discontinued it, and decided to try something different after our next appointment.  That was the failed experiment in Ritalin, and the resulting four suspensions and other school disasters . After a series of emergency calls, he came off the Ritalin, was suspended four times during the withdrawl, and we now know that we can't work on focus. We have to get the anxiety under control first. We got an emergency prescription for Buspar, and by Christmas, we seemed headed to even keel. \n \nThen came the snow. They've missed two weeks of school. Joey is out of sorts. His depression and anxiety are through the roof. And now, spring is here, his regular freak-out time. Yay, us. So we got suspended for having a breakdown, and go to the neuro, and tell him our tale of woe. The cussing, the self-deprecation, the sudden anxiety attacks and death thoughts, the meltdowns, the school's reactions, the escapes. I encourage Joey to tell his side, and he starts in on kids calling him names, getting answers wrong the the tests... and the words we hear all the time start coming out of his mouth. It was just a little, a few \"I'm stupid\"s and \"I'm retarded\" and a couple of cusses, just mild ones, not the big ones. I got him calmed pretty fast. Then I turned to the doctor. \n \nHis face had changed. He was frowning. This is our fifth appointment, and he had been sometimes cold, but never frowned. He asked how long it took us to get to  Kennedy Krieger . He asked until he understood where our home was, and it took us two hours to get there, through two heavy traffic zones. That we got up at 4am to get to 8am appointments, mostly so we could avoid the traffic and not miss the appointments.  \n \nThen he hit us with why he was asking. \n \nHe was really upset about Joey's condition and deterioration. He realized we really did need help. He could finally see it: I'm not nuts. I'm desperate, and my child needs help.  Now . \n \nEver try to get a child who is both under 12 and autistic into a psychiatrist? We're on waiting lists. We've been on waiting lists. We're still waiting. The demand is extreme, and the supply dangerously low. Such is the state of our mental health system, getting appointments for under-12s is hard enough, but coupled with communication disabilities, near impossible. Behavioral therapy? No insurance covers that- IF you can find one. They consider it educational. The school's behavioral specialists? Joey was great when she was his teacher. That was four years ago. We're still trying to recoup skills he had when she was his teacher.  \n \nKennedy Krieger has these things, and can do intensive outpatient intervention(he feels Joey is not having the very severe violent behaviors that most of their inpatient participants have, and is concerned that Joey might copy violent behaviors, so that's out)- neurology, behavior therapies, psychiatric help, nutritional help- but it would be 4-5 days a week, for 8-10 weeks, and we're two hours away. He was frowning. He was upset that no one was helping us. He was concerned that we couldn't get to Kennedy Krieger for intensive intervention. He didn't understand. \n \n\"If you can help him, we will do it,\" I said. Because that is all there is to be said about that. We will figure it out. Will insurance help us? Will we find a place to live there for the program duration, so we can optimize Joey's productive hours, which tend to be morning? I have no clue. But if they can help him, we will do it. \n \nDr. Rubenstein is spending the next few days hammering out what the program will entail and what specialists he can bring in to help. I spent today looking into Medicaid and SSI, talking to Joey's private speech therapist, and trying to track down costs of rooms and sublets in the Baltimore area. Mom worked on hotel rooms and other possibilities.  \n \nHelp may be in our grasp. I'm not letting go.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLdo-b-4ceY/Uz90HLrMEaI/AAAAAAAAFuI/o7jMU-2KsAQ/s1600/1979598_10203685550277890_1291412435_n.jpg", "http://www.kennedykrieger.org/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-logistics-of-hope.html", "title": "\nThe Logistics of Hope\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, May 15, 2014", "body": "\nThere are some things in life that should be simple. Honestly, they should be  simple , because once you are desperate enough to want to do them, you need them done, like,  yesterday . There shouldn't be hoops to jump, long waits, strings of phone calls, more wrangling and begging and trying to get it to happen. You've already done all you can stand of that. If you thought you could stand more you wouldn't be... \n \nAsking for help. \n \nI get very angry about comments like, \"you should just ask for help!\" Or similar comments: \"Just call 911!\" \"Call a therapist/doctor/lawyer!\" \"Just get an advocate!\" \"Why don't you hire a lawyer/doctor/specialist?\" \"Why don't you have Medicare to pay for that?\" Then there are the clear judgements. \"That person should have [insert one of the previous comments here].\" \n \nIt really should be that simple. I so wish it was just that simple. A phone call, connect with the professional, get that help in here and get your loved one, your family, yourself much needed help. Desperately needed help. \n \nFirst, there is the stigma of asking for help. Ever listen to people talking about folks on \"welfare\"? Or how people refer to people with mental health issues? How about \"helicopter parents\"? The idea that people who ask for help are somehow weak, lazy, trying to steal or mooch, bitchy, even aggressive- this is the message society hands those who find themselves in a tight spot. It's your fault you are there. Suck it up. \n \nIf you are feeling that stigma,  don't believe it . Not one word of it. Not one little tiny piece or hint of guilt, or threat, or anxiety. Don't be fooled. Asking for help is a huge, monumental step in the  right  direction. And overcoming those feelings is just the first hurdle. The small, warm-up hurdle. The one you can do something about with the power of positive thinking and the realization that you need help, deserve help, and have the  right  to ask for help. \n \nNext hurdle: finding the help. \n \nEver try to track down a special needs attorney? Or a mental health specialist for a special needs child (or even adult)? Which specialist do you need? Who does what you need in your area? Does  anyone  do what you need? Are they any good at it, even if they are close at hand? Who do you call? \n \nConnecting with \"clearinghouses\" and resource information before you actually need it is a really great idea. Just found out your kid needs an IEP? Go to the parent center, the local disability resource center, get on Google, find those possible resources before you find yourself in the morass. Have the numbers at hand. If you have trouble finding them, start asking. Needling. Researching. By the time you are in a place where you need the help, you don't need the stress of not knowing where to turn. Trust me on this one. \n \nThird Hurdle: The Actual Call. \n \nSo you call the attorney's office. You get the receptionist. She's a gatekeeper. You may not even get through her, as she asks you several questions that are really none of her business, you want to discuss your answers with the damn attorney, not the receptionist,  that's why you are calling . Three receptionists later, you finally get told someone will call you back. \n \nThey never do. You call again. You start leaving a string of messages, like a crazed stalker, begging for the help you desperately need. Your messages become increasingly emotional, desperate, pleading. The meeting is a month away. Two weeks away. Next week.  The damn meeting is tomorrow, why won't you call me back and help me??? \n \nDon't even get me started on our local Project Lifesaver fiasco.\u00a0   Remember, Joey has escaped his school building six times this year. Not the classroom.  The building . \n \nSIX. TIMES.\u00a0  \n \nThen you call the doctor/therapist/specialist. You manage to get through the gatekeeper again, and have the callback game again. Finally, you get on the wait list... for six months from now. Then you have to call again, and re-sign-up onto the wait list. Some places, you go back to the bottom of the list. Some places forget you were ever on the list. Some places tell you they have no idea what list you are talking about. Sometimes you make an actual appointment six months out, to have it cancelled two weeks before. A week before. The day before. Oopsie, doctor/therapist/specialist is going to a conference that day. Their schedule changed and they no longer have appointments at that time. You go back to the bottom of the list, praying some other poor soul cancelled their precious appointment and you win the lottery for being called to take it. \n \nThere are some key words that might get you scooted up the list. I assure you that \"my child is suicidal and jumping out of moving vehicles\" is not among them. I think \"seizure\" might be one for the neurologist, because instead of being put on the six-month wait list, we got an appointment within two months, an actual, scheduled event that actually happened. It was amazing. However, since it appears to have not been a seizure, I still think he thinks I'm nuts. \n \nYep, hurdle four: you finally get to see your specialist, and you end up back at hurdle one: being judged a pushy, bitchy, crazy parent who just needs to pull up their big girl panties and deal. The lawyer tells you to \"stand your ground.\" The doctor gets all \"concerned\", but when you get the report, it says nothing about being referred to intensive intervention or that anything observed was in any way problematic, despite their apparent \"concern\" when you were standing in front of them. The therapist gives you some stuff to \"try at home\" or a list of \"recommendations\" that say nothing about them being actually necessary. You aren't even sure they are specifically relevant to your child.  \n \n \nIt's like they have no idea why you called. Or what you went through to get to the point where you felt the need.  \n \nLet's say you get over hurdle four. They agree to help, and actually start to do something. Now you have to pay for that. \n \nWelcome to hurdle 5. See, your medical insurance doesn't cover that therapy or service or doctor, because it is related to your kid's special needs. Or they consider it educational. Or you live in a state where they can basically exempt themselves from anything they want, despite having a doctor proclaim treatment is needed, effective, and available. The school won't pay for it, because it isn't through their people, or they consider it medical. I have no clue how anyone pays for a lawyer. I suppose if your case is super-blatant, they take you on contingency? Or you have wealthy relatives? Or a major bake sale? Take out a second mortgage, hoping you both win and get some cash to cover your costs in the settlement? What if, despite everything, you lose? How can you leave a child in what you know is an inappropriate, even dangerous, setting, even though the courts tell you it's just fine and all legal? \n \nI haven't even tried the social services debacle yet. I just have the stories of friends to consider. Calling in social services seems to be asking for trouble. I have friends who just decided to end SSI. They still qualify, but it was such a pain they couldn't deal with the stress of the paperwork anymore. They would get things their kids needed, be told it was ok, turn in the receipts, and be told that it actually wasn't OK and they had to pay back the money- which they used for this item that their kid really needed. All those stories of people living off their special needs kid's \"check\"? I have  no clue  how you would do that, since you have to justify every expense you use the money for. Besides, my friends were tired of being vilified for getting income to cover their kid's medical expenses. Remember, people on \"welfare\" are all \"welfare queens.\" People who need that money are reminded of that everywhere they turn. Welcome back to Hurdle One. \n \nThis is all the epitome of idiocy. A family needs help. They call for help. They should get that help. Immediately. Easily. Readily. Respectfully. Asking for help should not cost you your health or your dignity. You should not feel you might be paranoid, wondering if you are doing the right thing. Wondering if there was more you should have done before reaching out. You shouldn't have to beg, plead, and sell your first-born child to get it. \n \nBy the time you ask, you are already saying you are overwhelmed, stressed, and  need help . Adding to the stress isn't helping. Judging those who are trying not to drown in deep water by asking why they don't just swim isn't helping. Tossing a rope that is too short for the drowning person to reach isn't helping.  \n \nIt should be so simple. It needs to be simple. Why can't we just make it simple?  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/05/just-do-this.html", "title": "\nJust do this!\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, August 24, 2014", "body": "\nGood news: Joey's school is officially licensed! He is set to start and is in the transition camp now! Can I get a \"woo-hoo\"? \n \nJoey is going to  Stafford Academy , and we are hoping for it to be as awesome, wonderful, supportive, and miraculous as he needs it to be. We have lost a lot of time, and there has been a lot of damage from leaving him in schools that just would not do what he needed them to do: provide an autism-specific classroom with trained autism professionals, and pull out to the mainstream classrooms as he was able to deal with those broader environments. They are doing it right behind us- but that doesn't help us. Now we need  MORE  support, not less. We have slid back into more and more restrictive environments, but not ones that included, all the time, people trained to deal with autism. \n \nWe have learned the hard way that autism is not like  ANY  other disability when it comes to learning. The uniqueness of the needs, the difference in motivations/reasons for behavior, the needed differences in responding to those needs and behaviors- they are so different from how you address these issues, that putting them in a room with kids with, say, emotional disturbance issues, causes huge problems. Massive, catastrophic anxiety and depression, specifically. \n \nWhat we also learned- mostly from experience, but also from talking with our friends have actually had to go through these environments and therapies themselves- is that ABA isn't all that and a bucket of crackers. It's a tool (a key tool in working with kids who need to have tasks broken down and \"chained\" by practicing each part), but it can't be the only one in your box. Sending him to an \"ABA school\" without a lot of other supports, such as the psychological supports we can't seem to get for love or money, doesn't work well. Our disappointment in the Kennedy Krieger program cannot be overstated. \n \nStafford Academy is not an ABA school. It is an approach that immerses the kids in occupational therapy methods and interventions, addressing needs for sensory integration, stress management, movement (lots of movement!), and social thinking/skills. It will use  Social Thinking  in its curriculum, which you all know I love. Using lots of tools in the toolbox, the school provides a entire environment to meet the needs of autistic kids, with small classes so the environment can be individualized and effective for each child. They will be spending time out in the community, and as the kids become ready, they will hook up with local homeschooling groups for learning, community projects, and outings. \n \nSound awesome? We are hoping it will be. We are going to work hard to make it awesome. Joey needs it to be awesome. We want him to learn how to be happy again- not just in passing, but in his core. \n \n \n Meanwhile... \n \nOur other big news is Andy is coming home. He has been having trouble with bullying at school for years now, but we had no idea how bad it was. He is so emotionally brittle, and teachers are so not trained to deal with sensory issues that lead to being emotionally brittle, that I believe now the school adults were ignoring the signs of severe bullying- to the point Andy was learning to defend himself from these kids by bullying back. Not what we need. \n \nI spoke to some other parents, and their kids, who were better able to communicate about the situation. One family actually moved out of the city, a decision they partly based on the serious situation in the classroom that no one would address. Apparently, if adults don't see bullying, they don't address it or even believe it is really happening. In a school. How long have these teachers been on planet Earth? Anyway, the reports from these families were far more dire than just knocking things off Andy's desk and a few threats on the bus. There was serious emotional abuse occurring, threats of violence (including sexual violence), racial targeting (we knew about that- Andy was really upset and confused by it), and a lot of things going on \"under the adult radar\" because it was not just jumping kids on the playground and covering them in bruises. Though we also had some of that going on. \n \nOn top of that, not understanding Andy's disability leads to bullying from the adults, both actual and perceived. This past year was particularly harsh in that regard, and the result is a child who loved books who doesn't now want to touch them. We've had a slide back in wanting to write and communicate. He has, in short, not only a lack of interest in learning, but an actual loathing of anything he views \"educational.\" Say \"learn\" around my child, and you get a scowl. If you can get something from him about it, you are likely to hear the word \"worksheets\" and \"stupid.\" \n \nAndy has enough stress in his life, to be honest. Being Joey's family takes a lot of work and emotional energy, but it also takes physical energy. School needs to be a supportive, safe environment. He wasn't getting it in this school system. \n \nI have already been doing experiments in his learning style, interests, and ideas. I've been working on putting together my toolbox. We have been deschooling, a process I hope to be through by Christmas. We are now, officially, a homeschooling family. \n \nTalk about being someplace you never dreamed of being. \n \nWish us luck.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.staffordacademyva.com/", "http://www.socialthinking.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/08/big-changes.html", "title": "\nBig Changes\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, May 09, 2015", "body": "\nWell, 9 years ago today, Life With Joey was presented to the world. How far have we come? \n \nNine years ago, Joey was four years old. \n \n \n \n \nHe had about 30 words he could regularly access. He loved his Bus- the one he carried with him so constantly, when he once put it down accidentally at Wakefield, we back-trekked the whole way around the walking trail until we found it, because it was Bus. \n \nWe were just learning that we were Joey's sole real advocate. We were just starting to butt our heads against school staff and school politics. Other people were helpful, offered advice, mentioned some things that might help, but they all had other kids and other jobs and other things to worry about. We have Joey and Andy, and that's all we worry about. If what they need is good for other people, too, yay. But nine years ago, we were still trying to work to get everybody what they needed. We learned- Joey and Andy first. Otherwise, we get left in the cold. They get left in the cold. \n \nWe were just starting to realize that Joey would likely need an aide to be in a regular classroom environment. Unfortunately, it took him running out the door from stress and anxiety before we could get one... six years later. \n \nJoey loved Pinky Dinky Doo, Oobi, and Little Bear. He loved  Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type . He loved to sing  Waltzing Matilda . \n \nWell, some things don't change, eh? Only now we sing  Let It Go  instead of  Waltzing Matilda . \n \n I hope you've been enjoying the ride with us so far. I know there are longer gaps now, but getting older means there aren't so many of those small triumphs and quick cuteness, and often what I find worth writing about, Joey and Andy don't want shared. That's OK. This is their lives, too. \n \nToday, I have a teenager and a preteen. Joey may still like Little Bear, but he also likes Mario, and video games, and riding his scooter. Andy is into the Avengers. They like to hang out with their friends, but they also still like bedtime books. Neither is still in public school*. Nine years ago, Andy hadn't even started school! \n \nJoey is better at conversation, but has a unique way of using language that can still cause communication issues. He loses communication skills when he gets upset, anxious, and stressed- good or bad stress. Frustration and anxiety are still our dire enemies, to be battled daily. Sometimes we win. Sometimes we don't. \n \nI have appreciation for Signing Time, Social Thinking, and Zones of Regulation. We are still discovering new methods to work with, new interventions and coping skills to try, new angles for accessing skills even in crisis. \n \nWith these tools, Joey now can- and does- run his own snack cart business at school. \n \nThat is how far we have come. \n \n \nWhere did the time go? \n \n \n \n \n \n*Technically, Joey is in public school, but is in a private placement paid for by the school. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KzziJ2csNMQ/VU7Ttasa-uI/AAAAAAAAF_k/9fiZ_J7dIuQ/s1600/IMG_0702.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vWCaZoipIJA/VU7UElKFD3I/AAAAAAAAF_0/rWYbLF1Ai3Q/s1600/IMG_3661.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-twsjCO9AOfU/VU7TtUgR6DI/AAAAAAAAF_o/tQH_wuyu6SQ/s1600/IMG_0656.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2015/05/happy-blogiversary-to-me.html", "title": "\nHappy Blogiversary to Me!\n"},

This has been a bit of a crazy summer, and jam-packed with boy adventures. \n \n \n \n Off on summer adventures! \n \nSummer is always an odd time for us. Joey's schedule is different. While having a schedule at all is always good, the ups and downs of things being different remains. We have a new teacher this summer, and we originally were told he would definitely be Joey's teacher in the fall; now he has been offered a contract with the regular school system, so we don't know- we have to wait and see what the new teacher decides to do. Will we have yet another transition? How far will Joey be set back if we do? \n \nSo the best thing is to fill what we can with other activities, and keep him busy and thinking. It is a battle- Joey versus Anxiety, and we want Joey to win. \n \n \n \n Secret Agent Boys. Not so secret, actually.\u00a0 \n \nOur arsenal is not without tools and weapons against the foe: after all, we have The Pool. Joining a local private pool has been a really good investment for us. Yes, there are some people there who really need some education, but most of the folks now know Joey, so at least they aren't blindsided by him. \n \nIt is a great way to keep cool, get in lots of exercise, and have lots of fun. Most years the boys have kind of done their own thing in the pool unless they were the only ones there (which happens a bit when you're in a small, private pool)- but this year, they have stuck close to each other. This is not always a good thing, as like all siblings, they also get on each other's nerves. But for the better part, we have brothers finding ways to connect and play together. \n \n \n \n Bumper cars! \n \n \n \n Shy Guy wins the race on the Standard Car. \n \nA new tool in our bag is  Funland , a local arcade and amusement park. It includes video games, claw machines, those things where you push the coins along the levels (my dad used to ROCK at those), and some rides. I think they also have mini-golf. Some years ago, when we first tried it, disaster ensued- too loud, too flashy, too everything. We stuck to our beloved Chuck E Cheese (which, you should know, serves beer). However, there are not a lot of teenagers who hang out at the House of Mouse- so we eased our way into another go at the bigger, noisier, crazier step up in the world. \n \nThe lure was bumper cars and go-karts. Joey's love of  Mario  won at last. \n \nJoey also had his beloved theater camp. The last couple of years were not a huge success, with the changes in the staff and the issues with dance camps and art camps and Joey's anxiety. This year, the program we had been participating in more than doubled the price, so we were disappointed to have to skip... until we found that the lady who ran the other program before all the mess had started a new program. Better yet, she had secured funding so that all the campers were able to participate for  free . \n \n \n Boy in his Element \n \n \nJoy ensued. \n \nJoey was back on stage, in a great Sea Adventure! \n \n \nHe did sea creature dances, and made his very own Koopa Troopa costume (OK, it was sea turtle costume... but now that the play is over, it is back to Mario!), and enjoyed himself thoroughly. A big thank you to  STEP-VA  and Ms. Monroe, for giving Joey an anxiety break for a week. He needed the breath of air. \n \n \n \n Proud Boy. Proud Dad.\u00a0 \n \nAndy also had a camp, so we had some adventures that were just Joey and Mom. I don't get a lot of Joey Time now- school, school, school, all the time. His favorite adventure was going to the pet store, where he could check out the kitties for adoption (and beg for one), look at the fish, and check out the small pets (you know... mice. Guinea pigs. SNAKES.) \n \n \n He named it \"Slippy.\" We did NOT take it home.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Taking photos on the ipod.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Hi, Fish! \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0We also took a trip out to see Allan's family in Tennessee. Long drives are always an adventure, but the treat at the end of the road was well worth it. \n \n \n Hi, Aunt Emily! \n \n \n \n We had the biggest sparklers we have ever seen.\u00a0 \n \nWe spent a good bit of time hanging out with Granny Ann, which mostly consisted of playing Wii, petting Granny Ann's cats, and setting off fireworks that are illegal in Virginia. They were pretty cool. \n \n \n \n Showing Granny Ann how to shoot tanks. \n \n \n \n \nJoey has decided Allan grew up in a mansion. I think he enjoyed himself.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd so the summer is moving along, with school days, pool days, and new headgear. The beach isn't happening until September this year, so we have plenty of lazy days ahead. More adventures to be had, more world to explore, and more Minecraft to build. \n \nAh, the life of a Boy. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0J0qqKsvErE/VbMCFpx7f_I/AAAAAAAAGF4/hq4eWmAD1sY/s1600/IMG_4954.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PTzzp9BQo_Q/VbMC-Y2RoCI/AAAAAAAAGGA/6g69OLbwhgI/s1600/IMG_5001.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ydyrdq3rp04/VbMD5zmv4GI/AAAAAAAAGGQ/TT2CaRXPw20/s1600/IMG_5345.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LFLNistRN7k/VbMF5JsA1GI/AAAAAAAAGGc/mJDA3Q23ExA/s1600/IMG_5466.jpg", "http://www.centralparkfun-land.com/", "http://mariokart8.nintendo.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FroVFHVNhf8/VbMHN4gjaTI/AAAAAAAAGGo/XUUuAX5Wlsw/s1600/IMG_6141.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8fA0DXLC9gs/VbMIHuJYxSI/AAAAAAAAGGw/0HmJs9CSm44/s1600/11753283_10207436217042215_8370162511754096089_n.jpg", "http://www.stepva.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ozAKSkpT-Oc/VbMJRHLxULI/AAAAAAAAGG8/xlpQFpCaRQ0/s1600/IMG_6121.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vak5Uyr5j94/VbMJyNH6L3I/AAAAAAAAGHE/59hjWlvp3es/s1600/IMG_5386.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jkda3mTVHmY/VbMJ1qvQmKI/AAAAAAAAGHM/-D3LPUruCMM/s1600/IMG_5378.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UHcDXNEDYgU/VbMJ6MYPmVI/AAAAAAAAGHU/GRA3PYa6DgU/s1600/IMG_5385.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-guoM91CB85Y/VbMKcIsR-JI/AAAAAAAAGHc/x2TiWTcyrus/s1600/IMG_5670.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CNII1F1HLFg/VbMKyt5DkOI/AAAAAAAAGHk/ts52a6C7EEk/s1600/IMG_5806.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CQsg4_Nww98/VbMK2RBs1HI/AAAAAAAAGHs/E537d63s9Rw/s1600/IMG_5788.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xWxHJCClOqw/VbMLXa3b2zI/AAAAAAAAGH4/aQYNBY4w2mc/s1600/IMG_5900.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-syPKG_69CGE/VbMME8Hs2wI/AAAAAAAAGIA/YoJez-YV9S0/s1600/IMG_5352.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2015/07/summer.html", "title": "\nSummer\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 17, 2015", "body": "\n \nToday is Ivy Day at Smith College, my alma mater. Yep, that one on the right? That's me... 22 years ago.\u00a0 \n \n Want to hear something else funny? That dress was a size 18. I had difficulty finding it, because walking into a store and finding clothes in a size 18 was almost unheard-of 22 years ago. I loved LL Bean clothes, because they came up to a 20.\u00a0 \n \nYes, my friends, when people fuss about people being 280 pounds, that is what 280 pounds looks like. That is what we consider \"fat\" in this country. \n \n \n \nI dream of being a size 20 now. An 18 seems out of the question.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI should note some other things in this little throwback. I had known the man who would be my husband about 8 months by this point- the beginning of the fall semester. I had never seen him. We played an online game together, but they were text-based then (I know, so quaint now, but it was awesome- like a living book, being written right in front of you! And you were IN it, and helping WRITE it! I wish people still played those.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI was excited to start a new life in Wisconsin. How much colder could it be than New England? (Answer: A WHOLE LOT.) \n \n \n \n I was an odd duck in college, but not as much as I was in high school. Most of the folks around me were also odd ducks, which means, of course, they were powerful, awesome people who continue to be powerful, awesome people. I always think about all those awesome people, those women I went through college with, and am astounded that I ever knew them. 22 years later, these women run businesses, schools, libraries, laboratories, political offices. They are not just doctors, lawyers, scientists, writers, artists, teachers- they are among the BEST doctors, lawyers, scientists, writers, artists, and teachers in the world.\u00a0 \n \nMy life isn't exactly what I thought it would be. I had dreams of roaming around India, writing books about religious practices and history. I did manage to get to India, just not as long or often as I dreamed. I spend most of my days talking about art and culture, but not very often about the art and culture of India.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMost importantly, I have my beautiful family. It isn't the family I imagined, but the amazing, wonderful, beautiful roller-coaster of truth is harder, wilder, more vibrant, and more magical and amazing than I could have ever imagined. \n \n \n \nRight now, my son is \"forcing\" my husband to eat chocolates. They are both roaring with laughter. And hugs. And wonderfulness.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI will say, I couldn't do what I do if I hadn't had the education and training I got, the friends I have (who are marvelously understanding), the skills I gained at Smith. I hate to think what would have happened to my kids if I didn't have those skills. The true value of a liberal arts education? You can go out and train yourself to deal with anything. You know how to learn. \n \n \n \nHappy Ivy Day to all the new alumnae, and all my friends who shared in the wild years. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J7fPXbxGskM/VVfiwtedu8I/AAAAAAAAGAc/5R6XazUIA6s/s1600/185186_4172330825172_1264825894_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vfiVC07xSvU/VVfkLA6CEkI/AAAAAAAAGAo/0m15X-XMvLQ/s1600/542319_4172328985126_28917915_n.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2015/05/climbing-ivy.html", "title": "\nClimbing the Ivy\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, May 23, 2015", "body": "\nJoey has a lot of difficulty processing the whole idea of death. Already a tough subject for young people, this can be extremely daunting for Joey in understanding that life ends, and there is a permanence in death that he just cannot wrap his brain around. It becomes a huge anxiety trigger. \n \nHappy Memorial Day. \n \n This is the 20th year of the  Luminaria  at  Marye's Heights . I feel it is important for my boys to understand that freedom is not free. People die for their country, their families, their ideas. History isn't all cool houses, quaint costumes... and weaponry is not just cool toys. \n \nWars are real. And they effect everyone. \n \n I had Allan drive us closer to the battlefield to save our energy for climbing the hill. It was a great plan. We made it up just fine. Joey was being Shy Guy for most of the walk to the gate; andAndy wanted to look at more of the plaques about the battle, and the  Kirkland Memorial . Anxiety rose as we neared the gate, where the crowd was bottlenecked to enter the cemetery. We got through, and headed up. I was steady talking about what Memorial Day is, and then the Battle of Fredericksburg. We talked about the union soldiers likely reaching our back yard, but only about a block or two closer to the Heights. We talked about Gettysburg. We talked about how the site became a cemetery for soldier who died in the battle, with some burials for later wars. They liked the paper bags and the pretty lit walkways, and Andy wanted to know why some of the headstones were smaller than others, and what the number on the tops meant. We talked about each grave having 2 lights, because often  more than one soldier was interred there , and it wasn't always known who was buried where. \n \nThen we reached the top, and both audibly gasped. \n \nThere are over 15,000 soldiers buried at Marye's Heights. \n \nJoey understands that cemeteries are solemn places, and that when you see a sea of lights marking graves, he is supposed to feel sad. Confronted with that sea of sacrifice, he was sad. So we then talked a while about what he was seeing, and why it was important. Yes, it is sad. But it also important to remember, and respect, and think about what others do to keep you safe, free, and able to enjoy all the things of life. These were people who sacrificed their lives for their country. For all of us. \n \n \u00a0We also talked a bit about the Civil War, and why people were fighting. Andy observed that thinking people are less than human just because their skin is a different color is plain stupid. I must admit, I totally agree with him. \n \nHe wandered about the graves, looking at the different stones, the names, the numbers. He was upset when the light failed and he couldn't read the names anymore. As he said: \"These are real people. We should know their names.\" I think he was bit sad that we didn't know all the names. Only 2,473 of the soldiers buried at Marye's Heights are identified in marked graves. \n \nWe had to step aside to let the bugler through, and he played a lovely rendition of  taps . Both boys managed to stay silent through it. Yes, even Joey. We talked about that silence as a show of respect. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe walked home, two boys quieter than they were coming in.

{"date": "Monday, September 15, 2014", "body": "\nI did a little experiment this week. I commented on a story about Kelli Stapleton. For those who don't follow news, Kelli Stapleton attempted a murder-suicide of herself and her 14-year-old autistic daughter, Issy. She was well-known in the parenting circles, and a friend to many people I know. Like many such stories, this one has gathered a very specific rhetoric, the \"for Kelli\" crowd and the \"anti Kelli\" crowd. That rhetoric has become so strong and loud, it has drowned out any other ideas or voices, and everyone is expected to pick a side and then be torn to shreds by the other. \n \nIt isn't a very useful conversation. \n \nMurder is not acceptable. Attempted murder is just murder that fortunately wasn't successful, so as far as I am concerned for these situations, the same thing. Murder was the intent. You don't kill people. I don't really care what excuses you try to give for that as a defense. It isn't one. The fact that I even have to say this shows how loud and strong this \"for Kelli/anti Kelli\" rhetoric has become. \n \nWhat I found interesting in my experiment is the complete lack of interest in talking about the broader issues, about anything constructive, or about Issy. Every time, the conversation was turned back to \"Kelli bad!\" or \"You're making excuses for Kelli!\" I don't want to talk about Kelli at all. Plenty of people are already doing that. \n \nI want to talk about Issy. \n \nThe subnote to the \"for Kelli\" contingent is often a call for \"services for the family\" and \"support for the family.\" This often seems to be mistaken by the anti Kelli contingent as \"support for the parents,\" when it appears what is meant is something more generalized as services. \n \nSupport is actually more than just services. Support is about acceptance, community, and feeling loved and welcome. That is what is needed. \n \nHowever, what I suggested- and was choked out by the rhetoric- was that we don't need this primarily for the family, and not having it for the family is not an excuse to murder anyone. The person who needs support is the person with the disability. Issy needed that support. She needs that support. She didn't get it. \n \nAll too often, persons in our communities who are different, who have disabilities, don't get that support. You send them off to whatever is available for as long as you can afford, and hope. There is little mechanism for intervening and advocating for them if that is needed to keep them safe. Not just the Stapletons, people- in general. We need to talk about getting people help. \n \nGetting that support in place, and in the community, is constructive and supportive long before we get to murdering them. Reduce the exposure of vulnerable people to abuse, violence, and murder, and you might find fewer are victims of abuse, violence, and murder. Reduce their frustration and help them learn and grow, treat them with respect, and you might find less frustration and instability in the first place, all around. Give the support, and the world becomes manageable. \n \nPut the focus on the people who really need the help and support, and the other issues fade back. Improve the lives of people who need a little extra care and service, and their lives actually improve. It's an amazing thing. \n \nBut no one wants to talk about it. \n \nAnd lest you think the static is just in the Stapleton case, check out the other cases in the news. If you want to see extremes in making excuses, check the case of the murder of Jude Mirra. Check out the rhetoric in the murder of Robbie Robinson (you have to search his mother's name, Angie Robinson, to find the stories... how sad is that?) Look at the story of Randle Barrow. Think of Alex Spourdalakis. These are just cases involving autism- but autistic people are not alone in this, they are not the only people being murdered, and their disability blamed. Where were the communities? The advocates? The interventions? The understanding? Read the way the articles are written- they feed into the pro-murderer/anti-murderer rhetoric. The murdered people are often barely mentioned, their full names subsumed under that of their killer. \n \nSupport isn't just services- there needs to be an entire social mountain moved. \n \nWe need to think about how we support people and think about each other. We need to learn what acceptance really is. We need to start with ourselves, because you can control the way you think, you can take responsibility for yourself. As we tell our kids and ourselves all the time: your are responsible for your body and your words. Learn how. Start now.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-elephant-in-room.html", "title": "\nThe Elephant in Room\n"},

{"date": "Friday, September 12, 2014", "body": "\nWe have two new fur babies. Joey has been  so  excited about getting his very own cat, especially in the throes of still missing Luna. We finally brought them home. \n \n \n \n This is Joey's kitty, Lily. She looks suspiciously like Luna. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This is Andy's kitty, Marshmallow. She is totally not shy. At. All. And she approves of the changes in her fortunes.\u00a0 \n \nAt long last, we found our kitties, and Joey was looking forward to seeing her home safe when he came home from school. Andy and I picked them up from the shelter, and took them directly to our vet (do not pass Go, do not collect $200), and had our vet look them over top to tail. Lily was very good, letting her nails be clipped and the vet handle her. She got a clean bill, though she had some tartar on her teeth that we removed. Marshmallow had evidence of an earmite problem, but no mites. Her ears had not been properly cleaned from it, however, so she has a little yeast in the ear folds, very uncomfy. Our vet cleaned them really well, and treated them so the yeast will go away. Neither had any sign of fleas. Then we gave them both a monthly Bug Treatment (fleas, heartworm, mites, etc all covered by the treatment), just in case and just because its a good idea, and home we went to introduce them to Ellora. \n \nMarshmallow has proven a bold beauty, looking over the house and already interacting with her new people. The only thing she's not totally approved of is the food, because hey, she's a cat. Fancy Feast just ain't fancy enough for her (or familiar enough for her). She jumps up and says hello, and has been very interested in Ellora. \n \nEllora wants Nothing To Do With Her. She comes over and stares at me, with the look of, \"Mom, what did you  do ? There are whipper-snappers in my HOUSE!\" I believe she is plotting my demise. \n \nSo Joey came home to Marshmallow out and about. But where was his Lily? \n \nWe found her. She has found a little space under a kitchen cabinet, and has tucked herself in there. The shelter said it took her a couple of days to calm down there. We expect the same here, if not a little longer. Everything new, her world torn up again. She was a turn-in; a family deliberately gave her up. The papers said she \"didn't get along with the other cats.\" It also said she was in a house with five other cats and three dogs. The shelter had no problems with her and other cats, but noticed she hates loud and sudden noises- so we suspect she was terrified of the dogs. No wonder she's anxious. This is her third home, and she is smart to be wary. She's overwhelmed by the changes. \n \nJoey was bitterly disappointed. He wanted to be able to pet his cat, and feed her, and show how well he could take care of her. He began to perseverate, to spiral into the abyss of disappointment and grief. All afternoon, he was so sad. At first we couldn't find her at all, then we found her tucked under the cabinet. I got her to nibble some food for me, but otherwise, she was not ready to come out to say hello. Joey was devastated. He sat downstairs, trying to coax her out. He managed to get her out for a few minutes by tempting her with treats, but then she ran back to her hole. He was beside himself, thinking he was doing something wrong. We kept assuring him that she would come out, he just needed to give her time. We tried to get him to think about how he felt when he was upset and scared, and get him to understand the cat was feeling this way. He wasn't buying it. \n \nWe finally got him calmed down enough to get him settled into his room for bed. I came out a little later to check on him. He was in his bed, reading his dictionary, surrounded by his stuffed Mario and Frozen characters. \n \n\"Are you OK?\" I asked, and he returned the standard \"um-hm\" of \"I know you want an answer but I don't want to deal with you.\" \n\"Do you want me to sit with you a while?\" I offered, as this is sometimes something he likes when upset. \n\"No, I need my alone time.\" \n\"Oh,\" I nodded, giving him a smile. \"Well, I just want you to know what a good job you are doing, taking care of Lily. Sometimes, taking care of her means leaving her alone for a little while.\" \n\"Like me telling you I want my alone time?\" he brightened. \n \"Exactly.\" \n \n By George, I think he's got it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-33FfX5ny6Iw/VBO0bwP5YAI/AAAAAAAAF0I/g7zZgzjfxW0/s1600/10469211_10204930090790625_7387920725984624046_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZI5H73UiMPU/VBO0b9T2a6I/AAAAAAAAF0E/2S90R7ykQnc/s1600/10635776_10204931968717572_6385101587001734477_n.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/09/empathy.html", "title": "\nEmpathy\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, December 10, 2014", "body": "\nWhen Joey was little, he came up with phrases that made him feel happy. Very often, by the time he started repeating them, the words were lost in a pool of sound, but they made him feel better, even cracked him up. It has been a while since we have heard one of these happy scripts, where he would repeat it just for the feel of the words in his mouth, and giggle hysterically. \n \nToday, we have two. \n \n\"Steal Olaf's nose and feed it to Sven!\" he chimed at me this morning. This was a vast improvement from yesterday, when he woke up grumpy and let me have it double-barreled from the get-go. The hysterics followed. I can still hear the fuzzy edges of the words, a sort of stuffy sound that I now recognize as the apraxia- but also a cue that the meaning of the words don't matter. It's the sound, the cadence of the words, the sharp rhythm that entertains him. The words no longer go to mush; this is a  Frozen  reference. Where the exact phrase came from, I don't know; always before, these phrases are ones he had heard, and became enchanted with the sounds. Certainly, it is a script, but the source this exact line is lost to me. Part of me hopes he has made it up himself, heard it in his head. \n \nScripting has become a problem most of the time- both of word and action. Stealing items as a \"joke.\" Repeating \"grounded\" over and over- referring to punishments. Negativity, self-denigration, and depression have been a running theme. Profane language has become commonplace, and trying to correct it, vain. When I hear about police using force against people simply because the people used bad language towards them, my stomach does somersaults of fear. He bolted form the house twice this past week- what if a police officer had found him in that state? \n \nI welcome the return of soundification. To celebrate, I turned on  Frozen  for him this afternoon. Then I gleefully listed to him soundify and giggle for an hour. \n \nMusic.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 21, 2014", "body": "\nWell, here it is, October. The seasons change, the light slants through the sky at different angle, the air chills, the leaves fall, and Joey goes bazonkers. I am pretty sure the season change is part of the problem for him, because we have the same thing happen in the spring. When Joey gets off-kilter with the change of season, he can't help it. He feels it, and his frustration goes up, he goes into severe silly moods, the swings of mood can be dramatic. He doesn't like it any more than anybody else, but he also has no where to go with it. \n \nAdd onto that puberty. Then, a new school, and problems with regulation associated with change and increased academic demands. Plus, now that we think he is starting to trust the people around him, he is starting to try to process and express a lot of feelings, frustrations, and experiences for which he has no words. Yeah, I think you might go a little nutty, too. \n \nThis is the moment that tries a school's soul. For the last few years, that soul has come up wanting. And when the school comes up wanting, it is not longer a safe space- and the spiral goes rapidly into the vortex from there. When he starts acting out and expressing fear and anger from years of bullying, frustration, and difficulty communicating, how do you respond? Do you lecture him, suspend him from class, punish him? Most school settings do. What have you taught him when you react in a way that is punishing, negative, hard, cold? \n \nThat he can't trust you. He can't rely on your help, because you aren't going to help. You are going to punish, and just expect him to swallow all that horrible down. He learns you want him to shut up and go away. \n \nWe had our first blow up at school. What was the attitude of the new school? \n \nLet's make sure he is safe. Let's give him ways to tell us what he needs. Let's make sure he has space to calm down, decompress, de-escalate. Let's teach him some new coping mechanisms. Let's find out what he is feeling, and help him express it. Let's hire some psychiatric help so he gets some support and therapy for what he is experiencing and feeling. \n \nNo panic. No suspension. No \"he's got to have negative consequences for this!\" No \"I have to keep my staff safe!\" with the implication of, \"your kid is dangerous!\" They shifted the positive reinforcement back to shorter time expectations, to give him time and support to learn new strategies, process, and re-adjust. The gave him time to calm down, then engaged him in a discussion of what choices would be good choices when he is feeling overwhelmed, scared, sad, confused, or even super-silly. We talked about things he finds calming, and how to make sure he has access to things like pictures of his cats, squish balls, and favorite games. \n \nHow's that for a whole new world? \n \nAnd the result? He came home happy as a clam, saying he had a good day at school, and talking about Mom visiting and playing games with his classmate and teachers. He's still happy to go back to school and give it another try, every morning. Today wasn't a good day, but tomorrow is a new day. \n \nHe still feels safe and loved. That is the attitude he needs to succeed.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/10/attitude.html", "title": "\nAttitude\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 08, 2014", "body": "\nIt's been a weird summer. \n \nRemember back  once upon a time when we were going spend our summer in Baltimore getting Joey all this wonderful help and therapy at Kennedy Krieger ? It sounded so awesome. 8-10 weeks, and they would help him. We'd get some of the damage from the anxiety and depression mitigated. We were scrambling to figure out how to pay for it, where to stay, how to make it work. We sent back paperwork and held our breath. \n \nWe got the call back much later than we were expecting- mid-June, when we were under the impression from the doctor that he was keen for us to get started ASAP. But then we got slammed with one unpleasant truth after another. \n \nThe program was an intensive ABA program, with no psychiatric support. It got chopped down from that 8-10 weeks, where I would think even just an ABA program might be at least useful, to 4 weeks, then to 3. Then he was \"too high functioning\" for the main facility (because he wouldn't need nursing care... of course, they never actually saw him go into a spiral), so they were shipping us to a satellite, where it would be much harder for me to find somewhere to stay. Then, they wouldn't even be targeting the most important self-injury we needed addressed: the self-deprecation and self-harming threats. They might be able to keep him from attacking when he got desperate- but they had nothing for helping him keep from getting desperate. \n \nOne thing we have learned in our journey using ABA-based ideas and methods: you can replace a behavior, but you can't control what Joey will replace it with. That's one of the streams that fed our current situation to begin with. \n \nI don't know if saying \"no\" was the right thing, but I do think we need to consider that \"anything is better than nothing\" may not be the way to handle support services and therapies. Getting \"anything\" isn't appropriate. You need to get the  right  therapies and supports. \n \nI think the doctor already thought I was barmy. Now he's going to think I'm completely off my rocker. \n \nPart of the reason I said \"no\" was that they came straight out and said they could not address the core issue. It was a big part. But there were other red flags for us. For one, the insurance was going to \"cover\" it (it was still going to be $1900) under \"mental health services.\" The problem is, \"mental health services\" was the one thing they said point-blank the program would NOT HAVE.  \"Neuro-behavioral therapy\" is apparently just a slick name for \"intensive ABA\" - and still ignores the root of the behaviors we are seeing, and need to get help for. I'm glad the insurance was interested in providing some coverage, because ABA is very useful for certain things. However, at Joey's age, without the psychiatric support, it would likely simply add to his depression- another reminder that he's \"doing things wrong.\" Positive behavior supports and social skills/coping/regulation training are all great, but don't do much if you ignore the negativity exploding in my child's mind. \n \nAnxiety and depression are strange mistresses. Kind of like  Siamese cats . \n \nMeanwhile... \n \nTaking another strategy, looking to reduce stress and anxiety in Joey's day, we had our  Big IEP meeting . It was the one that you have to stare the reality of the situation in the face and admit utter defeat in order to gain the victory your child needs: appropriate services and appropriate placement. After years of regression and struggle, the team had to agree that the current setting wasn't working. Joey starts at a special school on Sept 3, and we are crossing fingers and toes that it will work for him. It will be a small class, and he already knows and likes one of the other students. The approach will be sensory, movement, and OT-oriented, with  Social Thinking  as part of the curriculum, rather than being ABA-heavy- so they will address the roots of problems, not just the outward crashes. Stopping the spiral to the abyss before Joey goes over the edge just makes a lot more sense to us. \n \nIf we can locate psychiatric support, we may yet try the Kennedy Krieger program when a spot opens this fall. Until we have the crucial piece, I don't see the point of setting him up to \"practice\" being in a meltdown. It's not just about having resources, or services, or professionals, after all. It's all for naught if they aren't the resources, services, and professionals you need. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care/patient-care-programs/inpatient-programs/neurobehavioral-unit-nbu/applied-behavior-analysis", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG5mOd8Ubsk", "https://www.socialthinking.com/?view=featured"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-wild-ride.html", "title": "\nThe Wild Ride\n"},

Having a friend around the corner is big excitement for Andy, and he is totally enjoying it. We are fabulously lucky. They are awesome people, and they love Joey, too. M's little sister T is particularly fond of Joey, because they seem to talk at the same wavelength, even though she is younger. \n \n\"Do you want to go to Big Pool with Andy and M?\" I ask Joey, calculating how long it will take me to get into a suit myself, and what would need to be packed to survive an afternoon at a very crowded public pool, instead of the Smaller Pool where we are members. \n \n\"No,\" Joey replies without hesitation, and suddenly settles in front of his computer. This is unexpected reply; I blink, then turn to a crestfallen Andy. \n \n\"Well, you can go ahead,\" I say, to Andy's delighted surprise. After all, I know M's parents are like me- eyes on the children at the pool. Not time for reading or facebooking.

This year? His teachers allow hugs. They help him, they guide him, they make it clear what their expectations are and provide him tools to meet them. They are busy teaching him those tools right now. He gets the attention he craves, and his fellow student thinks he's the bee's knees, and doesn't tease or otherwise make fun of him. Into Toy Story and Frozen? No problemo. You like words? Cool, let's look at word roots and definitions. You get the picture. \n \nThe result? Happy Boy who wants to get up and go to the school in the morning, two morning in a row, first week. Wow.

Half a week in, and I get the feeling that by the end of the year, I may have my Joey on the right track. \n \nSchool for Andy has been a struggle of tears the last few years, anxiety of bullying from both students and unempathetic teachers. His third grade teachers figured him out. Last year's teachers never did, and I think they just wrote him off as a spoiled over-sensitive brat. Summer has been something of a struggle to get him used to home learning, and finding out interests we can target for interest and pleasure in learning. Saying \"learn\" around him risked shutdown. Asking him questions risked shutdown. I was getting very worried that this might not work, and then what to do? Sending him back into the hellhole is not an option, to be honest. \n \nWe talked. We looked at some materials. We toured the town and the resources for local field trip opportunities. He actually asked to look at some places, to get out and explore some. He asked to see the local museum. We read  Ichabod Crane  together, set up a game that teaches scientific method, and even did a straightforward math lesson, at a table and very traditional. No, it wasn't all sunshine and roses, but he did it. He showed interest. He demonstrated understanding. I think by Christmas, when his  \"deschooling\"  should be complete, we should be able to really get into what he needs to move along. Here in Virginia, he needs to pass an eval at the end of the year (either a portfolio or standardized test), so we will likely need to continue with math lessons in a more traditional way- I'm not really familiar with any other way to teach it- but we have plenty of resources here to make history, science, reading, grammar, writing, arts, etc. relevant and immediate.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 10, 2014", "body": "\nI have advice for every sane person on the planet: never read the comments on news sites. Comment sections have becomes fuming bastions of ignorance, hate, and widespread evil, stewing in tempting little bites of illogical nonsense that make one want to scream at the computer at 2 am. \n \nHeaven forbid that article bring up the issue of special needs services or mental health services. Or both. \n \nThe general consensus out there appears to be that people who need help for their kids should go out there and get it. What's wrong with those parents, anyway? Lazy, selfish beasts raising brats to run wild, and then don't go out there and get them therapy if they need it. Or they over-diagnose their kids so they can drug them into oblivion. One or the other- and both opinions often from the same mouths. \n \nWhat they don't know is that it isn't that simple. One, you have to know what services you need. Two, they have to actually exist. \n \nI've been impressed by the growing range of services available to kids (mostly kids) who need a lot of support to make their way in the world. We have seen a lot of programs (relatively speaking) for non-verbal kids, kids with severe behavior issues, kids who need to be taught how to learn and respond, so that they can be taught skills they need to get through life, such as bathing, toileting... even simple things like walking. There are whole schools dedicated to teaching kids basic life skills, skills of daily living, and basic academics. There aren't enough, but there are more than there were. Or maybe we just know about more of them. \n \nThen we get told Joey is \"too high-functioning\" for their \"program model.\" Then they start listing off other programs, pause and note he is \"too high-functioning\" and \"too verbal\" for those programs, too.  \n \nJoey's school is having trouble keeping him safe. The problem is, most of the time, he is fine. But every few days, sometimes with a break of a couple weeks, he is  not fine . Those are the times we need to address, so that when he finds himself in trouble, he has skills and strategies to fall back on. We need him to use that good time to learn to cope with the hard time. \n \nYou know, like everybody else. Funny that. \n \nAfter all, waiting until a child melts down to try to address melting down isn't much of a help, is it? It is far better to teach someone a skill, rather than wait for them to fall on their face and then say, \"oopsie, you should have done this, then you wouldn't have broken your nose!\" Thanks for nothing there. \n \nSo we have decided he needs alternate educational placement, and are on the hunt for a school. The most poignant part of that meeting? Listing schools, to watch everyone frown and say, \"well, that one won't be a good place for Joey...\" Why? Because he's \"too high functioning.\" \n \nExcept he isn't functional. That's why we are having to take him out of school. \n \nWhat do you do with a child who is highly intelligent, yet has occasional behavior issues due to anxiety and depression? Where do you get them the mental health and behavior services they need? Where are the programs to address kids who are \"high functioning\" yet not functional? \n \nEven if you could find such a program, who pays? Is this an educational program, or a medical intervention? Guess what. The schools will tell you its a mental health issue, to be addressed by medical insurance. Guess what the medical insurance tells you. Joke's on you. \n \nIn other words, there are cracks in the \"system.\" They aren't the great yawning chasms they were only ten years ago, but they are too wide to always jump across. People get stuck in them. People like Joey. \n \nYou know that saying, if you can walk, you can dance, if you can talk, you can sing? Well, what if you can't? Where is the help to bridge the gap? \n \nYou can't enroll in a program that doesn't exist. You can't get a service that doesn't exist. All the money in the world cannot pay for an intervention that does not exist.\u00a0 Those are the true cracks in the system- the services that simply are not out there. At all. Anywhere.  \n \nThen people complain that people get stuck in the system of dependence, welfare, government services... well, what do you with a child who is fine most of the time, but might melt down suddenly? Unless you can teach that child to cope, how will they ever get decent employment? How will they become a functioning, taxpaying citizen? Where are the services to help them overcome these lower hurdles, that are still too high for them to get over themselves? It is like the government building that has ramps everywhere, except the front door, where there is a step. Not a huge one, not a very big one, and only one, but there it is. Then they wonder why people in wheelchairs can't come in and pay their taxes, which have to be paid in person, no proxies allowed... \n \nSo don't read the comments in news articles. When you are caught in the cracks, you don't need to know how ugly and ignorant people are of them. You are too busy trying to claw your way out, with people who keep dangling ropes just out of your reach.

This isn't just for kids, either: these people provide adult services, and make adult services available and affordable.  \n \nIn case you miss it from their website: \n \n \n \n Intervention Assistance Fund Mini-grants \nASNV\u2019s Intervention Assistance Fund awards quarterly mini-grants to \neligible adults with autism and families of those on the spectrum to \nhelp defray costs of therapies, medical procedures, training and other \ntreatments.  Click here \n to find eligibility requirements and application instructions.\u00a0 ASNV \nhas a designated subcommittee that evaluates the applications and \nadministers the program.\u00a0 You can donate directly to the  Intervention Assistance Fund  and 100% of your donation goes to support local families. \nYour donation goes to the fund, which then goes to the families and autistic adults who need support and services.They help cover families who otherwise can't get traditional services such as OT and speech therapies, but also help with \"uncovered\" services such as adult support, equine therapy, art therapy, safety equipment, behavioral therapies, assistive technology, summer camps, respite care, psychological evaluations, and even training workshops. THESE PEOPLE HELP.  \n \nThe Fredricksburg Walk raised $22,000 for the fund last year. Our team goal is a modest $500, but we know every dollar is a huge help to access therapies, training, and supports that directly help people with autism, and that would otherwise be beyond the reach of adults and families. \n \n Our Team Site has a donation button.  When you donate, you can become a \"virtual walker\" and member of Team Joey! If you prefer a straight donation, just put in your amount, and then scroll to the bottom for the checkout button.  \n \nThank you for your support as we all walk today to make a better world for families in Northern Virginia!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ua-JGX33E74/U1zwTE5RBII/AAAAAAAAFvQ/_27tErrjOgI/s1600/_original.jpg", "http://autismacceptance.org/teams/detail/4ee6004cdf", "http://asnv.org/page/about", "http://asnv.org/page/family-services", "http://givlnk.com/bjiSbN", "http://autismacceptance.org/teams/detail/4ee6004cdf"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/04/walking-autism-society-acceptance-walk.html", "title": "\nWalking: Autism Society Acceptance Walk\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 23, 2014", "body": "\nIt's Friday. The week has been one of those hard ones that make you really want to just hug the boys tight and let them know you love them, no matter what is ahead. There have been ups and downs and stress and meltdowns and tests and rocking of the boat. I spent last night typing up a comparative of Joey's school evals over the last 10 years. He's been in school 10 years. I spent one night looking over Andy's IEP and an afternoon in a fruitless conversation with his principal. \n \nJoey hops off the bus. He starts talking about the weather. He wants to know where Luna is. I follow him into the house. My knee isn't going to bode well for a walk today. \n \n\"Mom, let's watch  Frozen .\" \n \nI hadn't seen  Frozen . I've been putting it off. It's about siblings. Somewhere in the world, I have a sibling. You can see where I might put this off. \n \nBut Joey wants to watch it, it's Friday, my knee is bad. He wants me to see it. His teacher likes it. He asked for it as a reward for having a really good week and doing some cleaning and getting honor roll not long back. He starts singing a song from it. I turn on the TV.  \n \nHalfway through, he starts singing again. Then he starts the processing, out loud and in the air between us. Joey has trouble with this kind of intense emotional processing, and he immediately starts attaching his world to the characters in a distressing way. His cheeks begin reddening. \n \n\"I'm like Elsa,\" he starts. \"I've shut Andy out. I'm dangerous!\" \n \nTwo minutes later, it's reversed. Andy is Elsa, and Joey is the one \"shut out.\" Then I'm accused of \"shutting him out.\" He understands the pain. He understands the words. He tries to attach them to something concrete, something he can relate these emotions to. He understands his role as Elsa, and hiding himself. He goes outside and sings. \n \nWe work through the hurt. I have my own feelings about who to attach to these roles, push it aside to stay focused on Joey, and Joey's processing. We talk about why Elsa hurts, why we don't ask him to hide who he is. We love him and want him to be who he is. I try to assure him that he is far more like Kristoff than any of the other characters: brave, competent, caring.  \n \n\"Andy doesn't love me.\" He begins to spiral. I can't stop it. I can assure him that we have true love for him, that momma does. But he insists that Andy shuts him out. \n \nI call up the stairs. Andy's head appears. \n \n\"Andy, come down here a sec,\" I coax him into the den, then turn to Joey. \"Well, here he is. Ask him yourself.\" \n \n\"Andy, do you love me?\" \n \n\"Of course I do!\" is the ready answer, and Andy hugs his brother. \n \n\"It's true love!\" Joey clicks the understanding in place, hugging Andy. \"And you'd die for me?\" \n \n\"Well, duh,\" Andy replies, releasing his brother as a matter of course, begins his own pacing. Yeah, they're brothers. And it's True Love. \n \nThe clouds break up. Joey starts singing again. He's being Elsa. He's making his own \"windstorms.\" The pain, however, is gone. It's a feeling of power that replaces it, a fun in pretending to toss wind and ice about, to sing a song about freedom to be yourself. Joy returns to the singing. \n \n \nAndy goes back upstairs to play with his Pokemon cards. Joey goes out to the yard to sing. Outside, I can hear the refrain. \n \nHere I stand. And here I stay.  \nLet it go.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/05/fractals.html", "title": "\nFractals\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 24, 2014", "body": "\nI've been having a lot of anxiety attacks, depression attacks, and general upset lately. I'll tell you all about it when things start to smooth out again, but the details are not what's important today. The reason those details are causing a lot of discomfort, however, is. \n \nIt's Wednesday. That means I teach a class and make a stop at the adjunct office before I do, where there is another adjunct doing the same thing I'm doing- printing out lesson plans, worrying about whether or not to change something in the class format for the evening, sometimes meeting with students. Usually, he giggles at my lecture, because the class is on modern and contemporary art, and hey, performance and installation arts can be amusing to an economics professor. Just saying. \n \nAnd so we chatter a bit. He noticed my van is smothered in autism bumper stickers, and his (now grown) kids both have issues, so we swap war stories a lot. What works, what doesn't work, how different kids need different things. We were talking this evening about some of the upcoming events and past events and details and stuff, when the question came: \n \n\"What's his prognosis?\" \n \nIt is likely a question that would sound odd outside the special needs community, especially in those terms. Prognosis is a medical outlook. We talk about \"prognosis\" when we talk about things like major infections and broken bones. It's a question that makes me wince. What will Joey's future look like? That's what he meant. \n \nIf you had asked me that question four years ago, I would have been all bubbles and grins. No, we weren't all roses and good times, but we were headed in the right direction. Joey wasn't reading for me at home, but at school he was reading on the 6th grade level. He was tested a few months later, and passed the final math test for the 5th grade- and he was starting third grade. He would walk between classes by himself, between classroom and the cafeteria by himself, between the bus and classroom by himself. He was gaining social confidence, with a few hiccups as he was very trusting. His language use was improving. He would participate in regular classes with a little support. All arrows were pointing to progress, growth, and the steady pace of growing up, with a few (not unexpected) blips on the map. Prognosis? Independence, higher education, mathematical brilliance, adulthood of normal levels of support and opportunity. It was looking good. \n \nToday, I haven't a clue. \n \nAs we prepare for 8-10 weeks of intensive treatment for Joey, we feel we hit a major block in the road and fell into a sinkhole. Joey's academics have made a steady march backwards. His ability to cope with the school environment has turned into a disastrous and dangerous nosedive into depression and severe anxiety. If I had to make a guess now, I'd be at a complete loss. I feel like if we didn't have this intervention on the horizon, the \"prognosis\" would be dependence, limiting communication disabilities, and severe depression struggles, with no light at the end of that tunnel. With it, I think we're having to come to grips with the fact that Joey is going to take longer to get to independence, and gain the skills he needs and access the education he needs to be successful in supporting himself. We've simply lost too much time.  \n \nWe find ourselves in the grips of stigma that we intend to fight full-out. Some kids just need longer to get where they need to go. Some kids need more help. 18 and 21 are completely arbitrary marks on a development spectrum, and we all need to face the possibilities of difference. I went to school with a kid who was very much a \"space cadet\" all our growing up. He's now got a college degree and is doing just fine- he just took a little longer to get there. So what? \n \nWe're all adults for a very long time. After a while, does it really make that much difference if we get what we need when we're 17 (when I graduated high school) or 22 (when kids automatically age out of the school system)? And if we get what we need by 22, why would that make higher education a problem? Why should a slower developmental timeline be a serious problem? \n \nHow will the stigma of slower development affect Joey's opportunities to have a happy, fulfilling life? \n \nAs parents, we do our best to help our kids develop and grow, and we need to do more to respect the unique pace of each child. The push for earlier and earlier academics is one we should consider carefully, and reconsider what other skills young children might need to develop and learn besides letters and how to sit in a chair and fill in a little circle. Meeting kids where they are, how they are, and providing them with individualized challenges and successes takes a lot more work than our current education system is willing to give it, even in special ed (where \"individualized\" is supposed to be the cornerstone of the education plan). The next time someone tells me Joey won't suffer academically in a self-contained classroom, I'm going to laugh, while asking what planet they are on- because they certainly aren't from ours. Joey's scatter of splintered skills needs to be taken up and addressed. I keep saying we need to play to his strengths, in order to help him with his challenges. I'm tired of being ignored, especially to the point where Joey is failing math tests. \n \nReally? MATH tests? \n \nWe are in the grips of understanding that Joey needs more support in order to face his challenges. Those challenges have been left unaddressed so long, it will now take much more time to face and overcome them. We don't know what his future will look like, or how far he'll be able to go. \n \nI suspect he will surprise us all.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/04/in-grips.html", "title": "\nIn the Grips\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 08, 2014", "body": "\nTomorrow is going to be a big day. \n \nI have some friends coming to help me throw a bunch of stuff in tubs, and haul it to storage. My basement is full, I have a guest room full, I'm a hoarding packrat that would make a good TV show. It's all headed to the storage, so I can go through the dozens of tubs of crap in peace. I've been through a couple dozen already, mostly sent off to the dump or the donation bin. I'll get my basement back, and can set it up for the boys. My house will have a semblance of being picked up. \n \nSounds great, doesn't it? \n \nI've actually been working on it, box/tub by box/tub, one or two a day. But now I need it to happen RIGHT NOW. Why? Because we need help. The kind that requires a social worker to come to your house. That's how you apply for Medicaid waivers here. They send a social worker and a Medicaid person to your house, and determine if you qualify for the waiver, so you can get some help. Having social services in my house is not something I look forward to. I look to the left an the right, and all I can hear is my dad. The words aren't pretty. Everything I've heard about letting a social worker into your house is also not pretty. \n \nAnd I am the worst housekeeper on the PLANET. It may have to do with trying to work three jobs and raise two special needs boys, but to be honest, I sucked at housekeeping before I ever had to work a day in my life. Just ask my dad. \n \nIn the face of ten weeks in Baltimore, the continued high anxiety, the increased spring bolting, and the emotional wreck that is my son spiraling downward every moment, we have come to the end of our rope. This is going to be a financial disaster for us, just to find a place to stay, far more if we can't get the insurance to cover services. This is already an emotional catastrophe for Joey, even with the increased medicine. There is a waiver that will help with respite care, which would let us bring in someone to work with Joey in our home, and possibly allow me to shower more often. It also is a back door into Medicaid, which will cover a broader range of service than the state BC/BS will- we might be able to get some speech services covered again, maybe even some OT. They might cover some of the behavioral therapies that BC/BS considers \"educational\" (and the school considers \"medical\" or \"not directly related to academics\").  \n \nA social worker in my house means I spent a good deal of the afternoon with several large tubs, stuffing them full of clutter, so that I can go through it all later when there is more time. As if it was in any way related to Joey needing anything, or anybody's business, if I have stacks of books, papers, and toys in my house. As if it made any difference that the boys tend to kick trash under the couch, toss notebooks around, and leave their stuffed animals in little nests beside the furniture. Why should it matter that my back hall is basically a big closet, with hooks on every (real closet and basement) door, covered in jackets, hats, and tote bags? \n \nI put every thing in a bin, each item tugging at bitterness. It shouldn't be anyone's business. I should be able to apply for this in an office. I also think about those messages we get bout government assistance. I have seen the posts on Facebook and Twitter, I know we are about to lose more people, we know how they feel about us, are about to feel about us: mooches, lazy, social dregs. We have heard the message, loud and clear. I don't want to hear the \"well, I didn't mean  you \" excuses. Because you know what? You do mean us. You mean  me . You make it harder to do this. \n \nAnd every book, every toy, every paint bottle, every pencil, each and every thing I place in the tubs was accompanied by the tears. This shouldn't be. We were doing so well, Joey was doing so well, how did we get to this? How did it come to this? Where did we go wrong? We should have fought sooner. We should have done more. We should have pulled him out of school years ago, since we couldn't afford a lawyer. We should have done something the moment we saw the downturn. We should have acted after the first bolt. We should never have listened to the school people with their chants of \"this will work\" and \"it will be OK\" and \"we will take care of him.\" All lies. Every single one of them. \n \nI'm a smart woman. I should have known better. I did know better. Joey is paying for my being lazy, and complacent, and trusting the wrong people, and wanting it to work.  \n \nI place each thing in the tub, another mark of my own lazy, complacent, idiotic ways. It will go off to storage, where it will sit for months while we try to get this sorted out, then go to Baltimore, then the new semester will start, and fall rush will hit us at ETS, and there will be no time. Christmas will come, and go, and what will I have done? We don't even know if this will come to anything- we may go through all this, and apply, and have it all be for naught. \n \nThey will help Joey this summer in Baltimore. I have to believe it. It's going to work. It's going to be OK. They are going to help us. They are going to help Joey. We are going to get the depression and anxiety under control so he can go back to being happy, and healthy, and independent, and growing. \n \nEyes on the prize.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 18, 2014", "body": "\nI have been following several stories online about kids being brutally bullied for liking characters and shows considered \"not appropriate\" for their age and gender. Currently, many of them are about boys who like My Little Pony. They are beaten, teased, and told not to wear their favorite shirts or bring their bookbags to school because, heaven forbid, they like a show that has female ponies as main characters, and was designed to be marketed to girls. Occasionally we hear of a girl being teased about wearing a shirt or bookbag that has a male character or superhero on it, but we are quick to hop to her rescue. Heaven  forbid  boys like a show about strong-minded females who practice good social skills and are supportive of each other. Right? \n \nKids like what they like. I like Disney movies. I could sit here and watch Cinderella or Snow White over and over until my poor husband turned into a blob of sputtering goo. (And I have him as witness to this fact). I'm 42 years old. If you don't like it, I can show you the door, because I'm allowed to like what I like. \n \nI can defend myself. Not everyone can. Especially kids. \n \nIf you are teaching your kid that it isn't OK to like something, you are teaching them to give someone else a hard time-  to bully them - if they like it. That is  NOT OK . So when you teach your kid that they can't like Elmo anymore because they are a teenage boy, what do you think he will think when he sees another person who likes Elmo? That they are being baby-ish, silly, inappropriate? And how will he handle that feeling? What will stop him from walking up to that person and saying, \"Elmo is so babyish! You shouldn't like that anymore, you're not a baby!\" \n \nMy boys like a lot of things, and many of them are not \"typical.\" The whole idea of \"age-appropriate\" is arbitrary. When I went to see the last midnight show of the South Park Movie, there were 6-year-olds roaring it up in the theater. That isn't \"age-appropriate\", either, but obviously that didn't bother their parents. And those kids weren't likely to be bullied about liking South Park, either. \n \nWhy would that be? \n \nWhy can't my sons like butterflies, rainbows, kittens, unicorns, or any other thing they like? If my son wants to wear pink, why is that a problem? After all, they both look great in it. My grandfather wore pink all the time, and he looked good in it, too.  \n \nWhen I was a kid in school, I was the weird one. I liked black turtlenecks, reading books, writing stories, and running around in the woods. I like bright colored shoes and big earrings. No, I didn't have a lot of friends. I was never invited to a single party (unless the whole of a group was invited- never for me, myself). But I knew I was me, and I could defend myself if anyone dared to actually be brazen enough to comment to my face. I only got beaten up once. I remember it very well, and still remember the older girl- the only other girl in my neighborhood- coming to my rescue, and letting that kid have it. I just could not be anyone else, I couldn't just \"fly under the radar\" and get into the things other girls were into, and \"fit in.\" I also had an awesome Mom who let me be who I was, and offered many things so I could discover what I liked and what I didn't. \n \nThere are plenty of kids out there who cannot defend themselves, or who face bullies who aren't afraid to attack viciously, and even physically. They need our support. Like Twightlight Sparkle, they need true friends to stand with them when they are vulnerable, even physically shield them if necessary, so they can learn who they are and gain the strength they need to be themselves. \n \nI doesn't hurt any boy to emulate Rainbow Dash. Or AppleJack. Or Twightlight Sparkle. Or Rarity, Fluttershy, or even Pinkie Pie. There should be nothing wrong with having strong female characters as your heroes, no matter your gender. \n \nBullying should never be considered OK. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/03/its-not-ok.html", "title": "\nIt's Not OK. \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 30, 2014", "body": "\nWe're on the roller-coaster again. \n \nI do a slow circle around the old school, where Joey went to preschool, where the social worker is. We haven't done a social history since he was two. The young lady I'm going to talk to is new, she doesn't know us. Turns out, she's not familiar with the people who work in the different schools or anything.  \n \nA slow circle. I spiral in on a parking spot, like a shark. It isn't where I wanted to park, but there's nothing else available. I wonder why all these cars are here. I never find out. \n \nI climb up to the building, through an entrance I have only used once before. Joey used the entrance on the other side of the building. I always parked in that little side lot when we were here for school, or meetings. The building seems strange, since this isn't the entrance I'm used to- twisted around weirdly. I find my way to the main office to sign in. I don't know the secretary there. More weirdness. \n \nThe new lady comes down, takes me upstairs as if I don't know exactly where I am going, only I could walk this path blindfolded. There are 27 steps to the second floor. I count them off as we climb, in my head. They haven't added any in 10 years. It's the exact same room. I was here, ten years ago. The story was shorter then. \n \nI rattle it off. I start on August 31, 2004. I make it to this year. I think she's figured out I'm not happy. She asks more questions, filling out her little form. Who lives in the house with us? How old is Joey's brother? How is Andy doing in school? How is Joey doing in school? Do we have health insurance? What is Joey like, his personality? Does he have behavior issues? Does he get aggressive? What do we do at home to discipline him (her words)? What services does he get? What contact does he have with the community? \n \n \nShe puts on her Concerned Face when I talk about him being suspended, when I tell her about the possibility at Kennedy Krieger, when I note the differences between second grade and now. I don't know this woman, I don't know if Concerned Face is going to mean anything yet. From experience with others, I'm betting it means nothing at all. She's trained to look concerned. It's an Active Listening skill. It's her job. \n \nAnd I never forget, it's the school that signs this woman's paycheck. You can never forget that when talking to people- who pays them. Whose side they are on. It's like a Mission Impossible, with espionage and counter-espionage. What information do you offer? How will it be used? How could it be used against you? People trained to take every word you say and judge you with it. And perhaps I am suspicious because I know that usually, when Joey goes into meltdown, it's my fault. When I don't pick up the signs, when I miss the cues, when I make the wrong choice of intervention or lack thereof, the wrong moment or the wrong words or the wrong tone. But you don't want to say that to a person who could pick up the phone and have your child removed from you, just like that. \n \nParanoid. I've become paranoid, suspicious of everyone connected with the school, because every time I ask for them to help him, we get nothing. Or worse. They have had him since he was two, for the love of Pete. If you can't figure out how to do a job in eight years, why should I trust you to learn to do it in the next eight days? \n \nOur meeting is in eight days. They came to the Triennial with no new evals, and the excuse that they only eval every six years. I told her that. I got more Concerned Face. But I would have none of that, especially since the evals from three years ago I thought were a load of crap three years ago. So we are doing all these evals. This is one of them. \n \nEight days, and I will know if these people are competent. It will be my turn to judge them. After all, no one knows Joey better than I do. I will know if they can evaluate him and come up with an accurate picture. I will know. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/04/concerned-face.html", "title": "\nConcerned Face\n"},

We had just finished another Encyclopedia Brown mystery; he had read most it if himself. Now he had to write abut the main idea. A sentence of two, that was all. He looked tired. Reading is hard work for Andy, because he has to keep his eyes carefully focused. I still catch him cheating a little, guessing at words instead of reading them. Sometimes its because he's tired and can't focus anymore, physically forcing the convergence of his vision. Sometimes he can't do any more processing. And sometimes, I wonder if he isn't dyslexic, and has just learned to fake it. \n \n\"You read it better,\" he sighed, though he seems proud after reading the solution. He almost got it right.

One sentence is all he can write, and you can see the fatigue- the letters are everywhere, and I watch as he uses strange strokes to create them. I have to spell most of the words for him. Words like \"police\", \"tricked\", \"left.\" He got a zero on his last spelling test. Not a single one right. They were long words. He mostly left out vowels. \n \nHe sets the paper aside.  \n \n\"How did you like the story?\" I ask. I have done it on purpose. I don't have long to wait, and here it comes. The torrent of words. He retells the story to me. Sometimes he half-whispers the last word or two of a sentence under his breath, before going on to the next one. Then he starts talking about his favorite bits. That part is a bit of word and sentence salad, but cohesive enough for me to follow if I pay attention. He giggles over the solution, a little detail that made the whole clear, he thinks he'll be able to solve the next one. \n \n\"But you read the next one,\" he says, looking at me uncertainly. \"I remember it better when you read them.\" \n \nI know this is true. If I read it, there is less word salad after. The ideas are clearer, so long as I don't ask him to write them down. I wish I could make it easier. I wish there were some better programs out there to capture speech- one that wouldn't balk at his tongue-thrusting, lisping speech; one that could keep up with the furious tumble of words. Amidst that word salad, there are some great ideas, solid thoughts, keen observations for a 9-year-old. \n \nHe finally realizes homework is done, and he can play his Minecraft. As he bounces off, I know what my plan of action is. \n \nBuy more Encyclopedia Brown. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/02/dysgraphic.html", "title": "\nDysgraphic\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, March 16, 2014", "body": "\nIt's been a very long time. \n \nWhen the boys were smaller, I would regularly take them on adventures. In fact, every good weather weekend was time to be out and about, anything and everything. We went to the zoo. We went to the farm. We went to museums. We went to Maymont. We went to the park. We went to Williamsburg and Jamestowne. We'd visit friends in DC. We went for walks at Wakefield. We get in the car and off we'd go, often with Grandma in tow. \n \nMost of the time, it was just me and my boys. JoeyAndyDad often had to work. I learned the drill for handling two boys by myself. I carried an emergency adventure kit with me: toys, fidgets, bandaids/first aid kit, water, washcloths/small towels (never leave home without your towel!), wet wipes, chewy candy, small snacks, a spare totem (whatever Joey was carrying around- such as a diecast bus or a wooden spoon), sunscreen, lip balm, spare bags, a spare set of clothes for each child, small change and dollar bills. I was ready.  \n \nWe had great adventures. We've done  our share of rock collecting . We've  chased chickens and picked pumpkins . We've seen  dinosaurs . We've seen lots of  dinosaurs . We've  checked out colonial ships . We've  made friends with some otters . Maybe  even too friendly . We  met the Queen  (well, the RenFaire one, anyway). We  dropped pencils on the coral reef exhibit in Baltimore . We even got  attacked by turkeys . Adventures rock. \n \nLately, taking them by myself has been... not a good idea. Even going to the park has been, for the most part, a disaster. With both boys increasingly brittle and Joey's bolting, I've been sticking to controlled settings. The pool is fenced, and has lifeguards about who are told about Joey. The parks we do go to have clear boundaries I can enforce and see clearly. Nature centers have walls. \n \nHowever, work was cancelled today, its going to snow tomorrow, and I just couldn't bear to waste a 70-degree day. JoeyAndyDad wasn't feeling hot, so we left him home to rest up, and headed to the Richmond Zoo. I figured I could  corral them with the budgies  if all else failed. \n \nI forgot part of my kit, because ts been a long time since I needed one. Folks, do NOT forget your sunscreen. Or your towel. \n \nWe managed to have a fabulous afternoon, anyway. There were lots of people, but nothing that made us feel overwhelmed with crowd. Unfortunately, the giraffes and budgies weren't very hungry, having chowed on birdseed and animal food all day, but we discovered that most folks don't know you can also feed the elk, the warthog, or several other animals with tubes to their pens for the purpose. Andy, however, did figure it out. I should mention that elk are much bigger than I thought. With horns I would not want to meet in a dark alley. \n \nWe also took the sky ride. Andy got nervous with the height, but with the lovely weather and great view of the cheetahs and rhinos, he managed to like it. Joey loved it. And they got to ride together, with mom in the car just behind them, which was apparently a happy adventure in and of itself. \n \nThey have also put up an awesome play area, and Andy would have stayed there for hours if I had let him. Lots of climbing and sliding and stuff. \n \nWe did manage to get a budgie on a stick, and we got the giraffe to take a nibble. All was well with the world.  \n \nYes, we managed to have a successful adventure. No meltdowns. No whining. Tired, happy boys. Thank you,  Richmond Zoo . \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.metrorichmondzoo.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/03/skyriding.html", "title": "\nSkyriding\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 05, 2014", "body": "\nIt's a meltdown. \n \nWhat was the trigger? I can't be sure now. But the words that come from my child's lips are not his own. They are horrible, ugly, painful. He's been working hard not to use them, but when the pain is there, they capture it so well, project it so well. \n \nThe words he calls me are nothing. You all know them, everybody uses them. If we completely squash them, as he gets older and it becomes the norm for people to use them, it will only emphasize his differences. Adults use them all the time, after all. And its the pain he's trying to communicate. The frustration, the anger, the shake-me-because-I'm-not-getting-it pain. I get that. I may not like it, but I get it. \n \nIt's the words he directs at himself that really take me by the heart and soul. The self-deprecation. The words he uses for it. Yes, we know those words, too. Stupid. Ugly. Fat bastard. Sometimes he sprinkles them with the fancy words that he prefers, such as scoundrel, smart alec, aggressive, repugnant, obnoxious. Then there is his new star word: \n \nRetard. \n \nYes, we all know the word. We know what it means. We know how it is used. We know Joey hears it applied to him. \n \nHe hears you. He knows what you are saying, and what you mean. He knows it is an ugly, deliberately painful word. It's a sword in his hand. \n \nWhen we talk about SIBs, we often talk about physical injury. People who bite themselves. Cut themselves. Hit their heads against things, or punch themselves bloody. We know it is scary (though until it is someone you love, you can't imagine how scary it can be.) We may even understand the extension of that pain and injury to others: people who lash out, throw things, flail, become aggressive in the face of the frustration, the stress, the disorientation, the pain.They are \"challenging behaviors.\" We want them to stop. And when we understand the source, we know its not our pain that needs to stop, not our frustration that really matters. It's theirs.  \n \nWhat about those whose self-injury is invisible? What about self-deprecation? What about self-injury that is psychological? \n \nThe mental health system in this country is already a shambles. Now try to get help for someone who needs specialized care; a person with autism can't just walk into an office and start seeing any social worker or therapist. A person with autism needs help from someone who understands autism, who understands the issues of communication and regulation, who really  gets it . Until the therapist gets it, he or she cannot help  you  get it. When trying to communicate these issues to Joey's last principal- a person who was supposed to be a psychologist, knowledgeable in special needs- I got told Joey might have emotional disturbance. \n \nI knew there was nothing more to say there. Even the people who are supposed to \"get it\" often have no clue when presented with someone with autism who needs help. How are we supposed to help Joey cope with his pain, find constructive ways to communicate and deal with frustration, to help him grow into an adult who can care for himself, if we can't even find someone to help us who understands the challenge? \n \nOne of the ways we work hard to help Joey is by giving him language to use. We try to turn his echolalic skills into something helpful and constructive. It is a skill, a talent, a strength like any other; so feed him the language that he can use, words he can fall back on. \n \nYet we fight an uphill battle, because we are also trying to help him understand how he is a whole, wonderful, capable person, in a world that see him as less. A world that has given him language that hurts him. A world that, despite his talents, his intelligence, his kindness, his creativity, his imagination, his empathy, his strengths- see him in the light of less, and in the light of the word that runs bitter from his mouth: retard. \n \nJust as we all have our own challenges and special needs, we all have strengths and we all have weaknesses, why must we take perfectly good words, and infuse them with hate? With derision? With pain? \n \nIt is no longer a perfectly good word. Please stop. I assure you, he hears you. He knows you mean him. And he knows it is a word that means pain. \n \nMore pain that I hope you ever, ever face.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/03/swords-in-hand.html", "title": "\nSwords in the Hand\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 23, 2014", "body": "\nJoey's IEP meeting is this week. The purpose of the meeting is to determine his goals for the next year, but I think it will only be the first of at least two meetings, since I had the school actually do some evals, and they aren't done yet. Can't really make goals for a child until you know where they are. \n \nHowever, here is the beginning: that first attempt to hammer out what Joey needs, and where we need to focus. As such, it is time to re-assess the bigger picture: try to get a handle on who Joey is, what he needs to move forward in his own development, and how to support those needs.  \n \nWhen Joey was getting what he needed, he made a lot of progress both socially and academically, meeting his goals and becoming increasingly independent. That was four years ago. Trust me, I know how horrible that reads. Right now, that is not where we are. We need to meet Joey where he is right now, not where we think he ought to have been. At the same time, what happened? And what can we do to fix it so we return to meeting goals, making progress, and resuming the march to solid development and independence? How do we go back to helping Joey be happy, and gain the skills he needs to successfully manage himself and his own life as an adult?  \n \nHow do we re-gauge what he can accomplish in a year? Clearly, this needs to be reconsidered. He hasn't hit his goals in four years. We need to re-consider what the bigger goals are, and how to break them down into the smaller chunks. Then we need to be meeting those chunks. We need to reconsider what made Joey so successful before, and ask why he is no longer meeting his goals. What combination of re-write and resources would make this next IEP successful? \n \nKey to all of is this, what will those goals be? What are the larger goals? Broad goals like \"being happy\" and \"becoming independent\" are too vague to work with. What does Joey need to be successful in the school environment, and in the larger world? How can we get him access to the curriculum of the school, assessed accurately in his success in learning that curriculum, and engaging that curriculum in terms of skills and knowledge? You can't write goals until you know what skills he has, what skills he can use, and what skills he needs. You need to understand where the real gaps are. It's useless to write a goal saying a child needs to learn how to write a sentence if the real problem is that the child needs to learn how to hold a pencil, or be taught to type so they can demonstrate their writing skills. It is also pretty weird to write goals about coping with anxiety when the environment seems to increase and intensify anxiety- you need to fix that environment into a low-intensity, low-anxiety environment first, so that skills can be gained and strengthened. You don't give a beginner the task of an expert; first, your goal is to master the beginner level. You then remember they haven't mastered it yet- you expect them to master it by Christmas. Then you determine means for controlling the situation and environment to provide opportunities for learning, building, and success, before moving everything up a notch. You build up to that mastery, then work on moving to the intermediate level.  \n \nEven the makers of Angry Birds understand that. \n \nSo this is only the first meeting. We can't finish this task until we have the evaluations, and compare those evaluations to our own observations. I get tired of evaluations telling me he has trouble with math, or can't read well. Really? Allow me to disprove that one for you...  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/03/iep-time-key.html", "title": "\nIEP Time: The Key\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, March 01, 2014", "body": "\nLetting Joey out of my sight right now is like watching a child take a plunge off the diving board for the first time. You know they can do it. You've seen them swim, there is a lifeguard right there just in case, but you still hold your breath and pray hard until that head comes back up out of the water. And for us, we still watch them like hawks at the pool. It's what parents do. \n \nBut it is all that much more when you know your child is a bolter. An eloper. When you read a story in the news about a child who \"wandered\" away, and the tragedy of losing that child forever, and you ache for that family not just for their loss, but to know that, but for the Grace of God, there your path lay. It could be you next time, weathering the barrage of ugly comments about how horrible a parent you are to have ever let your child out of your sight and \"letting\" them escape. \n \nIt could be us. \n \nSo you have to know how huge a step it is to let my 11-year-old son go to the corner, by himself, to wait for his brother's bus. There are adults there, and they are all aware of Joey and his needs. They know I am sitting on the porch, a loud yell away. Joey is so proud of himself, going to get his brother all by himself. It's a little bit of independence. \n \nI still wasn't ready for today. \n \nWe have neighbors around the corner, and we have often had the kids here, or gone over there. Their oldest is just under Andy's age, and their middle one thinks Joey is the bees' knees. They are wonderful, awesome people, who think my kids rock. Now that their oldest is into Pokemon, he and Andy are really going back and forth a lot more. There have been lots of \"I'll see you tomorrow\"s and \"I'll come by later\"s. There have been children appearing in my house like magic. It's pretty awesome. \n \nToday, Andy decided he wanted to go over there instead. It's a few houses down as the bird flies, only a few more as the sidewalk turns. Nothing unusual for a 9-year-old, to go over and play at a friend's house when living in a town. Except I don't have usual kids. We said OK, because I knew I could ring over to the other house and alert them, just as I call and let them know when one of their kids appears here. \n \nThen the words appeared, slashing through the air and dancing on my nerves with an odd, shimmering vibration: \n \n\"Come on, Joey, let's go!\" \n \nThat Joey was coming, too, was just a foregone thing to Andy. I was going, and therefore Joey was going. He was old enough, so Joey was old enough. It was simply the way it was. \n \nI balked. I know, all that assume competence and have faith and believe in your kids and all that, but if one small thing went wrong on the walk to the other house, Joey might be off to the races. Andy might say something wrong. Joey might trip and fall. Even the smallest thing can become a sudden and dramatic big deal. Besides, they would have to go around the corner to get to this house. I couldn't just watch them from the porch or even an upper window. \n \nJoey would have to go out of my sight, and with only Andy to help him. \n \nJoey knows we balked. We explained to him why, because you know what? He has the right to know that we are concerned about him running. We are worried about his well being and safety when he bolts. He love him. \n \nAnd then we decided to let him go. \n \n \n \nWhen I was still pregnant, I remember my mom saying something about parenting being a constant letting-go. She also said something about it hurting. My mom is a smart lady. \n \nWhen I called, they didn't pick up the phone, so I pulled on my coat and shoes and trotted after the guys. If the neighbors were not there for some reason, Joey might melt down after the anticipation of going to see them. I got to the corner, and stared down it. They were no where in sight. I opened my phone to call again, and found the battery was dead. So I trotted the rest of the way to make sure they made it. They had. The family was there. All was well with the world. \n \nSo I went home. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/03/one-step-at-time.html", "title": "\nOne Step At A Time\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 04, 2014", "body": "\nSpring is coming. \n \nFor most folks, that means crocus, daffodils, and colored eggs. You know, baby chicks and new veggies and cherry blossoms. \n \nFor us, it means the next major regression with the change of season, anxiety attacks, and battening of hatches for the coming crisis. Does that sound harsh? Personally, I'd rather be prepped and have it not happen for the first time ever, than not be prepped and have a major catastrophe. The last school never prepped, even though we warned them, every year. And every year, they had catastrophe. I'm totally battening. \n \nWe've gotten the first whiffs of that spring breeze this week. After mostly calming down into Christmas, and making it through Christmas par for the course, we had snow. This meant school being cancelled. But Joey had already not been in school for two days of that first week back, because he had this mysterious illness. He would conk out for first period, with coughing, headache, complaining of tummy, falling asleep. He would be sent to the nurse. The nurse would call me. I would go pick him up. He would reach the car, and all symptoms would mysteriously disappear. One day, I actually called him in sick, and they mysteriously disappeared when the bus passed by the door.  \n \nSo this last time he got sent home, Grandma and I came and got him, and took him out to Grandma's, and let Grandma work her magic. Why didn't he want to be in school? What was making him anxious and feel bad? \n \nThe interpretation of the data we got, spoken in Joey, is that Joey is feeling teased and bored. The math sheets sent home with him was stuff he's been using as a perseveration game since he was six. The history reading is totally baffling to him, as he has difficulty grasping abstract time and events have little relevance to him. He's in middle school, and even non-autistic middle schoolers start feeling the social pressure- so you can imagine Joey, with even fewer coping mechanisms or skills to fight the negative internal monologue of middle school than his peers, trying to navigate. This is headed to catastrophe. \n \nThis morning, when the nurse called again, I asked he be sent to counseling. I don't think they talked about what he needed talked about, but it got him calmed and back to his class for lessons, until he disagreed with something on an English test. Already brittle, it sent him into flight mode. Yes, they caught him. And thankfully, these folks have been working on back-up for when he runs, since they had so much of it already. They managed to catch him and get a card in his hands that said something like \"Rock Brain Moment- Go to the Cool Zone!\" and he managed with the visual and tangible to pull himself together enough to get to his Cool Zone. They had been practicing with this card for a while, prepping for just this moment. It worked.  \n \nCan I get a \"GO, MRS. C!\" (She's the autism resource person doing the card thing).  \n \nBut just as I went out to make sure we had ice melt, even though we've already had our quota of snow for the year, I continue to prepare. I don't see this bolt as an end. I know it is the first signs of coming anxiety.  \n \nSo no matter what the groundhog says, here comes Spring. Are we ready? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/02/shadow.html", "title": "\nShadow\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 12, 2014", "body": "\nI've spent the last few months watching people get torn up and verbally masticated over the very complex notion of friendship. What is it? What does it mean? When you love someone unconditionally, are there really no conditions? And if they do something horrible and terrible, what do you do? Are you suddenly, \"well, I love you and I'm your friend and all, unless you do something horrible. Then you're on your own.\" If someone has made a horrible, terrible mistake, done a horrible, terrible thing, torn up lives and people and the cosmos, isn't that the exact moment they need a friend the most? Does being someone's friend, and loving them unconditionally, mean you condone everything they say and everything they do? \n \nFriendship is not black and white. That makes it very difficult for many people to navigate. That is why middle school is so hard- kids wake up to what it really means to be a friend, have a friend, need a friend, and at the same time developmentally needing things to be clear and defined. It can be difficult to grasp the fact that friends love each other, true friends love each other unconditionally, and yet they still fight, they still disagree, they are still separate, individual people with their own views, their own experiences, their own values. Individuals don't match up 1:1 down to the last fiber. That is part of being human. Actually, it is part of  being .  \n \nPeople make mistakes. They make bad decisions. These can be horrible, ugly, wrenching, devastating mistakes and decisions. We often spend a lot of time and resources trying not to, but it happens. Is that the time you would want to be abandoned by the people who are supposed to be your friends? Would you want your friends to be pilloried, slandered, crucified, insulted, threatened, bullied, torn apart, put down, crushed, and spat at, simply because they still love you, still try to help you, still stand by you when you need them most? If someone you love did something terrible, would you stand by them and try to help them? And does trying to help them mean you condone their actions? What is \"help\"? \n \nI don't have an army of friends out there. It's not how I am. I've said it before- each and every friend is precious to me, and they are my friends because they are awesome people. That doesn't make you all perfect angels. That's doesn't mean you don't make mistakes. Sometimes big mistakes. Big, honking, holy-cow-world-ending mistakes. And if you make those big mistakes, I'm still here to help and love you. Always. You may not like what I say, or do, or what is needful or helpful. Support is not always easy, just as supporting is not always easy. \n \nWhen Joey makes a mistake, and I need to shut down his electronics time to help him understand his mistake, try to fix his mistake, and learn not to make that mistake again, it isn't easy. I still love him. I don't condone the mistake. I don't condone the meltdown from the consequence of the mistake. I don't condone him cussing up a storm, calling me names, flailing at me. But I do my best to help him, because I love him, every minute, every day, all the time, always. Unconditionally. Absolutely. Just as much as when he's giggling and dragging me out the door to look at the moon, just as much as when he is covering me in kisses, just as much as when he is helping his brother learn a new game- I love him.  \n \nThat's what I mean when I say, \"I love you guys.\" That's what it means when I say, \"friends are family.\" And when I say, \"we're friends\", that is no small thing. \n \nAnd maybe its a bit more black and white that some would like it to be; or black and white in a different way. Personally, I think it's full technicolor wowness.

{"date": "Saturday, December 14, 2013", "body": "\nI loved Christmas. \n \nJoeyAndyDad used to tease me about starting up the holiday movies in August. I collect versions of  A Christmas Carol . I spend hours making garlands of glass ornaments over the doorways of our house, wiring each ornament individually, each year, to glistening perfection. \n \nWhen I was young, my folks put up a ten-foot field pine in our livingroom. Dad would take a whole day just getting it up and the lights on. Two more days to decorate it, with Dad doing the very top on the ladder. I remember the first year I did the top, the pride and feeling of being grown-up and competent to go up that ladder and get the topmost branch glittering. The table under the tree held half a dozen paper house villages, plus an array of rubber and lead animals, arranged as farms and fields and aluminum pond with swans. The train had real smoke, puffing as you pushed the transformer lever forward, and watched it turn endlessly through the Christmas wonderland. \n \nI remember the first time I crept out, so happy to have a stocking for my mom to put out. I had been distressed that my mom never got a stocking. A neighbor helped me gather up all the little treasures, and I wrapped each one. I crept out into the moonlight, not using a single light, because I didn't want to ruin the morning surprise. The wooden villages were in every sill of the bow window, the bare branches of the woods dappling the moonlight that shown behind them. \n \nI put those villages out for my mom every year until I went to grad school. As soon as Thanksgiving was done, they could come out. One year, my brother took all the extra wooden trees and made a great woodland for the manor house. I always put it that way every year after, in his honor. Even after he stopped speaking to us. \n \nEvery year, I would try one more thing, try something new and beautiful, a new display, a new corner decorated and sparkling. The shelf in my kitchen became my Christmas garden, full of paper houses and all sorts of Christmas trees, the wilder the better. I even have bright glittering pink ones with fruit stuck in them. The mantel also became a garden, though it used to alternate with my Christmas dolls, more in the tradition of an old nativity creche- all the different people coming to celebrate. I have a display of angels, for atop the bookshelf. The buffet was a three kings display until we let the buffet go. I have a scene of a Christmas ball, with figures that move and music that plays. I have one of those penguin toys where they march up the hill and slide down. \n \nThe week of Christmas, I make the greens arrangements, the live ones, to go all over the house. I have now been making them for thirty years. Layering in the textures of the greenery, the selection of the highlighting picks, the structure of the line, the bow, handmade by me, as many loops as I can get from the bolt. I even found a little glitter spray does wonders, without harming the greens. There should be one for every flat furniture surface- every table should have one, every side nook. \n \nMom would make the most beautiful trees from a styrofoam cone and a special kind of weed, one that when dried seemed to be tufts of little stars. Sprayed gold, tucked with old fashioned glass balls and beads, it was the star of the display. I have made a couple, but nothing like what mom could do. \n \nChristmas made the world glitter, brought in the joy and reflected it back like Indra's net, each facet glittering in all the others. Everything was beautiful.Everyone was happily busy, with decorations and cookies and songs.  \n \nI loved Christmas. \n \nEvery year, now, when the first of the ornaments appear, Joey goes bananas. So much change. Familiar things become unfamiliar, like stepping through the looking glass. School lets out, destroyed familiar structure. There are many things that are only done, seen, said, smelled this time of year, keeping them all new and strange, and only to be whisked away as soon as they become familiar. \n \nHe's a ball of anxious mess. \n \nAnd I find more and more, I just want it to be over. The magic of it gets lost in the screaming. The joy is drained by the meltdowns. Instead of being wonderful, it is overwhelming, terrifying. Too much noise, too much new, too much, too much, too much, all amplified by glitter and glass. Nothing is ever just fun and right. Every outing that should be a delight is instead a carefully orchestrated balancing act, and all too often, I fail at balancing. The smallest thing, unlooked-for, sends everyone over the precipice and into the spiraling abyss. \n \nAnd I look at the boxes of glass, and wonder why I do this to him, year in, year out, tearing up his world. It isn't that Joey doesn't like the decorations and the whole Christmas thing, but navigating it remains beyond his grasp. And lately, it has been getting worse, not better. Even familiar events have become too much, the outings and activities he loved are minefields. Instead of enjoying the glitter, I find myself constantly poised for fight or flight. \n \n His  fight or flight.  \n \nI wonder how long he will last. What I will do to help calm him, keep him safe. Wear shoes to run in, in case I screw up and he bolts. Try to get those around me to understand, when it is time to go, it can't wait, not even just one more minute. \n \nI start wondering what and who I am doing this for. \n \nI loved Christmas.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/12/holiday-madness.html", "title": "\nHoliday Madness\n"},

Andy's will be here this afternoon. I'll keep you posted. \n \nThe way report cards are done here, everyone is supposedly graded on the same measurements. In other words, Joey's report card reflects his work against that of his non-disabled peers, and the standards of all 6th graders in his school. In that context, getting a C in English is a downright miracle, given his communication and language disabilities. A B in History? With a child for whom historical time* is an ungrasped abstract concept and these events seem to have no relevance or meaning? Let's PAR-TAY!!! A B- in math, however, is highly confusing. He's been doing the math I've been seeing come home for 3-4 years already, and does these sheets perfectly in about 10 minutes. Plural, sheets, as long as there is minimal language involved. I am going to assume this means they are giving him a lot of word problems. With all we've been working on with his language and reading skills and communication disabilities, I'm tempting to again PAR-TAY! Joey is rocking the world! \n \nBut it also means he won't be honor roll again, and honor roll is something that is very poignantly\u00a0 significant to him. It is touted as a mark of success, and not participating is therefore, in a back-and-white world, the very essence of failure.  \n \nJoey noticed I was looking at the report, and so I asked about some of the comments the teacher made, such as \"low quiz grades.\" That is when things starting spiraling. He only got 30s on quizzes, that he was a \"stupid retard\" and \"retards aren't allowed to pass quizzes\". Though my heart shattered in a million shards of grief, I also knew he was speaking Joey. This word means Pain. It means Heartbreak. He was telling me of frustration, anger, disappointment, and pain all in one fell swoop of verbiage. \n \nThis is a word he knows people use to refer to him, and has fully grasped what it means.\u00a0 And like any other word, he has emotions attached to it, and is ready to use as a placeholder for expressing those emotions. \n \nI already have my letter in to his teachers, trying to pinpoint the issues that need to be addressed. Are his accommodations appropriate and effective? Are these grades reflecting his efforts? I also took some steps here, the same we have done for his brother- \"A\" quizzes means prizes, in an effort to get him to take them seriously and try to do his best on them. But what if, with all the language involved, all the issues of testing, all the problems of balancing accommodations, expecting an A really is too much? Will  not  getting a prize be just a reinforcement of failure? \n \nWhen Joey gets home, a certificate will be awaiting him. It will be, in essence, \"You are awesome. Let's PAR-TAY!!!!\" Because he totally deserves one.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n*Yes, there is a difference between abstract time concepts and practical time concepts. Joey can gladly tell you exactly what time it is. His new interest in moon phases has been helpful in getting him to grasp the idea of cycles and years. But that something happened 200 years ago? Unfathomable for him right now. He has a very, very basic understanding. For him, 200 years ago is \"once upon a time\", and has very little difference from 2000 years ago. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2014/02/report-cards-can-go-suck-it.html", "title": "\nReport Cards Can Go Suck It. \n"},

In fact, it skews the whole problem of communication disability and disorder, so that the terms aren't useful for much of anything. \n \nAfter all, Joey talks. Therefore, he is \"verbal.\" \n \nThen there is this morning. He was talking, therefore \"verbal.\" But he was mostly scripting, or chatting about his own agenda without being able to respond to me. When I asked a question, even a simple one, the best he could do was stare at me. We even had Blankface, which is never a good sign. He ws having trouble processing the question and the response. He just could not do the whole question thing. \n \nI know he was processing the questions, albeit a bit slower than you might expect from someone without communication difficulties. When I asked if he was cold and needed a coat, he went inside, and then let me help him into a heavier coat. When I told him about picking his own learning activity for the afternoon, he started chatting about Cool Math Games. But directly answer a question? It wasn't happening this morning. \n \nJoey is not \"verbal.\" He is not \"non-verbal.\" He is  differently  verbal. That can be really hard for people to grasp. He uses language in his own unique ways. Some days he can use language in ways we find familiar. Some days he can't. Some days he uses it the way he wants, some days the ways we want. Speaking Joey can shift and change from hour to hour. Its a complicated communication system. \n \nWe need to understand that being different is not bad. We expect him to learn to understand us; we should also take the time to understand him. We need to consider what people around us need, how they see the world, how different perspective changes the view. We teach about cultural diversity in our classrooms, we expect our college students to take humanities classes. But culture isn't the only defining factor in experience. Seeing the world differently gives us wider vistas, more tools for understanding the world and solving issues that arise within it. \n \nUnderstanding Joey and his different verbality, his different functionality, his different point of view is part of that, and gives the world crucial new vistas. We should take the time to explore different paths. They have so much to teach us, and give us, and create new wonder for us. \n \nAnd wonder is good. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/12/a-different-path.html", "title": "\nA Different Path\n"},

{"date": "Friday, January 24, 2014", "body": "\nWe have a reading problem here. For Andy, with his vision screwed up for so long and other processing issues, reading takes an incredible amount of energy. He loves books- but he would prefer to listen to them. I have tested his auditory comprehension with books he has \"read\" by audio book, and he seems to get almost every word. If I read books to him, he loves it, and he loves the stories, the information, and he likes the pictures if there are any. Reading by himself is a much bigger problem. I find myself thinking, what is more important? Him reading the words himself off the page, or him getting the information, the narratives, the understanding? And how to broach the issue with his teachers? \n \nJoey also scores poorly on reading comprehension tests, but has a lot of issues with auditory processing as well. I can't just pop in a CD and expect him to get when he needs that way. Narratives often make no sense to him. Visualizing a story, a character, a place, is a real challenge. Understanding the inferences of words remains a challenge. \n \nAt least his teachers think so. I have often said he could read  War and Peace , if you gave it to him one sentence at a time. If you give him the smaller bits and let him process it, he not only gets it, he keeps it.  It never goes away . My brain used to be like that. It has its pros and cons, but at this age, the pros are far greater- if you allow him to process and retain. \n \nI now can say he can read  War and Peace - and now, you can give him three sentences at a time (maybe even up to five!). You can break it down, discuss it in these smaller bits, get through the page, and he can answer questions about what he read. Don't read it to him- let him do the reading. He can focus and pay attention that way. \n \nWhy these learning differences can't be accepted and worked on, I have no idea. By the end of the school year, we should have those five sentences consistently- that's a whole paragraph at a time. Last I looked, that' show I read- in paragraph units, think about it, then move to the next one. Why does everything have to be such a rush? Yes, it takes me longer to read things. However, I understand them when I am done. I have noticed many folks who read faster, but have to go back and read it again. Which is better? \n \n(The answer is neither. They are just different ways of reading, learning, and gaining understanding.) \n \nSo this coming week, provided no one showers us with any homework, my goal is to do some reading with Joey, and see if I can't get him enjoying books again.

{"date": "Thursday, November 14, 2013", "body": "\nWhen I read Suzanne Wright's blast of autism on Veteran's Day, I was smacked in the face. I was so stunned, furious, and despondent that I haven't been sure what to say. Others of my tribe have been far more on the ball, being able to twist their emotions into words so beautifully, so clearly, so... quickly. All I could do is look at my son and cry. \n \nYes, we are coming out of one of those rough patches. The ones described by Ms. Wright, where you lay awake at night- sometimes sleeping in your livingroom- listening, waiting, your knuckles white and your mind racing. Will he try to get out tonight? Is he safe? What is going on in his head How do I help him? Why can't I seem to get anyone else to understand what he needs? \n \nAnd for a parent, that can quickly devolve into that negative self-talk that Joey wields so well. \n \nWe didn't need any more of it, thank you very much. \n \nSee, Joey is not lost. He isn't some other person, stolen away from us by autism. Autism is part of who Joey is. There is no Joey without autism. He would be a completely different human being than the human being he is now. \n \nJoey is not a tragedy. He needs help, he needs support, he needs love. You know... like the rest of us. The difference is that he needs supports in a different way than most people do, so we can see it- it is more obvious that he has needs, because they aren't readily met. Like so often in our society, others baulk when we move beyond the one-size-fits-all, when we have to individualize and think about what we do and say. Being an academic, I see this problem all the time. It is the problem I tell my students to shy away from. Not all paleolithic painting was made for the same reasons- there is a span of thousands of miles and thousands of years between sites. There can even be a stretch of thousands of years at a  single  site. Saying all the paintings were done according to one theory is just laziness. Plain and simple. \n \nTo think all people learn the same way, think the same way, and are motivated by the same things is laziness. Yes, there is commonality between human experience; but that should not discount the individuality of the human experience. \n \nOur family is not merely existing. We are a growing, loving, living family. In fact, we learn so much from each other, I would venture that having Joey as part of our family has taught us even more than most of those \"normal\" families. Or perhaps we have just learned different things. We explore the idea of being human, the joys of living and breathing and eating and working in new ways, different ways, every single day. \n \nYes, we know families whose children are more disabled by autism than Joey. They aren't just treading water, either. Their experience is different from other families you and I may know, but that doesn't make their experience somehow less. \n \nWe anticipate Joey's next move, moment-to-moment. I have trouble working, because I have to be ready in case Joey needs me. This is not usual among autism families. But I do not wait in despair. I wait, wondering how to help, preparing the tools I need to help- not just Joey, but also those who work with Joey, who are trying hard to learn how to help him and support him in new and effective ways. \n \nDo I get depressed? Sure I do. Does Joey get depressed? You betcha. The mental health system in this country is in shambles, which really doesn't help, either. But that's not an autism problem. That's a society problem. The tragedy isn't that people suffer- that's life. Just ask the Buddha. Been going on since time immemorial. The tragedy is the reluctant of people to move their minds and be creative, and think of others. The problem is Theory of Mind- and it is not the autistics that are having trouble thinking others may be thinking their own thoughts, having their own feelings, and needing their own supports and ideas. It seems to be everybody else having this problem. Funny that. \n \nDo I think something needs to be done to help? That things need to change? That policy needs to be reworked and rethought, so that it is easier and more accepted by society to help Joey and his friends? Sure I do. I think it insane that insurance stops autism coverage at age 7, as if autism came to a screeching halt and that there was nothing more you could do if they are still autistic at age 8. I think it crazy that schools are not properly funded to provide free and appropriate education to EVERYONE, including Joey, yet we seem to be able to spit out money for tanks the army doesn't even use or want. \n \n \nWhen Joey was very small, and first diagnosed, I received a letter from Autism Speaks. It was a fundraising letter, a request for money, with an anecdote of a father with an autistic son. I will never forget it. In the end of the anecdote, about putting his son to bed, the child dies in his sleep. I. Freaked. Out. I called the doctor who had just diagnosed Joey in a blind panic. Nobody said this could kill him, I cried. Nobody said anything like this could happen. Ohnoohnoohnoohnononononono.... \n \nAnd that doctor got back to me almost immediately. The child in the letter died of reasons other than autism. Because kids with autism are also human like the rest of us, they can have other health conditions, too. Some of those conditions can be, unfortunately, fatal, and yet have nothing to do with autism. No need to panic. Joey wasn't going to just stop breathing in the middle of the night because of autism.  \n \nI remember it for two reasons. First,  I will never give a dime to Autism Speaks . They are trying to panic people into giving them money, and they don't even use that money to help people with autism. They systematically ignore autistic people, such as my Joey, and pour money into research of things such as causes and cures. If you are into those things, I would still not give your money to Autism Speaks, simply because they are holding you hostage, emotionally abusing you, to get your money. Emotionally abusing people is wrong. Period.  Spreading panic for raising money is  despicable . \n \nTwo, it was a reminder that not every little thing is an autism thing. Pervasive as it is, Joey is still a human being, and other things can happen, too. He gets colds. He has growing pains. He might even get the flu. Our hyper-vigilance may bring these things to light more often, or faster, than another child or family, but that doesn't mean they are connected with his autism. That is the Truth. \n \nExperiences differ. We have out good days and bad days. We have our good weeks, good months; bad weeks, bad months. You know, like everybody else. We believe we shouldn't have to fight tooth and nail to get society to support Joey and help him be a happy, productive citizen, just as they help everybody else, just in a different way. And I do think we have a social emergency on out hands, because people are too lazy, ignorant, and selfish to change things and help others. However, I can certainly craft a message without a national plan. \n \nTreat others as you would want to be treated. \n \nWhy is that so hard? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-truth-whole-truth-and-nothing-but.html", "title": "\nThe Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing But the Truth\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 05, 2013", "body": "\nI wanted to pop in and give folks a follow-up on the Meeting. This was not an IEP meeting, but one to discuss \"discipline.\" And I have a few important things to say about it. \n \nFor one, I am totally and completely grateful for the people who work directly with Joey, or as I prefer to call it TeamJoey. We only as the New Autism Person, the WonderPara, and Dr. Awesome (the vice-principal) from TeamJoey at this meeting, but we also had the other vice-principal and the principal at this one, because it was a discipline hearing. Also, I took my friend, who is acting as Joey's advocate (and is doing a FANTASTIC job keeping things moving when all I want to do is scream and sob wildly, and who knows what questions to ask), SuperDude. And the best thing I can say for all of these people is the highest praise I have: \n \nThey all love Joey. \n \nSo that's a good place to start. The problem is they have no idea how to help him. I came out of the meeting much happier with New Autism Person, because I felt there were lots of ideas coming from that quarter this time, and that they were definitely against this being a discipline issue. Its a disability issue, not a discipline issue. But I think I've already discussed that, right? \n \nFinding that professionals do not know what to do in their professional capacity, however, is something I always find disturbing. Yes, they asked questions. So did we. The principal was accommodating, but a bit on the boast-side of being so, since I had specifically met with them before the year started about this exact very possible problem, and was told everything would be oh-so-fine. And I did get to look them in the eye and say, \"you know, at home, every time Joey has a meltdown, I did something wrong. Every. Time.\" Because you know what? You don't punish someone else when you make a mistake. And Joey is the child. I am the adult. Doing the right things to de-escalate and support him is my job. Not his.  \n \nTeaching him to self-regulate and cope, so that when he is an adult and it does become his job he can do what is needful, is also key. It's also in his IEP. Punishing a child for failing at a lesson before he's been taught it is also wrong. \n \nThis is why using positive, proactive strategies is so critical. Try not to have the meltdown in the first place. If it starts, be ready. Try to counter-act, but be ready in case it spirals to a Level 10. KNow what to do to keep everyone safe. \n \nThis is what I am asking for. Don't suspend him. Teach him. \n \nNow, we move on to another IEP (we already have the FBA underway). So I am putting together a Manual of Joey, to do some JoeyTraining, since what I've done so far has been... not ignored, but not taken to heart, either. \n \nI'm a teacher, after all. I can do this. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/11/follow-up-meeting.html", "title": "\nFollow-up: The Meeting\n"},

{"date": "Monday, November 04, 2013", "body": "\nI sit here, waiting. I had to cancel my work shift. There is no way I am going to risk scoring exams today, those are people's lives on the line. So I wait. \n \nI haven't slept. I passed out for about an hour, but not slept. I spent the night trying to track down anything I can find online about autism, anxiety, aggression, meltdowns, positive behavioral interventions, you get the picture. I need to go to the library and get real information, but that got spun out, too, because Andy is sick. \n \nAllan got a phone call Friday, while I was at work.\u00a0 There was something about discipline, and an incident on Friday, and needing to discuss an earlier suspension. There was confusion about the phrase \"need to meet before Joey returns to school.\" Of course, I went there at once, but no one was there on a Friday afternoon at 5pm. I emailed. I called. I finally got a response, with this same phrase in it, at 6pm on Sunday night. I emailed back as soon as I got that email, about 20 minutes after it was sent, to get clarification. I got no response. \n \nSo this morning, I had no idea if the bus was coming or not. I decided to act as if it was, and went through the normal morning routine. We were in luck. The bus came. No meltdown over that, but with my nerves, Joey picked right up on red flags- he was brittle. I emailed the school, but that did about as much good as it apparently usually does to tell them anything- none at all. \n \nThe phone rang. My heart dropped. Joey is having trouble at school. Joey's advocate can't get to school until 1, but can't I move it up? No, I can't. No advocate, no meeting. I'm not going in there, after having loaded them already with information about why they shouldn't be suspending my kid, without that advocate. There needs to be somebody on Joey's side in there who has had some sleep.  \n \nAnd then there was the reports this morning. h, I finally get the \"report\" I was supposed to get on Friday, but that teacher \"doesn't know what happened in ISS\", that was the para. So I ask for a report from the para, and get told, oh, the para doesn't send emailed reports. But she is the only one with the information. I am not walking into a meeting with admin with no information, how would that be fair to Joey? \n \nFour times in four weeks. They have suspended him four times in four weeks. \n \nWith all this, how can he possibly be safe? How can he possibly be in a proper environment? If they keep suspending him, doesn't that say, loud and clear, that they cannot handle him or support him properly? And yet, if I go get him, the school \"wins\" because they don't have to provide him with his education and services for the day. Or the week. Or whatever. They don't have to service him when he is suspended, because, well, he's suspended. \n \nI should have have pulled him from this system three years ago, when we first saw him regress from lack of support. He left second grade a happy, healthy kid, well on the road to being a functional, self-regulating person, ahead in almost every academic subject. Star in math, star in spelling, reading on the sixth grade level. Able to walk independently between classrooms, between class and cafeteria, between class and bus. I should have pulled him when, come September, none of that was possible. I should have hired a lawyer. I should have gotten him into a better school situation. I should have insisted on the model that worked for him: academics in the morning with teachers well-versed in Joey's needs and with his para on standby, lunch at noon, afternoons with autism-specific resource services. I should have done something. Anything. \n \nAnything but this. The waiting. The wondering. What is happening to him? What is he feeling? How is he being treated?  Is he safe???  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/11/real-terrorism.html", "title": "\nReal Terrorism\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, September 07, 2013", "body": "\nYes, I have something else to say in this matter. And it is a matter that comes up way too often. To be clear and honest, having it come up even once is \"way too often.\" For it to keep happening, for there to be whole web pages dedicated to the lives lost because there are lives shattered and lost is \"way too often\" by an exponential of \"way\". And I have something more to say on the matter.  \n \nThat is the growing war between Families and Self-Advocates. It is a war that is not only devastating and horrible as any other war, leaving useless casualties in its wake, but it is completely self-defeating and purposeless as it is being waged. Instead of growing understanding and co-support, lines get hardened and people get terrorized. Both sides, people. Terrorized on BOTH sides. \n \nThe real problem is a misunderstanding of how we both contribute to our common goal: getting people who know nothing of the matter and are in need of education and compassion to move further along on the path to that ultimate goal, acceptance and understanding. If we could achieve that goal, that ultimate understanding that All People Are People- and it is, unfortunately, still a  highly  radical idea on all fronts- then most of this would go away. It would be so much better in our world, where people would be properly supported, educated, and employed as they needed, and everybody just took others as they are, instead of how they think others and even they themselves should be. Imagine it. Just take a minute to imagine if you could just be you, and get what you needed, and even if people don't  like  you, they at least  understand  you. And you, them. Just think about it. Imagine it. That's where we want to be. No, I'm wrong. That is where we  need  to be.  \n \nThe job of a self-advocate is daunting. They have the job of helping people understand this concept that all people are people, and it is their very lives that are on the line. They risk everything to rock the boat. They are, understandably and reasonably so, extremely angry. If the world told you that you were subhuman wastes of resources and oxygen, and reminded you of this opinion every single minute of every single day of your life, you'd be angry, too. People deal with anger in many different ways, and self-advocacy is an important one for fixing the problem, at its very core. They are the people who understand, despite being told otherwise all their lives for generations immemorial, that they are people. They are the ones who know it best, and can teach it best. That is their job- to watch and guard their personhood, and communicate it to those who don't understand. And ultimately, that is everybody. \n \nSelf-advocates are at a wide variety of places and understandings in themselves, in their roles, and in their methods and reactions. Folks, this is as it should be, and must be. We all must understand that, or we get no where and start masticating ourselves, like Saturn devouring his children.\u00a0  \n \nThe job of a family advocate- usually a parent- is to make sure that personhood is respected and try to translate missed messages between the self-advocates and the ignorant, often hostile people who haven't understood that All People Are People. And parents, like self-advocates, are also fighting that deeply ingrained social lesson, so thoroughly accepted by the followers of Ayn Rand, that some people don't count. Some people are lesser, and trash to be used and tossed. And if they aren't useful and productive, or useful and productive to a certain standard, they are wastes of time, resources, and effort. How thoroughly our society and culture has swallowed this! Yet when you have that loved one in front of you, how incredibly fast you learn how ugly a lie this is. People are people, and they, every single one of them, have worth, value, and deserve respect, love, and support. And we know how hard it can be when you are fighting battles for someone else. Parents and family advocates are angry. Their job is to protect those who cannot protect themselves, and protect the rights of those who cannot fight for themselves, against those who do not understand, and think others are a waste of time. And ultimately... that is everybody.  \n \nRarely is a lesson learned in complete epiphany. It is a process, and parent-advocates are at a variety of stages and places in the learning process. They have a variety of methods and reactions, and a variety of learning styles. As is should and must be. We all must understand that, or we get no where.  \n \nPillorying each other is not going to help. Teaching and learning is a process that takes time, effort, and support of each other. We need to face obstacles that are complex and make sure we all get through this together, as best we can. We will all make mistakes. We need to keep it civil and supportive between ourselves, or we just end up crucifying each other, reinforcing the idea that some people are not worth effort, or time, or resources. It is self-defeating to try to silence other voices. \n \nSelf-advocates, keep up the good work. In these times of crisis, keep up your voice. There is no excuse for killing anyone. All people are people. Keep educating, keep pushing, keep making sure the message is out there. \n \nFamily-advocates, keep up the good work. In these times of crisis, keep up your voice. There are reasons people become desperate, and until we all understand All people are people, we need to try to strip away the other obstacles that keep our loved ones in the silence. Keep pushing for services and understanding. Keep getting the message out there. \n \nAnd together, we can get this done. I believe it.

{"date": "Wednesday, September 11, 2013", "body": "\nJoey had a hard day. \n \nWe started with me running some advil over to him for a (highly unusual) headache at school. He got better, there were reports of unusual behavior- OK, but unusual- all day. Then he came home. \n \nThat's when, as usual, the Witching Hour began. It just never let up. \n \nSo when I caught him with his tablet after lights out, and he lost the privilege for three days (second time he's been caught!), it was not a surprise to us to be facing a Level 10 meltdown. \n \nYep. Long day. \n \nSo I'm grappling with his self-deprecation and other unpleasant language, and trying to stay quiet (trying to do social skills work at 11pm on a school night is just not a good battle choice), when JoeyAndyDad comes in, singing \" I Wanna Be Like You .\" \n \nOne of our strategies for pulling Joey out of meltdown spiral is complete distraction and redirection. This is more difficult than it sounds, because you are trying to address a potentially explosive situation, and you can be so focused there, that it can be hard to come up with something to distract. Completely random, unexpected behavior, however, is a good trick for us. It kind of sets a shock to Joey's system. Here he is, upset about his tablet and not wanting to sleep and wanting his game and not feeling well and AAAAAAA.... and here is his father, singing and pretending to be an orangutan. You might see how that might be distracting. \n \nAnd then we broke into a duet of \"Bare Necessities\", and having been Baloo in his play, how could Joey resist joining in? And then giggling? And then getting mad because he is giggling when he is supposed to be mad, which then makes him giggle more? \n \nSometimes, you just have to pick your battles.

{"date": "Sunday, November 03, 2013", "body": "\nTrying to fight for understanding of both Joey and Andy everywhere is a daunting task, often an overwhelming effort of fighting prejudice so ingrained, so pervasive, so accepted in our culture and society that we find ourselves at a loss for explaining why it is so inherently wrong. Our culture's experience and even language is geared to fully accepting the discrimination, takes the prejudice as accepted and fact, weaves it into the fabric of even basic communication and understanding. \n \nIt has been really rearing its ugly face this month, too. Joey has been suspended, either in or out of school four times in the last month.  Four times.  He has been so overwhelmed by anxiety that he has lashed out in frustration, melted down, with power, violence, and vehemence, that they have removed him and kept him out of his classroom- and once out of school- FOUR. TIMES. We're averaging once a week. I can't see how, even if this was a situation of simple \"bad\" behavior, this would be viewed as effective or acceptable; but being that Joey is autistic, and related to that has a severe anxiety disorder, it is simply insane. \n \nYes, I know he hit adults, shouted obscenities, and did some other things that were unexpected and inappropriate in his frustration and desperation. Yes, he was able to communicate that he wanted to go home, and did most of these things with that goal in mind. If  you  were trapped in a haunted funhouse of freaks and wanted out, you might try anything you knew would get people to help you leave, too- anything you've seen or experienced as successful in  getting you the hell out of there . Having the freaks tell you that you aren't allowed to leave and have to do strange, overwhelming tasks (or monotonous, pointless tasks) you know are impossible for you to do that moment, upon pain of scorn and punishment (or even if they try to bribe you into doing the impossible tasks) would probably make you fight harder, or try something more desperate and energetic. Like hitting them. Like running out of the room, or trying to escape the building. \n \nNow imagine you've been in the funhouse for years, and have to go through this every day, with no end in sight. \u00a0  \n \nSee, Joey is disabled, and that disability includes issues of handling anxiety, processing sensory information, and regulating emotion. It also includes problems with effective communication, though I more and more suspect that is a problem that cuts both ways- he has trouble communicating, and people around him don't put in the effort to understand, which makes it a frustrating spiral of nonsense. He lives his entire life like Alice in the Mirrorworld, only he never wakes up from it. Wonderland and Mirrorworld are the realities he has to learn to deal with. And I'm not talking about the fluffified Disney version, either. I don't think it any wonder that these kids struggle with depression and anxiety. I don't think it any real wonder that Joey has been struggling with depression and anxiety for years now. \n \nTrying to explain this disability, and the need for supports, to other people shouldn't be hard. However, I find it is like trying to have a long talk with the Caterpillar. After a while, you wonder who is the one not making any sense. \n \nWe have friends who are in wheelchairs. Yes, they are trying to learn to walk. However, I have never seen anybody punish them for not walking across the room, even just once; or take their chairs away for a day, because hey, they won't die without them, right?  \n \nThis happens to Joey all the time. \n \nWho would put the Deaf child in the regular ed classroom without an interpreter, because hey, they're smart, and shouldn't they be able to read lips? Why isn't that good enough for them to understand this new science lesson? Or maybe we can throw them in with an interpreter, but we don't offer signing lessons. What, don't Deaf people use sign to communicate? Why doesn't this child understand sign automatically? \n \nThis happens to Joey even  more  of the time.  \n \nAnd really, it boils down to autism being invisible. You can't  see  it. You can see clearly that our friends cannot walk. You can see their legs and feet aren't developed for it, and you can see they struggle when they try, even with fancy walkers and supports. A Deaf child tossed into a hearing classroom without support is also obvious. It's ridiculous. It is so ridiculous, it's stunning how often it actually and really happens- after all, you can't usually tell someone is Deaf by looking at them. \n \nAutism is invisible. You can't  see  the processing problems, the neurological differences. The facets you  can  see are often overlooked- for example, Joey's weight, which is a combination of metabolic difference (due to neurological difference), dyspraxia, and sensory disorders (Joey is sensory-seeking with oral stimulation), is often just overlooked as too much ice cream and credited to laziness, bad parenting, or whatever, because our society is so totally accepting of weight discrimination and fat shaming. (Autistic kids who have the opposite issue, where they may be neophobic or otherwise don't eat or absorb calories, move constantly, have a high metabolism, etc. also are not seen to have any real \"issue\" either, because our society loves thinness and values it- so those kids get no help or support, either). The uneven ability to access skills is ignored by the adults who should be helping him and teaching him. \n \nIt's even in his IEP. Goal: to be able to cope with stress using behaviors appropriate and acceptable in a classroom. It's right there in his contract. He's learning to do this. Expecting him to do it is like tossing  Alice in Wonderland  at a kindergartener and expecting them to read it, because hey, aren't they learning to read? \n \nThen punish them if they don't read it perfectly, aloud, in front of the whole class. Punish them in a very visible way, one that students find particularly threatening or humiliating. Like, say, sending them to the office and suspending them.  \n \nThink of how those other students might feel, seeing what happens. \n \nWhy are people shocked by meltdowns? Why aren't school staff extensively trained to deal with them? After all, it's not just autistic kids who have them. \n \nImagine how you'd feel.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/11/out-of-sight-out-of-mind.html", "title": "\nOut of sight, out of mind\n"},

His emotional and social development is as splintered as so many of his other skill sets- advanced, delayed, and everything in-between. The world holds a lot of frustrations for my little man, and self-regulation can be problematic. \n \nReading about caregivers who murder their autistic children is not only terrifying, depressing, and frustrating, it is horrifying to see how many people believe that such murders are justified. Lack of services, lack of support, the child was getting big, aggressive, unmanageable... people, these are not good reasons to murder someone.Would it be acceptable if the victim of the murder was not disabled? NO. And believe me,  lots  of teenagers can seen big, aggressive, and unmanageable, without being autistic. Somehow, when the victim is disabled, is autistic, all the sudden the caregiver becomes the victim, and victim becomes... what? The aggressor? \n \nYes, the aggressor. That is what we can conclude by the \"poor caregiver!\" attitude prevalent in these news items: the person murdered brought it on themselves, by being big and \"unmanageable\" and needing care and services. They get swept aside as a sort of sacrifice to our society's greed and cold capitalism. After all, people with disabilities are often seen as a drain on society, needing support and services and hey those things cost money and poor caregivers... \n \nYes, we need to fix the services, and make it easier to get services. But we shouldn't be murdering children to prove that point. No one should have to be some kind of sacrificial lamb, dismissed as a blood offering to... who? Our poor, poor taxpayers? \n \nJoey is getting big. He's getting increasingly frustrated. Teen angst isn't going to help. He's come at me before. He's likely to come at me again.

Just do what is needful, as best I can. \n \nThere is no excuse for murdering a person over \"lack of services.\" Being a teenager is not an excuse to murder a person.

That is the common claim that, somehow, a lack of services is an excuse to murder your child. It is not. \n \nWhat I find more frustrating is how those services are described: services for the family, services for the parents, if only that mom had more support and services... \n \nWhere the system is broken is not in the services the parent needed. As an adult, I take that responsibility for \"services\" myself. It is up to me to put together my network of friends and family, and make it strong. If you are unaware of what services are available to you, I recommend contacting family support services, whatever they are called in your area. In my area, we have a Disability Resource Center, we have the Community Services Board, and our school has a Parent Center. Heck, call the school guidance counselor, they know people to call. If you attend church, mosque, or temple, they are a good place to call. Need an idea of what kinds of services you need? Look into these: a therapist or counselor for talk therapy, respite services, support groups, local activities, and hobby groups (which are good for respite and support). If you can't find someone in the neighborhood to be a buddy, hop online. There are lots of support groups, pages, and people out there to help and welcome you. Even if your child has a rare condition, there is someone, somewhere, who is also looking for someone to talk about it and how it is affecting their family. You are not alone. If nothing else, drop me a line, I'll work on it for you. And since you are out there, check on all the threads in your networks, and make sure they are doing OK. Send them silly cards. Send them virtual hugs. Send them prayers. Whatever you think they need to make sure they are OK, and let them know that if they aren't OK, you want to help, and not judge them. Its kinda like the penny exchange. Have a friend, be a friend; need a friend, here's a friend. We are all in this together, people. Really.  \n \nNo, that's not the broken part. The problem is not in services for me. It is the issue of getting services for my kids (or for your loved one... child, adult, cousin, friend, whomever). Services that they need, they deserve, and they have the right to get. As a society, we are all in this together, and so we all pitch in to provide means and services for those who need it. Fairness and equality is in making sure everyone gets what they need, not in making sure everyone gets the same thing. My kids need support to learn to do things independently and effectively. They need to be taught how to control their temper and communicate their needs effectively. They need speech therapy, occupational therapy, sensory integration therapy, vision therapy, extra teachers, paraprofessionals, and supports. They need certain equipment and specific methods and trained people. And if they get all these things, we will have adults who are as independent and living as well as they can, and contributing to the world around them as much as they can. If they don't, they won't. It really is just that simple. \n \nBut getting the services they need is not that simple. All of these things cost money. Everyone wants to pass the buck and no one wants to help pay for what is needful. Even when the costs are minimal, you have roadblocks: they take time, or patience, or understanding, or other effort that far too many people don't want to expend- mostly because they see your child as a waste of resources. You pay into the pool of medical insurance, but they decide they don't want to pay for the services your child needs to succeed and be independent. They pass it off as educational, and thus for the school to pay for. Or your child makes some progress and is suddenly not disabled enough to be considered eligible for service, even though they remain behind. The doctor prescribes therapy and intervention, but as soon as it starts actually working, the plug is pulled... and this is discrimination at its most devious. When the doctor prescribes a ten-day round of penicillin, the insurance company doesn't just pay for two days, since that's when your symptoms improve. You have to take the whole ten days, or the infection recurs, and often worse than before and penicillin-resistant. You may even need to take medication for an extended illness until the doctor proclaims you cured. But if your doctor prescribes occupational therapy, the company can simply stop paying- without recourse or warning- because they decide you seem to be improving. Or they can chop you off arbitrarily, whether you are better or not. Shouldn't my doctor be deciding if I am done with my cure or not? \n \nThen the schools. Holy crap, trying to wrench your child's rights and services from the schools, it is enough to make you scream in the night. Even if you find a method that works, you have to fight for it each and every time, each and every grade, each and every teacher, each and every school. Ignorance is rampant, at every level. And then they tell you that a service is medical, not educational, so they don't have to provide that, you have to go through your medical insurance. You know, the insurance that just denied the service because it's educational. \n \nAnd you know what? Medicaid and respite services are not for the mom and dad. They are for the person with the disability. There is a new person to check on them and work with them, and the caregivers get some breathing time to recharge so they are better able to help. Respite helps keep everybody healthy.  \n \nThe constant battle to maintain the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is wretched, ugly, and depressing. Depression kills. \n \nAnd it is all completely unnecessary. If we valued our neighbors, our people, we would be investing in making sure their rights to life, liberty, and education were being met and upheld. Instead, schools hold bakesales to make ends meet. When a treatment becomes available and is prescribed, the person should be able to access it- the FULL treatment, without having to resort to bankruptcies (when the family goes bankrupt, how do you think that effects the person in need of support?), community fundraisers, and war with bureaucracies at every turn. My children should not suffer because I am a poor politician, or a bad negotiator, or even if I'm a complete ass. They should get what they need, and the supports that are their right. Period. \n \nThe reason they don't, the reason parents have to go to war and wage constant battle to get those rights respected is because too many people do not see people with disabilities as people. They see them as lesser, as wastes of resources, wastes of time. Or they view them as somehow forever children, to be patted on the head and seen, but not heard. They are seen as drains on budgets and stretchings of staffing, rather than as people with needs. The supports are viewed as advantages and perks, rather than access. \n \nIt always amazes me, however, how many of these roadblocks wear glasses. They would be aghast if I arbitrarily declared they were not permitted to wear their glasses during my IEP meetings, because those glasses give them unfair advantage, and look ugly, and do they REALLY need them, anyway? But they have no problem saying this about the accommodations our kids need. And adult support services? Talk about leaving people out in the cold... \n \nSo we need to start tackling these problems, from a lot of different angles. Everyone needs to understand that people are people. No exceptions there. That my kid has the same right to live and be educated in this country as any other kid in this country. Then we need people to understand the important in investing in that education, and the education system. At the same time, we need to make sure adequate and appropriate support services are in place so that everyone gets what they need, when they need it, and for the full course of the need. No one should be scrambling to pay for their last eight days of penicillin. \n \nAs parents, we need to know, to our very core, that our children are precious, and the owners of themselves and their own lives. We have no right to take that away from them, for any reason. Even when we make mistakes. Even if we are jerks and horrible at our jobs. Even if THEY are jerks and make mistakes. If we can't understand that through every fiber of our being, how can we expect those who stand in complete ignorance to ever understand it? You can't teach what you don't know. \n \nYour children are my children. Your families are my family. We must understand the preciousness and respect the lives of all of us. Check on each other. Keep an eye on your own life and fatigue levels. Watch for depression to sprout up around you, and take steps to protect those who fall to it. If you feel you made a mistake, come to the boards and post it out, and we'll rally to try to figure it out and fix it. Because we love you, we love your kid(s), we love your family and your community. And we are all in this together. \n \nUnited we must stand. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/09/no-excuses-part-two.html", "title": "\nNo Excuses: Part Two\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, July 16, 2013", "body": "\nI live in a world where we question and challenge basic assumptions all around us, every day, simply by existing. We challenge what people think it means to be human, to be intelligent, to be functional, to be autistic, to be \"normal\", to be happy. We make these challenges because it becomes quickly obvious that our lives and experiences are different from what appears to be a vast majority of how those around us think, feel, and experience the world around them. \n \nI have lived my life this way. \n \nWhen I was very young, I figured out very quickly that I understood the world, other people, and even space differently than other people around me. It has been a constant struggle to relate and connect, because I relate differently, I make connections others don't make, I live is a network of connections and assumptions others don't have. As I grew, I found it wonderful to discover other people who, though they didn't see the world like me, still saw it in ways that were unique, interesting, and diverse. This may make for a lot of difficulty trying to connect with other mommies at the park (I'm not fond of  Titanic  and have no interest in reading  Shades of Gray ), but it makes for a wonderful world of friends and experiences- never a dull moment, always something new to think about, even as they fade in and out, coming into focus and out again, spinning like stars in the void, little nestlings, oases if you will, in a vast press of banality. \n \nI may not have many friends, but each of them, I assure you, is a jewel, in their own fascinating facets and flaws. We hang together like Indra's Net, a constant glint and dazzle of cosmic gems. Meeting a new friend is always a wonder for me, an earthshaking event to be marveled at, wondered about, explored, and relished. \n \nSome years ago, I stopped by a friend's house; I was bringing her something, and just stopped for delivery. She was having a little book club in her house. They were discussing a book I had never heard of, but I was invited to stay because it had some connections to South Asia and my friend knew I am a South Asianist. I would say I was one of the few neighborhood women who hadn't been included in the club invitation- which for me is par for the course, really.  \n \nThe scene they were describing was, to me, almost surreal. A man had kidnapped a kid and apparently forced the child to be some kind of sex slave (no, really) and had somehow managed to injure the child and thus put in the hospital (people read these books?), where he was now lamenting that bad things always happened to him (not the kid, to himself), and how terrible and miserable it was that the kid was injured, because now he might have to go without his little sex buddy for a while. \n \nThey got about halfway through this description, and had started on how was feeling badly, and I thought sure this was going to be a moment when he realized what a misery he was making this kid's life and then do something right for a change- but no, the character was a complete and utter selfish jerk who could only think about himself, crying over how he was being inconvenienced. \n \nThen came the part I found really surreal. All of these women started chiming in about how they related to this character, and didn't we all feel this way when things happened? Everybody thinks of their own inconvenience first, their own self first, after all... \n \nAnd I knew, instantly, that I had nothing in common with these women. \n \nThe flippant attitude, the idea that all people are, by nature, selfish and mean, and that everybody feels... well, the way they do- there is something inherently arrogant in that. I won't judge them based on a single conversation about a single character in a single book, either- the scene I describe is not absolute in who in that room I ultimately liked or disliked or whatever. It was just a keen, and somewhat embarrassing, reminder of differences, and the fact that other assume everyone else is like themselves. \n \nWhich brings us to this week. \n \nThere have been a lot of broad brushing, painful, ugly generalizations running rampant over the internet, as buttons have been pushed and surprises popped upon us. I get tired of reading them. Whenever I see those catch phrases, they make me cringe, make me somehow angry that everyone assumes all people see things the same way: \"Just admit it...\" \"You know you do...\" \"We all do/feel/know it...\" The article that assumes all white people get defensive when they see a black kid in a hoodie at night. The article that assumes at all autistic people want to be \"cured.\" The article that assumes all men want to have a affair. The article that assumes everybody thinks of themselves first. \n \nI now put out my own broad-brushing, painful, ugly assumption: people who assume everyone is a selfish, selfist jackass tend to be selfish, selfist jackasses. \n \nAnd I don't like being told I am a selfish, selfist jackass by people who are selfish, selfist jackasses, and know nothing about me, or how I see the world, or what I experience through my own senses and thoughts and emotions. Studying culture and society and how they color and influence experience and understanding is interesting and fascinating- but even more so are those who stand out, who help us question what is cultural and what is not, and what it really means to live and to be. \n \nWhich brings me back to my friends, my family, and my sons, and why I find them fascinating and wonderful. Keep thinking, folks. Keep questioning. Keep wondering. \n \n Challenge those assumptions .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/07/assumptions-and-point-of-view.html", "title": "\nAssumptions and the Point of View\n"},

I have boys home to squish and make snow cream and watch movies and eat popcorn. The making of popcorn is one of our great achievements since I saw you all last.

So did the meeting.  \n \nWhen we set up this meeting, I was unhappy about the idea that we were getting together at 2pm to \"look at the data and decide what to do.\" I asked for the data and a draft of what they thought they should do before the meeting, but that didn't happen. So I had no idea what the data would look like, had no time to process it, and was unable to have my own professionals look over it and discuss it so I could be a useful team member. We actually spent a lot of time talking about how the behaviors that originally set al this in motion have mostly ceased. You know, the threatening language, cussing, and self-deprecation. In fact, during their 2 weeks of data, he had mostly \"good days.\"  \n \nAnd so the meeting was a waste of time.  \n \nThe only thing I could get across to anybody was the need to help Joey communicate when he is on the brink of being overwhelmed, because you can't tell by looking at him. So they agreed for him to have a notebook with his well-being check-in color and number scale, and have him do regular checks of where he is on the scale, and possibly talk about why (so he can connect emotions to things that happen and proper language). The idea is that this will help him process and communicate, to avoid the behaviors.  \n \nGreat.  \n \nMost of the meeting was filling out a form about these behaviors and lack of data, which can mostly be summed up as \"Joey is autistic.\" To the point they'd say something and I wanted to say, \"NUH! He's AUTISTIC!!!\" or write \"Look! My autism is showing!\" I mean, seriously, just write \"autistic\" across the paper and be done with it.  \n \nAnd what is the plan should he have another meltdown incident?  \n \nOh, well, um... that wasn't discussed.  \n \nI had no urges to throttle anyone.

{"date": "Monday, May 20, 2013", "body": "\nWe lost two beautiful lives this week. Mikaela was lost in California, Owen in Florida, and both to the nightmare we have discovered for our own family: eloping.  \n \n And to those families, who have been slammed with the judgment of the ignorant on top of the pain of losing their beloved children, I say this: You are not alone. We are praying hard for you, and know it could easily be us next.  \n \nThere are several reasons kids with autism elope. There is the fright-flight response to stress and anxiety. There is the wandering behavior of their own curiosity and lack of impulse control (for those of you who think autistic people aren't curious, come stay with us for a few days. We can debunk that one for you super-quick.) There is the active attempt for escape and retreat, the need for freedom and control of a life that is often controlled by everyone else around them. All of these can be exacerbated by other skill delays- communication, social, sensory... the list goes on.  \n \n What we have learned as parents is that you can't have eyes everywhere. Safety issues can arise when you least expect them. Constant vigilance is absolutely essential- and not enough.  \n \nJoey can disappear in seconds. A blink of an eye. A minute of distraction. A moment of panic. Or those five minutes when you think, you are so sure, that everything is locked up and all is fine and you can get that sip of water or that moment to pee or that second to actually acknowledge your other child's existence, only to find he's discovered a way out. You didn't even know he was stressed enough to want out, and he's gone.  \n \n He's faster than you think, too. I made the mistake not long ago of assuming I could walk to the end of the street and would see him turning whichever corner he encountered next. He was already out of sight even of that corner. I think he may have even ducked between houses, but he could have simply begin to run the minute my eyes had been turned from him. By the time the immediate area was checked, he was long gone. We knew his paths and his favorite destinations, and we were incredibly lucky. We found him.  \n \n49% of families with autistic loved ones go through the panic, the terror, the pain of those minutes, those hours, when the person is gone. The rate is  four times  that of a non-autistic child.  \n \nWe have been lucky, and we have always found Joey, safe and sound. From 2009-2011, 22 families in the USA were not so fortunate. 91% of those unfortunate families lost their autistic wanderer to drowning. The other two were stuck by a vehicle.  \n \n Both are outcomes that are awfully close to home. We live a few blocks from a large river, a smaller creek, and several pools. My mom's property is edged by a smaller river. When Joey escaped from us on the beach two years ago, we found him on the beach, in the breakers. He had gotten out because each adult thought another was watching him, while my husband and I went for a short walk along the boardwalk, a rare few minutes alone together. He was missed within about five minutes. The time of the search gave Joey plenty of time of cross the sand.  \n \nThose are the minutes people dismiss. Gone in a second, and then you begin the search. That search takes time. And each minute you haven't located them is another minute they are heading in an unknown direction, and into those dangers that can be fatal. A bolt into the street. A slip into the water.  \n \n Once you get through the ignorant people screaming that you should have had your doors locked (as if you didn't) and your eyes on them (as if you could stare at anything 24/7/365), you then have the helpful folks recommending preventatives, like Project Lifesaver.  \n \nThis is a program where they fit your loved one with a GPS, and you call the police when the loved one elopes, and they can then find them quickly. Sound good? It is. Except that the program is completely volunteer, and there is not enough equipment to go around, and not always enough manpower at the local level to run it. The police officer who came to our house in August when Joey disappeared pressed us to get into the program, and friends had been praising it as saving their own wanderers for some time. We called. We were promised we'd have it within a week.  \n \nWe're still waiting.  \n \n Families of Mikaela and Owen, and to those other 22 families, and the ones before and since, who have lost their children, we stand with you. We grieve for your loss and pain.

We hadn't seen him in a while.  \n \nThe program is entirely volunteer, and entirely free. That's right- free. They are serving families already overwhelmed with costs of therapy and care, therapies and interventions that medical insurance often sees as \"not medically necessary\" (because apparently being able to do things like speak, move, and interact are not medically necessary- what?) or \"experimental\" (translate= the insurance company hasn't updated their library of studies done in years, and are perfectly willing to completely ignore the progress and improvements your kid has made with an intervention) and the schools are too overwhelmed to offer. Even small accommodations can cost money. We've just had to put up a new gate to our yard because Joey figured out how to climb over the old one- that's $700 just so we can let him play in the back yard. Our house has double-key locks, we had to install them. We may have to install a security system just to keep Joey safe. We've been waitlisted for  Project Lifesaver  since August; we've had two major bolts since then (when he was gone for more than 20 minutes and we had to bring in others to help search for him, and he was found more than a quarter mile away) and several smaller escapes since that August incident. To get one ourselves? About $150 for a device, plus a monthly service fee. And even the best of these devices - downright cheap compared to the ones used by the police and Project Lifesaver- is a gamble for whether or not it will work properly. Compared to other families we see, we get off fairly inexpensively, too. We just do OT/social skills group and speech/language, plus these smaller interventions. We had to pay out-of-pocket for a round of vision therapy (that was AWESOME). But we're not on special diets or doing horse therapy or art therapy or music therapy or having to get a service dog. Joey doesn't have any attendants at home (except me and JoeyAndyDad and Grandma). We don't get respite care. All of those things cost money- a  lot  of money.  \n \nAnd no, there aren't huge studies to say this program makes everything all better, or any long-term improvements. But I can tell you, it makes the world a better place- even if it is just for half an hour, for one boy.

On top of that, the job that has been the stopgap for some of this is ending... today. Jus gave the final exam this morning. Eep. This puts a serious damper on planning for summer and therapy schedules. My current plan is for me to eat less and cook more as a money-saving strategy (and a health strategy- I really do not need a bedtime snack. Seriously.)  \n \nAt the same time, my boys keep growing, and it is time to plan for new experiences and getting them re-familiar with old favorites. We need to start thinking about colonial history when we go to Wakefield and Williamsburg. We need to explore more science a Skyline Drive and the Smithsonian. WE need to start appreciating and understanding the world around us at the next level, beyond that early recognition of novelty.  \n \nThat is more difficult for my kids than for most. It takes more planning, more preparation, and more readiness.  \n \nAndy has a field trip to the zoo coming up. Hes asked me to go. If I don't get picked as a formal chaperone, I will likely drive up on my own. I will have my Zoo Bag ready and with me: extra water, fruit snacks, crackers, cheese sticks, a noisemaker, a squishy ball, paper and markers, a damp cloth, wipes, and a spare set of clothes and sunglasses. Most of my friends haven't carried a Zoo Bag with them to the zoo since their kids were infants. They often toss some wipes and a camera into their purse or pack and off they go with their nine-year-olds. THey aren't fighting a constant battle against  Glassman, RockBrain, and HyperBunny . Their kids remember their underwear.  \n \nAll too often, they don't understand the difference between a high-energy kid and a hyperactive one. They don't get that there is more to ADHD than just bouncing off the walls. And they aren't afraid to say it. Society gives them license to say it. Not only is my kid's special need invisible, it is openly denied to exist at all. Yay, me.  \n \nLooking down those questionnaires, the vague \"often/sometimes/never\" of screens and evals, knwing that each and every answer needs qualification and context, more specific information to really understand, you want to think the folks who score them will understand. I have learned otherwise- the hard way. Hard for my boys.  \n \nThe good thing is it also gives me a better idea of how to help. Thee evals are reminders of skills and challenges, things that may need to be addressed and supported that we might forget are challenges for my guys. They serve as a reminder that expectations should be high, but you need to plan for success- it doesn't always come intuitively. That more often than not, we are still packing our Zoo Bag for situations other families have long taken for granted and easy. We need to be prepared to succeed. After all, India is wonderful, and beautiful, and full of life, color, and the scents of ginger and cardamom. We enjoy it as it is, as long as we don't expect it to be the Mediterranean. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.socialthinking.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/05/where-air-is-filled-with-sandalwood.html", "title": "\nWhere The Air Is Filled With Sandalwood\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 17, 2013", "body": "\n Brother to Brother  \nHand in hand \nThey wend down to the water \nAcross the sand.  \n \n \nI don't think there have ever been two brothers more loving of each other than Joey and Andy. There may, in this world, be equals, but none greater. It simply would be impossible.  \n \nI won't say they get along all the time. Their abilities, their challenges, their personalities, their differences preclude complete harmony at all levels and all times. Like anyone else in constant close quarters with huge amounts of trust between them, they bicker and fight and let it all out. But it doesn't cleave between them. They are brother to brother, always.  \n \nEven when they were very little, there was that understanding between them. Joey didn't let kids pick on Andy; he protected his brother, hugged on him, loved him. And Andy didn't let people exclude Joey. He stopped and explained the game, let Joey catch up and catch on. Andy is more of a dynamic player now, with less patience to wait for Joey to join in and catch on; but then, he's 8, not 18. And he almost always invites Joey to play- periodically, throughout the time at the park or wherever.  \n \nThey were both out of sorts at soccer yesterday, no doubt about it. Andy was brittle, to the point the coach came over and asked for my advice (and he's ADHD, too, so he has some grasp on how to deal with ADHD kids). Joey was bored and tired and hungry. I knew I had a brewing disaster on my hands, and had called in the cavalry, but it was 20 minutes away.  \n \nAndy was scowling, kicking a ball back and forth across the field while the other kids were doing some exercises that involved jumping over the ball alot. It was an exercise he was not very good at, and that frustrated him all the more. It was time for intervention to bring Andy to a better place so he could participate. I moved to intercept him, and he turned midfield and started away from me. I waited. He turned to come back across the field in his pattern, looked up, and with a grumpy frown, pointed and grunted. A flick of my eyes to the bench where Joey had been, now empty, told me the issue. Now Andy made a louder noise, no words yet, but with more distress in his face.  \n \n\"I can't go deal with him until you stop this unexpected behavior and do what you are expected to be doing,\" I explained calmly, but firmly. I knew Joey was headed to the bridge that went to another set of playfields, but there was a set path; I would be able to catch him without much difficulty. Andy, however, did not know the path beyond that bridge- and he took off at a run to catch his brother. Grumpy, tired, and irritable as he was, to him, Joey was in danger.  \n \nAt least they'll now be moving in the same direction, was my initial, very tired and irritable, thought as I trotted after him. I didn't put on speed because I wanted Andy to catch Joey first. It was important that Andy, once alarmed, was able to feel like he did something. I learned that a while back. He needed to be part of helping Joey when Joey was distressed. It actually helps him to do something that seems useful, instead of having to cower in his room during a meltdown or stand in panicked indecision during a bolt.  \n \nAnd two minutes later, they came back across the bridge, hand-in-hand. I could hear them talking to each other about expected and unexpected behavior. Andy was upbraiding Joey for his \"unexpected running.\" Joey was telling Andy he was \"expected to be playing soccer now.\"  \n \nAndy went back to his team. Joey came back to the bench. And the world righted itself for a few precious minutes.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VznxM9j--tM/UW9vjWksFsI/AAAAAAAAFWM/o6hRmp77Ryw/s1600/beachboys.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/04/autism-understanding-yet-another-day.html", "title": "\nAutism Understanding: Yet Another Day\n"},

If you know me, you know what a huge thing I am saying. Absolutely, positively unique; no one sees the world quite the way he does, and the intensity with which he loves people around him can sometimes be overwhelming. He likes thing in his own way, in his own time.  \n \nAnd once you grasp the absolutely uniqueness of everyone around you, and especially Joey, I think you will find the world is a fascinating, intense place.  \n \nJoey has a way of walking right up to people and just starting talking, as if he's known them all his life. It takes people by surprise, unexpected and often disconcerting to strangers. However, it is very rare for them not to smile, if they give him a minute, listen to what he has to say, listen to the love and friendship and acceptance he is offering. I can tell a lot about a person in how they react to Joey; the first three seconds when he walks up and accepts them as people, just as they are. Will they repay the compliment, the kindness, the love, or not? It often turns out to be all I need to know.  \n \nAs we enter April, I ask you to move beyond just \"Autism awareness\" and into \"Autism understanding.\" Take a minute and listen to what Joey has to offer you.

When we first started  Challenger's Baseball , Joey knew nothing about baseball. He didn't know how to hold a bat, what a base was, or even how to run- at 6 years old, he was still using a toddler trot. He took to it like a fish in water. There were high school baseball players out helping, people cheering, and holy cow, it's  fun ! Joey lights up on game day. His running and movement improves drastically between the beginning and end of the season (unfortunately, he often doesn't retain that progress out of season). He thanks the \"big players\" for helping.  \n \nOur local program has expanded to 8 teams, so the smaller and older players are now separated. Joey moved up to the Big Kids teams this past fall. Unfortunately, his best baseball friend is a year behind him, and so no longer on his team. He got to see her Opening Day. He was overheard telling her, \"There is nothing more important than our friendship!\"  \n \nThis summer, I am going to again attempt a little program to help Joey connect with friends and think about them, even when they are not immediately present- through letter-writing. I thought I might even set up an email account for him, so he can start thinking about how to use it and learn the rules of email use and etiquette. Joey is so social, and loves to be around people so much, I am hoping it will make him happy to continue to feel connected to people, even when they are not right in front of him. I thought a bulletin board with photos of his friends might even be a good visual cue for him.  \n \nI'll keep you posted.

I've spent weeks putting together presentations, binders, handouts, and data graphs. I've sifted through evals in techspeak, observation reports that have some or no observations, and IEP goals that are measurable and unmeasurable. I have fought, planned, co-operated, held my ground, given ground, compromised, and even thrown a hissy fit.  \n \nI am not an OT, a PT, an SLP, a neurologist, a developmental specialist, or a special educator. I am an art historian. And educated person, but not an expert at this.  \n \nOur back-up plan, like so many other special ed parents wrestling with an uncooperative and ill-funded system, is that great mantra, \"Call the lawyer!\" There lies the secret weapon, the person who can come in, look over all the mistakes you have made, and tell you to do next- or if the next step involves, say, the lawyer.  \n \nThis is such an ingrained mantra that we have taken up Wrightslaw as a banner, reading the books, going to the workshops, making sure we were ready, making sure we had done all we could do before... well, calling the lawyer.  \n \nThis morning, I called the lawyer.  \n \nWhen your back-up mantra is \"call the lawyer\", you also recognize that calling the lawyer is an admission of defeat.

The question is, \"what am I doing wrong? And how do I fix it?\"  \n \nAnd so you call to make an appointment with a lawyer.  \n \nSounds idyllic, yes? Well, what no one tells you is what happens when you make that call.  \n \nSee, when you call, apparently you have to be ready, like a lawyer yourself. You have to know exactly what is wrong and exactly why you want to speak to the lawyer. \"Something is wrong\" won't even get you past the receptionist. Even, \"this meeting went badly and I don't think what they gave me is appropriate\" isn't enough.  \n \nSeriously, I never got past the receptionist, who kept interrupting me to say, \"I don't understand why you want to see a lawyer.\" \n \nWe've had a blow, folks.

Child one, child two. Child one, child two.  Today, I looked up doing my headcount, and three boys who looked alike (must be brothers or cousins) were headed straight for me. This is never a good sign; and sure enough, they complained that Joey was cussing at them. Joey's explanation was that they were \"being mean\" and \"ignoring me.\" So we had a little talk about how some people are not interested in being friends, and we should just leave them alone. Then we talked about not using bad words, and that we had been having this discussion all week, so it was time for him to be suspended from the Wii for the evening. Then he bounced off with instructions to tell his brother we were leaving in ten minutes.  And I finished up reading the paper I was grading, about three minutes, and looked up for a head check. Child one....  No child two.  I gathered my things and headed over to Andy, asked him if he could see Joey. After a brief look about, the answer was no. He ran up the hill. No Joey. The park realized I was looking for Joey, and I started getting reports. He had gone up the hill. He had been seen on one road. He had been seen on the other road. He certainly was not  here .  Andy ran ahead to check the car, the other adults spread out in a search; and I called JoeyAndyDad to get him on the move.

{"date": "Monday, March 12, 2012", "body": "\nI know, you wanted a nice, happy post today. You ain't gettin' one. Sorry.  I've been following the information about  George Hodgins, a 22-year-old man  who was murdered by his mother last week. George Hodgins was autistic.  I have been struck by the comments that follow many of the news items. Not just the outpouring of sympathy for Elizabeth Hodgins, but the complete lack of sympathy for George Hodgins. The blaming of \"lack of service\" and the call for family support may seem a natural reaction to many people- indeed, it must, as many of the comments steer in that direction; but is it really the appropriate reaction? What about talking about support for autistic people? For people in general? What about the support for the victim in this case? And folks, the victim is not George Hodgins' mother. The victim here was primarily GEORGE HODGINS.  When I see comments like, \"well, all parents of kids with autism think about killing them,\" the magma rises before my eyes. I mean, seriously? Holy crap. I have never thought of killing Joey.  Never . When such comments are followed up with \"Any parent telling you differently is lying,\" I do think of violence. Not against my son.  But you know who I worry about first? No my Joey, who even now is gaining skills in self-advocacy, who is able to speak up in his own way. By the time he leaves school, I have solid grounds to hope he will be able to self-advocate effectively and live independently. I think of Max and Charlie and Jack, the boys of my best friend who cannot speak for themselves. I am convinced that there is more going on in those heads than anyone gives those boys credit for, and primarily because they cannot speak. They are boys who are severely disabled. They may never work jobs, they may never talk; but does that mean they have no value? Sadly, to many people, they believe these boys have no value. Of course, they have also never met Max, Charlie, or Jack, or anyone like them- or if they have, they dismissed those people out-of-hand, instead of taking the time and effort to know them and let them work the magic of changing their lives and creating the understanding that is their value, the way they give back to our society- with infectious smiles, personality, and a real understanding of what it means to be  human .  Max, Charlie, and Jack are people. Just like you. Just like me. We may be vastly different in many, many, ways, but in this we are in common: we are all human. We are all people. These lives have intrinsic value in the miracle of existing. Until you meet them, with an understanding that they are people- reall, full-fledged, absolutely whole  people - you cannot fully appreciate their value, because our society is so convinced that they have none. They spread that idea to the very base of our youth and experience. Shake it off.  I will not speak for my friend directly, but I strongly suspect she has never thought of murdering them, no matter how \"high maintenance\", \"low functioning\", or \"easily irritated\" her boys might be.  George Hodgins died because his mother valued his life so little, saw it only through the desperation of not giving him full value of being a person. He had been out of his program for around three months, and the program had adult service available. This is not a story of lack of services. This is a story of a young man whose life was cut short, and stolen from him. No excuse, no justification, nothing that we can design or imagine to justify her action in killing her son can change this fact, that she chose to murder another human being, a life of value, and rob us all of that life, and rob George Hodgins of his life. He was a loved, cherished young man, with friends and family who loved him and valued him, he was a young man who loved and cherished and thought and breathed and lived, and now he is gone.  Autism is not happening to me. Yes, my life is not what I planned, and I gave up certain paths and dreams to help Joey and to help Andy in ways that people with typical children simply cannot fathom. I have a different life, different plans, different dreams. Seriously, what life goes as planned? And though I think about the lack of services and supports, the problem is not that there is lack of services and supports for  me , there is a lack of these things for  Joey . I want his life to be as happy and fulfilling and joyful as it can be, with the opportunities to enjoy living that other people have. I'm a parent, after all. I might have to fight harder for it, and get less sleep along the way, and maybe my working life isn't typical, but that's life. I have never thought of stealing it from Joey. To insist I have is a really stupid thing to say- a hateful thing to say.  I wish there was some way to get through thick skulls that this news is terribly painful, and it is painful enough without people saying stupid, hateful things. We have a family out in California in pain. They have lost two family members in a sudden and senseless way. Two people are gone, for really no reason at all. IF you want to make it a discussion, let's talk about the issues of services for disabled people, for support of people with disabilities, and the idea of valuing them as human beings, and the sad fact that all too often, society dismisses people with disabilities as being not-people, or half-people, instead of just people. Let's be working to change that, so fewer people like George Hodgins will have their lives stolen from them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thautcast.com/drupal5/content/memory-george-hodgins-plea-autistic-personhood"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/03/when-ignorance-is-deadly.html", "title": "\nWhen Ignorance is Deadly\n"},

{"date": "Monday, February 27, 2012", "body": "\nYes, my hyacinths are blooming, I have daffodils opening, the rose bush buds are leafing out (shoot- I didn't get the pruning done!), it must be time to be thinking about IEPs- that map to Joey's future, based upon his present. All those thoughts, and goals, and concerns, and everything that have been mulling about must come together to think of the next step. SO what is Joey's present? What does my crystal ball say about his future?  As I once told Joey's teachers, in some ways, Joey is 15. He is SO ready for algebra. We need to get him moving into the abstract, so he can understand what the numbers are doing on the paper- but he is not so happy with long division, he can already cut through it to see the answer. He want to test Mom and Dad in his boundaries of being an individual, exploring scripts that include words he has found contain the power of immediate attention (you know, the ones not appropriate for school. Or family-friendly blogs.) He definitely likes having his \"girlfriends\" and really misses the friend that moved away, his \"wife.\"  In some ways, Joey is still 5. He wants his cuddles. He makes friends with everyone. Adults are authority, no matter how they treat him, and he is happy to share hugs even with ones he doesn't particularly like. He wants his own way, and though he has learned to take turns and wait some, he's not always good at it. He still struggles with social interactions, such as maintaining conversations or keeping up with dynamic pretend play.  And in some ways, this is on par with being almost ten years old- an age where the little kid fades and the young adult begins, but isn't here yet. Not that I am that familiar with typical ten-year-olds, mind you. But in thinking what I have seen and read about them, I know that Joey definitely isn't one.  As far as I can tell, typical ten-year-old boys can handle things that Joey definitely cannot. They can build treeforts, ride two-wheeler bikes unsupervised through a neighborhood, can care for their own possessions, and often take on chores of the house like filling a dishwasher and taking out the trash with fair independence. Ten-year-olds around here seem to be able to play in the front of their homes without much supervision, even go to visit neighbors on their own. Perhaps the story of the ten-year-old on the New York subway is a bit extreme, but my mom remembers riding the bus in Baltimore when she was five- by herself. Ten-year-olds are able to think of things to do for themselves in their free time, even without a TV or a computer.  Joey cannot do these things. I wouldn't dream of letting him out of my locked gates without my eyes upon him. Every chore has to be supervised, structured, clearly delineated. Joey, build his own treefort? Leaving the coordination that such a feat would require aside, could he figure out a book about how to build one, and follow through? Watching Joey trying to hold a conversation is also something that, in the IEP season, strikes at my very core. Other kids talk and play so easily. There is a clear back-and-forth, a rhythm of communication even as ideas change, a coming to consensus and moving through the play, that Joey cannot do. He's getting better. But he's not like the other 10-year-olds, and boy do they know it. The constant unpredictability quickly overwhelms Joey, he can't keep up with the constant shift and change. He can't follow the way the other boys communicate by glancing at each other. He know they are communicating; but he can't decipher the code.  What does this mean for Joey's present? What does it mean for his future? As we take one step nearer to the dreaded Middle School Years, what can be done to mitigate the challenges that Joey faces in his uphill climb to being an independent adult?  In many kids' shows, there is an episode about Secret Clubs. Kids, especially as they get towards Middle School, are into segregating themselves into little groups, or cliques, of other kids that make them feel- well, a part of an exclusive little group. For some kids, this is not a good thing; for others, it is a way to connect with other kids going through life with similar ideas and goals, and to be more comfortable as they grow. There are secret handshakes, secret codes, secret meetings, secret games. In all of these shows, the point is that these clubs often make others feel left out, and that being inclusive is more fun. ITs a lovely little lesson on thinking of others, the merits of diversity and inclusion, and just plain differences between being nice and being mean.  For Joey, the whole of society seems like a secret club, and he is the one not invited. He doesn't have the secret handshake, the secret code, and isn't invited to the secret meetings. And with adult life, it gets to be a huge problem when those secret handshakes lead to the secret games called \"employment.\" And yes, I worry that he may never really learn to deal with the dynamics of learning the secret social code, even if we can show him what the code means. It is like someone who speaks a foreign language- a native speaker can almost always tell the difference. There are idioms that a foreigner just never really picks up on, uses, or understands. After all, Joey will always be Joey. The question is, will the secret club let him in? How lovely would it be if we all kept those kids' shows at heart, and remember to be kind and nice, and not mean?  But such is not the way of the world, and more's the pity. In fact, most of society defends its secret club vigorously, and has no problem declaring it openly that my son may never be included, should never be included, and is a waste of time, breath, and money to try to fight for his inclusion. Others are more subtle, going through the motions but often denying support, or expecting the motions to be enough without the intention and understanding. There are also those who say they are inclusive, but their actions prove otherwise- and unfortunately, those people are all too often in positions of power and authority, including in school systems. They often are very vocal about being inclusive in public, while doing and saying things in meetings and behind closed doors that clearly speak otherwise. And sometimes, you have to plan IEPs with these people. It isn't pretty.  Spring is here, and it is time to think what goals would be reasonable for Joey in trying to get him to the next step. At this point, I am thinking in terms of making Middle School as easy as possible for him; but I must not forget the greater goal of adult independence and self-advocacy, goals that most parents assume as granted. Sometimes I wonder how wise that is- but perhaps that is the subject of a another blog post.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/02/spring-is-here-time-for-ieps.html", "title": "\nSpring is here...

It's disconcerting. When one cannot get a grip on the little things, stringing them together as a necklace, the whole world becomes scattered.  Andy has started his OT. It is already making a difference for him at school, as he will now write more, especially after therapy. I have to pick him up from school, go to therapy, and then take him back, twice a week for the next three months. However, I am totally glad I didn't wait for school to move on it. Our eligibility meeting isn't even scheduled, and it could be the end of February before they get to us- which would, of course, be at the end of the three months. Having Andy struggle at school with no support for another three months would be devastating.  Driving down the road, having just paid up the co-pays and the gaps in insurance, remembering days when insurance wasn't helping with either child, I kept thinking of a Mastercard ad. OT, $100 an hour, twice a week. Speech therapy, $95 an hour, twice a week. ABA therapy, $90 an hour, four hours a week. Having your autistic child call you \"mom\" for the first time? Priceless. Having your ADHD and sensory dysfunctional child be able to sit in a chair and write a sentence? Priceless. I need to get Joey a new speech therapist, we've been without one far too long.  Joey is working on an animal report for school, which includes a written report and a model. I puled out my celluclay, but forgot how long it can take to dry. Joey is upset that he doesn't have his model to take with him today, but our very understanding teacher is going to allow us to turn it in on Monday. I just hope it dries enough to paint it over the weekend.  The Christmas decorations are slowly going up. If you want a sample of years past, you can check it out  here . It is going slower than usual. We have Evan with us for the forseeable future as he searches for a job, so he can then get his own apartment. He's been a huge help with moving boxes about, but I'm not getting things done after the boys go to bed like I usually do, because he's downstairs and I would be in his space. I also don't want to annoy other folks with my constant playing of versions of  A Christmas Carol  while I work. I hope to get the glass garlands up today while the boys are in school, its hard to do those when the boys are running around the base of the ladder.  This morning, I am teaching some of the kindergarden classes how to sign  Jingle Bells . I've been practicing all week.

I didn't get any sleep that night. The thought that there are people- professionals who are supposed to be familiar with disabilities and the rights of people with disabilities- is terrifying.

There is no excuse for anyone to deny someone the right to live,  especially  by denying them appropriate medical care and service. Professionals of a children's hospital know better. If they don't, the hospital should take measures to find out why, and make sure everyone on their staff knows better, and believes that all people are due their basic rights.  Not just the doctors, nurses, and social workers, either. Everyone. The administrators, the assistants, the janitorial staff, the cafeteria staff, the volunteers, the secretaries...  everyone .  Disability is no excuse for denying a person- no matter their age or your assumptions about their \"quality of life\"- the right to live. People with disabilities are already actively targeted for bullying and crime; they don't need to be targeted in a hospital, when they are trying to get medical care.  This is important.

They have a speech therapist, occupational therapists, theater teachers, special ed teachers, art teachers... and every kid gets a \"coach\" assigned to them for the week.  Joey  loved loved loved  it. He was bit nervous the first day, and pretended to be Quack the Duck all week, but he liked it, he wants to do it again next year, and he had a lot of fun.  The play was based on the book,  Giraffes Can't Dance  by Giles Andreae . Joey was a rhinoceros. He was fabulous. I would show you the clips, but you can see a lot of the other kids, and some of them would prefer not to be on the internet. So you have to take my word for it, he was fabulous and his usual beautiful hammy self up there.  However, he was also his usual beat behind on the dance routines and most of the lines. We might need to stress the sign language and visual supports more in stuff like this, because I know he notices and finds it frustrating.  The kids do everything to put on the play. They make the costumes (which included a tail they had to stuff, the headbands, the necklaces, and attaching squares of fabric to their t-shirts), the props, the set- there were paper flowers, paper plate snakes, paper ants, trees to be made, stars for the backdrop, everything. They had a choreographer come help them learn to move and dance, a drama instructor and director, they had the kids do everything. Each kid had a little dance they did with one or two other kids, a section of the book to say, and several group dances. They did a  great  job.    Joey had two awesome coaches for the week. He got to have two because during orientation, the staff was graced with witnessing one of Joey's bolting dashes out the door. I showed them  Peep and the Big Wide World  on the first day and explained the whole Quack thing, and then fell right into it. They didn't even mind when he signed himself in as Quack Guyton.

He is sitting and doing work. He read ten pages of a book for one of his teachers on Monday. He spent 25 minutes on a single activity on Tuesday. HE gives his teachers hugs, says please and thank you, and takes turns. He's being silly and smiley and... who is this child, and where has he been for the last five months? If nothing else, Joey's teachers are getting a taste of what he can really do if he's given the correct supports. We just need to figure out what those are. Joey gets break from the overwhelming anxiety that was dragging him into the abyss. Maybe he can then help us by being able to better communicate what he needs, and have a chance to settle in to his routines and get used to his teachers.  I much prefer the giggly Joey, I can tell you. I bet he does, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/10/how-to-define-dramatic-change.html", "title": "\nHow to Define \"Dramatic Change\"\n"},

At eight am Tuesday morning, I had that meeting. The principal is a very likable person. He knew what he was supposed to say- things like, \"we're here to support Joey\" and \"we want to work with you and want your input\" and all that. \"You can call me anytime.\" \"Feel free to call IEP meetings.\" \"Ill always be honest with you.\" Stuff like that. Always nice to hear.  By your actions shall you be judged.  There were several things said that were highly disturbing. Most prominently, the para in Joey's inclusion room has no training in nor experience with autistic children. This is the person who is supposed to be keeping Joey safe? Seriously, what are they  thinking ?  He informed me that though I was appealing the discipline referral, there was nothing to appeal. Even though the first level of discipline was implemented (conference with the child and call home), this was \"just the school's process for documenting such incidents.\" Um... no. Discriminating against a child for their disability by \"documenting\" in the form of a discipline referral is absolute inappropriate and unacceptable. I'm working on exactly how I am going to make that clear, and to whom.  He seemed surprised about the push to place Joey in summer scholars, when I explained what he needed was a program to imitate what school would be like, with lots of structure. Yeah, I'm shocked, too. I knew we were uncomfortable, I told him we were uncomfortable, and made sure he was apprised of how much a disaster this was. Just shy of completely catastrophic, honestly.  The principal admitted he knew very little about autistic students, and suggested they hadn't had many. I informed him he needed to get prepared, here they come. Then he suggested Joey's high intelligence made him unusual as an autistic student. I pointed out another student I knew he had experience with, one who just left this person's school, as an apt comparison. He also admitted he hadn't seen Joey really, not gone into his classroom. I recommended he do so.  Then I had  my lovely chart of concerns , and what I wanted done about them. I am working on a supplement for the actual IEP meeting. So he has something in writing about what I want done. Let's see what he does.  I sent in times for the week for an IEP meeting. No word on that. I am putting together a more formal letter requesting the meeting, lest they forget we have an  emergency  here!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/09/wow-is-week-over-yet.html", "title": "\nWow, is the week over yet?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 10, 2010", "body": "\n If I was the kind of blogger that let language fly, I would be doing it right now. For about a page and a half.  Instead, I am scheduling another IEP meeting and arranging to dispute and appeal a disciplinary write-up. Joey had a sub this morning- both of his teachers needed to be at an IEP meeting for another child- and he ran into trouble. I cannot figure out the trigger, but he went into fight-flight, and couldn't get out of the room. So he melted down. Apparently it was somewhere between an 8 and a 9. He was sent to the office and officially written up, meeting with the vice principal some time after they managed to calm him down.  We're going in breathing fire.  When Joey has a meltdown here, I can guarantee you, I made a mistake. I failed to do something he needed, and I usually know better. I miss his cues, and he goes into tailspin. I raise my voice or use a trigger word (such as \"quickly\"), when I know I shouldn't. I fail to de-escalate a situation.  I am the adult here, that is my responsibility.  If you think I'm going to hold the school to a lower standard- people who are supposed to be trained to deal with disabilities, including autism, on a far more formal level than I have been- you are very sadly mistaken. And you do not send a child to the office because  you  made a mistake.  In getting geared up for the battle, I found some helpful war paint to apply. A nice set-up for a chart to clarify the issues and how I am seeing things from this end. If you are headed into an IEP, you might want to check it out:  Organizing Your Concerns.

{"date": "Sunday, October 17, 2010", "body": "\nMy boys are growing up. Kids grow up whether you raise them or not. It's a time thing. Time keeps marching on.  Some folks have asked me why I am Joeymom and Not JoeyAndyMom (especially since my husband is JoeyAndyDad, and the blog address is joeyandymom). It's a time thing. When I set up this blog, I was using an older blogger account, and just set up a new blog instead of starting it all from scratch. I had been Joeymom for a couple years before Andy came along. Funny enough, I don't think anybody who actually knew me online in those two years is anywhere on the radar now. Something about no longer being able to compare my kid's milestones to theirs. Moms can be funny things.  When I set up the blog, the new thing was picking an avatar: a little picture to represent me to the internet world. This was new and exciting for me four and a half years ago. I started my internet life with text-based MUDs. Even chat rooms had minimal choices for little pictures to go with your name. I knew this was important, though. When your contact with a person is exclusively online, that little visual image is how they think of you. Art is a powerful addition to a world based entirely on the visual. Now I would be more than words, I would be a little picture.  Should it just be my face? That may sound logical, and in fact, is the option selected by many online. But what does my face really say about me? After all, an avatar is a mini-portrait: a creation of your online presence, much more about who you are than what you look like. An image that gets recalled and connected to you, to your presence, to your \"I was here!\" in the comments section, something to search for along the many tweets and have that leap of, \"oh good! something from you!\" when it is scanned and found. Is my face a powerful enough message? How about using the boys?  Besides, the avatar is usually pretty small. About a half-inch square. How legible is my face at that size?  And trying to fit  two  faces in there?  Ha ! Perhaps something a little more legible in mini would be better. Something like  Maddy's goldfish - clear, loaded with symbolism and meaning, and yummy. Maybe something like  Miss Kitty's cat , which goes with the name and expresses love for cats. Or Stimey's  gerbil . Actually, that kinda fits her to a T. She kinda look like that gerbil. Cute and fuzzy with the tiny claws ready in case you threaten to mess with her, if you know what I mean. Seriously, meet this woman, and tell me I'm wrong. Stimey totally rocks, in a comforting, wonderful way.  Maybe something more graphic.  Sunday's banshee  comes to mind. Or one of my favorites,  mommydearest's gothgirl .  Right. So I made my choice. And I chose...  Uma.   For those of you unaware of our history, Joey basically learned to talk watching Oobi, with the help and support of intensive early interventions. He loved Oobi, the talking hands on Noggin. The show is hilarious, gentle, imaginative, and beautifully captures the concerns of young children. Uma is Oobi's little sister. No, that isn't my hand. I can tell you that the voice is Stephanie D'Abruzzo, but I am not sure if she is also the \"puppeteer\" or not.  I have been Uma now for four and a half years. I wonder how many people think of me as a hand puppet with googly eyes. Hey, Stimey, do I look like Uma? Or more like a  Shmoo ? My kids are 6 and 8 now. Oobi has been left behind with a world of preschool cares and joys. They are growing up. I do sometimes miss those little babies, so squishable and giggly, but I do  so  love the boys they have become, and I look forward to teh men they are going to be.  Perhaps it is time to move along, and find something new.  Maybe a shmoo.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/whittereronautism/416572540/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/518/2129/1600/cupmirror.jpg", "http://a1.twimg.com/profile_images/53172909/1.JPG", "http://a2.twimg.com/profile_images/1112486026/screaming_banshee.jpg", "http://mommydearest1514.blogspot.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkpW3OC_lHc&feature=related", "http://www.deniskitchen.com/docs/new_shmoofacts.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/10/considering-joeymom-avatar.html", "title": "\nConsidering: The Joeymom Avatar\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, August 28, 2010", "body": "\nIt was Joey's turn for a break, a quick stay at Grandma's. Joey did great. Grandma's house is nice and quiet, and Grandma is particularly good at letting Joey take life at his own pace. He played in Grandma's truck and with her new cat, take a nice bath, and had a generally good time. I arrived nice and early to take him home after his breakfast, as he prefers. We were worried he might get anxious, but everything seemed great. Grandma put Wubbzy on the TV via Netflix/Roku so we could review the visit and talk about the upcoming school meeting.  Unfortunately, the connection out there s a little slow right now for reasons unknown. Every few minutes, the movie was interrupted to \"load.\" The third time, he ran for the door (leaving it open enough for the new cat to sneak in).  I was prepared. When Joey runs at Grandma's, he runs for the car; so I left the doors unlocked and a toy for him to calm down. I cut off the conversation, packed up Joey's bag, helped mom put the cat out, said goodbye, and headed for the car. I put the bag in, looked in the back seat with a friendly greeting, and...  No Joey.  He wasn't in the back of Grandma's truck. He wasn't in the garage. He wasn't answering to my calls. I ran back to the house, shouted into the door that Joey was gone, and ran down the driveway. Whenever I could get him to take a walk at Grandma's, he always preferred to stay on the driveway- a nice, clear line and path to follow. I made it to the circle, and down the road a little way, with no sign of him. I turned and ran back to Mom's. Maybe she had found him, he was just hiding in the back bedroom, or behind the house.  \"You you have him?\" she called as I appeared. No, I don't. I don't have him. He's gone.  Those are not words you want echoing through your head.  I hopped into the car. \"Keep calling,\" I said, I suppose to my mom, \"I'm going to see if he followed the road.\" I started down the road, watching the woods to either side, for any sign of him, praying he had gone this way, and not into the woods to the river. Please be on the road. Please be on the road. Please be on the road.  He had gotten about 3/4 of a mile down the road. I turned the corner and saw him, and he looked glad to see the car. He was hot, tired, and scared. He had probably met a number of dogs along the way, which would have sent him into more panic, and sped him along the road. If I had tried to continue to look for him on foot, he would have gotten out to the main road, and we would have been in more serious trouble. All the way back to Grandma's, he told me how he had gotten off the road whenever a car had come.  We got a lot of hugs when we got back to Grandma's. And a drink. And more hugs. And now I have him home, with our double-key locks, set up with his computer and his brother. And I'm looking up GPS.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/08/stroll-down-road.html", "title": "\nA Stroll Down the Road\n"},

They kept not wanting to have a para with him in specials (art, music, etc.), but I won't have it these first few weeks. \"They can lock the door\" is not an acceptable answer. You expect the teacher to deal with the meltdown when he finds that door locked? What if there is a fire? The tradeoff is that for the same first few weeks, he will be self-contained half the day, so he can be in small groups or 1:1 instruction while he transitions. We'll start moving him back into the inclusion room after a few weeks.  Then, unbeknownst to them unless they read this blog, I am going to start asking questions about LRE and moving him into \"regular\" classrooms. Because you know what? That is where we was before. The sped-centered environment is a step backward, a regression from being with his non-disabled peers in supportive environments. Our school system fills \"inclusion rooms\" with kids who are borderline for services as their \"non-disabled\" kids- kids that really should need service, but they have issues of clear documentation of needs, because they don't have a \"25% delay\" in anything specific and measurable.  Andy is a great kid for an inclusion room. He has speech issues that are being otherwise ignored, he had focus and attention issues that are met by the structure required in inclusion environments even though he is technically not receiving accommodation or service, yet he has the academic and social skill strengths to really support his classmates, as well as experience with disabled peers. To push him into a faster-paced, distraction-filled environment would really... well, prove he has issues.  Yet it is into that \"mainstream\" that both boys must eventually go, like it or not. One day, they will graduate. The world is not full of special needs classrooms.  And you know what? I want those kids in \"mainstream\" and \"regular\" classrooms to have to meet and cope with people like Joey and Andy. They need to learn what it means to be tolerant, to appreciate people's strengths and talents, and to therefore appreciate their own foibles, their own talents, their own abilities- to learn what it really means to live in a positive, constructive community.  On Tuesday, Joey will start school with a lot of quiet spaces and an ever-present lifeguard. Andy will start in a structured room with only 15 classmates. Here's hoping everybody- including you- has a fabulous year.

{"date": "Monday, August 23, 2010", "body": "\n One of the great adventures we planned was a pirate adventure, aboard the great  Duckaneer ! Unfortunately, this was one of the side trips that Joey staunchly refused to leave the hotel room for. In fact, he refused to go on any boat rides, saying they were scary. So we left Joey in the hotel with Dad and Grandma, and Andy and I went pirating! We arrived to explore the docks, and Andy was very excited to see live crabs on the piers. We also discovered a place to get shirley temples, an office with stuffed sharks on the wall, and the gift cart. Oh, and a place to buy a hat for Mommy, as we realized there would be little shade on the Duckaneer.  We were soon off to find pirate treasure! The treasure in the end turned out to be, as Andy suspected, small toys. The folks were very generous with letting all the kids have a handful of treasure.  They were also very clear about the fact that everybody would be getting wet. They are serious. Don't go on pirate adventures if you are afraid of getting soaked to the bone. After all, there are ten water canons on the Duckaneer! The boat is wonderful. Andy thought it was amazing. There is a big pirate map painted on the deck, and the folks are in costume and character. They sit the kids around the map and spin a wonderfully fun yarn about the adventure. Parents are encouraged to participate in everything, too.  Andy loved the map. He started looking for the \"X\" right away (there isn't one- the adventure is more adventurous than that!) He especially liked that the places marked on it were places we had talked about and been to, such as Assateague Island.  Andy was soon ready for high adventure! He actually sat and joined in the story, and really got into the whole thing. He had some trouble now and again with processing instructions, but overall, he was having a glorious time as a salty sea dog. Yo ho, Yo ho, a pirate's life for me!  Andy manned the canons when we first got on, but in the thick of the battle against the enemy pirate, he spent a lot of time just trying to avoid being soaked. He was actually pretty successful. The enemy pirate would also reach in and grab shoes off the kids' feet, and Andy was very proud that he didn't lose his shoes (they all reappeared in the treasure chest at the end of the adventure). He did get a few good squirts in, though.  Here's the map on the deck.  It really is a fun thing, and worth the money. The folks that run the thing make it lots of fun, you get lots of toys, and you also ride around the bay and see Assateague. The pirate battle lasted a good long time, and everybody got into it, adults and kids alike. After the battle is won, they have games and dances for the kids to do on the way back to port.  Also, what is a pirate without his mustache, beard, and tattoo? They had quick \"facepainting\" which involved drawing two lines for mustache, a line on the chin for a beard, and an anchor on the kids' arms for tattoos. Oh, and one pirate ran around doing the same to the adults. I managed to avoid being mustached and bearded. Andy, however, hopped right into line. He got excited because they ran out of blue pencil, so he got to have red instead.  That's my little pirate!

{"date": "Tuesday, August 17, 2010", "body": "\nSince we were heading to the beach for a whole week, JoeyAndyDad and I did some lightning research online for things to see and do besides our usual triangle of sand, pool, and boardwalk. In the last few years, we had expanded to include  Assateague , a boatride, and yummy dinner at  Hooper's , but basically, we did the sand, pool, boardwalk thing. Hey, its the beach, right?  So we put together a list of fun stuff, and set it to the beat of a schedule: breakfast, beach, ride to something fun, lunch, rest, something fun like the boardwalk, pool, dinner, more pool. We found some pirate museums, a pirate boat adventure, and a new nature center to check out. We even had some breathings of trying to visit Niksmom and Nik. I thought the boys might also like another trip to the Salisbury Zoo. We all know planning is everything, right? So we were so ready.  Joey hasn't been riding in the car well, so we thought of that, too. It's a four hour drive to the beach, so we pulled out the stops: videos, his CD player, plenty of books, toys, notebooks and pens. Hey, if it will get him through four hours, thirty minutes should be a cinch, right? I mean, the fact that I had been trouble even getting so far as Grandma's all summer was of no consequence at all, right? We had made it to Jamestowne before Summer Scholars began, after all!  So what happened?  Well, first, the Bay Bridge happened. This made a four-hour trip into an eight-hour slog. We went through our bag tricks, but the trauma of the long ride lingered. Whenever a ride was suggested, Joey insisted he wanted to stay in the room. In fact, we had a hard time getting him from the room even to go on to the beach or into the pool on enough occasions, we were afraid he might even be sick.  When we did manage to get him into the car, the results were, at best, mixed.  We managed to pry Joey from the car in  Salisbury , after much complaints that he didn't want to go, and that it was too far. And that nobody likes him, and he doesn't want to go.  He showed mild interest in a couple of animals, then insisted on returning to the car. So JoeyAndyDad took him back to the car, and Andy and I roamed about, looking at animals and chatting. Then we discovered the little nature center, and managed to pry Joey out of the car to touch a frog. Hey, wouldn't you get out of a car to touch a frog?  We managed to lure him into the zoo some by promising him a look at otters. Joey loves otters. However, this time he was unimpressed. He did look at a few things- then wanted to go back to the car. So the zoo visit was over for him.   I didn't allow that to dampen Andy's visit, however. We saw the animals, some of them twice so he could get a closer look without the chorus of \"Let's go back to the car, now!\" Andy thought the flamingos were fabulous, and very very pink. He thought his friend Kylie would like them. He also was fond of the bobcats, though I didn't get any good photos of them. We also saw a black jaguar, which was awesomely beautiful.  It is a lovely little zoo, lots of shade, some nice benches placed around and about, and even these wooden walkways through parts of the exhibits. The focus is mostly on American animals, though there are a few exotic things like the jaguar (OK, South American... no big tigers or lions or anything). There were llamas, bears, otters, and peacocks. OK, India, too. But colonists had peacocks, so there. They have a cool exhibit with beavers and wood ducks, too. h, and a fancy wolf exhibit, though once again, we didn't see a single wolf.    The nature center was small, but air conditioned, and they had a turtle shell to crawl through. They had lots of turtles and snakes to look at, oh and frogs. They also had a young lady who would bring things out to touch (like the frog), or happily tell you all about any animal there in great and fascinating detail. When she wasn't talking, she had a chair to one side to sit. JoeyAndyDad noticed that she liked to rock. Yes, there really are wonderful options for people with ASD, if you find their interests and give them the opportunity.  The  Delmarva Discovery Center  was less successful.  Andy loved it. He got to look at real horseshoe crabs, and there were aquariums of fish, and a model of a steamboat to walk through, and a model of a Native American house, and trains to play with and... and... it is an impressive little center. I recommend it.  However, Joey got through the door and ran screaming through the building with me hot on his heels. I finally cornered him in a back room (no, I didn't actually catch him, I cornered him), and we gathered ourselves together. The ride was too long. The place was scary. He was a ball of anxiety and frustration. He wanted to go back to the car. He made a break for the car, and again, I was on his heels, so we managed to cross the parking lot safely, and get into the car with Grandma.  I then wandered through the museum taking photos of the exhibits and Andy having fun with his Daddy: touching the crabs and watching them swim, looking at different seashells, exploring a cool computerized globe thing and learning about satellite launching, and even looking at a reconstructed hut for duck decoy carving.  I then took my camera out to the car and showed Joey what was in the museum, the cool stuff he could see and do, to see if i could take the edge off the unknown factor and get him to come have some fun. He was finally convinced by the beaver lodge.  After all, I said he could go in it. I wasn't lying. He was happy to go in, but unfortunately scratched his arm on a stick on his way out, and it was kind of downhill from there. Even the big fishtanks were no use.

I honestly believe they were intended as comforting. We sent my child to four weeks of summer programming- an excellent summer enrichment program, by the way- to try to transition him to a new school and new people. We knew it wasn't going to be a waltz through the tulips. However, what I saw was not encouraging.  What I usually see is a happy Joey pitching in and hamming it up, grinning to be in front of people and showing off, or at least showing off for Mommy. You get used to seeing Joey having fun doing stuff, even when he isn't the most perfect or graceful about it (well, to other people. To me, he looks absolutely wonderful.) I am not used to seeing this:  He then had to have the teacher come get him from my arms, and go for a walk with the special ed teacher. Oh, he had earplugs in; but it was all too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much to try to coordinate and do. The other child you see the teacher working with? He didn't get ESY services in his IEP, he's there as a \"regular\" attendee. I could rant on about that from several different angles. Let's just stick to noting that Joey is unhappy, and bolting- something that occurred all of twice at school all of the previous school year, but was apparently a regular occurrence during the summer program, and certainly has become a regular enough occurrence here that we are considering upping the security on our doors (he's figured out the keys, and soon will figure out how to reach them). I had been thinking our parking hangtag was going to be obsolete by renewal time, now I'm thinking, no, we'll be renewing it- and that is still two years away. About the time we will be transitioning to the next new school.  I love hearing that Joey is doing great and fine and having fun.

{"date": "Saturday, July 24, 2010", "body": "\nSome weeks make you want to jump up and down screaming excitedly. And some make you want to run screaming into the night. Most weeks end up with a little of both. So, let's not talk about the blown head gasket in the car I just put the transmission into. Or the broken AC and needed timing belt in the other car. The meltdown moments of heat and frustration. The bout of heat exhaustion because I was stupid enough to try to cut a path down to the river at mom's house in a 120 degree heat index. Andy's erratic behavior all week. Not shall we mention the fact that my courses for the fall disappeared from the college computer system and my department chair is out of town with a family emergency (and for a harrowing night, I thought I had been fired). No, let's set the screaming-into-the-night bits aside.  ******** This week in nature camp, Andy made a deer footprint and a boat, and re-connected with his classmate, S. Now, S's mom is one of those totally rockin' moms that steps right in to the thick of things and pitches. When the school had Math and Science night, and decided to send second graders in one direction and kindergardeners in another, she stepped right up and went with Andy and S while I had Joey and her second-grader son, M. I promptly lost M (we managed to track him down, but... how embarrassing!) but she was cool enough to not get bent out of shape. As far as I know. To continue to prove how rockin' she is, she actually came over one morning when we were picking up from camp and said, \"hey, I'm sorry, I forgot your name, but I know you.\"  I have a lot of respect for people who do that, because I have a heck of a time remembering names. So I told her I was Joeymom, and then noted that I had no idea what her name was, either, and she told me it was Smom, and then said, \"I've heard that you remember people's names better if you keep saying it. So, Hi Joeymom! How are you, Joeymom? We're so glad to see you, Joeymom!\" And we spent the rest of the week calling each other by name every sentence. Guess what? It works! ******** I signed Joey up for another round of swimming lessons. He has expressed interest in being a lifeguard and joining the swim team, and all the lifeguards now know him, so I cornered the one that gives lessons and got her to agree. For ten dollars, Joey get a half-hour of Red Cross-based swimming instruction and I get to write my silly little stories in my spiral-bound notebooks and not have to worry about him drowning or anything or half an hour. That's ten bucks well spent, I tell you. (I ravage Walmart this time of year for those 15-cent notebooks. The year they were five cents? I went  CRAZY . And still ran out.) It went a lot better than I was expecting. The young lady, Miss K, did a great job holding his focus to the task and making her expectations clear, and demonstrating what she wanted him to do. I think a lot of folks have their kids do a couple of lessons and leave it; I've let Miss K know we're here for a while. My original thought was that it might take longer for him to process the lessons and b able to perform. Now Im just thinking he's loving the lesson and might get his form together enough to be on the swim team next year if he is so inclined. That rocks.  ******** We've seen a lot of our across-the-street-neighbor this week. We've had a lot of fun spoiling him- taking him to lunches, letting him jabber about anything he likes, dunking him the pool, and buying him Zhu Zhu pets. He's a funny little guy, hyper and bouncy like Andy. This has been a little bit on Joey's nerves, truth be told, because Joey doesn't handle lightning-fast play and bouncing very well. However, Andy is thrilled- mostly- to have a friend over so much. What a threesome! ********* I have my fabric sorted into the quilt projects I want to work on. There's only... 8 of them. Not too bad. I do very utilitarian quilts- 6\", 8\", or 10\" squares of fabrics, quilted down the gutters on my machine. By just doing big patches, I get to enjoy the fabrics, and have a lot less cutting and piecing to do. When I get a chance to do it at all. Um, I'll keep you posted.  ******** With it being 103 degrees and 120 heat index, I've been doing a lot of watering in the morning and the evening in the garden. My tomatoes have understandably stopped producing, and the lawn is crunchy. I got Grandmother's Rose mulched in today, in case we get any water falling form the sky or anything like that. ITs a great opportunity to mulch, because all the weeds I usually have got whacked down when I had the yard worked on, and its been too hot for them to grow in again. Of course, the problem is that it is also 103 degrees and 120 heat index. Not conducive to gardenwork.  ******** I have the room reserved. I have Luna's week at the Cat Spa (aka the Vet's Office) arranged. I am starting my lists of Things To Pack. This is Finals Week, so I won't have any grading to do, grades will be all turned in. Yes, it is time to start prepping for The Beach! Two weeks and counting down! (Um, how do I keep the fish alive for a week while we're gone?)

{"date": "Monday, July 26, 2010", "body": "\nYou know, life happens. And sometimes you wonder if you're being a little selfish about it. I had two moments today with that oddish feeling that the world is staring at me, and perhaps I was feeling a bit selfish about it.  This morning, we chugged through our routine- take Dad to work because we're down to one working car, get Joey bundled off to ESY, take Andy to his beloved nature camp. I signed Andy up for three sessions of said camp, and last week folks looked surprised and explained that it was the exact same camp. That doesn't bother us. In fact, that's a good thing for us, because then Andy knows what to expect. And he's superlatively happy at the camp. He was so happy, he put on his camp t-shirt proudly to go to camp, chattering happily about playing in the creek and which footprint cast he was going to make this week.  This morning, we had a different set of ladies running said camp than we have had for the last two sessions. This time, the lady comes down the walk, calling \"Are you Andy's mom?\" Startled, I responded to the affirmative; and was promptly treated to a lecture about how the director of summer activities had been trying to call us all weekend and we were not supposed to sign up for more than one session because there was a waiting list and other kids didn't get a chance to come to the camp at all and...  ... and I took Andy's hand, turned to the car, with a comment to the effect of, \"Well, we certainly do not want to be someplace we are not welcome.\" It was not the gracious thing to say; saying nothing would probably have been far better. We went down to the parks and rec office and pulled Andy from the remaining summer activities, and demanded refunds; and the ladies there were gracious (and intelligent) enough to comply immediately and without comment. There was a note there from the director of summer activities, too, so they were kind of expecting us; probably helped. And I must say, Mama Bear is a rather large, imposing woman with a face like thunder when she is Unhappy, which probably also helped. But the result is that Andy cannot go to his beloved camp. Now, when we got home some hours later, there was a handwritten note from the director of summer activities stuck in my door with some nonsense about how she wanted to just refund the first day and he was welcome to go the rest of the week, but I have no interest in leaving my child with that lady who felt it appropriate to berate me in front of not only my own child, but the other parents and children who were arriving for the camp. It was not only mortifying, but I have a few questions about judgment, there. And how will these people feel about my child now? No, I'm not taking a chance on that. Camp Andy shall be hastily gathered together and implemented. It shall involve fun things like wading in Grandma's river, going to the  Bug Box  (which we did today), and making bean mosaics (I happened to pick up some beans on the reduced rack just last week for the purpose of making mosaics...) If I am feeling really chipper, I might even get out stuff to make chocolate mold casts (I don't have footprint molds, but I have plenty of rabbits and Santas!). Maybe we'll use plaster- or maybe we'll use chocolate. ;) And next week? JoeyAndy Camp commences! I am considering a trip to the  National Aquarium in Baltimore , as a replacement for \"Under the Sea\" and a prelude to our week at the beach.  Such were my cranking gears and thoughts as Joey came home and it was time for lunch. I decided to take them to their favorite Monday restaurant (it serves mac and cheese on Mondays, so Joey is all about it; and Andy likes the toy machines, where he can get mini glow sticks for a quarter). It's a lovely little place, very homey, been going there since I was a nipper myself. It has all-you-can-eat veggies and salad and stuff, and AYCE ice cream in the bargain, so I usually have happy boys getting their own food and feeling that modicum of control over their lives that young boys like.  But today, I accidentally spilled my drink onto one of Joey's Zhu Zhu Pets (the pet is fine, all dry, no worries). Joey has been very out-of-sorts this summer. I don't think he's doing that well with his ESY program- too many kids and too many field trips, not enough normalcy and routine that he needs- and the insanity of summer just gets to him. He gets a little hair-triggery, and this didn't even need a hair trigger, it was a perfectly obvious trigger. He did a lap around the restaurant, screaming \"He's ruined! My Zhu Zhu Pet is ruined!\" at the top of his lungs.  The moment of deafening silence in the restaurant as I caught the upset child and hugged him nearly broke my heart. So often, we are mostly invisible in public, and especially in familiar settings such as this restaurant. He had been overwhelmed by an avalanche of small things: a morning at busy ESY, the hub-bub of the public space with his growing sound sensitivity, the fact that we left immediately for lunch, so he didn't get his few minutes of computer time, Andy demanding his attention and barraging him with questions and instructions for playing, and then the drink spilled upon his beloved toy... and these are the things I can immediately report.  \"You're OK,\" I said to calm him, \"Look, I have the Zhu Zhu all dry, its OK, I am so sorry. You're OK.\"  \"She says that kid is OK,\" I heard the lady in the next booth say quite clearly, \"but clearly he's  not  OK.\" Perhaps I am a little sensitive or paranoid, but the way this was said, and the fact that she was speaking to the person next to her, yet looking straight at us, I'm sure this was meant for us. The waitress thought so, too, because she said something I didn't catch, very quietly, to the lady. I decided to simply ignore it at the moment, and get Joey to his seat and finishing his lunch. Our waitress fussed over him a little, making sure his drink was filled, asking if he needed anything, directing her attention to him, which also distracted him and got him re-settled.  We went out to see my mom after, and the boys were raising a rumpus (did I mention they are a little out of sorts?), and I told her about it, including the moment of silence. She immediately changed the subject. Again, talking about it in front of him was not a moment of good grace. So what if I felt all those eyes upon us? Life isn't all about me; the important thing is to get Joey calm and help him cope with being overwhelmed. How does he feel to hear his mommy talk about a moment he, too, may have found embarrassing?  I wish I could now write a paragraph as I did about Andy's situation, with all the creative and constructive things I will be doing to make this right. But I just don't see a lot I can do to make embarrassing my child in front of his grandmother right. We will talk about it some, I will ask the OT what I can do, we will try to assess situations faster and avoid the overwhelm better. And talking about my own feelings of such moments with mom? I'll wait until he's in bed asleep. It will keep (and if it doesn't, perhaps that's for the best, too).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bugbox.net/", "http://www.aqua.org/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/07/moments-to-blush.html", "title": "\nMoments to Blush\n"},

{"date": "Monday, July 12, 2010", "body": "\nI was in the middle reading Andy a bedtime story, when he carefully opened the screen door and crept in. At first I thought he was coming in for a bedtime hug from brother, but then I looked at those red eyes and knew there was more. I hugged him, and all he could do was sob. Daddy called Andy into another room to read, and I hugged my baby tight, covering him in kisses, and began the Guessing Game.  \"What's wrong, baby?\" I cooed, giving him more kisses as he leaned his little red face on my chest and sobbed.  \"I was in the bathtub alone.\" I frowned. To be honest, this made no sense to me at all; he's been insisting on privacy in the bathroom for over a year.  \"Were you scared?\" I prompted, \"We're right here.\"  \"I'm scared.\" Part of speaking Joey is trying to untangle the words that make sense from the words that don't, and figure out what are words he is attaching to feelings, and what are words trying to communicate like other people, providing clear information. This is even harder when the words are between sobs and sniffles.  \"What are you afraid of, buddy?\"  \"My brain is hot. It's burning.\"  \"Are you sick?\" I feel his forehead, but there is no fever. The words mean something else, then.  \"Your brain is burning? What is making your brain hot?\"  \"It's too long.\"  \"What's too long?\"  \"The ride! It will take a hundred million years!\" Ride. Ride. Long ride. Ah-hah! Field trip tomorrow! \"You have a field trip tomorrow,\" I nod. \"Don't you want to go to the museum?\"  \"No!\" Unfortunately, my wording of that question makes me wonder if I was clear.  \"Do you want to go tomorrow?\"  \"No!\" Well, that was clear.  \"Are you worried about the field trip?\"  \"The ride is Too. Long.\"  \"Yes, it's about an hour to Richmond, and then you will go to the museum- the science museum! You love science! What do you think they will have there?\"  \"I'm afraid of the sharks!\"  \"Well, they won't have live ones, maybe pictures.\"  \"I don't like sharks.\"  \"You can see other things. Maybe they'll have something about the weather! Or volcanoes!\" \"It takes too long!\" \"Do you know where the museum is? Do you remember when we go to Maymont? Those big buildings we pass when we get to Richmond? The museum is one of those. So it isn't even as far as Maymont. Just about an hour.\"  \"It is farther than Maymont! It will take a hundred hours!\" He breaks into sobs again. \"Its too many!\" \"Joey, are you worried about the museum, or the ride to the museum.\"  \"The ride!\" he wails, but clear as a bell. Ok, now we're getting somewhere.  \"You like riding the bus, don't you? You'll be on the bus with Ms. Macy, and all your friends...\"  \"Too many!\"  \"You think there are too many people on the bus? Are you worried about the people, or that it will be loud?\"  \"Too loud!\" More sobbing. My brain goes into hyperdrive.  \"Well, how about your earphones? Does Ms. Macy have your phones?\"  \"No!\" He's getting a little frantic now; time for a solution.  \"Well, how about earplugs? Would you like earplugs?\" The \"yes\" is reluctant, yet he is calming down; he wants to reduce the noise, but this is not the ideal solution for him. He knows he hates having the plugs in his ears.  \"How about a music player, with headphones?\" I'm thinking out loud. Mom got them headphones for Christmas. We haven't really used them, and they were originally for Andy; but this spike in noise sensitivity in Joey brings them instantly to mind- and besides, they are sitting right next to me. The phones would block out the other noise, and the music fill his ears with something rhythmic and familiar.  \"I can listen to my favorite songs!\" he almost sings, smiles busting out all over that little red face.  \"Yes! Let's go make a CD!\"  So I have let him pick out the tunes, have loaded it into the CD player, and emailed the teachers. I'm also sending a note. Let's just hope they have sense enough to let him have it for the ride!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/07/anxiety-and-world-of-bus.html", "title": "\nAnxiety and the World of the Bus\n"},

The doubt wasn't that he doesn't luv him some Hazelwild, but that he has to be there from 8:45 am to 5pm. That's a long camp day. Fortunately, he's still very happy, and had a great day. They couldn't go out for their nature program today (it was 100 FREAKIN' DEGREES, with a heat index of  ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN DEGREES ) so the camp watched a movie- one that Andy is afraid of, so his counselor kindly wandered about with him and chatted for the hour and a half. How cool is that? They did allow the kids to get in the pool, so all was good. Oh, and he made some kind of bead thing-a-ma-bob, with a few beads on a very long string. He's very happy about it.  Joey got stuck with Mom. He decided he wanted to learn about the ocean this week (decided Sunday night, no less), so i have lots of ocean stuff planned. We kinda didn't get to any of it today. I had to run in to the office to do some stuff, and one thing lead to another, and in the end we celebrated our first Ocean Camp Day by studying water. As in, we went to the pool and swam together. He was excited that Mom got in the pool, so all was good. We practiced our swimming. That counts, right?  Tomorrow I am hoping to pull out some Jacques Cousteau films and books and stuff, maybe talk about fish, and curl up in the heat of the day on the couch together with my computer and have a \"let's research and find out\" segment. Maybe look up currents or different ocean levels or something. I'll see if he has a question he can come up with himself. Oh, and we have speech at 2. Maybe I'll let Ms. Leslie in on Ocean Camp, too. ;)  Happy Summer!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/06/summer-camp-begins.html", "title": "\nSummer Camp Begins\n"},

And all sorts of other skills. I don't usually have folks over to my house, especially this time of year. Christmas is better- the house is cleaned and decorated and sparkling, literally. But the beginning of summer? Not a chance. I'm lucky to see my livingroom floor. Except that I think it has playdough smeared on it right now. Oops.  My plan for prep is to take a shower. That's a rare thing here, a real shower in the middle of the week! At least she won't know I'm normally stinky on top of being messy.  I know it is going to be a rockin' day, even if our plans get turned up-side down by the heat- because we'll be in Camp Stimey.

{"date": "Thursday, June 24, 2010", "body": "\n So the gracious  Stimey  came and picked up the JoeyAndy Clan, and we were off to Jamestowne! Woo-hoo! We picked the hottest day of the summer, of course. And Stimey lives over an hour north of me, and Jamestowne is almost two hours south of me. So we were already kinda hot and tired when we got there. Well, I was good, because Stimey didn't let me drive, and I had her to chat with. And the Zhu Zhu Pets. My kids insisted on bringing theirs, so we thought it would a good idea for Camp Stimey to include a general and complete round of Zhu Zhu Sidekicks, and then Andy had to bring two, so we had six Zhu Zhu Pets cooing and squeaking all the way up and down the road. Whee!  (By the way, Stimey has an awesome car. I recommend roadtrips with her. In her car.) The only real hiccup we had was when we initially arrived, and Joey's Zhu Zhu Pet fell out of the car, and onto the pavement. This really gets Joey upset when his toys touch the road and get \"dirty\". However, we assured him that the Zhu Zhu was fine, and could come with him into Jamestowne (because he's hurt and needs to be cuddled!), and the world righted itself. So we were off and running!  We decided to head straight down to the boats, which is the farthest point, and thus be there with the least amount of heat. It almost worked. We wandered through the Powhatan Village first. The boys liked ducking into the huts and seeing how Native Americans lived and where they slept.  We soon also had a running theme of \"where's Jack?\" Jack is such a wonderful little guy, so quiet, so patient, and so very curious. He has a mind that is turning a mile a minute, and he wants to go see what this is, or what caught his eye there. Because he is so quiet, he is easy to lose- the other guys, you just take a listen and you know where they are without even seeing them. Even Joey is motor-mouthing, especially with the heat. With Jack, visual contact is must. Stimey and I spend a good deal of time making sure one of us had visual contact.  Then we made it down to the boats. They have three replicas of boats the original Jamestown settlers crossed the ocean on. They are very small, especially considering there were some 40-50 people on them for four months solid. You can go on the boats and have people in costume telling you about the boats and the crossing and that sort of thing. I stationed myself at the only on/off ramp to ensure we had no escapees while running about the decks and cabins.  The boys bobbed and ducked all over the boats, down in the hold, through the cabins, onto the decks. The decks weren't too bad, but the lower hold, with none of the deck breezes, was pretty stifling. Joey liked the cabins, he came in and out of this door a few times. It was also pretty shady on the middle deck, they had canvas stretched over it like a tent, which made it more inviting.  Here's Quinn on the boat. Kind looks like Peter Pan to me, complete with Zhu Zhu Pet. To keep folks cool, I brought along drinks in ice in a cooler, and dipped washcloths in the cold water. By the end of the day, Quinn was running around with one on his head, then around his Zhu Zhu Pet. Absolutely precious. Those boys take good care of their Zhu Zhus.   Andy was having a grand time running about the boats. There is something about boys and the call of the sea, swinging about the rigging and running up and down the decks of ships. Pirates, ahoy! Andy and Sam were, as usual, mostly inseparable. Andy luvs him some Sam. I wouldn't be surprised if there were more letters and pictures exchanged between them this week.  The heat was coming on fast, and we kind of had to hurry the boys along instead of letting them run about in complete happiness.  Joey and I share sun sensitivity, so I surrendered my hat to a hot and tired boy as we headed up to the fort. We weren't there long before I started giving the signals of Joey being done with the heat (something to the effect of, \"Eep, Stimey, Joey's done! Where's Jack?\") We did discover the good-sized and airy church structure, which I found architecturally fascinating, but will have to spend time going over the quick snaps I took rather than being able to wander at my leisure to admire the wood work. This was a reproduction, mind, but it was still lovely. Andy liked the pews. Even my bouncy one needed a break.  Yes, Andy and Sam definitely had a good day. They got to see a musket fired, they got to play on three boats, any one of which could have been directly out of any pirate tale you like, they got to pretend to be Powhatan Indians and even try out the beds, and they got to be with each other! Total WIN!  WE then strolled back up to the museum, where you aren't allowed to take photos, and found some places to stretch out, watch educational films, and play with our Zhu Zhus while we cooled off. And as we drove off into the sunset, we saw the thunderstorms building and ready to strike, so our timing was fabulous.  Being with Team Stimey is always a pleasure. We should do it more often. And when it's cooler, so we can make it together longer.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXWD7FjrI/AAAAAAAADf8/N-VC77w11bc/s1600/andy_fountain.jpg", "http://www.stimeyland.com/2010/06/jamestown.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXSJK7LDI/AAAAAAAADf0/j74hZN3wcs8/s1600/joey_fountain.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXRhpj3mI/AAAAAAAADfs/f83kXzkIK60/s1600/joey_skywriting.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXRAiKP0I/AAAAAAAADfk/CaThlXv3qXg/s1600/andy_boat3.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXQSkbADI/AAAAAAAADfc/7e8K-uaWkiU/s1600/joey_boat.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQgDJITwGI/AAAAAAAADgE/O4GYFqEvDgE/s1600/quinn.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXQCe8BzI/AAAAAAAADfU/IKm0Cj3uPp0/s1600/andy_boat.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXDFalH8I/AAAAAAAADfM/dceREwwLwoE/s1600/andy_boat2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXCvg-HoI/AAAAAAAADfE/L9KPqBx7egI/s1600/joey_hat.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXCC1QDkI/AAAAAAAADe8/Odn4iRddWO4/s1600/andy_church.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXB_r6ruI/AAAAAAAADe0/WcfA0VN_3_M/s1600/andy_church2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TCQXBf2zUlI/AAAAAAAADes/2eEGOa5AE70/s1600/joey_hat2.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/06/joining-camp-stimey-in-jamestowne.html", "title": "\nJoining Camp Stimey in Jamestowne\n"},

NOW .  Start with the assumption that given appropriate services, all children can excel. If the child is not thriving and progressing as any non-disabled peer would do, start thinking about whether you are providing appropriate services. Does the child have access to communication skills (not just speech skills-  communication  skills)? Does the child have an appropriate sensory environment? Are the methods being used to teach the child appropriate?  Only when all that is exhausted should modification to education be even dreamed of. And it should take  years  to get there. Just as it now often takes  years  to get appropriate services in place,  if  they ever are actually put into place and practiced.  With a proactive, positive attitude, creative solutions can be easier to find and implement. Assuming competence means you are more likely to push a child to competence. It works with non-disabled people, I assure you- if you expect them to do A, B, and C, I find the vast majority of them do. This should be no surprise to formally trained educators.  So why is it? Why is discrimination against people, simply because they have challenges, considered acceptable in our society?

He's gotten through the year being able to do his work, participate in his class, and enjoy his year. For my little guy, whose ADHD has gone mostly unrecognized by his school, this is huge.

{"date": "Thursday, June 03, 2010", "body": "\nI signed Andy up for T-Ball. This is very exciting, and Andy is very happy about it. When I got the phone call about the practices, it was a little odd. \"You're on the Red Team,\" the message said. \"Practices start next week. Oh, by the way, we don't have a head coach for the Red Team yet. If you know anybody who can help us out, give us a call.\"  Well , I thought,  I don't know anything about baseball. It's a pretty popular program. One of the dads will hear that and pick it up, no problem. Besides, I'd like to be able to just sit with some of these other moms and dads and get a little taste of normalcy for a bit.  We turned up at the first practice, and Andy was happy to find he knew several of the kids (there are 30 kids, and only one is a girl). I knew some of the moms, and even a couple of the dads. I got to talking to one older gentleman, a granddad; Andy didn't know the boy, but soon made buddies with him. We all stood about chatting, waiting for the coaches to show up, and realizing there were two teams here- Gray and Red. Some of the moms were in book clubs, chatting about the books they were reading. Chatter of TV shows I have never even heard of. Some talk of who would be \"suckered\" into being the \"team mom\" for each team (and thus organize post-game snacks each week). Guess where  that  conversation was heading. After all, these were all busy people. They had jobs and kids and bookclubs to do.  When the coach (note the singular) showed up, we all gathered in to hear what was up: the program had called him pleading for him to please coach a team, and then they decided he would coach both teams, but he needed assistant coaches. He wanted two from each team, and he had two from the Gray team already signed up. One was a young dad who seemed to know a good deal about baseball, and a mom who was already wearing a gray shirt and a baseball cap. Could he get two volunteers from the Red team? Because if he couldn't, the program would have to be cancelled, and there would be no season. There was a moment of deafening silence. Eyes found the ground, the kids, the cars, the sky. Just a moment, when things became very,  very clear. Given the choice between volunteering or disappointing their kids by canceling the program, crickets were starting to chirp.  No, I didn't speak up first. Remember, I know nothing about baseball. Or coaching. And I am very, very fat. Did I mention I am not an athlete in any way, shape, or form?  Granddad spoke up first. But I knew from that moment of silence that without another voice, Andy wouldn't be able to play, and that wasn't the right choice. These kids should be able to play. It wasn't their fault that coaches weren't lined up for them. And it's T-Ball, how hard can it be?  So you can just call me Coach Andymom. Granddad and I looked at each other and laughed. In a sea of parents, we knew it was the right thing to do. But I know it's going to be a fabulous experience, because Granddad waved me on to the field with him saying, \"Well, they're ours, now. Let' show all these folks what fun really is!\"  They all obliged by standing outside the field fence chatting together and reading their books while we had a  blast  playing with their kids. The Red Team may not win many games, but we're going to have a lot of fun playing them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/06/because-thats-way-i-roll.html", "title": "\nBecause That's The Way I Roll.\n"},

What this means for most kids is that the older elementary kids- third, fourth, and fifth graders- are not housed with the wee ones (K-2), so that programming and instruction can be more focused on the needs of the two age groups. What it means for us is we have to start from scratch trying to claw for the services Joey needs, with a whole new group of people with a whole new attitude towards special education, special ed students, and what services should entail.  And so far, I am not impressed.  We had a separate meeting for ESY, partly because there was this huge gap called August, five weeks of black hole in service that would be a disaster for Joey. And what I learned was that our new crew believes my son's education is less important that waxing the floors. Really.  Not. Good.  I've listened to these folks at the Sped Parent meetings. The impression I get there is no better. There is a sense of dividing and isolating cases instead of a broader view of service in which the children's services and strengths are interconnected and interwoven for an effective educational netting- or better yet, fabric. You can't have social skills for one. The problem is I know they have at least three, likely more. Can't do this for one, can't do that for one. If I hear it again, I'm going to stand up and say, \"You have one that needs this. Not wants. Needs.  Figure it out .\" I'm starting to look up the numbers for lawyers again. I suspect I will need one in the next, oh, three years. And it is likely to be sooner rather than later. Better to go ahead and put in a retainer, rather than have to come up with one in a super-hurry.  As I left the meeting, the new administrator made the usual \"Everything is going to be fine\" speech. I think she meant well. However, if she thinks she's building any trust here, she is sadly mistaken. When your concern is about having to have a whole month to strip the floors, rather than being concerned about the needs of your students- even just one student, if you must- there is seriously nothing trustworthy there.  I'm going to have to start seeing some serious effort and creative support soon if we're to get any trust going on this side.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 11, 2010", "body": "\nYou may remember that  we had an incident at school  a couple weeks ago; Joey was taught a bad word and then paraded about the class to repeat it, to the amusement of his classmates. Want a textbook example of bullying a child with a disability? Here it is.  You may remember I was assured there was teaching, there was \"consequences\" for the other child, there was discussion. However, with such an event happening even when the next school is assuring us that \"our kids aren't like that\", and the possible supports I could arrange through his OT and speech therapists, getting a report on the incident has been... frustrating.  I went to the school office and requested a report. I was told to see Ms. D, and someone went to tell her I was there. I waited. Then I was told Ms. D was busy and had appointments waiting, so I put my request in writing. The response was an email to the effect of, \"I have no incident report on this incident.\" Um... wait a minute, I thought there were \"consequences\" for the bully involved? If there were \"consequences\", surely there was a report, and the victim should have access to such a report (with the name of the other child's name and ID info redacted for privacy- we are talking about minors here)? Or since I have requested one, perhaps one could be created to document the incident? No, I was referred to the gym teacher,  Mr. P, who left a message on my phone.  Talking on the phone is not documentation.  What, I'm not happy that Joey is fine and the other child has had \"consequences\"?  Well, no. No I'm not. Joey isn't fine. I want a frickin' report. In writing. Now.  I stumbled upon the teacher in question when Joey missed the bus one morning, and I had to take him to school. The teacher was upset, and perhaps a little nervous to realize who I was, and not knowing whether or not I knew who  he  was. I certainly know now. I was promised a summary of the incident via email by the following Monday.  Sound good? Yeah. Too good. Two weeks later, I've got nada. Last week, I contacted our awesome case manager to make sure the email I had sent confirming the conversation had not fallen into the nethers, and had her re-forward my email. I still have nothing.  Today is Tuesday. If I still have nothing come Thursday, Hell breaks loose on Friday.

{"date": "Saturday, May 08, 2010", "body": "\nWhen I take pics and film of my guys, it is a rare thing to see them doing anything but being their smiling, happy little selves, being boys and doing stuff boys do. When I send out movies and slide shows of my kids, it becomes hard for some folks to believe that our lives are so divergent from normal. It spreads a sort of myth that my kids just do \"more of the same\".   I don't use the word \"myth\" lightly, as many of my students can tell you. That general misuse of the term to indicate \"complete falsehood\" makes properly talking about myth difficult. Myth is not false. Myth is about deeper Truth. Perhaps Truth on the Slant. An oblique view of realities, in terms that are understandable to the audience. The image I put out of Joey and Andy, that \"like other kids, only more\" is an oblique look at the Truth of living with my kids. But what does it mean to have \"more of the same\"? Does intensity make a difference?  I took footage of about 30 seconds of the start of a spiral today. Joey fell and scraped his knees, poor little guy, and the instant overload commenced. Few get to see this part of Joey, that \"everything is perfect until something goes wrong; then I'm completely D.O.N.E.\" side. Those who do see it, see it so often, we're used to it, it just becomes par for the course, and you know what to do to mitigate and have the best chances of avoiding meltdown.  However, our new school folks have not seen it. The folks who think none of  their  little darlings would tease a special needs child have no clue what this looks like, or what to do; and it becomes so matter-of-course to the old crew that I think it gets overlooked. It is a part of our lives left undocumented, and I worry about it being ignored. Ignoring it can cause a whole host of problems; not having safeguards in place to deal with the unexpected spiral means meltdowns are on the way. Meltdowns are scary- for Joey as well for anyone around him. They are also avoidable, if you know what you doing and how to diffuse a situation (which is hard enough to do when you  are  prepared and keeping it mind!) I'd say, prepared, you have about an 80-90% chance of averting meltdown. Unprepared? Eep.  So I took about 30 seconds of footage of the beginnings of a spiral. I didn't catch the first initial shock and scream from the actual fall. I started with him hugging on his Dad and getting hugged, and yet things were still not right. He was D.O.N.E. It goes up to when he decides \"I'm leaving now\" (and says so), and I have to stop filming to go catch him. We didn't melt, and I'll probably never get footage of a melt. I'm too busy trying to help him to be filming something like that. But this was enough to see the storm clouds brewing. Hopefully dark clouds on the horizon are enough to indicate the strength of a potential storm.  Watching those 30 seconds was hard. I look over the clips, and erase ones that are better tossed to oblivion- unfortunate angles, bad focus, accidental exposures, that sort of thing. I also wanted to get an idea of what I had captured, because to be honest, I was paying more attention to Joey than to the camera, even though it was in my hand; those little markers that say \"I'm about to melt!\" are important to catch. I think it is important to get across to the school what skills we need worked on and able to generalize to home, and the potential issues over things we consider insignificant. It is also important to document the issue so we can measure improvements- or track regressions. I'm nervous about next year in a big way. The questions asked by the new teachers at the IEP made plain how unprepared they are.  It is all the harder to watch because we are through the early spring regressions, and have made our leap forward. Joey helped his Grandma make her bed- mattress cover and all. He is better able to locate objects in a room, even bringing things from one room to another. He is improving in his ability to control himself and cope. His language use is looking up. His attitudes are generally improving. He's doing so well. It makes the harder moments that much harder to witness, and to get others to understand. We've come so far, and yet have so far to go; we can't get stuck in a rut in the middle. Not now.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/05/hardest-half-minute.html", "title": "\nThe Hardest Half Minute\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, April 25, 2010", "body": "\nDid you guess that it has been a long week?  I sit now, in a break from reading essays, curled in the bedroom chair, the cats asleep. One is sprawled over the bed, taking up the whole thing as only a cat (or small boy) can. The other has languidly spread herself over the top of the chair. With the boys downstairs, stillness reigns. It is an odd, rare moment here. The IEP is mostly done, and we take a breath before working on the ESY piece and putting together the material for fighting the OT piece. The job interview has come and gone, and I now find myself worrying about what I said or did or what I might need to do, for a job it is highly likely I will not get. The mind races, the wheels spin, and I begin to wonder what things I ought to be doing but haven't done yet, what should be done first in the long list of things that are needful.  The mind spins.  It is supposed to storm today. I can see the deepening grey of the clouds, the stark green of spring leaves against the gathering storm. The greying sky makes the new leaves seem almost neon, almost glowing in brilliance. You don't get that effect in summer. The light doesn't play through the older, darker greenery of summer in the same way. It's a spring thing.  I'm gearing up for summer. I know I have at least one week of both boys together, and one week of Joey alone. I wish I could get my embroidery machine up and running- the toy I asked for two Christmases ago now, and still haven't gotten far enough in life to even get out of the box- I could make merit patches for the boys to earn. If I knew how to get my own designs into the computer of the machine, of course. That first week we could do some traveling, I am putting some money away for it. Down to Williamsburg. Up to the zoo. The usual, familiar haunts to greet the coming of summer. We could put our feet into the water at Colonial Beach, maybe find some shark's teeth in Westmoreland Park. Or maybe we could find something new. That second week, it is time to send Andy off to camp, and find something for Joey. He did weather camp last year, and space camp, and vehicles. It is a little too soon to really ask him- we're almost two months out- but I need to start thinking about materials and projects and what we can do.  I've signed Andy up for t-ball and camps, and Joey looks like he'll have four weeks in a big school program, and I've requested at least two more weeks of programming of some kind for him. A five-week school hiatus in August would be a disaster. On the other hand, where they plunk those two weeks could be important for us; when will we go to the beach? Joey so loves the beach. Which school will I be working for? One semester starts sooner than the other.  Whirr, whirr, whirr.  What materials should I put together for Joey's new teachers? I wish they had several inclusion rooms, instead of just one for each level. Is there such a sharp drop-off in kids in special ed? I wonder if he's being \"stuck\" into an inclusion room instead of sent out into the \"regular\" rooms because he needs an aide, and they don't want to hire one. What happens if they find they need to send him out, for academic and/or social reasons? Should I have pressed for an aide? Should I have asked more questions? Who will be Joey's case manager in his new school? Why wasn't it made clear at the meeting?  I need to find something fun for Andy to be doing while we are at Joey's games. He's feeling left aside, the game is boring to him since he can't play in it. There are a few other siblings hanging around, maybe something can be organized for them. Some way they can participate and join in. There must at least be a way to let them know they are not forgotten. What do siblings normally do at the games of their brothers or sisters?  I need to go to the grocery store tonight. We're out of yogurt and cat food.  When does the spin cycle end?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/04/as-mind-turns.html", "title": "\nAs The Mind Turns\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, April 13, 2010", "body": "\nI sit at the picnic table with my little notebook, making my scribblings, a story that sometimes runs through my head for developing, but nothing serious, a junk novelette for the fantasy section of dimestore bookrack. He runs up to me, looking tired, red in the face from the running, which is more like a toddler trot. He lays his head on the table, then perks up to take a sip of soda.  \"How are you, Buddy?\" I ask, as he looks hot. He grins.  \"I'm OK.\" He pauses, takes another sip. \"I am playing a game.\"  \"Oh good!\" I start in the praise, but he cuts me off.  \"Use the arrow keys to move the Joey through the snappity-snap turtles. Press the space bar to jump.\" He runs off, with a funny gallop. It isn't skipping. Joey can't skip. He can't hop. He doesn't really run, not like other children his age, even the ones bad at sports. He can't crab-walk.  He re-appears, and starts doing the buttons on my sweater. This is an exciting moment, a new skill, he is showing off. They are large buttons, and he has a hard time getting them through, but he does it. I have never seen him do a button on himself.  \"I did your buttons, Mommy!\" the pronouncement is sharp, clear, full of pride.  \"Good job, Buddy! Thank you!\" He's gone again. I tried to put him in pants that he needed to snap and zip himself, but it was too much frustration for him. He zips his coat now, that's a good thing. But the snap was too much. I haven't really tried a button, pants buttons are too small for him yet.  They both appear, panting, and claim their new Zhu Zhu Pets. They turn and run off, Joey following the siren call of, \"Come ON, Doey!\" The words that follow this call are too unclear for me to decipher, but Joey seems to know what his brother is saying, and they are happy. Happy is good.  He is at the swings. Someone has a baby in the baby swings, and he pushes, ever so gently. He loves babies. He is talking to the mom, who doesn't mind that there are gaps between her questions and his answers, she gives him time to process, probably more because she is watching the baby than out of understanding of processing disorders, but it will do. \"I like Wow Wow Wubbzy!\"  \"Do you? That's nice. Who do you have there?\" \"Widget.\"  \"Is she a pink... um... rabbit?\"  \"And Wubbzy is a bear with a long tail!\" \"Do you go to school?\"  \"I go to Hugh Mercer.\" \"Who is your teacher?\"  \"I have Mrs.H. Mrs. L's class, we did about ancient Egypt.\"  \"So you have Mrs. L?\"  \"We read about George Washington!\"  Not bad. On topic, real responses, mostly nice grammar. It is the gaps, which I cannot really reproduce here, that stand out and make it clear that this conversation is not ordinary. I know the woman picks up on it, because she glances quizzically at me, but I won't say anything unless she comes over to ask. Some do. Some don't. That's fine.  He is trying to play with the other children; Andy and two other little boys, who are about Andy's size, so probably Joey's age. I quickly discern the game involves a bad guy, Star Wars, guns, and a lot of hiding behind trees. Joey walks up to one of the kids, I can't hear what is said, but the look on the child's face screams confusion and annoyance. Another child tries to get Joey to hide behind a tree. Joey wanders off. Andy tries making him the bad guy and shooting at him. Joey gets upset, he doesn't want sticks pointed at him, and runs back to me, crying.  \"Andy is killing me! I don't want to be dead! I died!\" Oh no, I think. Our trigger is tripped. The rest of the day is sprinkled liberally with  pronouncements of the death of various toys, and how long they will be dying (\"My Zhu Zhu Pet died for twenty years! He's dead! But he got better, he's better now.\").  Joey has had enough. The frustration is getting to him. Sometimes he will lay on the merry-go-round and play in the dirt to calm down, but there are bigger kids there now, and they have it whirling about at a big-kid speed. He calls to Andy. I gather up the pile of small toys and sticks that has accumulated around my position at the picnic table. We wander towards the car. He's come so far, I remind myself deliberately. So far. So far. So far.  So far to go.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/04/upcoming-event-here-comes-iep.html", "title": "\nUpcoming Event: Here comes the IEP\n"},

I have to find a way to translate what I see into terms of black and white, specific goals to be met, skills to be taught. I have to walk that line of what he cannot do, weighed with what he can; He is doing super-well, but he's still disabled. I have to get people to understand why functioning is important to educational progress. School people patting themselves on the back for how far he's come, and having to dampen that with how far we have to go.  Why can't Joey join in pretend games with other children? Why is that important to his academic progress? How do you explain the value of dynamic intelligence, of social inclusion, of being able to connect and remain connected? How do you explain intellectual development as more than reading, writing, and arithmetic, in a world where standardized testing reigns supreme?  Why can't Joey grasp the idea of history and time, when he can tell you exactly what time it is at any given moment? How do you express concern about teaching abstract concepts to a child who is so firmly concrete?  Why can't I get Joey to read at home, independently? Why can't I get him to focus on a book? What I can I do to help him understand the importance of being able to find information for himself? How do we instill a sense of imagination, so that he will better be able to problem-solve and think outside the box? And how do I introduce this child to these new folks? Should I be assembling a set of notebooks, packed with information about autism and approaches to teaching? Do I need more than the latest set of evaluations, thin as that packet now is? Should I have called Kluge and had a full re-evaluation?  Then there is the looming battle of OT. I've already been given the heads' up that the OT wants to release him to \"consult only.\" Yet I see so many issues, some of them even regressions. I can't get the private eval until May, so I won't have that piece of paper to fight this battle.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 13, 2010", "body": "\nIt has been brought to my attention that CafePress is donating 10% of sales of anything marked \"autism\" to Autism Speaks through the end of April. Upon inquiry, this includes a number of other autism-related tags as well. We were not given any notice about this \"promotion\", nor were we asked for permission.  As you may realize, April is for autism-related products what the Christmas season is to most other retailers: the high season, when you make your money, if you are going to make any money all year. I get 10% of the sales of CafePress products through my shop. Through most of the year, I make enough to cover the cost of the shop (because I have multiple designs, etc., I do have a \"premium shop\"). Usually from February through April, I make enough to cover a few sessions of speech therapy for Joey.  I must leave it to you to make a decision about purchasing from the shop this month. Does 10% to Joey balance out against 10% to Autism Speaks? If you would prefer not to support Autism Speaks, but were intending to purchase something from the shop, my advice is to wait until May, to be extra-doubly-sure we are out of this \"promotion\" period. If you are searching for my products this month, the only products you will be able to find searching for \"autism\" are the items which actually have \"autism\" in the caption/design (assuming the tag changes take effect). My apologies.  I have tried a number of other sites of this kind, but CafePress is the only one that has been self-sustaining and actually pays real money- I have actually received real checks, not just promises that I might get one someday if my design is super-popular, or get \"paid\" in site-\"cash\" that can only be used to buy stuff from the site.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 27, 2010", "body": "\nWell, it happened. That day we tried hard to prepare ourselves for, watch for, warn others to try to avoid. But it was, unfortunately, inevitable. I wish it wasn't, but it is. A sad statement, that.  One of Joey's classmates thought it was funny to teach him to say \"bitch.\" Then they thought it was hilarious to take around the room and have him repeat it to his classmates- who all laughed and thought it was funny. So Joey thought he was being funny, and went with it. I'm sure we all know that those kids were laughing at him, not with him.  What tools does Joey have to defend himself against such an attack? What does it say about our society that such an attack, child against child, would even be imaginable? Yet not only was it imaginable, we had already started trying to teach those skills of coping with anti-social behavior of others. Teasing. Bullying. Nastiness.  I am assured that there was discussion and teaching and correction all around, action taken, the substitute who was supposed to be with him spoken to, etc. etc. etc. Certainly Joey understood what had happened at some level by the time he came home and we talked about it, some with Grandma, some with me, some later at bedtime. We have not heard the word repeated here, other than when Grandma asked what had happened, and he explained to Grandma what had happened, including the detail of what the word was. We knew enough about the incident to fill in the blanks he had left in his description of the event.  All of these things are already in his IEP to address, but it leaves ringing in my brain the response to the goals:  Our kids aren't like that , the new teacher insisted, backed up by another staff member of the new school. Sorry, folks, but this is a very small system. We have one school per level. Joey will be going to school with the same kids he is going to school with now. If your kids \"aren't like that\" now, get ready. It only takes one.  *********************************************** Andy and I were engaged in a new routine of bedtime activity, the Watching of the Videos. He loves him some  Fuzzy Fuzzy Cute Cute,  and  Nigel Marven , and  Walking with Dinosaurs: Live Edition.  He's allowed three before storytime, and we were coming to the end of our third, a clip from  Chased By Dinosaurs , when he burst into tears.  I was shocked. I stopped the film. He's seen the show a million bazillion times, its one of his favorites, and this clip is of funny bird-penguiny-things swimming around, and Nigel mentions most them do not live to a ripe old age because there are so many ways to be eaten in the Cretaceous oceans. Eaten? Uh-oh.  \"I'm afraid I'm going to die!\" he wailed, inconsolable.  Death has been a huge trigger around here since the fish died. Both little guys are having a lot of difficulty processing death and the loss of their fish, made worse by the fiasco of trying to replace them. Joey is constantly getting caught in cycles of talking about this person died, or that toy died, or his fish died. For the last two days, Andy has piped up and asked him to stop talking about dead things.  Then came the terrible blunder of our YouTube moments, one of the videos of silly dinosaurs included  the eating of a pig , and Andy loves pigs. To get around this, I showed him the  Warm Bath video,  which he loves. He made the connection between the two pigs, and we finally settled on that the pig wasn't eaten, that he was just joking with the little dinosaur and drew a picture to fool him, and the big dinosaur carried the pig to the farmer to be put in the nice warm bath, and the big dinosaur burped because he thought burping was funny ( see the video to see what I'm babbling about ), and that's what happened. No eaten piggies.  Are you with me? Because now I have a child who, about to turn six years old, is suddenly petrified by death.  \"I dont want to die! I don't want to go back to God!\" How does one cushion the fear of death in a six-year-old? I haven't a clue, honestly. We did the best we could. We assured him that we love him, that he wasn't likely to die anytime soon, the God takes good care of all of us. And we love him, and do our best to keep him safe and help him learn to stay safe.

{"date": "Sunday, November 01, 2009", "body": "\n Yes, the Big Night arrived: time for Trick or Treat! A little light rain didn't hold us back. Fleece washes. So Buzz Lightyear and the Purple Chipmunk were out and about to get their share of sugary comestibles.  I will say the boys did a fabulous job with their jack-o-lanterns. Neither of them wanted gooey hands this year, so JoeyAndyDad and I did most of the disgorging of slime, but I then had them draw their faces on, and I carved them out just as they were. Andy preferred round eyes (he has trouble making corners still), and Joey did lots of triangles. I also recommend those little electric lights instead of candles- that way boys can play with the pumpkins even after dark.  We were greeted at many doors with, \"Oh! Buzz Lightyear!\" which we expected, and then quizzical looks and \"and... um... uh...\" and Andy proudly informing his audience, \"I'm a purple chipmunk!\" Which we also expected. A couple folks asked me what character he was, and I had to tell them as far as I knew, this costume wasn't from a book or TV show. Andy just is into the color purple right now, and into chipmunks right now. So there you have it.  We did a lot of walking. I wandered down to my friend's house, but they weren't home. They must have figured we weren't coming because of the rain and taken their guys to the mall or something for treats. In consequence, we got a lot more candy than usual, because we hit houses all along the way. I expect to have two little guys with feet in the air and hands clutching tummies, but so far, they have been pretty good about the candy.  Happy Halloween, and Trick or Treat!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Su16y0cLp1I/AAAAAAAADEE/A3Lk12hiD8U/s1600-h/08_boys_ready.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Su16ytptbXI/AAAAAAAADD8/wo34uDiQXPk/s1600-h/08_boys_ready2.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Su16yjepzeI/AAAAAAAADD0/WrQyZhAhyHA/s1600-h/08_boys_treating2.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Su16yfIpatI/AAAAAAAADDs/ejKIj3F5f0A/s1600-h/08_boys_treating.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Su16yC_Z6dI/AAAAAAAADDk/Plelt-7SlPk/s1600-h/08_boys_treating3.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/11/halloween.html", "title": "\nHalloween\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 18, 2009", "body": "\n So we had part of my high school 20 -year reunion last night. Very odd. Reunions are kind of like proms- you don't over-analyze, you just go. And funny enough, people are glad to see you- even if they had no clue who you were 20 years ago. After all, being teenagers together is very intense. You never know who was watching you as you rolled down the tunnel of your own existence.  The folks who organized the reunion (and they did a fabulous job) got their hands on some of the footage that was taken just before we graduated. Most of it is from the final senior awards ceremony, the pep rally, and folks getting ready to take the big group class picture in cap and gown. That was fun to watch, partly because I wasn't in a single frame. The people who flickered across the screen were exactly who I expected to see there: the popular kids, arms around each other, living in a world from which I was excluded.  I think some folks were surprised to realize I didn't hang out with them in high school. I was a bit of a character there, with black clothes, big buttons, and the wildest earrings (clip!) that I could lay hands on. I was sad to learn the other kid who was voted Most Unforgettable was gone. Like I said, you never know who was watching. It was just odd to have people come over and want to hug you, when twenty years ago- the last time you saw them-they didn't have two words in a row to say to you. I'm not into hugging strangers (I don't even like doing it in church), and though I keep trying not to think of these people as strangers, the vast majority of them really and truly are. I was on the fringe of these people's lives, a fact made sparklingly clear by the video, those echoes of the center of the past. I wasn't even an accepted part of the fringe. I was completely absent, not even passing in front of the camera on my way elsewhere, in the lunch line, in the library.  If I was making video of my high school experience, it would include a lot of people whom these people didn't know. I was far more at home at  CTY  and with the folks I met there. Even of my \"friends\" at school, I can only think of three who were actually friends to me; most of the time, I felt begrudgingly tolerated. With my CTY friends, I was just one of them. I think it is kind of the same thing those popular kids felt, sitting about the senior courtyard, hugging and singing and laughing together. A kind of \"we're all in this together\" feeling. Watching them laugh and talk to the camera and hug each other, kind of reminded me of sitting about the lounge of Franklin and Marshall. I might still have been on the fringes, but I was an accepted part of the fringes. The center didn't push me away, they even actively included me, asking me to come along with this or that. Being invited along is a mark of acceptance that becomes so important for teenagers on the fringe. I suspect most teenagers feel themselves on the fringe, even when they are in the center.  Sitting at the table nearest the door, it was fun to watch people step into the room, and get the look of \"I don't know anyone here!\" People change over 20 years. I found that guys change more than girls- the faces of the women were mostly recognizable, if I ever knew them. For the men, we were all glad we had nametags. I was also surprised at how old people looked. After all, we're not forty yet. There was a good deal of grey hair, faces with more lines than I expected. I even went home and looked in the mirror again, and seriously, I do not look as old as these people do. I wasn't expecting any of us to look like teenagers, but seriously, am I  that  old? Perhaps I ought to be happy that I am \"better preserved\" than some of these folks? I mean, some folks looked right on the money, right where I think I look... but a whole lot more than I expected looked  old . Weird.  We're supposed to have a picnic today, so we can meet the kids and grandkids (!) and all. Might be interesting. Or it might not. Might give the kids something to do after being penned up from the cold and wet for two days...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/StsjfGCxYQI/AAAAAAAADCk/7D4nKJmYoc0/s1600-h/family_missdee.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/StsjeCwZVtI/AAAAAAAADCM/zRxbgRW99u0/s1600-h/amanda_marching.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/StsjegUsdcI/AAAAAAAADCc/_v4KCtM-_fI/s1600-h/amanda_sweater.jpg", "http://cty.jhu.edu/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/StsjeXHxJrI/AAAAAAAADCU/tBqxgXdVdOs/s1600-h/amanda_prom.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/10/tattered-on-fringe.html", "title": "\nTattered on the fringe\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, November 15, 2009", "body": "\nThis time of year, I am often holed up on the weekends working, scoring essays for the GRE. One of the perks of the work is that occasionally boys saunter in for kisses.  Andy pops in. He is bearing a number of small pieces of paper he has colored for me. \"I'll put them here, mom,\" he assure me as he gingerly tucks them into frames of pictures in the room. \"There! Now don't lose them!\" He pops out.  Joey wanders in. He looks sad, and he sprawls on the bed. \"Are you OK?\" I prompt. \"Daddy says I have to stay in my room one hundred years.\" \"Wow, thats a long time. What happened?\" \"Andy sat on my arm. I am Buzz Lightyear.\" That may not tell you much, but for me, it conjures up a scene where Joey is annoying Andy by pretending to be Buzz Lightyear falling down the stairwell, complete with slow-mo and shocked face. At the end of the sequence, Joey pulls off a glove to pretend his arm has come off (or he hides an arm in his shirt, pulling it out of his sleeve- but the \"sat on my arm\" indicates glove). Andy then sits on the glove, probably purposely, but you never know. Joey proceeds to take action to recover said glove. Result: the crying I hear downstairs and a Joey in my bedroom. Andy comes wailing in, tears down his face, and into my arms as I swiftly move the computer aside. All attempts at conversation are repulsed; I hug him, kiss him, and he darts away. I haven't a clue.  Joey bounces in. \"Hi Mommy!\" he calls loudly, probably letting his Dad know that he has  not  gone to his room as he was told to do. \"Hey, little Buddy! Whatcha up to?\" \"Mud is brown!\" \"Yes it is.\" \" Ducks are blue !\" \"Are they?\" \"I'm a green caterpillar!\" \"I see!\" He hugs me and leaves without another word.  Andy comes in, with a big bag and a soda- lunch! Yum! \"Hi Mommy!\" he chimes as he gives me the bag. \"Do I get a kiss, too?\" He giggles and lets me smooch him. \"I miss you, Mommy!\" \"I miss you, too, sweetie.\" \"I'm not a sweetie! I'm a Andy!\" I guess he doesn't have the concept of \"synonym\" down yet.  Joey appears, grinning. He has small pieces of blue painter's tape all over his face. He comes over, and puts one on me. \"I'm sick,\" he says, drawing an exaggeratedly sad face. \"Oh dear,\" I respond helpfully. \"Do you have the polka-dot pox?\" He doesn't respond to this, but moves the tape from my arm to my face. \"Your face is broken. I fixed it.\" \"Thank you,\" I respond, hoping it is the correct response. You never know. \"I'm so cute!\" he announces, snatches the tape from my face, and bounces out.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.peepandthebigwideworld.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/11/entrance-exit.html", "title": "\nEntrance, Exit\n"},

Still no word about OT, but that's OK for now, because I am still trying to pay off their bill that I thought was paid long ago, and I still have no clue how much I still owe because of the way they bill. Andy is his usual bouncy self. We have been mitigating the bounce factor by encouraging outside play. My plan for today was to work on the back yard, but unfortunately, I am in the grips of a sinus yuck that I am hoping is an allergy.  Someone at school is into Spongebob Squarepants I guess, because Joey's words of the week are \"Tartar sauce!\" and \"Barnacles!\" with a smattering of, for unknown reasons, 'yucky cookie!\"  Not wanting to sit outside in the cold yesterday, I surprised with them with a popcorn an movie party when they got home. It was the first afternoon in several weeks that I was not drowning in grading, lecture-writing, discussion boards, and other teaching stuff. It was nice to be caught up. It seems a shame to waste it on being sick, though. I have also begun my annual showings of A Christmas Carol when the boys are not home and I am. 'Tis the season.

{"date": "Sunday, October 04, 2009", "body": "\nI've been particularly drawn to my children and their use of words lately. Perhaps its because Joey has been using barking more than usual, so when he uses words, I take note. Perhaps I've been reading stuff about communication in a variety of settings lately, so I've been attuned to the listening. But its been interesting.  For example, both boys have been using words more to ask for help, especially when they are looking for something. Andy came in this morning with a quiet \"Mommy, please help me find my ball. I can't find it.\" Naturally, I got up and found the toy desired, and praised him for asking. Not long ago, I would have been awakened by screaming and crying, rather than those quiet words.  Joey has also been into the words for finding. He's still very bad at hunting for lost items, but now he chants, and it takes him longer to get to the point of explosive frustration while trying to find a thing. I wish the chants were something other than, \"i can't find it! It's gone! It's not here! Someone took it! It's gone  forever !\" but it sure beats cutting straight to the screaming.  We also have more words after school. The current rhythm is Andy gets off the bus first, then we walk back to the house to get Joey. Andy will chatter about his school day all the way home- a miracle in and of itself. Joey comes off the bus and tends to barrel in the door, and he's not that interested in talk, but will at least answer a few yes/no questions. That sure beats silence.  So I found it of equal note when words were out of the question. We took Andy to the doctor on Friday because he was sent home with fever and cough, and we're on Flu Alert. Turns out he does have the flu, but not the H1N1 variety, yay. He had no words at all in the presence of the doctor. She wasn't our usual doctor, but a very nice lady all the same- and he had no words at all. He wasn't as chatty as usual eve when she wasn't in the room. Tired boys run out of words. However, I knew he was really on the mend this evening- he spent much of it pacing the livingroom, in constant conversation with himself (he got upset when I thought he was talking to me, and I answered something. Eep.) The return of the constant motion.  I also note that when Joey is upset, he is using words, repeating back words and phrases that upset him. Its actually very annoying when you are upset with him, and he's echoing you, or simply keeps talking, even back-and forth. If you aren't careful, you get caught in a net of exchange that spirals into the abyss, when you shouldn't really answer him in the first place. Not that you can ignore him, but there are evasive responses that work better than actually responding to the words he is saying.  \"Joey, please clean up the mess you made.\" \"Clean up! Clean up!\"  \"Yes, please. Let's go get some paper towels...\"  \"Towels?\" (spoken as if he has never heard this word before in his life). \"Yes, towels. Please get some paper towels and clean up the spill...\"  \"Spill? What spill? AAAAA!\" \"This spill. Let's get some towels and clean up... \" \"Clean up? Clean up? I don't want to clean up.\"  \"You made the mess, you need to clean it up...\" \"Up! No! Clean down!\"  \"We don't clean down, we clean up. We get the water up off the floor with the towel. Now come on, here's a towel, let's...\"  \"AAAAA! I'm a stupid boy!\" \"No, you aren't a stupid boy, you're a very clever boy, but we need to clean up this spill...\"  \"AAAAAAAAAAAAA! Stupid! Stupid!\" See all the mistakes I made? Instead of feeding into the banter, I should have not really responded to his \"clean up!\" chant. Instead, I should have just handed him the towels, maybe with a plain, gentle, vague, \"yes, dear.\"  But then, will that be teaching hi to not use his words?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/10/ebb-and-flow-of-words.html", "title": "\nThe Ebb and Flow of Words\n"},

I currently teach five sections as an adjunct, though the max is 4. Fortunately, the number of students I have did not max out, but it is still a pain, and requires five preps. We were thinking there would only be 3 (since all three live sections are technically the same class), but they are in 3 different formats, so they require 3 different testing and lecture formats. Yikers. (Did I mention I am only being  paid  for the maximum 4?) Then one of my colleagues got sick, and is out for the semester, so I took one of their classes.

Yep, JoeyAndyDad and I moved the furniture, scrubbed the floor, got up all the tape (why do my kids love tape?), scrubbed again, and... well, we probably should have sanded, but I am sure we'll be doing this again.

Andy thrives in a tight ship, and that is definitely what Mrs. B has to offer. She also wanted it in his records: Andy needs structure, and a lot of it.

It is hard to compete with a place that can sell anything you have in your shop for 10% less than you can buy it wholesale. Only they don't. They just undercut your retail price enough to take your customers, while raking in all that extra dough.

It's easier to justify going to the local hardware store if they are selling that can opener for $11, but $15? And in this economic climate?  Walmart can be evil from some points of view, salvation from others, and I'm not here to get into that debate. I have a habit of going to Walmart not to buy things, but simply to wander around someplace that is large, relatively quiet, and full of stuff to look at. I used to develop a lot of film there, now I print some digitals off, maybe browse what's on clearance. Sometimes I have a list of things that its best to get at Walmart than any of the other places around, which are all big-box chains, anyway, and Walmart's a lot cheaper than Lowe's for a lot of things.  I digress.  I shop at a Walmart that is not the closest Walmart to my house. There is one huge, honking reason for this:  It is not a Super-Walmart.  Super-Walmarts are so huge, so overwhelming, and so warehouse-ish that there is no pleasure in shopping in one. Even for a completely utilitarian visit, the hugeness of the space is such that trying to find the thing wanted is a pain in the patookas. And to make it worse, they move stuff around, so where it was last month, it may not be there now. The signage sucks. Heaven forbid I have the guys with me, and have to drag them across the store, because the thing that was just inside the lawn and garden door last week is now all the way over in Grocery. Oh. My. God.  No, no, I had this nice little Walmart, just a bit further than the Super-Hellmart, and in the other direction (putting it in a neighborhood that is a good bit safer after dark). I loved my little Walmart. I could wander into the lawn and garden area, and browse the flowers or the holiday wares, maybe get some cat pan liners, pick up some pictures, Meander through the craft section, then wander back through the hardware and toys and home. It was a lovely little circuit, not exhausting, familiar, unchanging. If something moved, it moved predictably, because I knew the aisles that were \"seasonal\" and the aisles designated as \"clearance\" and nothing else wandered. If I wanted something, I could go in, get what I wanted, pick up a few other things that were convenient, and be out in 15 minutes, cheerful and happy to give them my money, with thoughts of giving them my money again, no problem.  Note the past tense.  Some schmoo somewhere in the corporate higher-ups of Walmart made the disastrous decision to expand my nice, comfortable Walmart into a Hellcenter. The renovations are underway now. My store is a mess. I can't find anything. They changed the entire location of the entrance and exit, completely disorienting me when I go into the store. And my favorite lawn and garden center? Demolished. DE-MOL-ISHED. Gone.  Some poor cashier, when I expressed my distress after having spent twenty minutes in search of an item that I preferred to purchase there, started telling me how wonderful it would be, because the groceries were so much cheaper, it would be fabulous. I didn't bother to tell her that the Super Hellmart with the groceries was closer to me already. If I wanted Hellmart groceries, I could easily go to the closer store. In fact, it won't make much sense for me to go to my little Walmart anymore, because its gone. I may as well save some gas and just go to the closer store. Except that I hate that store. Its ugly. Its dirty. The people who frequent it are rough. People get mugged there a lot. And on top of that, I've priced it, and the Wegman's is beating them up one side and down the other on grocery prices right now, except for slowcooker liners (the item I spent 20 minutes finding) and cat box liners (hence me picking them up whenever I make a circuit). Everything else I buy? Nobody is touching Wegman's right now.  So the end result is my once-little Walmart is going to lose a customer. I'm sure no one cares that one person is not going to go there anymore. I'm sure so many people in that area will be very happy, as there isn't a nice supermarket on that side of town right now, so folks in those little subdivisions will fill the void I leave. But it is very, very sad to be forced from a place that was so quiet, and calming, and comfortable.  But I bet I save a lot of money, since I won't be wandering about the Walmart.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/08/goodbye-to-old-comfort-zone.html", "title": "\nGoodbye to an old comfort zone\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, September 01, 2009", "body": "\nI have a new comment on my  initial post about Alex Barton . You can read the post from ablp3391 (using your AIM tag is apparently a new way of being \u201canonymous\u201d, as you cannot email the person or find out anything about them) for yourself, and take whatever action or inaction that you feel would best suit the situation. But such extreme ignorance- an ignorance apparently shared by Wendy Portillo and her school district at Port St. Lucie, as they apparently share the attitude of the commenter- cannot go unanswered here, where I work so hard to help people understand autism and the ways my son works hard to include himself in society.  Allow me to present you a less extreme case of a  Tale of Two Classrooms .  When Andy started preschool, we had some very serious issues of sensory integration dysfunction, and as we now know, hyperactivity and attention deficit. He lasted about a week in his first preschool. His teachers had nothing good to say about him, and it was so traumatic for him that we regressed I hard-won toilet training.  Then came Classroom One.  We regained our ground and put Andy back in school with Mrs. Sch. At his new preschool. The school worked better for him because there was a lot more movement required, which he needed, but also because of Mrs. Sch. On the first day, she made clear that she just wanted to get an idea of him, before talking to me. On the second day, she pulled me aside and said, \u201cOK. Is there something you want to tell me about Andy?\u201d At that point I filled her in and told her the recommendations we had from the OT.  Mrs. Sch. now knew she had a child with special needs in her classroom. She listened to me. As the teacher, Mrs. Sch. was the adult, I control of her classroom, with the goal of meeting the needs of her students. She took that goal and duty very seriously, and changed her classroom and her routines to accommodate my child, ad in turn benefited all of her children. They were transitioned properly, had a clear schedule and daily routine, and even tape Xs on the floor to show them where to sit. These things, and all the rest of the adjustments she made over the year when I was able to provide more information, were good for everyone. Andy made leaps and bounds of progress not just in academic-based skills, but also in social skills and attention.  This last year, we had Classroom Two.  Andy was placed with a teacher who, at the last minute, had to be replaced, and we had Mrs. B, a first-time preschool teacher. Mrs. B has the makings of a fine preschool teacher, and I have no real complaints, but the marked difference in Andy was clear. The schedule was not as clearly posted for the students. The circle was not marked. The classroom had a lot of distractions on the walls. The noise level was higher. Transitions were often abrupt. When I provided the recommendations from the OT, I saw no difference in the classroom environment. We may have gained academic skills, but the sensory integration and social interaction pieces showed some regression, and certainly no progress.  Mrs. B was also aware that she had a special needs student in her classroom. Instead of listening to the parents and experts who provided advice and support, even if the school did not, she chose to run her classroom without this help. As a result, we had more days when Andy had trouble, both in school and (more often) immediately afterwards. Some of these problems will easily send Andy to the discipline office when he arrives at Kindergarten.  In looking at these two classrooms, we see what can happen to students who are not given appropriate support by their teachers. The accommodations needed to support social skills can be very simple, and simplifying and clarifying schedules, roles, and expectations is not just good for kids with special needs: all children benefit from having clarity. Also, Andy learns at a pace similar to that of his peers. Our biggest problem last year was that Joey did not- he was learning academic skills faster than his peers. And that interaction thing? No, Joey doesn\u2019t interact the same way as other people do. But with a little support from his teachers, he can make and maintain friendships, and is learning the same way you might, on-the-job.  So, ablp3391, yes, I do find Wendy Portillo responsible for supporting the students in her classroom. If she was finding it difficult, sending him to the principals office was not an appropriate strategy. Listening to parents and doing some research- there are lots of resources out there now for how to teach autistic students- would have been far more appropriate, far more constructive, and far more proactive. Besides, that is part of the job of being a teacher. I know. I am one.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/09/tale-of-two-classrooms.html", "title": "\nA Tale of Two Classrooms\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, September 24, 2009", "body": "\nAutism Speaks has a new ad campaign out there. Its a video that starts as portraying autism as the Bogeyman, then tries to show families as the Anti-Bogeyman. What a great fundraising message: give us or money, or the kids get squished. Oh, and your marriage and finances, too.  I find that offensive.  I won't sit here and try to say raising an autistic child is all sunshine and roses. Nor is it cheap. Schools do not have the resources- or often the education and training- to provide appropriate supports and therapies for autistic kids. Autistic adults are even more on their own. BUt I have said it before, and I will say it again:  Joey isn't sick. This isn't about curing anything, because there is nothing to cure. Just like we put braces on crooked teeth, but we don't talk about the kid being sick. Or we have kids wear glasses to correct vision, but we don't consider that child sick.  Our culture is quick to medicalize everything. This is partly because of insurance. Medical insurance only wants to pay for things that can be put into terms of disease. Developmental differences are not diseases. That's why medical insurance doesn't want to pay for the therapies that help individuals who have them. They want the schools to pay for that, and they have a point. However, there is such a thing a preventive medicine. Getting my child to speak and move now is going to prevent a lot of health issues- very expensive ones- down the road. Just like straightening teeth or correcting vision.  Joey is who he is. He is not a changeling. No bogeyman swept into my house and stole him away. Joey was born autistic, which means his brain is developing differently than other people's brains. In Joey's case, this development has resulted in a disability. His ability to control his body (and even, we think, for his body to control itself) and communicate has been affected by this difference in brain structure and development, and so we need to give him skills that he needs to thrive in a society that is not designed to accommodate differences. Our society's world isn't made for near-sighted people. We give them glasses.  Joey would not be the wonderful, joyful, lovely human being he is if he was not autistic. He would be someone else. Perhaps that person would have also been wonderful, joyful, and lovely. I don't know. He's not that person. I have trouble wrapping my mind around the idea of Joey being someone he isn't. I have no idea why people even try. \"If my kid didn't have autism, he would be this other person...\" Huh? That is what Autism Speaks would have you believe, and think about, and give them money to get other people to think about. Try it for yourself. If you weren't you, who would you be? See what I mean?  There are many ways of saying the same thing. Autistic people need supports, need understanding, need community, just like everybody else. Why not focus on autistic people as people, as human beings, and appeal to humanity? Has our culture lost so much touch with the idea that we are all in this together? Edit:  What Susan said.  That's what I mean.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/09/autism-is-a-color.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/09/way-things-get-said.html", "title": "\nThe Way Things Get Said\n"},

Its a amazing what a little support and a loving, caring environment can do, an active and engaging environment.  Why can't all the rest of the grades be like kindergarden?  Why can they be active, making information hands-on and providing context and relevancy? Teach the math, then get the kids to \"play store\" in \"centers\" (maybe even have a real class shop as they get older!) Why sit behind a desk all day? They'll have time for that when they are grown and working. Get them up, get them pretending to be caterpillars, get them thinking about history and what it was like to live in the past (and appreciate our progress forward!), get them doing things outside the box!  How much more fun would everybody have at school if the abstract things were then immediately put to use?  I bet there are schools like that. I'll be happy to hear all about them in the comments.

{"date": "Friday, March 27, 2009", "body": "\nNot one to waste a decent afternoon, I took the boys to the park after Joey got off the bus today. We've been spending a good bit of time at the park whenever we can, because it is good for the boys and Andy begs to go. He likes it best when there are lots of other kids there. It likes it even better when Joey is also there, because he is guaranteed a playmate.  However, we have been increasingly running into  issues  at the park. Joey has a very set way of dealing with large spaces, with other people, and with play. He cannot see a couple of kids playing and just jump into the game; he has to be told very specifically what the other children are playing, and what his role can be. This has left him open to some very unfortunate situations when children are not so nice, and there are some children at the park, and even in his classes at school, who are, to be frank, mean. They don't just casually exclude Joey, or fail to include him; they actively go out of their way to make it clear that they are shutting him out and casting him off, so that he knows it. Honestly, it takes a good deal of going out of your way to make it painful enough to Joey that he actually says something about it and knows you are doing it on purpose. Little jerks.  Joey and Andy kind of help each other on the playground, as many siblings do. Andy often gives Joey a few extra cues to catch on to a game, some extra repetition to pull him into play. Also, nobody messes with his Joey. When he sees those mean kids taunting him, he has been known to walk right up to them and say, \"You weave my Joey  awone !\"  However, this propping of his older brother sometimes gets on Andy's nerves. He wants to run and be in the game. Also, often Joey wants to play with Andy, but not always the game Andy wants to play. The natural result is that Andy wants to go play the game  he  wants to play, not the game  Joey  wants to play with Andy. The result is frustration, and often a few rounds of \"I don't want to play with you!\" and someone's feelings being hurt- usually Joey's.  Keep in mind that the vast majority of time, the playground chorus is, \"Come on, Joey! Come play!\" from Andy. Or after a few minutes, Joey's offers of, \"Andy! I want to play with you!\" is often met with unreserved enthusiasm. But a touch here and there, Andy gets tired of Joey, and wants to play with someone else and do his own thing; and Joey has a very difficult time playing with anyone else, because he and Andy know each other very well, and so Andy automatically and efficiently compensates for Joey's needs. Andy knows how to talk to Joey, how to play with Joey, how to draw Joey into a game and include him. Because of Joey's difficulties with language and social cues, other children have a harder time even when they are trying to be inclusive.  We were in the middle of a \"I don't want to play with you!\" mood. Joey gave up and started playing alone on the slides (I offered to push him on the swing, but I guess playing with Mom isn't always cool when you are feeling uncool). Andy headed over to the merry-go-round. Not too long ago, the idea of Andy getting on the merry-go-round was ludicrous. He still doesn't care to get on it, he prefers to push, or kick slowly and control the speed. But this time, he was with some new friends, a boy about his age, another older, and a third probably between the other two. They were playing pirates, and they all piled onto the merry-go-round to go \"sailing.\" The bigger boy started pushing, faster, faster. I moved closer, because I knew the breakpoint was nearing. It was crossed. Andy hates feeling like he is going to fall off, and the merry-go-round was going too fast. He started to wail.  Suddenly, Joey darted in from my left. He must have heard Andy and slid down fast to get there so quick. He was calling to the bigger boy, \"Stop! Stop! Andy doesn't like to go fast!\" and he grabbed the merry-go-round and dug in his heels to slow it down. The other boys were voicing their displeasure, but Andy hopped off, Joey let go.  \"Can I play with you, Andy?\" Joey asked.  \"Sure, come on, Joey!\" was the happy reply, and they both ran off to the climbing platforms, leaving the new \"friends\" behind to spin at their own pace. Because, after all, they're brothers. That's what brothers do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-playground-another-day.html", "title": "\nOn the Playground: Another Day\n"},

The foot input also means Andy and Joey both have more trouble sitting without footstools to put their feet on. That little bit of elevation means you lean onto your feet more, thus more input.

I like it that he's developing a sense of humor, even if it is potty humor. It IS age-appropriate, after all. It's the lack of contextual use that is the problem. If he wants to talk like this around his peers and his brother (and me), I'm all about that. It's a vital social skill that will help him make friends and fit in when/if that's what he wants. But what about if he says it to a girl in his class? Or his grandmother? (which of course he has done!) Or a teacher? People are hyper-sensitive about this kind of thing as it is, and he just doesn't need any more social hurdles to climb. But no, Joey. Most snowmen definitely do not have wieners. Now we get to ask him why he thinks that is. Good times. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/12/funniest-thing-of-all-time.html", "title": "\nThe funniest thing of all time.\n"},

We had a really nice short chat with Joey's autism resource teacher, then headed over to the inclusion room for another lovely chat.  In case you are keeping count, Joey has three classrooms, plus \"specials.\" He starts off in the autism resource room with Mrs. Huff and Ms. Macy. Mrs. Huff is his \"official\" teacher (case manager). Then he spends time in the self-contained room with Mrs. A, doing things like math and Fast Forward and computer skills and some language arts and other standards-of-learning kinds of stuff. Then he spends time in an inclusion setting with Mrs. R for social studies and science. It was Mrs. R we met today. He also has library, art, music, and PE.  Mrs. R is also his reading teacher, and they started reading groups this week. She's a bit concerned that he is basically the top reader in the class. She doesn't have a lot of experience with autistic kids, and the special needs kids she had before were not her top-tier readers, but she was really ready to listen to us and discuss Joey's strengths and weaknesses and strategies to support him. She's going to some training in December with Mrs. Huff about inclusion and methods for supporting special needs kids in inclusion settings, and she seems very excited about it. Her concern with Joey being the top reader is that she is afraid he won't progress more in reading, that he needs more challenge than she can offer because there is only one other kid who is reading at his level, and she can separate them into their own little reading group. The next set of kids are substantially lower on the reading scale. No, this didn't bother us that much because we are basically using his strength (reading) to get him familiar and comfortable and help him work on weakness (social interaction in a small group). But she's a reading teacher, so she worries about the reading piece. I think there is going to be some discussion between her and Mrs. Huff about \"what to do.\" I'll keep you posted.  We really couldn't ask for anyone with a better attitude. She's perfectly willing to dive in and rise to the challenge of being an inclusion room, and supporting her students. She noticed Joey liked to draw, so she sent home a book about drawing with us, partly to help us get him to focus on books better- maybe catch his interest.  So this lady seems like a solid link in the chain.  I have a meeting with the weak link on Wednesday.

She got the school resource officer to remove Alex from the classroom. It was the second discipline referral for Alex that day, the report said. Portillo told the officer after he left the classroom with Alex, she talked with the other children. \u201cPortillo said she explained to them that the students in class were all her priority and she would protect them like a \u2018bear defending her cubs,\u2019\u201d the report said. When Alex returned to the class, Portillo said she and the class were not ready for him to return. Portillo told the officer she asked Alex to join her at the front of the class. ...\" This makes it so crystal clear to me, the whole crux of this situation. Wendy Portillo's class children were her priority, and she was willing to protect her kids like a mama bear... except Alex. He didn't count. He was an outsider, an invader, an interloper.  Knowing full well  that he was in the process of being placed into special education with a pervasive developmental disability, instead of protecting him, she threw him out. Instead of talking to her children about inclusiveness, tolerance, and support for a classmate who was clearly having a hard time, she had them tell him to his face what they thought of him,  and threw him out .  The students in her class were  not  \"all her priority.\" Only the ones she thought deserved to be. Those others, though assigned to her classroom, are aliens. Disturbances.  Other.  Many of us are working hard to get our kids included, and so this strikes a hot nerve. Will our kids be supported and accepted into the community, or forever ostracized as \"other\"? Will they count as one of the students, or be thrown own to fend for themselves? Incidents such as these point to an alarming, heart-wrenching answer. As long as these kinds of incidents continue- often more subtle than the case of Alex Barton- we fear for our kids, and know the road ahead is long.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/may/29/police-report-reveals-teachers-side-incident-which/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/mama-bears-cubs-and-fate-of-invaders.html", "title": "\nMama Bear's Cubs and the Fate of Invaders\n"},

{"date": "Monday, May 12, 2008", "body": "\nI've been mulling  a post from abfh , which is something I do a lot, because she has lots of interesting things to say and insights to share. This one, in case you didn't click on the link, is about autism parents. The study is about how parents of autistic kids have a higher rate of neurological conditions than other parents- including depression. The good news was that only 1.8% of the mothers of autistic kids were diagnosed with depression. As she so correctly put it: \"Contrary to the widespread stereotype of the suicidal, emotionally devastated autism parent, these families with autistic children were enjoying their lives just like other families. The fathers were no more likely to be depressed than any other fathers, and more than 98% of the mothers did not suffer from depression.\" Why have I been mulling this? Because I have a problem. Something is wrong here.  A great many of the parents I know- particularly the mothers- have special needs children. Not just autistic children, either: Down Syndrome, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, ADHD, ODD, and a peppering of other disabilities, defined or specialized or what have you. Perhaps the vast majority of us are not diagnosed with depression. I suppose that would be correct.  But we are all, to a [wo]man, very, very, tired.  Exhaustion lurks around every corner, haunts every house, lingers in the corners and hangs in the air; exhaustion on a level I do not see in homes without special needs children, exhaustion I never see etched on the faces of mothers with no disabled children. In other homes, in other parents, there is a laugh-it-off: jokes about having drinks are lighter-hearted, comments about bad days are less edged, giggles about sleep depravation are followed eventually by a nap or a day at the spa.  What is even more interesting is that we seem less permitted to be tired. We have to attend more meetings, talk with more teachers, run around to more therapies, and meet more needs. Many of us can't just tell the kids to go out an play while we fix dinner. Every moment is a teaching moment, every chore a lesson in life skills. Many parents doubtless think nothing of having their child dress in the morning, come down to breakfast, eat their food, put on their coat and backpack, and get on the bus. For many families I know, each step of that process must be carefully choreographed, supervised, assisted, broken into smaller steps and specifically taught. The process of choosing clothes alone is actually a multistep process involving visual discrimination, sensory processing, motor planning, dexterity and coordination... and several other skills most people take for granted. All of these things have to be broken down and taught to many of our kids. And I'm not talking preschoolers here. I know several families directly with teenagers dealing with these issues- and know of several more families in the system. We have no time to be tired. Our babies are counting on us not to be tired.  Exhaustion and stress are funny things. They are not depression, though they can lead to depression. You can be depressed without being diagnosed as such. I had a therapist I was seeing for \"mood disorders\" before I had Joey who, upon hearing his diagnosis, suggested changing my own diagnosis to depression (I stopped seeing that therapist). Having thoughts of suicide and driving off a bridge with your child would, I think, be seriously in the running for \"depression.\" However, it's not the only outcome, and if I was having such thoughts, I would certainly be running- not walking- to the nearest psychiatric office for help.  Exhaustion leads to other problems. Sleep issues. Eating issues. Mood issues. Things that just get brushed aside as stress, as exhaustion, as \"oh, you're a mom, that's the way it is! Hahaha!\" Things that get laughed off as \"put down the cheeseburger, lady, and go for a walk!\" Things that get ignored as \"boy, you should take a nap/go on vacation/hire a respite worker for a bit\" as if you had time/money to do these things. As if an hour once a month did anything for the kind of exhaustion I am talking about. Or even once a week.  And it isn't just 1.8% of the special needs families I see with this exhaustion thing. It is 100%. I suppose there could be whole cities somewhere elsewhere with special needs families who are not exhausted. I'd like to meet some. I bet they'd have a lot of ideas to share with this little town- and we'd be all for them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/05/researchers-discover-happy-autism.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/autism-parents.html", "title": "\nSpecial Needs Parents: Where is my bed?\n"},

They are very bickery, Andy has been having people talk to the hand instead of dealing with them, and Joey has discovered several phrases that make Mom, Dad, and/or Andy squeak in amusing protest and annoyance. It's been a bit of a long week, turning fast into a long weekend. On top of that, I have a selection of students who like to email rude complaints about my tests and grading policies, and they have been timing these emails so that I get them just as I am about to close down and go to bed, resulting in me dragging my butt to bed at 1 am instead of the planned and much needed 10 pm. Then there's tonight, when I am now overtired and wired, and its 11 pm. Bets I end up awake at 1 am again?

Only this time, I wasn't driving, which was a change. And then folks in front of us decided they needs to stop  RIGHT NOW . Fortunately, my van has good brakes, and Allan gave up and scooted around the creeping brake-slammers.

Half of it is gorgeous, because I have hepl these last couple weeks, trying to get a handle of  something  in my life. The other half is a disaster. And my help is due any minute.  \"Be  Ms. Frizzle ?\" the voice calls in again. I turn to that little face, who on most days would be absent at this hour- at school. He's six years old now. He looks tall. Well, he  is  tall. Growing up fast.  Kitchens can wait. I turn obediently into Ms. Frizzle. Outside.  We have some minutes to kill before speech therapy, so I decide it might be a good chance to drop by  A.C. Moore  and get some stickers and art supplies. The boys chatter behind me.  \"No Miss Nikki today! No Miss Janine today!\" \"I'm a  T-Rex ! RAWR!\"  \"OK, guys, here's the plan. Are you listening?\" I put the L-sign to my ear to make my point and grab attention. It semi-works.  \"Listen! I want listen! No listen! No hear!\"  \"Aer you listening? Here's the plan, guys. We are going to go to the craft store and get some stickers. Then we are going to go see Miss Nikki.\"  \"No Miss Nikki today.\" \"RAWR!!!!\" \"Yes, Miss Nikki today, sweetie. So we're going to the craft store, then to Miss Nikki.\"  \"The store? What store?\" \"The craft store. We're going to buy some stickers.\" \"The crap store?\" HIs Dad would be so proud.  Andy and I sit in the waiting room, waiting for Joey's return.  He taps my head .  \" GOOSE! \" He squeals as I get up to chase him around the island of chairs.  \" Duck ,\" I tap him on the head.  \"Say  GOOSE !\" \" Duck .\" He giggles. \" Duck .\" \"Say  GOOSE !!!\" \" Penguin. \" More giggles. \" Duck .  Duck .  Monkey .  Swan .  Panda .\" \"Say  GOOSE !\" he squeals and giggles.  \" GOOSE !\" and we're off.  The other lady in the room just glares at us. She is completely missing the fun, poor lady.  One great challenge here remains  getting Andy to eat , especially at dinner.  Conventional wisdom  about just letting the child go hungry (well, not eat) doesn't help much- Andy would happily go hungry at dinner, and spend the rest of the night screaming about being hungry (until food is presented- then he'll happily not want to eat again.) So tonight is leftover night. Curry Chicken salad with asparagus, Indian chicken, chili casserole, or  peanut butter and jelly ... naturally, both boys choose  PB&J . But I fool 'em- I use multi-whole-grain bread. Then i slice up some watermelon, and voila! Dinner.  I start heating up leftovers for JoeyAndyDad and I, as the boys settle into the evening meal. Andy is jumping on the trampoline, Joey is intent on the food. Drinks are fetched. Plates are heated. I get to sit down. JoeyAndyDad gasps.  \"I think that's the first time Andy has finished first.\"  I look over at Andy's plate. It's cleaned. Joey is still chewing on a sandwich quarter. JoeyAndyDad and I have hardly started. Not only is the first time Andy's ever finished first, I think its the first in retrievable memory that he's even taken a single bite before the rest of us have finished.  \"Want dessert!

I have been really happy about Joey's teachers this year, and his so-far steady progress, especially his academic progress. Joey is happy to be in school. He's learning. It's fabulous.  But as the shadow of summer service begins to rear its ugly head, and some comments swim to mind that were made by familiar folks and strangers alike, it strikes me how much I construct a positive image of Joey and Andy here. I chose the picture where Joey is happily playing with the sequence cards, not the one where he is slamming his fists in frustration, trying to put together the words to narrate the story displayed upon them. I have him happily playing a computer game, not the ten minutes later when he progressed up two levels, and tore the phones off his head in frustration because there were now \"too many\" choices for the memory game.  I am often told, usually in off-hand ways, that Joey's \"just can't be\" autistic. He's too sweet. He's too sociable. He's too smart. He makes too much eye contact. He has too many words. He is too interactive. I often wonder if people know how really offensive such remarks, even (especially?) off-hand ones, are?  Yes, I know how very fortunate we are with Joey- that there are children who are far more effected, far less \"functional\", far more \"disabled\"- what words to use? Because it seems like anything I pick would make it sound like other people's children are not as precious or beautiful as my Joey. Every person is a miracle, folks. Life itself is a miracle. Having a life entrusted to your care is a fortune beyond reckoning. But back to the point: just because my Joey doesn't look or act the way you think an autistic person should look or act doesn't make his autism any less a part of who he is, any less real and here and now. When I see him trying to interact with other kids, and finding himself unable to do it, and seeing the frustration, the yearning, the interest... what? You didn't think autistic people were interested in interacting with their peers? Think again.  There is so much negative written and posted on the web about autism. Joey is such a bright, sparkling light of joy for us, and that is the part we most want to share. I don't hide Joey's weaknesses. I have written before about meltdowns and whinefests and echolallic perserveration. However, I do try to keep these kinds of incidents from dominating this blog, because they do not dominate Joey.

I manage to diffuse the problem. I return to find my half of the bed filled with boy. I give him a kiss, then waddle over to the other side, where I do the same for the handsome man I married, who is also fast asleep, cuddled with said boy. I get in the recliner, recline it, and try to go back to sleep.  It's mid-afternoon, another day in the waiting rooms of the therapy clinic. Our speech therapist has taken pity on Andy. He likes to play with one of those plastic dollhouses they use for teaching social skills and household words and stuff to kids. She isn't using it today, so she's put it out on the lobby floor for Andy. He's stretched out on his tummy, in the middle of the carpet, playing his littleheart out, sucking on a lollipop he \"won\" by having dry pants and going potty like a big boy. The house is inhabited by two \"baby\" dinosaurs. The peace is broken by a crunching noise, and the stick emerges from his mouth, devoid of candy, so that he can say: \"Mommy! Need the potty!!!\" The lull in activities before dinner. Two boys are clomping through the house in my shoes, round and round from kitchen to diningroom to livingroom to hall to kitchen, around and around. One has them on the wrong feet. They are also screeching, and hanging their arms, reminiscent of gorillas in Danskos. I realize they are actually both T. Rexes in Danskos.  Morning again. I've managed to retain my space in bed. A soft little hand touches my face. Then little lips find mine. Yes, the boy is up. Suddenly, a small body crashes atop mine with a wild giggle. Yep, the other one is up, too. Now four sets of little fingers are poking, wiggling, trying to tickle me. Get up, Mom! It's time to PLAY!!! The big yellow bus chugs up the street, sighs and squeaks to a halt in front of the house. I head down the porch steps, admiring the way Joey can now step off the bus and come to me, instead of me having to go fetch him from the bus door. He turns and waves as the bus pulls away, with likely the last words I will hear from him for the next hour: \"Bye, bus!

Publishing a book is no real problem- my mom publishes books, and we do an on-demand printing. Then we can all use the book for fundraising for our particular projects. To raise the funds for set-up, we can sell the book via Amazon. We just need to agree on a price. That can't be set until we know some specifics: How many pages will it be? Paperback or hardback? What size- do we want it to be more like 8X5, or more like 11x9?  Then we need content, of course. And lots of it- but not so much that we can't do a volume 2! Do we want to do a regular book, with main dishes, side dishes, and desserts? Do we want specialty sections, such as special diets and special needs recipes? Do we want to break it up so that this first book is main dishes, a second volume of side dishes, a third volume of desserts? Do we want to do a general book now, and then if it takes off, do specialty volumes?  I figure to put in a recipe(s?), you just send it to me with your name, and possibly some extra information for marketing- like the disability your child has, what you are raising funds for (would need to be long-term projects, such as saving for adult services or long-term therapies), perhaps descriptions of some of the therapies that work for your family? Also, some artwork would be a good idea. Black-and-white lineart is best with the on-demand system (as opposed to photos).

{"date": "Wednesday, September 03, 2008", "body": "\nIn which we visit Marty's Playland.  On  March 30, 2008 , the Ocean City Boardwalk was  ablaze : specifically, t he Dough Roller , next to one of our favorite points, Marty's Playland. We had not been able to gather much information about the extent of the damage, and so with some trepidation, we approached the restored arcade on Day Three. Well, actually, JoeyAndyDad and I scoped it out on the evening of Day Two, while the little ones slept. We wanted to check out the SkeeBall and the ten-cent cranes and be prepared. For those of you similarly worried, it looks like Marty's lost a SkeeBall or two, but the others are up, running, and looking lovely. The cranes have been moved again, it looks like the floor had some damage that is still being repaired, but the are there and working, too.  So we started our Marty's adventure, and the boys right away discovered a new horse-riding game. Its kind of a combo of a ride and a game. We had to help, but they really liked it.  Then we made our way to the SkeeBall, and worked on bowling. Joey got good enough to win tickets- he even bowled a 150! Joey really liked playing. Andy was more interested in games that made more beeps and had more flashy lights. He was pretty good at one that raced little cars on a track, and he was not too bad at iguana game.  My favorite- and my mom's- is, of course, the ten-cent cranes. We don't have pics this year of the cranes. See, one of the things to be won this year were those l ittle plastic crystal-looking animals , and one was a blue elephant. Joey had one earlier in the year as a prize, and of course it broke, and seeing one in the machine was very exciting. So he and Grandma went to work to try to \"win\" it.  Now, folks, the ten-cent cranes are antiques. As antiques, they often have trouble. Sometimes, you put your dime in, and they don't work just right. It's just part of playing the cranes.  But for Joey, when he puts his dime in, he expects the crane to work. Perfectly. So he was getting a little frustrated that the crane wasn't picking up the elephant like he thought it ought to. He'd get close, and move it around, and even grab stuff (he got  lots  of little toys!), but it just didn't get that elephant.  And then it happened.  He put the dime in, and the crane got stuck. It wouldn't go at all, because it got hung up on itself. Grandma called for help from the maintenance folks (who naturally hang out around the antique games), but it was too late. The noise of the arcade. The frustration with the machine. The lights, the people, the elephant not being caught. He started to scream, and I turned from what I was doing- which was mostly organizing tickets that the guys had won- and reached out to hug him to calm him, but I reached too late. I missed him as he whipped around a corner of the machines. Two steps behind, I whipped around the corner, too.  No Joey.  Marty's is something of a labyrinth of arcade games of all kinds. It is kind of two big rooms, but divided by games and cases into a maze of smaller areas. Fabulous if you like the crunch of an arcade. Pure hell if your child has just disappeared in teh crowd, despite wearing a bright orange shirt and screaming his head off.  Gone. He was gone.  I followed what I thought was the most obvious path, around the games back to where Grandma was standing, unaware that I did not have him. The sheer panic on my face must have spoken a thousand screams. We began scouring the arcade. I ran quickly through the little maze of rooms, familiar to me from childhood for the most part (and to my mom from her childhood), but there was no sign of him. He was gone. Maybe he had gone to look for Daddy?  But no, here was Daddy with Andy in hand. Seeing us panic, not knowing what happened, JoeyAndyDad had instinctively (and intelligently) grabbed Andy's hand, so we only had one to look for. Grandma and I headed to the Skeeball. Maybe he had gone there... or continued right out the door, maybe trying to get to the car? Or to his beloved and comforting beach? Was he lost in the crowds on the boardwalk? Was he lost in the arcade? Either possibility would be terrifying for him. (I was reminded later of the possibility of someone taking him. Fortunately, my brain didn't explode.) No Joey at the Skeeball. No Joey to be seen anywhere outside. Grandma took up station at the doors, to watch for him, and I think JoeyAndyDad stayed at the Skeeball with Andy to watch for him, and I plunged back into the dark hub-bub of the arcade.  Retrace the steps. Go back to the cranes. I headed back to the back of the arcade, where the cranes are set up next to teh prize/ticket redemption counter. And...  There he was, right next to the crane!  He was pretty upset. A very nice lady saw me, and told me she was about to get someone to announce over the loudspeaker that there was a lost child (she had tried to talk to Joey to calm him down, but discovered that was not an easy task- when upset, Joey often speaks what would be perceived by others to be nonsense). I hugged my little guy tight and got him out of there. Dad took the guys for another round of rides, but Joey was perseverating on the blue elephant, so Grandma and I feverishly plugged dimes into machines until we got one. Actually, I ended up with two, but that's a good thing, as these little toys break easily.  We came back the next day- our last morning at Ocean City- to play the air hockey. The boys were very into it. I think when Joey ran, that's where he went- it is a very dark corner of the arcade, so that the lights of the hockey tables show up. Until very recently, the idea of Joey running towards dark would be ridiculous, but with the glow of the lights, the corner may have seemed a good idea to him. Or a blind run into the dark. Either way, it is the one corner of the arcade where I probably would not have been able to spot him.  The boys thought the air hockey was great fun. Everybody was much calmer. Joey clutched his beloved blue elephant for the rest of the trip.  I think I'll put the other one on the Christmas Tree for good luck.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL9Ew2g54CI/AAAAAAAABVM/L-3-MJVa6VQ/s1600-h/martys_outside.jpg", "http://www.nbc4.com/news/15745134/detail.html?rss=dc&psp=news", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/30/AR2008033001356.html", "http://wjz.com/local/ocean.city.fire.2.687901.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL9Ep7JUH6I/AAAAAAAABUs/fxGq9vl4vBI/s1600-h/13_boys_horseride2.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL9EqOoXBkI/AAAAAAAABU0/8-HJpYxiHhk/s1600-h/13_boys_skeeball.jpg", "http://www.kipptoys.com//ProductBrowse/ProductDetail.aspx?TID=0&SID=0&PID=17113", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL9EqRORmkI/AAAAAAAABU8/XnFMeBUrA40/s1600-h/13_boys_hockey.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/SL9EqbgCC6I/AAAAAAAABVE/vqbfc085bLI/s1600-h/13_andy_hockey.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/beach-trip-part-four.html", "title": "\nBeach Trip: Part Four\n"},

He's come out in the 25th percentile in fine motor skills, he's developed some new sensitivities that need to be addressed. So we're here at least through the fall. This makes Andy pretty happy, actually, because he gets to see his Miss Cindy that much longer.  With the 25th percentile, I could probably request special education again, but frankly, he's happy where he is and working with the preschool was like trying to get an alligator to ride a bicycle.

One of my favorites was Mrs. S telling Joey, \"Here is what your words said: [Joey's mangled attempt to spontaneously create a sentence instead of quoting someone else]. Does that make sense to you?\" She would sometimes ask other kids in the class if those words made sense, too- not in a humiliating way, but in a way where everyone was helping everybody else untangle what was said, so that everyone, including Joey, could come up with the words that were needed. He could hear the words and realize they did not make sense, and clarify wha he wanted to say with some help from his friends.  For example (and I use it because I already have it up on You-Tube), when i went in to visit Joey, i took a lot of pictures of him. Joey has always loved cameras and having his picture taken, even as an itty-bitty. He was very happy and excited. So when it came time for the News, Joey's news was naturally going to be about me and the camera. He had nowhere to pull words for that. There was no TV show he could quote, no-one else was having their picture taken, he was completely on his own. The words that came out were, \"I am happy I get to play picture-taking.\"  We got it decoded to being happy I came to school, and happy to have his picture taken (watch the video, its really cute). Joey loves to imitate this phrase, especially if he doesn't understand what someone (especially Andy) said. He gets that little cock to his head and asks, \"Does that make sense?\" with a giggle.  I would love to go all Mrs. S on some of my students:  \"When a leader stumbles his followers fall right on top of him.\" \u201cB ecause the art is the dunp thing in paintings, the big painters like Leonardo the winchy and other painter said a lot to the people by the paintings.\u201d \"There is no denying there was a lot of Hellenistic influence in Greece.\"  \"Power is communicated though art in many was. religiously you have Jesus who wore a purple rode, gold rope and was a very powerful person. That was a sign of power.\" And those are from people who are English-speakers. I have plenty more that are silly only if you know something about art history. I'd just like to sit them down, and see if I can't get whatever they thought they were saying out of their heads and into their mouths (or pens).

{"date": "Tuesday, June 17, 2008", "body": "\n A lawsuit would likely be successful - but I hope the school district has the good sense to start training its teachers and staff now, rather than waiting for this to get to the courtroom. I hope they put supports in place for teachers who have special needs students in their classrooms- appropriate supports, not a police officer. I hope they start putting supports in place for students who are in the process of being evaluated and served by special education, so that they don't get lost in the gap.  I have stopped reading the \"letters\" about Alex Barton. Not only do the letters themselves put up my blood pressure, but the comment section makes me positively see red. It's not just ignorance. It is a display of positive malice towards people with disabilities and people with autism, and venom towards their parents who are advocating for them. The fountains of malevolence, spite, and vitriol are just mind-blowing. It makes you want to find out who these people are, write down their information, and make sure you not only avoid their company, but make sure you are not giving them business or otherwise supporting their hatred.  How does one educate people who have no point of reference to connect? The whole human thread thing doesn't seem to work, as they don't seem to see autistic people or disabled people as... well, people. They are some \"Other\" outside their existence. This is both the cause and the legacy of colonialism- seeing people who are different as Other, instead of as people.  The outpouring of sheer, unadulterated hatred that has resulted from this situation is something that strikes fear into my heart for Joey. People really do see autistic children as spoiled, horrible brats who need to be humiliated, abused, and isolated. I have become hardened to the judging glares of others since I started this blog (and I think they have diminished because Joey's frustration has gone down and his self-regulation has improved, so less people notice anything odd about him), but letters like these are stark reminders that these feelings are there, that one must be careful not to \"brand\" a child with a label (instead of having the label as a tool for support), and that, ultimately, there are a lot of stupid, nasty people out there.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 24, 2008", "body": "\nWe had another loss this week:  Tasha Tudor  is  gone . She was 92 years old.  I am a great fan of  A Secret Garden  by Francis Hodgson Burnett. I remember as a child looking at Tudor's illustrations through my copy, the thin face of Mary Lennox, the stout frame of Martha, the large eyes of Colin, the fresh spirit of Dickon. Tudor captured the very idea of a growing garden. She was a perfect illustrator for  A Secret Garden  because, like any character actor, that is how she was.  The cycles of things lend one to a nostalgia that meets us when we think of how things change. The world of Tasha Tudor was very different from my own. She lived in the world of my own grandparents. I have a photo of my grandfather with his horse and wagon taking vegetables to sell at the  Eastern Market  in Washington, DC. The  farm his father worked  to help the patients at  St. Elizabeth's  be self-sufficient is now a national park. I took my kids there recently. What was once a peaceful farm in farm country is now an oasis of the past in a sea of concrete, asphalt, steel, and grime. I remember being there as a child, vaguely; they used to give you hayrides and sorghum, and it was sunny there, I remember that. When we saw it, it looked so small. A corner of sanity in a world gone hard and fast. It seems all the world works like our own lives- the past seems so slow, quiet, and easy in a world growing increasingly hectic and hasty. Summers used to seem like lifetimes of warm air, wading in the river, listening to the  whippoorwills , and watching the storms roll in. Now they flash by, and I'm already wondering how we'll be carving the pumpkins and what Christmas decorations to pull out.  I'm not a particular fan of summer. I like autumn better. I like the cooler days and the crisp morning chill and the scent of ginger, cinnamon, and warmed pumpkin on the air. Although there is something wonderful about the scent of my great-grandmother's rose wafting over the whole garden in early summer, when the green is full out yet still fresh and the air not too muggy. And I do miss the lush shade by the river, with moss beneath my feet or the cool, slimy river mosses as you stepped in to hunt for mussels in the shallows. The feel of the water swirling under my fingertips as I lay on the bank of the Emerald Walk. The dappled sunshine and damp sandy mud, the smell of the earth and the clay and the fallen-leaf carpet. I used to run down the path to the Starting Point, brushing aside the saplings, swinging down through the tree-trunks, down the rock face to the tree overhanging the river and the jut of the bank low enough to step in and start wading. I hardly touched the ground all the way down, feeling little but the speed of motion and the final splash of the water greeting my eager feet.  The tree is gone, and that lick of bank is washed away. The path is overgrown with no wild teenagers to fly down it. The whippoorwills are gone. The world changes, and hardly ever flows the way we think it will; sometimes we get caught in the eddies against the banks or swirled by the branches that dip into the stream. We have a great luxury in this country, of being able to stop and slow down and breathe now and again, to wax nostalgic and ponder the might-have-beens. Some of us hold the luxury of preserving things the world has left behind, or would leave behind if we failed to preserve them. A stroll along the Emerald Walk would not be the same as it was when I was young, and one day it will be lost under a reservoir the county has long planned to support a growing population of folks who would rather have streetlights than stars, who choose grass and sidewalks over blackberry brambles. I  miss my mom's wild blackberry jam.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tashatudorandfamily.com/", "http://www.tashatudor.legacy.com/LMW/HomePage.aspx", "http://www.amazon.com/Secret-HarperClassics-Frances-Hodgson-Burnett/dp/006440188X", "http://www.easternmarketdc.com/", "http://www.nps.gov/oxhi/", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medtour/elizabeths.html", "http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Whip-poor-will.html#sound"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/06/farewell-to-tasha-tudor.html", "title": "\nA Farewell to Tasha Tudor\n"},

Or a veterinarian and work with animals? No. A teacher.  Then Andy piped up, \"I want to be a dinosaur!\" Well,  that  child knows his calling.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/finding-ones-calling.html", "title": "\nFinding One's Calling\n"},

Andy wanted red, so he dumped half a bottle of red dye into the batch. He stirred it himself. He helped knead it, and sprinkled the counter with flour. He pretended he was making pizza until Joey came home.  Joey is harder to make things with, but I got him to decide on red and squeeze the rest of the dye bottle into the pot, and stir it a couple of times. It was too hot for his hands to help knead, but he waited patiently and repeated lines from Blue's Clues in anticipation. I distracted him from the hot dough by cleaning, and then presented him with his new treasure.  Then I put some cookies in the oven, and settled for a peaceful play-dough afternoon. I put Mr. Rogers on the TV, so they were less tempted to abandon the kitchen to watch TV, yet if they decided to invade the livingroom, the show was appropriate and peaceful.  A boy appeared. His head was encased in red dough.  \"Look! Mom! I have red hair!\" Joey announced, glanced at the TV, said, \"Hello, Mr. Rogers!\" and retreated to the kitchen.  Apparently I laughed so hard, he decided it was  the  thing to do with playdough, and spent the next fifteen minutes with the play dough on his head (then they lost interest and we bagged it up for next time).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/coiffure.html", "title": "\nCoiffure\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 26, 2008", "body": "\nOne of the things Joey finds comforting is color. When he first started talking and we were teaching him to answer questions, when in doubt, he named a color. It was safe, and he could show he knew something. Blue's Clues has an episode on color where they mix colors together to make other colors. It is Joey's favorite episode, bar none.  Joey has been a little depressed lately. Not his energetic, giggly self; a little more languid, a little tired, a little sad. The beginning of school is something he looks forward to, but it entails a  lot  of changes and new challenges. We also have a teacher than is less than stellar (or has been so far), and some separation anxiety from last year's teacher, who was way beyond stellar.  Consequently, color has been a huge theme of motor-mouthing here.  I set the boys up to paint today after school. I thought with the renewed comfort of color, it was just a good idea. (And I couldn't find my iron to do fuse beads. How does one lose an  iron ?) This is actually the first step of making stick puppets. We're making turkeys and ghosts this round. I set them up, and we were off to the races! I crept out of the room, partly to get the camera, partly to give them some moments to just do their thing. I came back to Joey proudly displaying hands covered in paint and his puppets, as well as a paper he had gotten from the art supply shelf.  \"Purple and red make magenta!\" he said proudly, grinning from ear to ear. Sure enough, he had made magenta. \"Green and yellow make chartreuse!\" he pointed proudly to his patch of chartreuse. We also did marigold, violet (blue-purple), and aquamarine. (He had his hands washed before I recovered, so sorry, no pic).  Happiest boy on earth. Score: Mom, one. Depression, zero. On another grand development, Joey wanted a soda while we waited for the paint to dry. To do this, he had to:  1. Go to the kitchen.  2. Open the fridge.  3. Open the bottom drawer of the fridge.  4. Get his soda.  5. Close the drawer.  6. Close the fridge.  I told him these steps very carefully. It took two tries, but he managed to do it- all by himself. I guess grape soda is more motivating than I imagined.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/09/mixing-colors.html", "title": "\nMixing colors\n"},

He is still picky, but I'll take \"picky eater\" over \"neophobic\" any day of the week and twice on Sundays, especially with Andy being so thin in the first place, particularly following a growth spurt.

We discovered that  school food is too highly caloric and heavily invested in carbohydrates  to be good for Joey, who was becoming increasingly round. My family is prone to diabetes, so the increase in weight was a big red flag for me (we tend to pork up as a sign of diabetes- the metabolism change is a harbinger that our ability to use insulin properly has broken down).  But has this change in diet worked?  By packing Joey's meals, I can control not only how many calories he is consuming, but how many carbohydrates, fats, and other nutrients he is consuming. For those of you unfamiliar with diabetes, it's not about the sugar, it is about the carbohydrates. Many of those \"sugar-free\" foods you see advertised are absolutely useless to a diabetic, because they contained the same (and sometimes more!) carbohydrates than regular foods. With my family history and my own gestational diabetes, I have become something of a whiz at reading food labels (it isn't very hard, anyway; the real trick is  doing  it.) So, Super Control-Freak Woman is now micromanaging Joey's access to food. He needs about 1400 calories a day, so about 350 calories at breakfast, 450 calories at lunch, and no more than 100 calories for a snack. He needs no more than 45g of carb at breakfast (and 30 is better), about 45g of carb at lunch, and no more than 30g of carb for a snack (15 is better). I also prefer there to be 3 servings of fruits and veggies throughout his school day, and I don't count \"fruit flavored\" stuff a fruit (ie, his strawberry yogurt is not a serving of fruit). I've gotten a few nice combinations that fit into these guidelines for him.  Have we succeeded?  Well, I can say that I was having roll up Joey's pants with four folds, and now he is wearing the same pants, but with only 3 folds. And that's a whole inch. So we have a taller boy, but not a rounder boy. My next project: upping his activity at home. Snatching activity into pockets of five minutes .

Evan, my son, died in front of me for two minutes. So you ask any mother in the autism community if we'll take the flu, the measles, over autism any frickin' day of the week.

I'll take autism any day of the week, and twice on Tuesday, over measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, chicken pox, meningitis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, diptheria, tetanus, typhoid, influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, or polio. A lot more people have died from these diseases- any one of them- than from vaccination (all of them). The number of deaths reliably traced to a reaction from a vaccine is so low, giving an honest stat is considered impossible (and folks, they think a stat of \"severe adverse reaction\" is 1/100,000 doses- and have no problem providing that stat.) Is it one in a million? So in the US, about 300 people a year? (Between 1990 and 1992, there was only  one  reported death plausibly linked to a vaccine.) Did you know that influenza alone kills about 2000 people is the US each year?  I'll take autism over the flu any frickin' day of the week, Ms. McCarthy. Know why? Because autism doesn't kill people. And my autistic child is a beautiful, wonderful, loving child. Every autistic person I have met has been a beautiful, wonderful human being- even those severely effected, who cannot talk, who have trouble responding and coping with the world around them. I'll take that living human being over a dead one any day of the week. Proper vaccination  prevents  death and disability. It does  not   cause  autism.  Vaccinate your kids.  Do it properly.

{"date": "Saturday, January 17, 2009", "body": "\nMy house has been a bit cold lately. the spring before last winter, we had teh air conditioning on the first floor fixed with a new heat pump unit. Yay! We took out the window units and settled into a new life of cool comfort. Then came last winter. The house was a little cool, but that was OK. A sweater never hurt anybody, and we kept the bills down, and it never got so cold that the heat pump didn't work.  Flash forward to this week. For those of you unfamiliar with heat pumps, for them to work until, say, 40 degree high days, you need to have a heat coil unit. The units are expensive, the heat is expensive, and they still have issues with keeping a house with old windows heated. We do not have that coil unit. We opted to keep our gas boiler. The heating and cooling folks were supposed to set it up so we could turn on teh boiler if it got bad.  Natural gas prices have skyrocketed right with them gas prices. Only they don't go down so fast. So we have been braving it with the fireplace, space heaters, and the option to turn on the boiler if it got bad. This week, it got bad. Down the stairs went the brave JoeyAndyDad to turn on the boiler.  He flipped the switch upstairs. He flipped the switch downstairs. The boiler lighter click-click-clicked. The radiators started getting water in them. But the gas did not fire up with its glorious  WHOOSH  of heat and comfort. All we had was click-click-click and the smell of gas.  Not good.  So we battened down hatches, called the heating and cooling folks, and put extra blankets on the beds. Yesterday, I got the fire roaring while we waited for the heating and cooling guy. And he arrived. On time and everything, because we use the good heating and cooling people in town, we don't joke around. And they are awesome.  And he looked at the furnace, and the wiring, and what had happened with the installation of the other unit, and wow, he was  hot . Apparently, the other guys were supposed to do something very different, with a whole different kind of thermostat. They were supposed to hook us up so that the boiler switched on automatically when it got to be 40 degrees outside, and not have us completely dependent on a heat pump. What they did instead was try to rig it so that I had to manually turn on the boiler- which was causing some kind of electrical signal issue, so that when we tried to turn on the boiler,  we got no heat at all . And what made him mad is that apparently, I wasn't supposed to have requested this, since our heat pump had no emergency coils, it should have just been matter-of-course in the installation.  So he got us our boiler working. And now he'll be back next week with the proper thermostat, and install that like it should have been almost two years ago. And my house will not be chilly ever again... unless I make it that way on purpose, or something breaks.  Happy cold snap.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/01/fixing-heat.html", "title": "\nFixing the heat\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 12, 2009", "body": "\n Joey was sick today. I'm not sure if he had a bug, or if he just got so upset last night that he upset his tummy. He lost a tooth, but there was blood involved, and he really melted down. He was up and down all night saying his tummy hurt. When it was still hurting this morning, I just kept him home.  Which means I had extra snuggle-time with a little boy. I was curled up with my baby, in my room, watchin' us some Max and Ruby, snuggly-buggly. It was cold downstairs, it was warm in my room. All too soon he was ready to get up, Grandma was downstairs to check on him and see the missing tooth (and the cool blue car the Tooth Fairy left for him!), and the morning was gone. Just another memory.  Joey has been going to school since he was two and a half. When other kids aren't even wondering about school, just getting their first tastes of the world, Joey was getting on a big yellow bus and having a life away from me. Parents who choose to send their kids to daycares or babysitters at young ages don't know what I am getting at. Those who sent their kids into care because they had to work have an inkling. I missed those lazy mornings with my toddler, hugging and exploring and discovering.  A morning with me and Joey is a very special treat. I love Andy, I will miss the mornings I now have with him when he goes to school. I love having two boys bouncing on the bed and giggling. But I don't get a lot of just-us with Joey. I'm sorry he has to feel bad to have a snuggle-morning of just us. Taking out of school when he isn't feeling bad wouldn't be the thing to do, though- it would create anxiety for him to not have a schedule, to not have structure and activities.

{"date": "Monday, January 19, 2009", "body": "\nWhenever my father makes an appearance, I go a little nutso-bonko. My father and I don't generally get along. More accurately, we often find we have nothing to say to each other. Growing up, nothing was ever good enough. There was always something you could do better. Something more you could have done. Something that should have been done differently. And stranger still, he really couldn't have cared less about it, just that it should have been better.  I have tales I could tell that made even my therapist look at me funny and question my recollection, because it was just incredible. Truth really can be stranger than fiction.  Even when a \"visit\" is going fairly successfully, I get left with this vibration of \"you should have done this. You could have done that.\" Oh, and \"the house is a mess.\" Such strangeness comes out more when things go wrong. For example, this round, Joey apparently swallowed too much pool water Sunday morning at swimming, and the result was waxing on my father. Score: Joey, one. Father, zero.  JoeyAndyDad bravely and diligently got Joey to the bathroom, and I tried to hail the waitress for a mop. The other customers in the restaurant quietly and tactfully packed up, paid their bills, and skedaddled while I waited for a mop or towels or  something  to appear to help clean the mess. Finally, I was informed that she couldn't get a mop, because the mop was in the men's room.  So I fetched it. Joey was still sick. Hot water was slowly fetched- then the mop placed in my hands. Huh? But the smell was getting to me, I had to get it cleaned up. Where were my children? My father? My husband? Apparently the husband was being bundled up with the sick child to take home. Car seats needed to be moved. Waxxing still needed to be cleaned. The other child was hungry. There was pizza in there somewhere, and the salad I had been eating disappeared. When the dust settled, JoeyAndyDad had taken Joey home to rest, and I was caught at the mercy of my father with Andy and my father's wife at a pizza place that would really rather we just leave.  Right. As we finally packed up and went to pay for the pizza, it was just my father and I at the register, waiting to pay for the pizza.  And now I will toss in another tidbit. Remember that  brother  I haven't seen or heard from in ten years? Apparently he made an appearance at the family Christmas gathering we didn't go to because driving to Pennsylvania with two small children, especially small children who may get carsick, for a two-hour upheaval in a new place, is just not a great idea. I learned this because last weekend, my cousin's husband showed up with the Cousins, and we were driving to the pizza place (yes, the same one- I got in the car with him so he wouldn't get lost), and he thought I knew, so started talking about it. He thought I knew because my aunt and uncle have already been by since the event. I think  they  didn't mention it because they probably thought my dad should be the one to tell me, which is perfectly reasonable in this kind of situation. So we stand at the register, just us. Perfect moment to start a conversation about something. Anything. Would he tell me? Would he have something else to say, like \"the boys look good\" or \"you seem to be doing a great job\" or even \"gee, the weather sure is nice.\"  We stood there in silence. Was it my place to say something? Should I have just gone ahead and put something out there? But that isn't how we work. Um, well, I guess we don't work. Silence reigned. The entire visit finally passed without one mention of my brother. I did hear a lot about their trip to South Dakota, though. Oh, and I heard about my porch needing repairs. He'll come help if I hire a few other people to help.  Skip to today, and lingering insanity. I made pot roast for dinner today. I managed to get it together enough to get the potatoes cut, the carrots in, the meat in, and turn the crockpot on. Hey, that's a big deal around here. The boys got a new toy from my father, a Mickey Motor Speedway. I don't recommend it. It would be a fabulous toy if it stayed put together. But it doesn't. I might get the glue out tonight. The boys have been playing with it. Then it falls apart, and there is much screaming until I can get it back together. Joey decided he wanted the other car. That was a mess, involving deliberate pulling apart of the toy. Really, I can't much complain, but it was enough to be on my nerves with my nerves not so great to begin with.  Poor JoeyAndyDad came home tired. Not hungry. Must have packed enough food for him today when I packed his lunch bag last night.  Six o'clock arrived. I wandered into the kitchen, took up the lid on the pot roast and looked at it. The edges were too dark. It looked dry. I must have forgotten to put in the bouillon. Why did I make it, anyway? No one is going to eat it. The boys don't like pot roast. It will sit upon their plates. Joey will poke at it, and might eat it if he's really, really hungry; more likely, he will just say he's full and push it away, then ask for a peanut butter sandwich. Andy won't be so subtle. \"EWWWW!\" is his favorite dinnertime word, followed by, \"I don't eat that! It's  yucky !\" JoeyAndyDad already said he probably didn't want any.  Why did I even make it? Was it for me?  I slopped the roast into a casserole and stuck it in the fridge, and fixed the boys food they would eat- sliced raw green pepper, a PBJ for Joey, some rolled lunchmeat for Andy, some grapes, and a cheese stick each. Andy even ate a couple slices of the pepper.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/01/insanity.html", "title": "\nInsanity\n"},

It kind of looked like this:  Art History Class You Will Love Meets twice a week at this location Professor ReallyCool, phone number, office number email address (a big new thing when I was in school) Times Professor ReallyCool hangs out in her office This is a class about Art History. In an overview, it covers from such-and-such date to such-and-such date, and we will be looking at these Deeper Issues and generally wishing we were allowed to drink hot beverages in the classroom because we'll be doing a lot of learning and stuff while having an awesome time.  Buy these books. You'll be reading them.  You will have a midterm and a final. The midterm is on this date. The final is on this date.  You also are expected to complete a 20-page research project by this date. Please come see Professor ReallyCool to confirm your topic before the midterm. It is due on this date.  Here is the list of lectures:  Week 1 Introduction Week 2 Wonderful staging stuff for what we'll be learning. Read this book.  Week 3 A really cool look at stuff. Read this book.  Week 4 More really cool stuff and what Professor ReallyCool wants us to know. Read this awesome article.  Week 5 Wow, isn't this great stuff? Now think about this... Oh, and read this.  Week 6 Stunning new issues to think about stuff a whole new way. Read this to understand what is going on.  Week 7 (Usually the midterm) Week 8 A Deeper Issue you hadn't thought about before. Read this totally cool book.  Week 9 More really awesome art you wanted to see. Read this article about it.  Week 10 Some Deeper Questions about art. Read another book.  Week 11 How this art might relate to other art. Read these articles, they're awesome.  Week 12 Other Art that probably was influenced by this art. Here's a book about it.  Week 13 More Deeper Issues to make us rethink our assumptions. Read this book.  Week 14 Art is so totally awesome that we want all our friends to take this class. Read this article and this article.  Week 15 Either presentations about our projects, or a kick-ass wrap-lecture. (And here's some more reading).  Final on this Date.  And that was it. Were my professors tearing their hair out about students making excuses about not coming to class or not having their textbooks? Did they have students reading newspapers, email, Facebook in their classes?  My syllabus is now six pages long, before the outline of lectures. It includes policies for attendance, policies for academic honesty, policies for cell phones, computers, reading, and other distractions. It lays out the assignments in excruciating detail, from the format of the tests to the exact requirements for notating and documenting a research assignment (including font and spacing). Now I am going to have to add in a statement saying, \"You are required to have your textbook when you begin this class. If you are unable to purchase the textbook, please locate and use the copies available in the library.\" When I was in college, it was assumed that the student handbook policies- such as \"have your textbook\" and \"You are only permitted two unexcused absences per class\" applied to all of your classes. A professor didn't put that stuff in each and every syllabus. the idea of using a cell phone during class time was of course ridiculous, they weren't that pervasive, but anything that made noise or distraction was just known to be verboten. You just didn't. If you did, the professor could flunk you.  Just like that.  I did have a friend who got through college by asking for extensions from every single professor. She was famous for it. Even the professors knew about it, and I think they just planned accordingly when they saw her name on the roster. She was also known to be excruciatingly annoying, both to her classmates and her professors, for asking for extensions. But the point was, she was famous for it because it was so  rare . Not anymore. Heck, my grad program didn't permit \"Incompletes.\" If you had an incomplete on your record, you sacrificed your funding. Period.  Two weeks into the semester, I have students emailing me for extensions because they don't have their textbook. Big red flag: problem student here. Seriously, I have never had a student who, having \"issues\" at the beginning of the semester, did not continue to be a pain in my patookas for the rest of the semester. Not one. I've stopped allowing late adds, I don't care who died or what medical procedure you had. No extra credit here- more painfully poor work is not going to help your grade. And if you cannot be bothered to even  think  of going to the library to get your reading done, are you really ready to be in a college-level class?  And folks, it is really very depressing to see so many people unable to think for themselves, to have them insist on having things all spelled out as if we were all lawyers looking for loopholes. I think I prefer the days when a professor could just flunk you for being an arrogant jerk.  Just like that.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://profart.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/01/syllabi-blues.html", "title": "\nSyllabi Blues\n"},

Joey has had a very difficult time with knock-knock jokes. After all, knock-knock jokes require punning.  Knock-Knock.  Who's there?  Blue.  Blue who?  Why are you crying?  Joey's version:  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Blue.  Blue who?  Blue is my favorite color.  Yes, the literal side of things shines through. Uncle Lou, famous in my family for his jokes, even did his best to get the point across when we visited at the holidays, to no avail. I think it really hit my family that Joey really is different when they couldn't get him to understand a joke. Fortunately, I bet Uncle Lou will keep trying, because it is clear that Joey understands that you are trying to make a joke, and that jokes are supposed to be funny. He just can't figure out how they work- and the faces he makes are precious.  I was in Andy's room, reading our bedtime stories, and generally trying to convince the little guy that he was, indeed, sleepy and needed to be rested for school in the morning. I had just gotten him tucked in, and snuggled in (Andy likes to be snuggled to sleep. Oh, gosh, darn. ;)  ), when here comes Joey.

{"date": "Thursday, January 29, 2009", "body": "\nJoey had a project to do for his science class this week: he had to do a project about animals. The project had to mention what covered the animal (fur, feathers, hair, etc.), whether it lived on land or in the water, and what appendages it had (arms, legs, tails, claws, etc.)  Joey decided to do his project on polar bears. I suspect this may be related to the fact that the same class has been collecting change to adopt an arctic animal, and polar bears were one of the choices (I think I'm also sending in change for a walrus.) I tried to get him to google polar bears, but that met with limited success. So we went down to the library and got a real book. We took about four days to read the book, because the easy first-grade-level book was checked out, so we went for the third-grade book (and hey, since he can read that level, why not?) So he read, and we talked about it, and talked about it, and I worked on getting him to learn something new from his reading.  Next, he needed to decide what the project would be. At first he wanted to do a poster, so I had him look at a bunch of pictures of polar bears, pick some, and we went to Walmart and printed them out together. But on the way home, he got a bright idea- he wanted to write a story. So no problem, we made a book.  Each page I had him glue a photo, then write a sentence about polar bears. He was so proud of himself, he read it to me at bedtime. Then he read it to Andy. Then it read it to me again. And now, for your reading pleasure, I present to you, Polar Bears, by Joey Guyton! Polar Bears By: Joey Guyton! Polar bears live in the Arctic.  polar bears live on the land and in water. Polar Bears eat seals of meat.  Polar Bears Have paws! (and claws.)

We didn't do anything super-special; it was pretty cold, and lots of stuff was closed for the holiday. We went out to cheer up Grandma, and played some video games, and took a ride. We took Grandma to a store where she bought chocolate and flashlights for the boys. She wore out pretty quick, so we dropped her off after we picked Andy up, and I took the boys to lunch.  Taking two small boys to lunch by yourself can be a challenge, especially if the restaurant of choice is a salad bar place. Fortunately, we are well-known at the place, so they were happy to seat us next to the bar and in the window, so everybody could get food without leaving small boys unattended. And we proceeded to have the Perfect Lunch. Joey got his mac and cheese and green beans and sat down. Andy got his lettuce, dip, pickles, cheese, bacon, and butter, and sat down. I got my salad together, and we had a lovely lunch. Our lunches came, and the boys buckled right into their chicken strips. Food was actually consumed. We talked about Andy making a hat at school. We talked about it being President's Day. We talked about George Washington, and that he was  born at the farm we frequent , and spent his youth across the river from our house. We talked about President Lincoln being the 16th president and being born in a log cabin (something Joey needs to know for SOL tests). We played tic-tac-toe on our placemats. We got ice cream for dessert, with sprinkles. The boys spent the time eating it practicing signs and Spanish (well, Andy practiced his Spanish).  They were so lovely and charming, the elderly couple sitting next to us actually came over and told us so.

I remember riding in the back seat as my folks took a drive, bouncing down 522 through Woodville and Scrabble, listening to Paul Harvey. It was a voice from a golden age, lost to modern walkman-toting teens like me. He read the advertisements the same way he read the news, as if he were encouraging a friend to buy this wonderful thing. he used small details of lives to illuminate what it really meant to be an American, to value freedom and practice respect. He made you think about larger issues in human scale, and understand why integrity and self-respect were important, the larger effects of small acts of honesty, kindness, and compassion. He opened up the possibilities by showing how everyday people became extraordinary. It was more than just cold facts in a news article; there was a very human side, a lot of shades of gray, even in the most black-and-white moments. What choices would you make? Where would those small choices lead in the larger world?  You could count to a surprise ending, a twist in the tale that showed how this yarn, itself a masterpiece of values in hard work, caring for others, and doing the right thing for its own sake, was actually about a larger personality, a small moment in a life that was changing the world. Small moments became momentous. He revealed the deeper fiber of a person in a single episode from everyday living.  I wish I knew more about Paul Harvey, who revealed so much about others, and showed us exactly why they- and we- were great. I wish I had the rest of the story.

A boy ran up to Joey saying \"I know you!\" Joey was very happy to see him, though it took Joey a minute to acknowledge him. Then Joey realized there was also another child from school whom he knew. Joey tried very hard to play with these boys. However, they were playing some kind of make-believe involving swords (maybe Star Wars?) and at some point in the play, probably because Joey couldn't follow what they were doing, they started running away from Joey whenever he approached them (had they decided to make him the villain, perhaps?) Joey became very upset that these boys kept running from him. Finally, as I was trying to intervene and get Joey to calm down, he said, \"I don't like them running away from me. It hurts my feelings. I am going to go tell him.\"  And that is exactly what he did: \"Don't run away from me. It makes me feel sad!\"  I was so proud of him.  Unfortunately, the boy responded, \"You can't tell me what to do!\" and ran away. The two boys also kept inviting Joey to play when he gave up and tried to do other things, then running away from him, which I thought was a little odd when he had so clearly told them he didn't like that. I don't know if they meant to be upsetting to him, but I finally packed the boys up and took them home.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/02/on-playground.html", "title": "\nOn the Playground\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 21, 2009", "body": "\nWe've been having some trouble with Joey. This isn't a huge surprise- spring is here, the weather is all over the place, the light is changing, the world takes a shift for Joey- his sensory needs tend to shift about now, he tends to be trying to process things more and have a harder time with processing about now. The frustration level goes up. Behavior- like any child- also goes a little haywire.  OUr latest campaign is teaching Joey to use words to tell us how he is feeling. The idea is to teach him instead of showing us his feelings by screaming, hitting, slamming doors repeatedly, tracking, and other behavioral ways, he should use words to communicate his feelings. We've been encouraging him to understand different relationships and the roles of people in his life, and how his words can be used to communicate his needs to these people. We've let him know we want to know how he feels, and he can always use his words to tell us how he feels. Instead of fidgeting with things on the teacher's desk, he should say, \"I am uncomfortable. I am frustrated. I need a break.\"  Sounds good, doesn't it? Except you never know what a child hears. How is Joey interpreting what we are telling him, trying to teach him?  Joey got sent to  Ms. T  this week. The reason? An accumulation of behaviors that was becoming increasingly disruptive. Use of rude words (such as his favorite, \"wiener\"), putting marks on other children's charts towards \"timeout\", giving teachers checks, saying other children are responsible for his behaviors, and other inappropriate outbursts. This is very worrisome, as we are trying to keep him in inclusion settings, and these kinds of loud, inappropriate behaviors can get him sent back to self-contained environments. Fortunately, our school personnel- especially Joey's teachers- have been very understanding and willing to try to help him. However, a trip to Ms. T is a bit of a trauma. Joey gets upset when his classmates get sent to Ms. T, so to find himself in her office... well, he's a bit upset. Besides, Ms. T tends to raise her voice, so we've gotten a lot of shouting this weekend (and lots of \"Ms. T is  loud !\") How to help him? What is going on? What has happened to get Joey so out-of-sorts? Where is my  Deerstalker  and pipe?  My mom had an absolute brainstorm of brilliance. She's good like that. What if he has taken what we are teaching him- use words to express feelings- absolutely to heart? Instead of lashing out, he is saying words that, to him, express his feelings? After all, that is how Joey uses language- he attaches feelings and meanings to words and phrases, and uses them to convey those feelings and meanings, even when the words have nothing to do with the moment. What if he is using this tool of words to \"give himself a break\"- to get out of an uncomfortable situation?  We keep urging him to communicate, and to use words to communicate. Perhaps he has generalized that lesson in his own way?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.villagehatshop.com/deerstalker_sherlock-holmes.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/02/communicate-way-you-know-how.html", "title": "\nCommunicate The Way You Know How\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 06, 2009", "body": "\nThe plan is to start some new campaigns around here. Joey is six years old; he'll be seven in April. There are lots of things around the house he ought to be doing, and needs to start learning how to do. I am calling these the \"independence campaigns\" because they will include skills I believe Joey will need to be independent; things like cooking for himself and caring for his own things. However, I have no idea what seven-year-olds really can do. I am basing these skills on things I was doing at about seven, and remember doing myself at that age. Let me know if any of this sounds unreasonable.  The biggest campaign will be the cooking campaign. I thought I would start easy and rewarding: peanut butter sandwiches. However, we're going to knock it up a notch as well. At the book fair, Joey fell in love with a Sesame Street snack cookbook. I bought it because he was so enamoured with it- mostly with the fact Elmo was on the cover. He's been very into Elmo because of his classmates is very into Elmo, so they've been doing a lot of Sesame Street stuff at school, as well as Andy's new interest in Sesame Street at home. He gets it double-barreled. Then I actually got home and read the book- and it is really awesome. The recipes are simple, and most of them have several child-friendly steps. They are simple enough to include JOey in the prep as well as the actual cooking. Also, the recipes are relatively healthy, and emphasize healthy ingredients. So not only are we going to work on things like preparing his lunches himself, but also more general cooking- following instructions, following steps, and coming out with a yummy reward! The bed-making campaign will also be starting. Changing Joey's daily routine in this way is going to be a huge deal. however, keeping things in order is going to be an important skill for Joey- especially if he has inherited some of my very poor cleaning and organizing skills. I'm going to have to wade through the sea of toys and cull the things he isn't interested in as well- make sure his things all have a place- so he can put his things there himself. Yep... a clean your room campaign! Next, dressing. We know he puts on his own shoes at school, so we need to start having him do it at home. With new shoes, we have a ready-made excuse for the new change: you have new big-boy shoes, you need to put them on yourself. We kept the velcro. One thing at a time. However, we also are going to start looking at the buttons and zippers issue. Though he can get through life in pull-up pants, it will be easier if he can do snaps and buttons on jeans. I'm going to alert school on this one. The OT there swore he could do buttons two years ago, but we have yet to see any evidence of it. Its good for his fine motor skills! And finally: sleeping in his own bed all night. I'll miss waking up with a little guy every morning, but the many nights in the recliner are not good on my back. He needs to be comfy in his own space! Hmm, writing it down, it suddenly looks like a lot. We'll see how it goes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/03/upcoming-campaigns.html", "title": "\nUpcoming Campaigns\n"},

Go ahead and go read about it. It's fabulous. Then come back.  Are you back? Good.  Now, I am not a legal analyst, but this looks like good news to me. What do I think it means? I think it means:  All students, not just students with special needs according to a district's definition of \"disability\", have a right to a Free and Appropriate Public Education.  Students with disabilities who are struggling with academic and life function skills (such as social skills), whether they meet a district's strict definition of a disability (which around here requires a 25% delay. 24%, and you're screwed) or not, still have the right to a Free and Appropriate Public Education.  Schools will want to be considering the quality of their in-house special ed services and making sure they have services available that are appropriate for the kids in their system, because that's usually cheaper than private school tuition.  Schools need to possibly reconsider their definition of \"disability\" and how they screen for kids (Child Find), to be sure kids who have disabilities which effect their ability to learn and function receive the support they need to have a Free and Appropriate Public Education.  Why is this such good news for us? Because it fills in some of cracks too many kids fall through, and that we are scared stiff Andy might fall through (well, kids  like  Andy, but who don't have active parents like us making sure he doesn't fall through anything, even if I have to homeschool him myself, by God). Those borderline cases where districts deny service, but the kids are floundering and need support.  This kind of ruling also stitches up a loophole of schools getting around providing service by simply claiming a child is ineligible for service, through such means as failing to do appropriate screening (intentionally or not), having overly restrictive definitions of disability, or having issues with categorizing a child (such as Virginia's change in the \"developmental delay\" category, from max age 8 to max age 6... where do they think those two years' worth of kids are going to be categorized?). It seems the thought was if a child was deemed ineligible by the district, that was it. Well, no, it isn't it- if I can prove my child needs support, even if your screening process kicks him out of the system, my child still has his or her right to a Free and Appropriate Public Education, which still needs to be considered and addressed.  And that, folks, is a huge victory or the rights of children in this country, and their right to an education, as stated in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  (and for us, Article VIII of teh  Constitution of Virginia ).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wrightslaw.com/law/art/forestgrove.ta.analysis.htm", "http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/", "http://law.justia.com/virginia/constitution/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/06/common-sense-prevail-in-supreme-court.html", "title": "\nCommon Sense Prevails in the Supreme Court\n"},

My guys were very very excited, because I had told them they would be meeting three new friends: Sam, Jack, and Quinn. Joey has been very happy about meeting his \"three new brothers!\" Andy was just ecstatic we were going somewhere and were going to be with other boys.  We had planned a post-lunch extravaganza, but failed to take into account two important things: one was our appointment this morning with the psychiatrist to discuss Andy; the other was that it was Fourth of July and poor Stimey had to drive through holiday traffic. We managed to get there all the same, and meet up for our tour of history.  Stimey, Alex, Sam, Jack, and Quinn (Team Stimey!) are, as you all know, completely and totally awesome. But until you meet them, you have no idea how totally awesome they really are. For example, Stimey remembered to pack cold water for each of her three boys. How totally awesome is that? No, wait for it... she gave two of the bottles to my boys (I didn't pack water because we usually just do our circuit and get something to drink at the end). And she did not even complain once when my boys completely drained both bottles, leaving her three with a single bottle to split between them. Oh, and she brought pretzels, too, which my guys promptly snarfed.  Alex is totally awesome, too. He had a knack for finding cool stuff to show the boys, like a bee hive, and a rabbit skull, and animals. (Sorry about the beaver, Alex. That was all my fault.) He also had a knack for keeping up with little dudes while Stimey and I looked for strays, usually Joey and Quinn. When we had the little dudes together, he scoped out coming attractions.  We were pleased to discover that Team Stimey likes animals as much as we do, while still liking history about as much as we do. Which means the boys were enamored with the animals, and Stimey and Alex wanted to see the house, even though the kids found it a little boring. All of the animals were in pens today, probably because there was a huge crowd for the Fourth Weekend (a whole two dozen people! Very exciting! We actually had to share fence with a couple other families!) Did I mention that Andy and Sam turned out to be bosom buddies? Andy was delighted to have a new friend, especially a slightly older, and therefore totally cool, friend. He has made a picture for Sam already, and insisted we call Sam, and he was bitterly heartbroken when Team Stimey didn't come home with us to live forever and ever. Oh, and he was upset that he forgot to bring Beavery and Blankie with him to show Sam. So Sam, here they are:     Tree-climbing turned out to be a great favorite activity as well, and fig trees can be really cool to get into. You could tell Stimey's kids were more practiced at the art of tree climbing than my guys. I need to get them into the woods more.  Andy showed off his adept stick-collecting skills, including finding this cool walking stick. Or wizard's staff. Whichever. So here's Gandalf and Sam walking up from the river bluff... In case you can't tell, Andy was quite in his glory, with a big new stick and his new friend.  Joey was having a grand afternoon, too. He discovered that Stimey wears a watch. His afternoon was all set. Better still, he discovered he could set it himself, pulling the small pin and twirling the hands about to change the time and (even better!) the date. Joey did connect some with Jack, but once he found that watch he was  all  about Ms Jean and her wrist.  Andy and Sam remained bosom buddies, climbing the fences to see the baby pigs and the cows. There were quite a few animals out today, which is always nice, but no fowl. There must be a fox about again. And thank God, no turkeys. In fact, they had the blacksmith shop open and the living history going, so we got to snatch a few minutes of the talk about life as a colonial blacksmith.  Stimey is so awesome, she gave me a Stimeyland pen. You  know  you are jealous, just admit it. I have one and you don't!!! Thank you, Team Stimey, for a most excellent afternoon. We had a fabulous time, and can hardly wait to join in Camp Stimey another day. Maybe next time we'll convince you to come home and live with us. Because you totally, totally rock.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6ua8IXm0I/AAAAAAAACx8/-UpxHg-Rkq0/s1600-h/01_andy_marching.JPG", "http://stimeyland.blogspot.com/", "http://www.nps.gov/gewa/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6uaszl2rI/AAAAAAAACx0/ock9EDP3OdY/s1600-h/01_joey_wall.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6uEVHrX8I/AAAAAAAACxs/xAPCLdyZhcA/s1600-h/01_boys_water.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6uDywgX-I/AAAAAAAACxc/e0Xpdr6-ksM/s1600-h/01_andy_bees.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6uD9jvDYI/AAAAAAAACxU/sKrhN4rAmxU/s1600-h/01_boys_barn.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6uDuQCaLI/AAAAAAAACxM/hjrODOzl7Kc/s1600-h/01_andy_sam.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk613-CJmVI/AAAAAAAACyE/gg4EdQ5UEZw/s1600-h/01_andy_blankie.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6tzZkoNxI/AAAAAAAACxE/94o5KrdBcWY/s1600-h/01_boys_figtree2.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6tzKREYTI/AAAAAAAACw8/VYDIHzZuRB8/s1600-h/01_andy_gandalf.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6ty5SxCNI/AAAAAAAACw0/6Ix0BPS9wtk/s1600-h/01_joey_stimeywatch.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6tynd8vrI/AAAAAAAACws/Ly1pkSiwSCM/s1600-h/01_andy_sam_fence.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk65BZI1gFI/AAAAAAAACyM/nl-CNfUYIjc/s1600-h/stimeypen.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/Sk6tyA8K6eI/AAAAAAAACwk/NC-jZegCSvA/s1600-h/01_teamstimey.JPG"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/07/go-team-stimey.html", "title": "\nGo Team Stimey!!!!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 08, 2009", "body": "\nOne of  the most  annoying things that happens to us- fortunately far less often than it used to- is when people (complete strangers!) walk up to us in public places and recommend discipline for Joey. The behavior that people find unacceptable was most often that even as a larger child, he would often ride in the cart or walk around the cart. However, he does occasionally squeak or squeal in public when he has been denied an item or when being guided away from ordinary misbehavior, such as touching items on the shelves or begging for toys. Suggesting that I swat my child's bottom is simply and plainly  Rude .  We now have our strategies in place for dealing with Rude People. My most common response now is to smile, thank them for their helpful advice, and walk away. If I am blocked at that point, I then note that Joey is autistic, and we are helping him learn to cope with public situations. This deals with the vast majority of Rude People. One thing I have not had to deal with is someone insisting that autism is the diagnosis-du-jour, a-la- Michael Savage . I think I would have to exert a great deal of energy to not slap someone who said something like that.  Fortunately, most the people we meet and strangers who approach us are mostly curious, helpful, considerate, gracious people who show much understanding and patience with us, and who can apparently read my bumper stickers or purse buttons ( Yes! You can ask me about Autism! ) The general push for awareness has had some effect.  With Andy's new diagnosis, I was expecting the ignorance of strangers- though honestly, I've only had a couple of encounters about Andy's behavior, as when it is just him and me, he's usually quiet. It is the ignorance of friends that has been startling.  After all, it is widespread in popular culture to consider ADHD to be a farce, a medical label for poor parenting rather than a real condition, somehow a conspiracy of bad parents to justify lack of discipline and medicate their kids into a stupor. Comments sections on parenting are full of this widespread attitude. The idea that kids are \"overmedicated\" for \"rambunctiousness\" even pops up in  mainstream media . It is socially acceptable to deny ADHD and denigrate parents of children diagnosed with it.  However, I would think that if a friend of yours breaks the news that they have a child just diagnosed with the condition, upbraiding that friend just may not be the best way to show support and concern. Maybe that's just me. Starting an anti-ADHD diatribe and demanding second and third opinions may not be the best response to a friend who may already be upset and worried. I'm just saying. I can also assure you that it makes your friend  very  skittish to share the news with other people, and thus cut them off from needed support- especially when this is the reaction you get from not just one, but several \"close\" friends.  They may even turn to their blog and test the waters of their online friends, whom they consider more understanding of disability and conditions including ADHD.  Personally, I think the absolute best response I have gotten thus far was from Stimey, who (poor thing) got it full and immediate on the phone the day we got the verdict: \"So... how do  you  feel about that?\" I am so fortunate to have you guys, folks like Farmwifetwo, Maddy, Niksmom, Club166, and Stimey who understand that a diagnosis is really about getting appropriate accommodations and services. Andy hasn't changed; we have a new perspective to consider what is best for him and how to help him learn important skills to get through life. Just like Joey didn't change when he was diagnosed as autistic. Andy is still going to be his energetic himself (I have no intention of medicating him unless it is proven absolutely necessary, just as we do not medicate Joey).  Yes, reminders of how to get through the process of getting Andy what he needs are appreciated; but lectures on ADHD as a \"pseudo-condition\" are really just annoying right now. I need real information. Lots of information. Accurate information. And I need it by the 15th, when our Child Study is scheduled.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.about.com/b/2008/07/18/michael-savages-radio-rant-autism-is-caused-by-wimpy-dads.htm", "http://www.cafepress.com/joeymom/2929366", "http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Health/story?id=1820879&page=1"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/07/acceptability.html", "title": "\nAcceptability\n"},

{"date": "Monday, July 13, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the big reasons I blog is to give other folks a glimpse of life with an autistic child, to let them know that it is not something to be afraid of, and that there is someone else out here going through things you may be going through. There is a sense of support and security, a sense of comfort, in knowing you aren't the only one out here doing this, experiencing this, trying to help your child and your family.  I know I tend to keep the negatively neatly tamed here. Yes, we have bad days and weeks and months and they get blogged about, but the run-of-the-mill, every-day roller-coaster ride of having children, and especially special-needs children, I kind of leave out for the most part. It may seem our lives are all fun and roses and smiles. Like that last post about the beach? I left out the major double meltdown when clouds appeared on the horizon and I decided it was time to head home before rain hit. Why? Because personally, I find the fun more notable, and more worth remembering than the screaming that followed. Perhaps it is a leftover of being a mom- you keep the baby and forget the labor pains.  Some of my readers have commented to me what a lovely summer we are having. Yes, we are. And no, we aren't. Its been very much our usual roller-coaster. We are having some issues, some of them minor, some of them not so minor. Name-calling, biting, running, melting, hyperactivity, yes, they are still part of our lives.  So folks, you aren't alone.  If you\u2019ve ever been frustrated with your child\u2019s progress (or lack thereof) to the point of wanting to cry or scream (or actually crying or screaming), you\u2019re not alone.  If you\u2019ve ever been so afraid of a regression that you stayed up half the night trying to think of what to do for your child, you\u2019re not alone.  If you\u2019ve cried in public out of sheer stress of dealing with a melt down, you\u2019re not alone.  If you\u2019ve ever lost it in an IEP meeting, you\u2019re not alone.  If you\u2019ve ever prayed hard for a stiff drink while trying to get your melting-down child to a car that was clear across the parking lot, you\u2019re not alone.  All those days and nights of stress, tears, tearing out your hair, worrying, studying, chasing children, and wishing your life was being spent somewhere else, and thought you were alone? You weren\u2019t. I was right there with you.  I am still right here with you. I just want to put out that reminder that there are ups and downs all over, and the ups are every bit worth those downs. There is a reason God put wine upon this earth, and sometimes I need an extra glass, just like you.  If you're having one of those minutes, hours, days, weeks, summers... here's a hug for you.

Yesterday we got a little interrupted because we are looking for boards to replace our front porch (currently the original 1929 boards, and our isn't the only porch in town going bad fast) and got a line on some we thought would be affordable. Anyway, we did manage to take a picture of the clouds in the sky and watch a  Magic School Bus  on storms, but that was all.  So today we we worked on rainbows. We read the Magic School Bus book on rainbows, then I got out the prism. Joey was very excited about the prism, and is very proud that I let him actually have it, since it is glass and therefore a breakable. He's been making rainbows for me (or trying to) all day. The we put up some cards about different kinds of  clouds . We had picked up our print of yesterday's sky, so we pinned it to the board under the matching card ( cumulus ). Joey was totally excited. There were no clouds when we took Andy to camp, but when we came out to pick him up, there were lots more big puffies out there, so we talked more about cumulus clouds. I'm hoping to do a book or poster on clouds on Friday. I managed to snap a cirrus cloud this evening, and maybe we'll get some thunderheads tomorrow (cumulonimbus clouds!)

{"date": "Friday, July 31, 2009", "body": "\nOK, so among this summer's Issues, Joey has decided it is delightful fun to play with seat belts and take the head resters completely off. Nothing to get the heart leaping that to be entering a dangerous intersection, to realize your child has decided to unbuckle his seat belt and play with the head rester, which has two large spikes on the end of it when it is removed from its intended position (who designed  that ?) Every time we get in the car now, we start with a litany of rules:  1. Get in your seat and lock in.  2. Once you are locked in, you leave the seatbelt alone.  3. Do not play with or touch the head resters.  4. Do not touch any other seatbelts, either.  5. Stay in your seat, sitting upright, with your shoulderbelt properly over your chest and your lapbelt over your lap.  6. Do not duck from under the shoulderbelt to lean forward and remove the head rester.  And then we proceed to have constant reminders of these rules throughout the trip. The length of the trip does not matter. So now a typical fly on the window in my car hears something like this:  Internet! Internet! Internet! Toppit, Doey! Honey, don't play with the seat belts.  I put glue on Grandma! I put glue on Grandma!* (Wild cackling laughter) Toppit, Doey! Sweetie, put the headrest back, please.  Head rest ER.  Yes, dear, just put it back.  TOPPIT, DOEY! (smack) We don't hit. That's a star.  AAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!! Joey, sit up, please! Boys have wieners and girls don't.  Joey, stop playing with the seatbelts. Lock in, please.  TOPPIT, DOEY!!! Joey, put. the. head. rester. BACK.  It's after twelve o'clock. We are late for getting lunch.  TOPPIT DOEY!!! Joey, PUT THE HEAD RESTER BACK!!!

{"date": "Friday, July 17, 2009", "body": "\nSo we have come through the child study portion of the SpEd process, and we now need evaluations. They want psych evals, social evals, educational evals. All the things I thought they would do the last two times I brought him to the system's attention. But that's water under the bridge now.  The next step is eligibility, and these evals are a part of that. The fear? That the popularity of dismissing ADHD will mean these evals will come out as not significant for eligibility. That his behavior will be labeled a discipline problem instead of a real issue to be addressed. We need help teaching him to cope and gain self control with extra challenge of the way his brain works. We're scared to death of being told \"no\" by the very people who are supposed to be helping.  After all, the last two times we did this, we were told he was just fine and didn't need any help.  When we went through this part of the process with Joey, the fear wasn't that we would be turned down. It was so obvious he needed service that the question wasn't \"will he qualify?\", but \"how much will he qualify for?\"  I spent a lot of this last meeting explaining that we need help, why we need help, and about being lectured by the psychiatrist about him not already being in the system. I think it was clear I was Unhappy, but did they move us on because there really is a problem, or because Momma Bear is roaring?  Why is there so much doubt and nerves? Well perhaps because after our last round of  Child Find/Child Study , we were told he didn't need service. There was no asking for more evals, even though he spent the entire session in constant motion. What was the message to me as a mom? That the motion and behavior issues were my fault. After all, discipline is the job of the parent. It is my job to teach him to sit up straight at the table and follow instructions. It is my job to help him learn to listen to a story while sitting in a group. Just ask anyone on the street whose fault it is when a child is running around a restaurant, or talking loudly in a library, or when asked to do something, yells \"No! I don't like you!\" and hides in a corner instead of doing what he is told. Even when all the \"usual tricks\" you read of in magazines and see on SuperNanny fail (often spectacularly), the school just said he's fine, he's normal, this is just the way boys are. And if what the school says is true... well, it can't very well be the child's fault, he's just learning and being himself as best he can. And there must be a fault, because other kids don't do these things, and they are not acceptable behavior. That leaves... me.  In the meeting, the regular ed representative, a very kind lady and someone I feel is an excellent regular ed teacher, attempted to reassure me by explaining that kindergarten teachers do a lot of transitioning and many of the things my OT was recommending for Andy. We've been through kindergarten and seen the classes in action. We know the drill. Having to explain that we were talking about a matter of degrees- that these weren't suggestions for when Andy is in crisis, but things to do more consistently and more intensely in order to avoid a crisis. Once you are in the middle of an incident, it is too late. And we understand that ADHD is really a matter of degree. All boys have energy... but Andy has significantly more than you expect, and a quicker temper than you can anticipate without being very clear and consistent with  everything . If you take him to the cafeteria without support, life will be explosive for the twenty minutes after you leave- not just wild. Explosive.  It's kind of like trying to explain the difference between  a tantrum and a meltdown . You can get lost in semantics and forget there is a child here who needs support, more support than his peers seem to require, on a regular and consistent basis. Perhaps we are back to the questions of \"why should I need a diagnosis?\" and \"Why can't kids just be taken as they are, and supported as they need, no matter their label?\"  Perhaps I will muse more on that later.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/07/on-to-phase-ii.html", "title": "\nOn To Phase II\n"},

It may not have looked like Joey was fascinated to most people, as he meandered around the lot peering into windows and talking about various things that wouldn't seem related to cars, I could tell he was happy. There were trucks. There were engines. There were tractors. Life was great. Maybe Joey will grow up to be an auto mechanic! I know we have family and friends who would not approve. Too many people in this society think that a briefcase and corporate tie are marks of success. The decline in manufacturing and industry in this country has meant the worst financial straits in nearly a century. The excuse for getting rid of factory jobs is that people should go into information technology and other computer and service-sector employment, as if there was something dirty and bad about factory jobs. Let's face it. Not everyone is a computer whiz. In fact, it takes intelligence and good sense to be a good manufacturer, a good auto mechanic, a good construction worker.  I have two boys who need to be able to take their own paths, and we are working hard to prepare them for any path they may decide to take. It is likely that Andy will want something physical to do- park ranger? veterinarian? maybe a farmer? or construction? Joey may need something that doesn't require a lot of speaking.

{"date": "Friday, August 27, 2010", "body": "\nThere are those moments in life when you not only realize your mistakes, understand the real consequences of them, and know without a doubt that you are, at the core, a bumbling idiot; those consequences are presented to you in such a way that makes them so palpably and undeniably real, that you wonder how on earth you could be such a bumbling idiot and know that there are some mistakes you can't go back and really fix. It is in those moments that you know that people do really depend upon you, and that sometimes, you let them down; and it is in those moments that screaming is probably the only appropriate response- even those in that moment, that is the one thing you can never do.  One of those moments came at us on highway 50 on the way home from Ocean City. We're damn lucky it didn't come at us at 55 miles an hour, because somebody would have been seriously hurt.  When Joey's ESY meeting was held, and we saw the options, we saw no good ones. We settled for placing Joey in the summer enrichment program designed for regular ed students with an aide, with the \"everything's going to be fine speech\" tossed in, and then 2 weeks of OT tacked on. We could have sent him to a camp an hour away with a trip home in heavy traffic. That was kind of our only other option, and that would have replaced the OT, not the Summer Scholars. They were dead set on putting him into that summer scholars thing.  We weren't comfortable. We had been told there might be 40 kids in the class, but \"everything will be OK, because there will be two teachers, and we'll transition Joey to the new school and new teachers\" by having two weeks with the old para, then two weeks with one of the new special ed folks each week. The realities of the program were that it was a large, noisy group with two field trips a week- one in-town, one in Richmond- our para got usurped by another special ed student who was put into the program as a regular participant, most of the kids seemed to shun Joey whenever I saw him and were unfamiliar to him. We already were having increased anxiety issues as Joey realized he was going to be in a new school and not have his same teacher and para anymore- the point of putting him in the program was to  decrease  that anxiety, not  increase  it. The reality was instant and dramatic increase in anxiety, depression, and the associated behaviors such as bolting and self deprecation.  When we saw the increase the first week, we were told he was getting settled, give him more time. I should have pulled him.  When he really freaked out the second week, we sang our own praises in figuring out the CD player and getting him through the long field trip and the noisy days. I should have pulled him.  In the third week, when I got the note from the new aide that Joey was having trouble, but that she was sure \"Everything would be OK\", I should have pulled him.  By the fourth week, it was too late. I should have pulled him anyway. By then he was bolting almost daily, sometimes multiple times in a day. At any frustration, he was saying he was a bad person, he couldn't be a good boy, and that no one liked him. He was saying that people thought he was ugly and mean, but he was really a nice boy. He was saying he was stupid and clumsy and he waned to die so Andy could have a little sister. He wanted to break things, he wanted to kill me (when I didn't give him his way), he wanted to kill Andy (when Andy was annoying him), he wanted to die. Everything was most definitely  not  OK.  The beach trip he looks forward to every year was a series of struggles to get him to do anything new, sprinkled with familiar favorites to coax him out of the hotel room- some of which failed to do so. He was bolting there, too. Do you know how hard it is to lock a hotel room door from the inside, to keep someone in?  Then, just before the bridge on our way home, it happened. He was frustrated, tired, annoyed, hungry, cramped in the car, feeling the anxiety of heading home and who knows what else was exploding in that head of his. He was done, he was leaving, goodbye! And he opened the door.  Fortunately, we were in a traffic jam, so the car wasn't moving very fast, but folks, it was fast enough. A sharp cry from me got him to close the door, and JoeyAndyDad found a place to get off the road pretty quick. We engaged the child safety locks, got everyone calmed down, and started off again.  I dont think I need to go into the \"might have\" situations here. Thank God, none of them happened, we just got the door shut, the locks engaged, and no one was injured in the process. The tacked on OT turned quickly into a blessing these lat two weeks, as Miss Lisa got to see what has occurred, and put together a brilliantly clear letter about the issue of bolting and that this is a dramatic and new behavior, as well as the self- deprecation issues. On Tuesday, I get to sketch out the consequences of not providing Joey with appropriate ESY.  I get to look straight into the face of the consequences of not holding my ground and fighting, every single day. This is what happens when I fail him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/08/painfully-obvious.html", "title": "\nPainfully Obvious\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, September 05, 2010", "body": "\nTonight's story for Joey was  Miss Rumphius . In case you are not familiar with the story, which I recommend, Miss Rumphius decides there are three things to do in life: see faraway places, retire to the seaside, and do something to make the world more beautiful.  The idea is to get kids to think about life and how to make the world beautiful. Joey, however, was more interested in the \"seeing faraway places\" part, and we talked about how Mommy had been to India. He was interested enough that I dug out a couple of my photo albums, but they weren't as interesting to him. Andy, however, popped in when he saw I had pictures, and was fascinated.  We looked through the pictures, then I settled him into bed, and he started asking lots of questions- about the pictures, and the sculptures there, and the people in the pictures. He wanted to know if everybody there was brown. So we talked about melatonin and how different people have different skin because their ancestors adapted to where they lived, and people who lived in sunny places needed to be darker, and we came from the north where it wasn't as sunny, so our skin is lighter. And we talked about tanning in the summer. And we talked about how people are different, simply because that is how they were made.  So he wanted to know other ways people were different.  \"Well,\" I said, \"we all like different things. Like some of us like peanut butter, and some of us don't.\"  \"i don like peanu budder,\" he affirmed. \"Wha else?\"  \"Well, some people are short and some are tall. That is just the way they are made.\"  \"Yeth,\" he agreed. \"An sthome kids are fastht, and some isth swow.\" I nodded. \"I run fastht.\" \"Super fast,\" I agreed.  \"An Joey isth diff-er-en.\"  Pause. Was this about to go where I think it is going to go?  \"How is Joey different?\" I asked.  \"He no' like over kidsth,\" Andy frowned.  \"You're right. We're all different. And Joey is different.\" Andy still frowned. \"Joey is autistic,\" I added.  \"Wha's 'ausisdic'?\"  \"It means he thinks differently than you do. He sees the world a little differently. And he has more trouble talking than you do.\" He still frowned.  \"Wha do i have?\" he asked, and I shrugged. \"Nothing. You're just not autistic.\" He still stewed. \"Well, let's think of it this way. Most people have brains like... say,  toasters . And they make toast really well. So your brain is a toaster, and it makes toast.\"  \"Okay,\" he accepted the premise uneasily.  \"Well, Joey's brain is more like a hair dryer. It heats stuff, and can even make toast, but it is a lot harder for him, because he isn't made to make toast, he is made to dry hair. And we need dry hair, so it's a good thing he's here.\" Andy frowned. \"And some of us are ovens....\" \"Wha's dat?\" \"An oven? The thing we put cookies in to bake them. But not the best for making toast.\" Though I suppose that depends on how you like your toast. But let's not confuse the poor lad.  \"And some people are... clothes dryers. So they can heat things up, too, but they do better drying clothes than making toast. But most people are toasters, and the world is geared to making toast.\" Yeah, I fumbled it. Just shoot me already.  \"Thas funny,\" he giggled, thinking.  \"There's lots of ways to be different,\" I offered as explanation. \"And it's a good thing we're all different. It makes the world interesting. Things would be pretty boring if we were all alike. Some people like animals, and some like cars, and some have blues eyes, and some have brown. What color are your eyes?\"  Instead of answering, he put a finger to one of my eyes.  \"Yes, you have the same color as mine. What is it?\" He signed blue, and looked tired. \"That's right. Because that is just the way you are made. And handsome!\" I kissed him, and he snuggled in, and fell asleep.  I have the feeling this is going to be a regular bedtime conversation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chinaberry.com/prod.cfm/pgc/11100/sbc/11104/inv/457", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EywVzklAu_o/TIRdeChRKFI/AAAAAAAADq0/7gep0s_4ayM/s1600/amanda_india_bridge.jpg", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/03/toast-to-inclusion-autism-education-in.html"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/09/yes-were-all-different.html", "title": "\nYes, We're All Different\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 07, 2009", "body": "\nWe spent some time at the park today. Joey was very interested in two older girls- well, one was almost eight, and the other was probably no older than 12. The other kids were all little ones, the kind that Andy likes to take around by the hand and show things to. While Andy was indulging himself, Joey kept trying to engage these two young ladies. They clearly were at a complete loss for what to do. He tried several different approaches to engaging with them. First, he noted that the girls were tall, and he liked them. Then he tried to teach them some sign language, and the Signing Time theme song. Then he tried to include them in some of his own play, like asking if they wanted to make a mulch cake and sing Happy Birthday, or announcing he was an ice cream truck, and asking them to get in.  None of this worked. The girls retreated to a corner and were kinda staring at him as he satisfied himself by making a mulch cake (a pile of mulch that you then pretend to eat), then teaching some of the little ones how to sign \"black cat.\" They were whispering, and I was close enough to catch \"he's so weird.\"  And I put the body language, the eye track, and the words together, and realized they were talking about Joey.  \"Oh, its OK,\" I burst in on their huddle from my place by the climbing tree. \"He's just trying to play with you. He's autistic.\"  \"I don't know what that is,\" the older girl replied, but there was a cue, a way she kept looking at him, and now at me- she wasn't dismissing him. She wanted to know; she had made the statement as a question, and was now awaiting an answer.  I have no idea how you explain autism to a 12-year-old girl. I did my best. I explained he had problems communicating and speaking, and so didn't know how to ask the girls to play, or how to include them in his games, and was doing the best he could. The younger girl intimated that she thought him weird as in scary, and I assured her he wasn't going to hurt her, he was just trying to say \"Hi, I'm Joey, let's play!\" the way he knew how. If they wanted to play with him, they would have to join his game, or explain what they wanted to play, and I would be happy to help. They were unsure, and decided they wanted to do \"girl stuff\".  But it was a telling conversation. Here was a child not that much older than Joey, but the differences between her social connections and communication and Joey's ability to play and communicate were startling. I am sure they thought he was somehow intellectually challenged, because his behavior and language was so unexpected and unpredictable. The fear was startling, too. I don't think of Joey as scary at all, especially at the park when he is in a decent mood, like he was today. The older girl's interest in him was also something I found notable; she didn't just reject him outright. She wanted to know more about him. I need better language, simpler terms for talking about Joey to his peers- direct but inclusive, language that makes it clear that Joey does things in his own way- so does everybody- and helps his peers find common ground, a point where they include him, and he includes them. How do you explain to a 12-year-old that if they can find a way to include Joey, he's a lovely person to know and play with, and would be thrilled to have friends and to be a friend? That \"weird\" is really just \"different\", and we're  all  different? How does one communicate such a idea in a child at the stage when being the same as their social peers is so important?  And what can we do to help Joey make those connections he so very much wants,  clearly  wants? What skills does he need to be able to engage his peers, and join their games? What is the disconnect that results in that label of \"weird\", which becomes the brick wall between Joey and people around him? What crucial social skills are missing? What makes Joey's attempt to engage so very different than how I jumped in on the conversation of these two girls? Why was my engage tactic successful, when his was not?  These are the questions we are now asking, in thinking about the road ahead, the plans for IEPs and programs and therapies. How much frustration can we mitigate, how many skill gaps can we fill, before Joey is 12 and feels that intense need to fit in somewhere, anywhere? What tools do I need to provide and teach as a safety net, if he finds that, like his mom, he fits in nowhere?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2009/08/at-park.html", "title": "\nAt the Park\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, October 05, 2010", "body": "\nWelcome to Week Five of the school catastrophe. If there was a mistake to be made, we've made it; we now stand as an example of why appropriate service is absolutely vital to the success of a disabled child in school. You can't just shove a child into a program, it has to be individualized with appropriate support- both in quantity and quality, and year-round. Poor transitioning results in disaster.  Transitioning seems to be a major weak point in our school system and faculty training. The teachers Joey has are, to be clear and honest, working their butts off trying to get his puzzle figured out and come up with appropriate solutions to support Joey. However, it is hard to think of solutions when you don't have sufficient understanding of or training in the problem. When one tends to focus on behavior rather than understanding communication and issues, everything becomes a problem of discipline. This can be reinforced when Joey can pull himself together enough to be functional when someone such as the principal or one of his old teachers comes into the room. That the distraction might give him extra incentive to swallow the frustration he is trying desperately to communicate is something that seems ignored, or at least unrecognized. How does one get teachers to recognize that my child is so overwhelming, he has shut down?  And in the meantime, what to do? I have a child so completely overwhelmed, his teachers feel the need to separate him, and have gotten to no academic work in five weeks. When I say this child has shut down, I mean he becomes so completely non-functional that he is removed to a 1:1 self-contained setting- and still gets nowhere. How do I help my child survive this problem of transition, this overwhelming new-ness, this bump on his road?  When the stress is overwhelming, what do  you  do? After all, shut-down is not an option for most folks who read this blog. We have to keep going, keep functioning. Our children are depending on us to be functional. We're not allowed to be tired and overwhelmed. How do we dive through anxiety, exhaustion, depression, and frustration, to come out the other side with smiles, clean clothes, and possibly a cooked dinner?  Tomorrow, we are going to the doctor with Joey. I haven't yet gotten him into a psychiatrist, so we are going to try a back door- our family physician- to see if there is anything we can do; in other words, we're exploring medication. This is a touchy subject, and I am sure I will get comments and emails, some in great detail, for both sides (pro and con); but sometimes you realize you are fast running out of options, and running out of time, and damage is being done. Sometimes you have to examine the options, so that educated, reasonable, and informed decisions can be made. If Joey continues to be overwhelmed and uncomfortable at school, we could go from bad to worse in a way that would be even more catastrophic.  We'll keep you posted. P.S.:  What she said.  That's kind of my life right now.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/i-see-the-moon/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/10/back-to-school-blues.html", "title": "\nBack to School Blues\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2011", "body": "\nWhile we are in the confessional here, I have a real shocker for people who know me:  I don't like to read.  I far prefer doing other things.  Reading is a tool- and excellent for gaining new information about all sorts of topics, for discovering new stories and new lines of thought. But I don't like it. That may seem really strange when I spend my life in academia, where reading is an absolute necessity. It probably seems strange to people who know that when I am disturbed in the middle of a book, I can be quite snappish and grumpy. I was up until 2 this morning reading a story I love.  Reading is an overwhelming experience. The pull of words and scenes and characters becomes a sensory overload. Tearing away from a book to come back to this world is like being shoved from a movie theater into the bright sunlight, when you are still processing and thinking about the movie. Ouch.  If they published good, interesting books as audio books- not just junk fiction and \"nonfiction\"- I would love it. I am very much an auditory or aural learner, not really a visual one. But from what I have read about auditory learners, I don't fit those descriptions. I keep reading (I didn't say I  don't  read, I said I don't care for it and I would prefer to do other things) that auditory learners think in words, are bad at math and good at foreign languages, and have trouble visualizing things. I probably do think in words, but creating pictures is not a problem, either. I stink at foreign language, but rock at math. I remember things better if I hear them rather than having to deal with words.  Letters and words can get very jumbled on a page and overwhelming, and I have to stop and read it again, making it take longer.  I purchased a copy of Ivanhoe in mp3 because I had always wanted to read it. It was like having a whole new world, to be able to listen to the book instead of fighting with print. And besides, have you ever read Ivanhoe? Awesome.  I have been thinking about this more because Joey is so very visual, and yet seems to dislike reading. He sometimes says it hurts. I wonder if he means it is overwhelming. Perhaps he becomes engulfed as I do, though I have never seen him be engulfed in a book exactly in the way I get engulfed in a book and can't stop until I reach the end (even in books I have read many times before- did I mention I was up until 2 am?) Perhaps the letters jumble up, or make other kinds of patterns for him, and remembering they are words is something that requires more energy for him. Perhaps he is expected to read too quickly, and needs a lot more processing time to really understand what he is reading, just like me. And perhaps it is a totally different issue than anything I can right now picture or understand.  Trying to get Joey to understand that reading is a tool that provides him with information is has been a challenge. I think once he really understands what words and reading can do for him, he'll be happier. I wish I knew what the obstacle was, so i could help him get through it to the other side. P.S.- Joey reads beautifully, when you can get him to do it. So it isn't an issue of ability.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/04/reading.html", "title": "\nReading\n"},

Is there something he needs at home?  I stood in my livingroom a minute after I got them on the bus. I cleaned it up Thursday. It is already an explosion of Zhu Zhu pets, Star Wars figures. sundry detritus and pizza boxes, with my tubs of fabric stuck in the middle. School papers are scattered over the little table next to my chair. Wrappers from strawberry juice bars are on the floor. I can see the diningroom needs to be vacuumed, and is also a den of toys, used spiral notebooks, crayons, and unplayed games.  I was looking at card games in the store last night, after the boys were in bed while I was grocery shopping. There was one with dinosaurs. I looked hard at it. When I was six and eight, I loved games. Board games, card games, I was up early playing them by myself I loved them so. My boys don't play games. I try now and again. Joey liked Chutes and Ladders and Hi Ho Cherry-o for a while, but taking turns is a real challenge. Complicated rules and gameplay is another challenge. Instructions we find simple enough are a real hurdle for these guys. Maybe its time to have a family game night.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2010/09/aftershocks-and-mysteries.html", "title": "\nAftershocks and Mysteries\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, May 05, 2011", "body": "\nBased on observations and situations from this past week.  1. Teach respect in all situations.  If you teach your kid it is OK to rejoice in an enemy's death, you'd be surprised how quickly that translates to spitefulness and rejoicing in victory over anyone they decide is even mildly annoying. Treating others the way you would want to be treated is a basic lesson in respectful values. If you don't want anyone to dance on your grave, don't have a party on someone else's. I don't care what they did. Don't stoop to that level.  2. Don't use the word \"retard.\"  Or \"nigger\". Or \"spic.\" Or \"fag.\"  Or any other word intended as immanently offensive to another group or person. It isn't funny, it isn't casual, and I do not care who you are or how you think you are using the word. When you teach kids that \"retard\" is OK to use when you think something is dumb, stupid, ugly, nasty, etc. then you should not be surprised when they start treating people they regard as \"retarded\" or who act differently as if those people are dumb, stupid, ugly, nasty, etc. If you use these words in any way, don't be surprised when they start bullying kids they view as not even human beings- because that is what you taught them- with any of these ugly words. With rights comes responsibility, and we in this country have the awesome and wonderful right of free speech- and the awesome responsibility that comes with it.  3. Be aware of your child.  Home is not the only place kids pick up bullying and nastiness. Their own insecurity makes them sensitive to language and behavior of others. Pay attention. If another parent approaches you with an issue, address it immediately. Be sure your child understands what is acceptable and what is not. Would your child want to be ignored on the playground? Would they want to be called an ugly word? Would they want their pretend play laughed at and scorned by others? Would they want others throwing sticks or mulch at them? No? Then they shouldn't be doing these things. Would they want others to help push them on the swing? Would they want other kids to invite them to play, and explain the game to them? Would they want others to say hello to them? Would they like it if others shared their toys with them? Yes? Then they should be doing these things. Kids need help negotiating this, because they are developmentally wired to be selfish as natural self-preservation. Reminding them to treat others as they wish to be treated is an excellent way of helping them understand that other people have feelings and peers make potential friends.  4. Be aware of other children.  Is your child being bullied, picked on, teased, ignored? We can't control what others do, but we can control ourselves. Teaching your child appropriate responses to unsocial behavior and language helps that child understand how to show respect in all situations- including unfortunate ones. Steer clear of other children who are mean to you. Recognize when they are being mean and let adults know there is a problem. KNow who your friends really are. Peers have a potential of being friends, but not all of them are friendly. I have a Plan B whenever we go to the park, because there are some families that simply do not get the idea of treating other people with respect, and think it is funny or \"just being boys\" when their child is mean and ugly to other children. When I see them coming, we just leave.  What would the world be like if we showed respect to other people, no matter what?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/05/some-advice-to-parents-in-making-world.html", "title": "\nSome Advice To Parents In Making the World A Little Nicer\n"},

So we took them to Friendly's, sat down with french fries and paper, and hashed out what we think is fair and helpful. We wanted no more than ten rules, and if they get through the day obeying those rules, they get a check or a sticker or something. And in the end, if they earn enough checks or stickers or something, they get a Prize Box. Woo-hoo!  Here is what we've come up with:  Make the bed every morning.  Except for apples and water, ask for food or snacks.  Don't do anything that makes anyone else scream or say \"ouch\".  The bathroom floor must be clear and dry after any bath.  Keep hands and feet to yourself.  Speak respectfully to everyone, using only respectful words.  Do what is asked, right away, and with a smile.  Treat others as you wish to be treated.  Homework first.  All toys must be taken upstairs and put away at bedtime.  This is kind of a first draft, but not bad for being discussed over ice cream.

{"date": "Monday, July 11, 2011", "body": "\nWhen Joey was very little, we tried out a gluten-free, casein-free diet. We ended up with a very hungry child, especially since his diet wasn't terribly varied to begin with.  Now that he is older, and we are experiencing an increase in behavior issues, I am considering a cut in the gluten again. The thing about cutting gluten is that if I do it right, it can't hurt him; and if he's sensitive, we should see a difference in behavior or mood, or even weight, which would be a signal to us to go more drastic. It isn't like Joey needs to be eating a ton of pasta and bread, anyway.  Our doctor, clever person that she is, made a pretty big deal about wanting the boys to eat lots of fresh foods, especially vegetables, at their last appointment. We are, of course, going to cheat and remind Joey that the doctor's orders are to eat more fresh veggies. He's been very rule-oriented lately, so this may support the effort.  In the meantime, I think I am going to be at the farmer's market more often, because fresh veggies don't keep too well, especially in summer heat.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2011", "body": "\nStanding at our bus stop is always an interesting experience. I like our neighbors. We have 6 families who use our stop, with 3 who appear regularly. Most of the time we chat lightly about the kids, the teachers, stuff that I can click into mostly by talking about Andy. They ask about Joey, and are always very nice when he is at the stop (when his bus is late in the morning or early in the afternoon). Generally, it's all good.  And then sometimes, topics pop up that remind me that life is different on this side of the street. Usually, it is one of the other 3 families who come and pop into those topics to which I have little to add or are outside our experience entirely. And usually I just either stand there nodding as if I have a clue what their world is like, or strike up a conversation with Awesome Neighbor's grandparents, and drop away from the crowd. And sometimes, I'm cornered, and it can be a little awkward.  One of those topics that rears it's ugly head at the bus stop (and at other unfortunate moments) is babysitters. One of our bus stop families actually has a regular babysitter who gets the kids off the bus in the afternoon. Sometimes there is talk of regularly weekly or monthly outings, a phenomenon called \"Date Night\" in Momspeak. A couple of the families have whole weekends when they go away \"without the kids.\" And these conversations and events usually lead to a conversation about babysitters: finding good ones, who to use, who not to use, who the regulars are, and even a discussion of \"nannies\" (by which they mean a sitter like our one family uses, who picks up and cares for the kids in the afternoons). Apparently, most people can pick up the phone, call in a local teenager or college student, and go out for drinks or dinner or even a whole weekend.  I bet for a lot of my readers, that is foreign concept, over which you are now boggling.  Several of the families noticed that we have been having a bit more trouble with Joey than usual over the past year. All of them know he is autistic and have now experienced a little of what that means for us. So whenever these conversations come up, almost invariably, someone suggests that I should \"call a sitter\" and \"get some Mom time.\"  Seriously? And who do I call? That local teenager? Don't make me laugh.  When Joey was little, we had therapists who came to work with him for an hour or two at a time, mostly doing ABA therapies. These young people sometimes had some background of working with special needs kids. Sometimes we got a fully trained therapist, or a talented one (Hi, Miss Katie!), but mostly we got college kids who were vaguely interested in education careers and had some basic training in ABA and autism-  very  basic- and they mostly could at least deal with Joey for their two hours. And I would clean things, or play with Andy, or usually both. A few times I actually left the house to run an emergency errand. However, that was before Bolting Joey. And Biting My Arm Joey. And Everybody Hates Me Just Kill Me Now Joey.  We did try the teenager route a couple of times. Kids around here have to get in so much community service for their high school diploma, and babysitting a disabled kid fits that bill. However, you first have to ask the parents. \"my kid is autistic\" shut that down very quickly. And again, that was  before  Bolting Joey.  Even when we get people who know Joey to watch him, it can be an issue- problems can rear their ugly heads. It only take a minute for Joey to start the spiral into a meltdown. Or be gone.  Call a local teen with no training and no experience? Fat chance. Call a trained person? Any guesses how much that costs?  No, I don't think I will be calling in a babysitter on a whim any time soon, to run out for dinner and drinks with my husband tonight, but thanks for the suggestion. And the lecture about how I just need to call our babysitter. But give me a little notice, and I'll see what I can do.

{"date": "Monday, January 16, 2012", "body": "\nI remember That Meeting.  We were in a preschool classroom, and the topic was ESY. We had covered for the school the year before by placing Joey basically in daycare, and we knew it didn't really work very well. We came with the idea that we would be discussing Joey's issues of the year and how they might be addressed, and the need for him to have year-round service. We knew every educational study done supported autistic students having year-round services. We knew the government offices published guidelines that recommended year-round service for autistic kids. We knew the doctor, the speech therapist, and the OT were recommending summer services. He needed structure. He needed focus. He needed school.  It wasn't an easy thing for us to give him up, but we knew that everything was pointing to this being good for him, so we would lose a lot less time in the fall. Time was, after all, the enemy. We had none to waste if we wanted the best possible outcome in the long run. We came in to the meeting, sat in the half-sized chairs around the low table, and the meeting began.  And the school OT pulled out a color print-out of the state guidelines for ESY, and started noting how Joey met none of the criteria, mostly because he wasn't showing regression.  We were absolutely blindsided. Do you know what color copies cost? Here was a professional, going against everything we had, everything that we had ever heard of... and though regression was not the \"only criteria\", it seemed to be the elephant on the page.  Hindsight makes that meeting even worse, because I know now that Joey did, in fact, meet the criteria on that page. We were just too ignorant at the time, and not quick enough, to be able to throw it back in her face.  We have all had That Meeting. The one where the people who are supposed to be helping you actively sabotage you, and for no good reason you can see. Malice? I still wonder if there wasn't malice in our meeting, for that OT had already proved to be incompetent, I had already parked my butt in her boss' office to note it. I still remember going to a private OT and discussing things the school OT had said and done (and not done), and the utter shock as the private OT said, \"if what you are telling me is true, that is a major breach of ethics! Your OT could lose [thei]r license!\" and knowing that reporting the OT was going to do no good. We had already tried that route.  But sometimes it isn't malice- or at least, not conscious malice. Often, it is ignorance that fuels That Meeting. We expect professionals working with our kids to be... well, professional. The ignorance can be a shock. It bowls you over and stomps you into the dust. Did that person just say that? Really? They know better! And they are in a position that leaves us caught in a game of politics, or policy, or whatever, leaving us powerless to get around this person. We find ourselves at a roadblock, often unexpected, and have to think quick to come up with alternative paths. When someone actively sabotages you and your child, it can be an exercise in futility, frustration, and ultimately, creative problem-solving. How do I get around this person to make sure my child gets their needs met?  For us, the answer was lots of OT camps and speech therapy camps that we had to pay for ourselves. There wasn't time to go o Due Process- summer was upon us, and Due Process can take years. It also takes money. We now needed that money to pay for therapies. OT camp isn't like Summer Camp. It costs a lot more. But we- and Joey- were fortunate. We could take that option, even though it wasn't really enough.  The next year, the regression from summer couldn't be ignored. The stress couldn't be ignored. The slamming doors could not be ignored. We got ESY.  But we all know That Meeting. I don't think I have met a special needs family who hasn't had That Meeting. Unfortunately, most of the families I know have had several. We've been pretty lucky in avoiding That Meeting, but we have seen ignorance from plenty of people who should know better- whose  JOB  is to know better. What is scary is when some parents have That Meeting and it is the life of the child at stake. Educational issues, I can come up with Plan B, C, and D. For families facing serious medical issues, That Meeting is catastrophic. It is a life or death moment.  That is why I am glad to see  18,000 signatures on a petition against That Meeting . When you know you are not alone, and we take a stand against That Meeting in its most terrible form; that is the power of letting someone know the catastrophe is upon you. We've been there, and we are, as a community, saying: No More. Stop the ignorance. If you are a professional, act like one. Don't be the ignorant obstacle at That Meeting.  Do. Your. Job.  And do it in a professional, appropriate manner.  Go  Team Amelia .

{"date": "Friday, February 17, 2012", "body": "\nJoey's been having a pretty good year, but we are still having adventures. After all, he's nine. And the last few weeks have been topsy-turvy for him. Joey's aide quit to go back to school, so we have had subs while the new one was found. We actually liked one of the subs, but she wasn't chosen in the end, because they found somebody with a special ed degree. We met her today, and she seems fine, we'll give it some time and see what happens. Here's hoping for awesomeness.  This is, however, a big personnel change, and thus a major change for Joey. This means he's been stressing and anxious, and finding ways to try to keep himself calm. We have some new soundified* phrases, and unfortunately the favorite involves a threat of licking. We have managed to put a stop to actual licking, but the phrase still has the word and makes him giggle. And unfortunately, when said in certain contexts, it sounds extremely inappropriate. As in,  whoa , that was  inappropriate . And let's get out of here  now .  He's also been having... wardrobe malfunctions. Joey, being well-insulated and sensitive to heat in the first place, prefers to wear sleeveless shirts. These are not permitted at school. However, he has discovered he can wear them under another shirt... which he can promptly remove when he reaches school. We have made a compromise with him- he can wear the sleeveless shirt in small group times, but whenever he has to leave his self-contained classroom (ie, to go to math, group reading, specials, lunch...), he has to put on his shirt. All well and good.  The other wardrobe malfunction is Joey's preference for going commando. This can be especially problematic if he is wearing cheap pants, and the seams of the crotch come apart. This always happens when you least expect or want it. For example, Tuesday... during math class. Yes, there is nothing quite like getting a text from your child's teacher: \"Mrs. Joeymom, can you please bring some underpants for Joey? He is putting his fist through a hole in his pants, and we have discovered he has forgotten to wear underpants today.\" In my defense, the bus was early, and the Knickers Check was thus missed that morning. Figures the one day we miss the check is the day he fails to put them on.  I will say he looked very happy to see me when I arrived with a new package of boxer briefs, and sent him off to the boys' room to fix the issue. I gave the rest of the package to the teacher to keep, just in case we have any more malfunctions.  But just in case you think Joey has become self-absorbed in his anxiety, I will share one story from his teacher. One of Joey's classmates is going through an incredibly tough time for reasons I cannot disclose. Let's just say, he had very good reason to be upset and sad and mad and anxious and overwhelmed, and thus sitting in his seat with his head down, in tears. Joey, seeing his friend in distress, starting patting him and telling him in his gentle way that everything would be OK, and giving the friend hugs. The classroom para told Joey his friend \"just needs to cool down\", so Joey immediate fetched a paper towel, dampened it, and put it on his friend's head to help him \"cool down.\"  What? You thought autistic people have no empathy?  Allow me to introduce you to Joey... *Soundified is when the words lose their meaning and become a stim. When Joey was little, he would blur the sounds so that you had more of a sense of the rise and fall of the sound, rather than words. Now he retains the words, but uses them without actual meaning- he repeats them because they feel good in his mouth or make him giggle.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/02/in-knick-of-time.html", "title": "\nIn the Knick of Time\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 04, 2013", "body": "\n If you sit silent \nYou can almost hear him think \nThe world swirls through him.   \n \nJoey has discovered our back yard. This is a very exciting thing. He has taken to getting up whenever he feels like it, putting on his shoes, and acting out his favorite games and movies outside. Sometimes he even adds to them, pretending to be the characters, acting out what they might do or say or think. Joey is very good at imitating voices. He is an amazing  Mr. Waternoose .  \n \nWhat I especially like is the getting up and moving part. Moving really helps Joey's brain make connections and think things out. I am convinced that much of the bolting behavior we see is actually Joey trying to get away to take a walk, to process what is happening around him and to him; to escape the immediate melee and make sense of it. Figuring out that he can get up and do this at home is, I believe, a huge step forward for him.  \n \nI also like that he \"gets\" the rule that he is to stay in the back yard. We are constantly having to put up doors and locks and obstacles, lest his frustration overwhelm him and he bolts. It feels like we are building a prison around him; I'm betting he feels it, too. Joey doesn't have firm enough control of language as a communication tool to be able to express himself to, say, a police officer. During his longest bolt, he made it to the park, talked to some of the folks there, and came home; but that is not the same as someone in a uniform stopping you and asking you where you live and if you are OK. When the anxiety goes up, the ability to speak plummets for him- usually increasing frustration and anxiety in an out-of-control vortex of screaming abyss. Being able to have him go into the back yard and stay there, without having to put up a six-foot solid gate (there is a locked gate, but he could, with a little effort, climb it) to pen him is something I think may be important. To be able to mark and understand boundaries, without having to put up physical barriers to understand them- that is something to learn, a lesson about personal and public space. It is important to know the boundaries of \"home.\"  \n \nThere are boys in our neighborhood who roam. Awesome Neighbor was roaming by the time he was nine- often to our house, where we understood and accepted him, and didn't mind a little bouncing. There was no doubt that when the call came, he would turn for home. One of our current roamers- all in middle school- is an autistic kid from around the corner. It is a tug at heart and mind to think of Joey in his locked yard, when other boys seem able to roam free, with little concern from their parents that they will, when evening comes, turn their faces toward home. It is a hard line to walk, between trust and safety.  \n \nIt is a line that I know one day I will have to step over. He will walk down the street, and I will have to trust that when the sun goes down or the text goes through, he will turn his feet towards home. And he might say he's going one place, and actually go another. He may decide to turn his feet another way. It is the risk every parent takes, that first time they let their child out the door and out of their sight. Risk and trust. Risk and faith.  \n \nIf you have never seen that panic in Joey's eye, that rise of color to his face, that bolting trot, it may be hard to understand how fine the line is, how delicate the knife edge. One day, he will be ready. But not this day.  \n \nThis day, we are taking the first steps along that line. He gets up, and slips out the back door. And I trust that when he feels done playing, instead of going over that gate, he will come back in that door.  \n \nWe all have to start somewhere. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://disney.go.com/monstersinc/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2013/04/autism-understanding-day-4.html", "title": "\nAutism Understanding: Day 4\n"},

I got to see both young ladies this morning, as I took Joey's komodo dragon model in for him to paint at school. I knew the one young lady from last year, the other young lady is new. I was a little surprised to find I had permission to know our new friend's backstory. Then I heard it. I am not at liberty to share it, but let's just say my heart broke a little, watching that lovely young lady and understanding what challenges she faces. Joey adores her, and she is very serious about being \"Joey's Buddy\" and helping him with certain aspects of his day.  It was a reminder to us that there are going to be other challenges when you are in the world special education and special needs. So many of the kids in, say, Andy's class, may go through their entire school careers without having to discuss the needs of their friends, or that a friend is sick, or that a friend may go away. These events are rare outside the special needs community- so rare that children are often shocked and unprepared when their friends have needs, or get sick, or something happens to them. I am going to be working on strategies to help my guys deal with these things, because for us, it is a fact of life. Our friends have special needs, they need special kinds of attention and extra work to be able to play with them, our friends are often sick or get sick more easily and more intensely, and sometimes, things happen. We have not just one rare friend who hits the brick wall. Most of our friends face that wall every day of their lives. We have friends for whom every day they live is beating impossible odds. Every breath they take is a victory. Every moment with them is that much more precious. It isn't rare around here.  It was also a wonderful reminder of how far we've come. Joey is picking up on the rewards of being social, the skills needed to be social, and the joys of interaction with peers. He expresses his like for his two girlfriends- and I think we can call them both this, as in \"sweethearts\"- in a manner that is appropriate for his age. Other than being fascinated by their hair, he is completely appropriate. Holding hands now and then, spending time together, being buddies- all fine. And normal. And social.

It was a lovely little buffet, and the teachers were also allowed to come in and get free lunch (which I think is awesome), and then you sat down and ate, and maybe talked to people. Mostly, I talked to one of the teachers I volunteer for, and with Andy's teacher, but I also got to meet a couple of other volunteers doing awesome things, like the gentleman who volunteers in his daughter's classroom because his workshift doesn't let him see her when she's home, and the very nice lady who does stuff in the library. Seriously, volunteers at schools? They totally rock. I kind of forget what I do is considered on par with the wonderful helping these other folks do. \n \nSo came the question, when one is at a volunteer luncheon and knows, um, nobody: \"So... who do you volunteer for?

In fact, if I can get myself and my money together, I'm going to try for  certification through Signing Time to be an instructor . Then I want to expand the program to include more classrooms. Signing is great for getting around the processing speech problems among the kids in the SpEd rooms, so I don't see why it wouldn't make for great visual prompts and supports in other classrooms, too. They teach the kids Spanish, why not ASL? \n \n \nYeah, that's what I do.

At first, I investigated possibilities of trouble on the bus. A child was poking him and teasing him, so we had his seat changed. Earplugs were offered, but that caused trouble, too. Questions were asked about comfort. Then we got reports of morning trouble at school. He would have issues, then would \"clear up and have a fine afternoon.\" I was suspicious. Then he just flat-out asked if I could drive him. he wanted to be car rider, because of the headaches.  So in the morning, I have been taking him to school, so he can at least start the day quiet and headache-free. I really can't fetch him in the afternoon, because I can't sit in line, grab him, and be home in time to get Joey. Instead, I try to give him some time to calm before pressing homework upon him.

We haven't known this before because the kids are homeschooled, so we didn't see them at the bus stop or at school activities; we knew they lived in town, but not so close.  We discovered this yesterday when the boy (who is about Andy's age), was coming up the street. Andy ran to say hello, and M announced, \"T (his sister) is roaming free!\" We agreed to help look for her, as we know the panic of not knowing where your child is. The result was I had Andy going one direction, Joey going the other, and only one of me. In the end, we all ended up at M's house, and T was found safely fast asleep on a couch, missed because she was next to a pile of folded afghans.  Andy is ecstatic. So is Joey, for these kids actively try to play with him, and they like to hug. Also, there is a baby, To, and Joey has been showing him things and \"taking care of him.\"  We had another playdate today, It was supposed to be here. It was like a tornado was raging in the house. It was fabulous, if breathtaking. But I learned a lot.  For one, if I forget to lock the front door, trouble ensues. These kids don't quite understand, and run freely in and out of doors, and have no clue why that might be a problem. As Joey got tired and excited, he got touchy- and bolted. They figured out he was running and I was trying to catch him, and handled that pretty well. After all, To likes to run, too.  Two, Joey bolted straight for M and T's house. I gave them our phone info in case it happens again. They were very kind, and the playdate shifted to their house. T's room is all in orange, and Joey liked that a lot. Its also someplace new to explore, which can be very exciting.  New friends are always a delight, and I hope we get to play together alot. The mom is awesome, and has lots of interesting ideas about children and learning and playing; I may not agree with everything, but it is always interesting to hear a new perspective. I am thinking we might have a good party in the making, as there are several other kids on the street we know from school and whatnot now.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 16, 2008", "body": "\nOne thing I keep noticing is the use of the terms \"verbal\" and \"non-verbal\" when referring to children with a variety of communication disorders, including autism. We just had a SPED meeting, so the use of it bouncing around the bar (we all go out and debrief afterwards- usually over beer. This time we had lots of non-drinkers, so hot chocolate) brought it to mind again.  Depending on how you use the term, Joey is verbal. Or Joey is non-verbal.  Joey is on the brink of language. He has lots of words to use now, and is stating to use it pragmatically and conversationally. He reads, he talks, he answers some questions. For a lot of folks, this is \"verbal.\"  However, his pragmatic and conversational language is limited. Most of his speech is nonsense, echoed, scripted, or perseveration. He runs out of words and has to turn to other forms of communication. He prefers visual communication to oral communication. We began our adventure with a child who had zero words. For a lot of folks, this counts as \"non-verbal.\"  What it brings to the fore is the inexact use of language when trying to discuss disabilities and abilities.  I often have heated discussions of the word \"myth.\" In common use, this term implies falsehood, even deception. Stories taken as true which are really not true. Stories that refer to explanations of things we don't understand. However, in many academic fields, including mine, \"myth\" is not about falsehood. Myths are narratives that refer to deeper truths using mundane language. Myths are intended to be read \"on the slant\"- they hint and provide glimpses of Truth in terms humans can use; using inexact human language, these stories point to the workings of the cosmos and our role within that larger Being.  Having a conversation with another person about myth can get interesting, especially if we are using these two related, but significantly different, meanings for the term. We start gibbering in nonsense, like a passage from  Alice in Wonderland.   For me, Joey being verbal or non-verbal is a matter of getting him speech service. To me, he is verbal. This qualifies him for speech services in this city. Thats what labels are for- guiding us in what services he might need. The whole autistic, verbal, ritualistic, disabled thing is not about Joey; but they are labels and myths that guide and point us to think deeper about who Joey is, how he is experiencing the world, and how we can support him.  For the difference, between \"help\" and \"support\", I refer you back to my good friend  Snail .

Besides, I don't take my computer with me on such excursions.  However, before I go, I would just like to put in a word about Miley Cyrus. This may seem strange, but I have many beloved young girls in my life, even if they are not my own, and besides, I'm an art historian. This is a question of art and society.  I am tired of seeing  the photograph  derided as inappropriate, pornographic, or embarrassing.  Miley Cyrus, like it or not folks, stands on the brink of womanhood... and Annie Leibovitz caught that moment in a young lady's life beautifully, artfully, and tastefully. The photo is far less revealing- or provocative- than  many  of the  costumes  Disney is  putting  her in, with  miniskirts , exposed mid-drifts, and  plunging  necklines- and  backs  (thankfully, none of them are like the costumes of other teen celebrities- they still maintain decorum. None of the linked photos show Miley in anything I would consider inappropriate! Though it is interesting that the footage I've seen of the costumes is far worse than any stillshot I can dig up).  If this pose is so bad, what about the one  in the lap of her father?  I initially mistook it for being in the lap of a boyfriend (no, I am no fan of the Cyruses and have no idea what they look like). No? And you'd be quite right- an image of a young lady being close to her father, with his strong guiding hand clasping hers, is not inappropriate, either. But it sure told you a lot about how I view teenagers and images of them, doesn't it? Something I had to rethink.  The only reason this lady has to be embarrassed is because the media is deliberately embarrassing her by broadcasting language about this photo that has no business being attached to it. Wholesome young girls CAN become strong young women, with all that womanhood entails: something Annie Leibovitz and Miley Cyrus' grandmother seemed to understand very well, and something so many of us seem to want to ignore, hide, deride, and degrade.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://vanityfairmag.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/28/miley02.jpg", "http://www.mymostwanted.com/gallery/data/1569/medium/miley-cyrus_dot_com--rockonwallpaper.jpg", "http://blog.cleveland.com/entertainment/2007/12/large_hannah.jpg", "http://www.celeblook.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/miley-as-hannah-montana.jpg", "http://www.seenon.com/image/external/SeenonSlideshow/albums/album-40/lg/MileyCyru_Gregg_14433148_600.jpg/fetch/MileyCyru_Gregg_14433148_600.jpg", "http://z.about.com/d/shoes/1/7/8/k/Miley_Cyrus.jpg", "http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/images/celebritology/08/miley_red.jpg", "http://vanityfairmag.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/28/miley01.jpg"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/miley-cyrus-on-brink.html", "title": "\nMiley Cyrus: On The Brink\n"},

When I was India, I was scheduled to stop in Bodhgaya. I had made my reservation some months before, when putting together my trip, and had no idea the monsoon would be late, and that it would be unusually fierce, and that the entire region would be flooded. So I decided it woul dbe safer just to continue through to Varanasi, and skip the water-logged city. According to my literature, the thing to do was to go to the India Rail office in Calcutta, change the reservation, and then all would be well, since I had an Indrail Pass- a fancy ticket that allows you to ride any Indian train for free, because you paid more money for it than most Indians make in a year. It is a very common way for westerners to get around.  So I obediently trekked over to the India Rail office, stood patiently in line for two hours, and finally got in to see the folks who deal with reservations, and calmly and politely explained that I no longer wanted to get off the train at Bodhgaya; I wanted to go through to Varanasi, and needed to change my reservation. I was promptly told that since I had an IndRail Pass, I just needed to tell the conductor that I no longer wished to stop at Bodhgaya, but that I wanted to continue to Varanasi. No problem.  So a few days later, in the pouring rain, I boarded the train and when the conductor came to check my ticket, I told him I no longer wished to get off the train at Bodhgaya, I wanted to continue to Varanasi. The conductor frowned, shook his head, and said since my reservation was only to Bodhgaya, I had to get off at Bodhgaya. He had no room for me beyond that.  I told him what the people in the office said. I showed him the little book that cam ewith the IndRail Pass that said I could go anywhere with the ticket. I offered to take a \"seat\" in second class (that's the art of the train most folks think of, with the people hanging out the doors and windows). But no, I my reservation was for Bodhgaya, I had to get off at Bodhgaya. Knowing that it was now very, very dangerous to get off at Bodhgaya (riots had started there in the days between my trip to the India Rail Office and the day I set foot on the train), I knew I couldn't budge; I had to be found a seat. I had to yell, cry, and raise a general fuss. I stomped my feet, told him he would need to be calling the police in Bodhgaya to get me off that train. I wasn't getting off. I had an IndRail Pass, and I was going to Varanasi, and had been told it was not only possible, but that this was the right way to do it, and I wasn't going to leave the train, if I had to stand the extra four hours to Varanasi in the aisle, or even the bathroom (and if you've ever seen a bathroom on an India Rail train, you know how ugly this got.) In teh end, he found me a seat on another car shortly before the train was to pull in to Bodhgaya.  That's when I realized that the peoplein Calcutta had counted on me doing exactly what I had done- throw a tantrum. They didn't have to do any actual work, and the western woman would scream and stomp until she got her way anyway, so why bother?  Unless you scream, yell, and threaten legal action, the school doesn't care. They don't even try to sound like they care. The OT was very clear: she is only legaly obligated to provide \"educational service.\" The fact that I was asking for \"educational service\" be damned; she was only required to provide so much service, and by God, that was all she was going to provide. So now I am in the middle of having to have a tantrum, so that my Joey will get the service he needs.  I hate throwing tantrums. It would be so much nicer if IEP teams did what they were supposed to do- determine what a child needs. That it what the IEP meeting is supposed to do- not to ask if there is funding available, but to determine what is needed. But that is never what happens. Instead, if any money needs to be spent, it is \"out of the scope of an IEP\" or they start talking about medical rather than educational service. Like they aren't providing medical service... but it's irrelevant, because I am asking for educational service.

{"date": "Friday, March 16, 2007", "body": "\nThis is responding to a well-known essay by Jim Sinclair, \"Don't Mourn for Us.\" The essay is directed at parents of autistic children, and does much of teh smae kind of generalizing that his organization seems to be fighting. The essay can be found presently at http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/dontmourn.htm.  When I discovered Joey was autistic, I did indeed mourn. I still get upset. I greived. I worried. You could even say, I freaked out. But I think you missed completely why I was greiving- and why I still find myself listening to \"Never Surrender\" and having to pull off the road. You seem to miss the battle parents are fighting for their their children.  Sure, you mourn for the \"normal child\" you were \"supposed to have.\" We wanted to go to Italy and ended up in Holland. But you seem to think that is 1. a bad thing, and 2. the only thing. Autism is not happening to me. I am not autistic. But what I realized, feared, knew, and greived about, was that normal life was being threatened- for me, for my child, for my family. \"Normal\" families have no clue abotu IEPs, special ed administrators, and the constraints of labels and resources on the simple opportunity for your child to be independent. Normal parents assume independence is in the future of their child. I can never make that assumption again. I have to fight administrators, teachers, therapists, supervisors, doctors, insurance agents, and institution, just to allow my child the same shot at respect, independence, and freedom that normal families don't even think about. As long as their kid doesn't do something stupidly criminal, they will be free to live their lives as they choose. I am going to have to fight for that right for Joey- and if I don't do that fight RIGHT NOW, he will not have that opportunity- ever. If I ever STOP fighting- if we ever surrender to this insane, ignorant system that is supposed to be helping, but is instead trying in all ways to hinder us- our default is that he will NOT be free. He will be stuck in some institution, with people who don't care dictating his every move, every minute, every breath. This is not a reason to be upset?  I'm not worried about the child I was SUPPOSED TO have. I'm scared and fighting hard enough for the child I DO have- the wonderful, beautiful, intelligent, sweetling little guy who is my Joey, and his darling, intelligent, handsome, lickable brother, Andy, even though Andy does not have autism. These are my boys. My job is to help and support them, so they can be healthy, happy, educated adults. I'm the mom here.  The whole \"autistic person/person with autism\" thing is just plain idiotic, and I wish people would stop playing semantics. The hole high/low functioning thing is equally stupid. People with autism are autistic. \"HIgh functioning\" and \"low functioning\" is a guide to hich services these people may need, not whether or not they need them. My kid needs service as much as any head-banging, non-verbal, wheelchair-bound person; he just needs DIFFERENT services, because he has different issues and disabilities. He may OR MAY NOT require MORE or less service. Just because my kid doesn't need a helmet doesn;t mean he doesn't need accommodations in order to function and care for himself. This should be a battle to get everyone what they need, not fighting each other for slices of an ever-shrinking pie.  When I look at Joey, I have no need to say this is not some other child. I noticed that, oh, five years ago. Does that mean I can't be worried about him, I'm not supposed to try to help him function and be independent in the world? Because that is the signal you are sending- especially to my school admin. They take up essays like this and say, \"see? these people don't want services. They WANT to be autistic, just as they are. They don't want to be independent, employed, or functional- they think it torture!\"  Joey is NOT an alien child who landed in my life by accident. He is a human being, and he is my son, just as much as Andy is a human being, and my son. This is NOT an alien world. We are human beings on planet earth. We just need to know how to help him understand this world, just as we help Andy understand this world. And it takes Joey a little more time to process information. He IS my own kind- he is a human being, just like I am. He just needs different help, different support, different teaching methods than what I needed, or what Andy may need. He is not an \"it.\" Joey is MY SON.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/03/mourning-to-jim-sinclair.html", "title": "\nMourning: To Jim Sinclair\n"},

Milne There once was a Dormouse who lived in a bed Of delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red), And all the day long he'd a wonderful view Of geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue). A Doctor came hurrying round, and he said: \"Tut-tut, I am sorry to find you in bed. Just say 'Ninety-nine' while I look at your chest.... Don't you find that chrysanthemums answer the best?\" The Dormouse looked round at the view and replied (When he'd said \"Ninety-nine\") that he'd tried and he'd tried, And much the most answering things that he knew Were geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue). The Doctor stood frowning and shaking his head, And he took up his shiny silk hat as he said: \"What the patient requires is a change,\" and he went To see some chrysanthemum people in Kent. The Dormouse lay there, and he gazed at the view Of geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue), And he knew there was nothing he wanted instead Of delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red). The Doctor came back and, to show what he meant, He had brought some chrysanthemum cuttings from Kent. \"Now  these ,\" he remarked, \"give a  much  better view Than geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue).\" They took out their spades and they dug up the bed Of delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red), And they planted chrysanthemums (yellow and white). \"And  now ,\" said the Doctor, \"we'll  soon  have you right.\" The Dormouse looked out, and he said with a sigh: \"I suppose all these people know better than I. It was silly, perhaps, but I  did  like the view Of geraniums (red) and delphiniums (blue).\" The Doctor came round and examined his chest, And ordered him Nourishment, Tonics, and Rest. \"How very effective,\" he said, as he shook The thermometer, \"all these chrysanthemums look!\" The Dormouse turned over to shut out the sight Of the endless chrysanthemums (yellow and white). \"How lovely,\" he thought, \"to be back in a bed Of delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red.)\" The Doctor said, \"Tut! It's another attack!\" And ordered him Milk and Massage-of-the-back, And Freedom-from-worry and Drives-in-a-car, And murmured, \"How sweet your chrysanthemums are!\" The Dormouse lay there with his paws to his eyes, And imagined himself such a pleasant surprise: \"I'll  pretend  the chrysanthemums turn to a bed Of delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red)!\" The Doctor next morning was rubbing his hands, And saying, \"There's nobody quite understands These cases as I do! The cure has begun! How fresh the chrysanthemums look in the sun!\" The Dormouse lay happy, his eyes were so tight He could see no chrysanthemums, yellow or white. And all that he felt at the back of his head Were delphiniums (blue) and geraniums (red). And that is the reason (Aunt Emily said) If a Dormouse gets in a chrysanthemum bed, You will find (so Aunt Emily says) that he lies Fast asleep on his front with his paws to his eyes. I worry that Joey will grow up in a world full of Doctors. Right now, he is such a happy little dormouse, in a world bright with red and blue.

Being a parent at an IEP meeting is kind of like being a passesnger on a plane. You are part of the team inteded to result in a pleasant flight, by making sure everything is groovy, and stays groovy, from teh time you get on to the time you get off. Included in this team are the pilots, the attendants, the mechanical crews, the air trafic crontrol folks... you get the idea.  Normal, reasonable people know that when come onto the plane, you make sure your luggage fits in the overhead bins or under teh seat in front of you. If you need a seatbelt extender, you request one. You stay seated when the stay seated light is on. You ake sure smoking is not done in the bathrooms, your food and beverage choices are made reasonably, and thus the flight goes smoothly. You need to have a general idea of how the emergency exits work in case there is a problem.  However, on an IEP Flight, you as the passenger are also expected to understand how to fly the plane, serve the other passengers, and have full knowledge of how to maintain and even fix mechanical and other problems mid-flight. If an engine falls off, you're expected to know how to safely land the plane, re-attach the engine, and get the whole mess back in the air. The pilot won't set course or work the instruments unless you spefically request that s/he do so, and then often says they don't have the resources for working the controls anyway, and besides, do you really NEED to work all those buttons, levers, and gauges? Can't you see fron the windshield where you are going? When you go to find resources to help, you find a flight simulator; but you soon find it is either for an outdated cockpit, a simplified cockpit, or when you go to actually request the controls be worked properly, you are told that you just had simulator training, the pilot has had real flight time! So you try to sign up for flying lessons. Now you're told that you're still just an amateur. But they still won't work the controls unless you specifically ask them to do so, and say exactly what to do nd exactly when.  Oh, and your flight is already departing from the gate. And if you dont do all of this correctly, of course you will crash.

{"date": "Saturday, April 30, 2011", "body": "\nEmpathy. It is one of the markers people use in judging others. Does this person empathize with me? And how do I know?  Did you know that those cues for knowing how others feel, and whether they are empathizing with you or not, is culturally and socially determined? It is  not  totally universal? That the way we express emotion- or fail to express it- is also cultural?  Joey's teachers are very concerned right now about his ability to empathize. The reason is that when he is reading a book or looking at a picture, he cannot seem to communicate how the character in the book or picture feels. When asked, he often tells the teacher how he himself feels, regardless of the story or the picture.  For example, Joey was reading about  Nathan Hale , and they got to the end of the story- you know, when he is hanged by the British. They story was pretty matter-of-fact: he is taken to the gallows, regrets having one life to give for his country, and is hanged. There was an accompanying picture showing him with the rope around his neck. The teacher asked him how Nathan Hale felt.  Joey said he felt happy.  According to the teacher, this was the wrong answer, and that Joey said \"happy\" because  Joey  was happy, because reading was almost over, and so was the book.  I have another theory.  See, the problem is that Joey not only has empathy- he understands how people around him are feeling, and understands they might be feeling something different from what he himself is feeling- he also has the next step, compassion. When someone else is hurting, Joey gets upset. With a scraped knee, he knows what to do: go give the person a hug and ask if they are ok, and say comforting things. If that hurt is something more subtle, he has no idea what to do. The teacher is upset- I don't know why- what do I do? So his reaction can be unexpected.  How can he have empathy for people around him, yet seem unable to communicate empathy towards characters in books and pictures?  Well, how do  we  tell how a character is feeling? Perhaps we think about the details of the story, what we have read, and know that those things would make us feel a certain way if they happened to us. We look at the face of the person in the picture, or the way they are shown holding their bodies. We pick up on cues we have been taught to look for- scrunching eyebrows, smiles or grimaces, a look in the eyes.  We know many autistic people have trouble picking up on these cues. So how can they have empathy?  Did you see how those two sentences didn't go together? What does \"pick up on cues\" have logically to do with \"having empathy\"? Logically, there is a problem there: picking up on cues does not cause you to have empathy or not. They are two separate things entirely.  Joey is picking up on cues of some kind- he knows how people around him are feeling. Sometimes he is even hyper-sensitive to how others are feeling, and it overwhelms him- especially if he does not know how to react to those emotions or those people. My theory is that he is picking up on  different  cues than the ones we expect: ones that don't translate well into words and pictures. A still picture doesn't have a cue he uses to determine how the person is feeling. A simple set of sequential facts to relate it back to an experience he has never had (Joey has never been executed for being a spy, for example) is meaningless to him in determining how another is feeling.  But he has just been asked a question about feelings, and he knows- he has been hard-trained- that he must answer. So he gives the questioner an answer- the one that pops into his head as ready and relevant would be his own feeling.  Though with Nathan Hale, I am a little dubious. After all, the man just said he regretted he had only one life to give for his country- the logical leap that he might be happy about being executed is not a terribly gaping one for a third grader to make. I've had college students do worse.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/hale.htm"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/04/thats-your-cue.html", "title": "\nThat's your cue\n"},

Our lives were dominated by Oobi, Pinky Dinky Doo, Little Bear, Potty Power, and yellow school buses. Meltdowns were a daily thing, so much so that they went unblogged.  The contrast in those early posts between Joey and Andy was so marked- Andy could talk, Andy could interact, Andy could point. He was only two years old.  It's been a long road, and we look forward to the overgrown thicket of a road ahead. Hopefully we can improve on the pruning of the folks who blazed the trail before us.

He started off as bat boy and buddy at Joey's baseball game. He likes being included in the games. We actually gave him the option to not go, but prep for his party instead, and he chose to go help his Joey. That's our birthday boy! We gathered for cake and ice cream in the back yard after lunch. We had an awesome Darth Vader pi\u00f1ata (our theme today was Star Wars Ninja Pirates), with candy, super balls, parachute dudes and ninja dudes in it. That was hit. I am definitely doing the pi\u00f1ata thing again next year. Maybe I'll have time to make it myself, though- they're a little pricey.  Joey was the one who broke the pi\u00f1ata. It was pretty cool.  Andy decided to try the dark side out for size. Well, at least Darth's helmet and face from the pi\u00f1ata. He had spent the morning asking if he could wear it, and we kept telling him no, but we hadn't planned on it failing catastrophically. Since it did, he got to wear it after all.  So we spent an afternoon in the yard, defeating the Evil Bubbles of Doom, playing with  moon dough  (which I recommend- it is pretty cool stuff) and general hub-bub of wild playing-with-our-friends. It was pretty awesome. And I periodically punctuated the frenzy by adding more sugar.  We had ice cream sandwiches of different flavors (neapolitan was a favorite), candy in the pi\u00f1ata, and of course, cake. Andy asked for a yellow cake with chocolate icing. Nearly blew me over. He doesn't usually like chocolate. He got it, and ate it, so hey, I'm not complaining. I put the ninjas on the cake since the rest of the decor was Star Wars, with a splash of pirate tossed in. I hoped the blue marchmallow stars would be spacey enough to connect it. Who cares, it all get eaten, marshmallows being bonus. And everyone wanted a ninja.  Andy got lots of cool stuff. He still has a couple things he didn't open, but we wore him out. He'll have fun opening them in the morning.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 29, 2011", "body": "\nSummer is now in Full Swing.  Last week was Free Week 1. That means nobody had any formal anything to do. Usually I try to keep the guys super-busy, but with Joey being already out-of-sorts, I did my best to give them time to settle. We went to the  Richmond Zoo , which was A.W.E.S.O.M.E. The boys got to feed giraffes, play with free-flying parakeets, and get up close and personal with free-ranging chickens and peacocks. (Friends Who Visit, the next time you come this way, I have The Perfect Place To Go).  We also spent some time at Colonial Beach, with our good buddy the Awesome Neighbor. So far, so good.  Then my business trip was upon us and Joey started freaking out a bit. Fortunately, I knew he might, so had planned closer-to-home activities and lots of pool time. Also, we have been joined by  Evan . To make a long story short and sweet, we have my adopted brother here for the foreseeable future, which is A-OK with my boys, because they think Evan is awesome. He's been getting used to our routines and quirks.  Mom going away for two days is not a good thing for boys. We made it through, and here I be again.  Joey has a theater camp this week, designed for kids with communication and speech issues. He seems to be enjoying it. On Friday, the group will put on a play, and he seems happy. The only thing is, he has decided this week to be  Quack  instead of Joey, so I'm worried he might be a little anxious. We sign the kids in and out of the camp, and they each have their own \"coach\" as well as the adults running the programs. Joey has two coaches (he ran during orientation, so they decided to double-team him just in case). The coaches come out and take them in, then bring them out at the end. Yesterday, Joey signed himself in as Quack. Today, the coaches bid him goodbye, saying \"See you tomorrow, Quack!\" Hmmm...  Andy has been having \"Nature Camp\" at Grandma's while Joey is at theater camp. Andy's been very into the  Wild Kratts , so he seemed keen to be into nature stuff. I thought we'd be doing some wading in teh river, but he hasn't been keen on going into the woods. We had a nice nature walk on Monday, and yesterday Grandma found an awesome chemistry set so we ran some simple experiments. Today we skipped it in favor of picking out fireworks for the Fourth. He seems happy, though.  After camp, we have lunch and then go to the pool. I decided to have this routine for the summer, so that Joey could stay oriented and not freaked out like last summer. He's picked right up on it. Today, Andy needed a little sit-down before pooltime, and Joey was pretty upset. I told him to get his suit on, and I got mine on, since he likes it when I swim with him. Then I came downstairs and discovered no Joey.  Back upstairs... no Joey.  Apparently, I forgot to lock the door when I brought the fireworks in.  I popped out but didn't see him looking down the street, but that was also likely because he was behind a car or something. Awesome Neighbor's grandfather came over to tell me was, indeed, headed down the street, and was far enough along that running wasn't going to cut it (he had seen me pop out and call for Joey, so he started looking, too). I hopped in the car, and was off to catch him. He turned up a street, headed for the pool himself. When I caught up with him and asked him where he was going, he clearly said, \"The pool! It's pool time!\" So I explained that he needed a towel, and had no money for the snack bar, and they won't let him in without an adult! And he hopped right into the car, no complaints or anything.  Whew.  This might be a long summer.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.metrorichmondzoo.com/", "http://www.peepandthebigwideworld.com/", "http://pbskids.org/wildkratts/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/06/summer-update-on-us.html", "title": "\nSummer Update On Us\n"},

He still has no patience whatsoever. Ups means there will be downs. BUt I'll take the massive ups we're having. Yes, and twice on Sundays, with every down I've had.  Andy is loving himself some camp, too. He's decided he likes art better than scootering, though I think there are two main reasons for that outside of his love of art: his little ladyfriend, and being teased because his scooter isn't one of the shiny new kind. He decided he likes his scooter, but no so much the other boys who go scootering at camp. Art is more fun because the company is more fun. I know this, because we've had several talks about it. I was worried he wouldn't want his scooter after being teased about it, but he loves his scooter. He won it at the auction and painted it himself, after all. That's my boy.  So here's to summer.

{"date": "Thursday, June 16, 2011", "body": "\nWhen I was in fifth grade, the great goal of the \"gifted\" set was to be on the Safety Patrol. To wear that sash and badge and help direct the little ones to their buses was the mark of honor, the reward we got for putting up with a good deal- jibes and teasing from classmates for being nerds and curve-breakers, the scrounging of the over-acheivers and their busybody parents (helicopter parents are not as new as some would have you believe), and the work involved in learning and doing extra work that was often assigned to keep us busy. Being socially isolated on top of that, I took great pride in showing myself to be somebody by wearing that badge. I had the extra knock in fifth grade because I didn't test into the highest math group (in the tests, though every single I gave was accurate, apparently I did not do the problems quickly enough...), making me a social pariah even among the gifted group as \"not good enough.\"*  When one is doing a lot of work and getting very little reward or seeing very little use in it, little things like awards and certificates and hearing your name called can be a huge deal- especially when you are a child.  Seared into my memory is that day I was not made a patrol for a whole six weeks of the fifth grade. My whole little world was aimed at maintaining my position, perhaps to be eventually made Captain! But no, I was knocked aside- with only one B on my report card (my handwriting sucked)- for a girl with all Cs, and one who was particularly good at making it clear I was none too socially included in my class- I was too tall, too plain, too fat, and too bookish.  I remember the teacher sending me out of the room, because I actually started to cry. Did she have any idea what a disaster had befallen me? No, she had no clue. I got a lecture about how I was supposed to be so mature, how she needed this award to go to this girl who had worked so hard to get that all-C report card. How I would have this honor many times, and this might be the only chance this girl got. Oh yes, I remember. I could quote you the conversation exactly if I didn't think you'd find it boring. And I reacted like a 10-year-old might, left to pull myself together in that hall and chew on my disgrace among my peers, alone. To be honest, it still makes me tear up, that's how horrible it was. After all... I  was  ten years old. The reverberations from that disgrace actually did follow me for the rest of my school years, forever on the fringe.  At ten, I comprehended what the teacher wanted, and why this had happened. My brain processed it coldly, and still chews on it now. Someone else needed a reward. They needed something to work for. They needed a goal, a carrot before their nose. And apparently, I was undeserving of that. My work was worth nothing compared to the needs of another. My needs were not as important as another's. Clearly, my own pain was a frivolity, my own position of less worth. Why would a child who has talent need a reward for those talents?  We can, as adults, probably see clearly why that girl needed that safety patrol badge more than I did; I can already tell you who will tell me so, either in the comments or the emails I will get later, about how petty and childish it is to dwell upon that moment, or still feel it painful to do so. Certainly, that teacher did what she needed to do to help that other girl- she rose to be Captain of the Patrols (what a miserable six weeks  that  was for me), and a decent student through high school. I can sit here and reason it out and provide solid logic for it. None of that adult reasoning does anything to help a ten-year-old girl, I can tell you, especially one who was still considered new and trying to fit into social circles enough to at least not feel alone.  Joey came home today with his awards from school (we didn't go to the ceremony because he was at Mt. Vernon- he got his awards when they got back). He has certificates that say he knows multiplication 0-4, and 0-9. Woo. Hoo. He's known those for almost two years now. He had a nice Health Award, and a Most Improved Participation in Music award.  And that is what he got. No math. No reading.  Kinda makes you wonder about who gets awards and how it is determined, doesn't it? Your top math student gets no math award? What's that about? Do people not understand what powerful reinforcement these awards can be?  Trust me, I just spent a lovely twenty minutes hearing all about it. The field trip to Mt. Vernon? I had to pull teeth to get anything about it. That two other students got math awards, and he didn't? I know all about it. And I assure you, I will be giving him lots of hugs and kisses and working hard to make him understand how proud I am of him tonight. After a year like he has had, to have no recognition of his strength in math before his peers is, I know well, searing. Already being the only top math student not in the gifted program, plus being disabled with social interaction issues, is quite bad enough, without this. Add into it the  loss of the spelling bee . And after the year he's endured? Come on, let him know you are proud of his academics. It's not like its even being a patrol- all it costs you is a piece of paper. Seriously.  *And just a little fault of vindictiveness here, boy did I prove that to be a joke when I became the youngest captain of the high school math team as a  junior .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2011/06/hmmmmm-issue-of-recognition.html", "title": "\nHmmmmm...

But don't worry, I have some awesome books for him for the summer, we should be fine. The math award is more rare than the reading one, so that was pretty cool.  He also got the Good Citizenship award- the one you get when you have behaved yourself all year and been a good friend to everybody. Suspiciously, the bully we had to contend with this year also got Good Citizenship. Hmmm...  I am super-proud of my soon-to-be-second-grader.

Andy refuses to write. He will flat-out shut down completely when asked to write more than a couple of words. Homework can take us the entire afternoon. We are still behind on speech (but not as much as we were). His fine motor is rapidly deteriorating. Some of the evals we had to look at today were... well, its never good to see \"1%\" on these things (yes, folks, that's the \"first percentile\". And for those of you new to this, spot-on normal is 50%/50th percentile.) An afternoon listening to your child's deficits is never fun.  But now he is in such bad shape, since so little was done before, that he qualifies for special ed.  The good news: he'll get the support he needs, services to help him cope with sensory and handwriting-related issues, and will be more likely to be placed with teachers who understand ADHD and his needs. We'll have an IEP to back us up when we head to the next school in the fall- the one that was such a disaster for Joey. And it will be written by folks familiar with him, because IEPs are usually good for a year, especially getting one this late.  The bad news: More IEP meetings for me. Woo. Hoo.

I love listening to them play, and having their wild feet race through the house.  \n \nWhat I don't love is Joey getting completely overwhelmed by the total schedule upheaval, and melting down.  \n \nTrying to mitigate the situation, I usually stat our day by printing out a schedule for the day, which Joey is permitted to carry with him. However, there is absolutely no way that schedule can be anything remotely like, \"7:15, Get on the bus. 8:05, Arrive at school. 9 am, math class...\" See, they have a break, but like so many other working parents, I do not. On top of that, I don't do regular work. I can't just drop them off at a daycare or other structured situation, or even a corner of an office. I work 2-3 jobs every day, with varying schedule from day-to-day; so I can't even set a schedule today and have Joey understand that will be the schedule tomorrow, because it won't be.  \n \nThis piecework income production does very well in working around therapy appointments and bus schedules, but isn't very conducive to consistency when Joey is home and needs a regular schedule. We can't just stay at home and be quiet and still, as we can on winter break, when most of my jobs are also on hiatus. Running about to Grandma's is even a bit of a strain on his nerves, as the only solid warning he gets to anticipate when he will be going is basically that piece of paper he wakes up to, even when I tell him the day before and go over the schedule as best I can. Often, i don't even know where I will be until the morning. Sudden grocery stops and Walmart runs are simple when the boys are in school; these things are require huge amounts of planning and prep when they are home on break.  \n \nI also can't say he didn't need the break from work; to just keep sending him to school right now would also not really work. There have been far too many changes there, and his anxiety levels are through the roof. The sudden-para-switcheroo has also lead to a change his academic schedule, which has him thoroughly unbalanced. Now he's not only overwhelmed at home, school is also a mass of confusion and surprises.  \n \nI would love nothing better than to spend a day at home, letting both boys breathe and play in the yard as they felt the urge to jump around. I'd like to give Joey a day when he felt some semblance of control over his own life and his own time.

Dr. T was awesome.  The good news is Andy's acuity is awesome. Like, super-awesome. Yay, no glasses.  The bad news is he has inherited the family curse- his eyes don't work together. This explains some of our focus and hyperactivity issues, and our flat-out refusal to write. Imagine if you had the eyes of a chameleon- only a chameleon can control his eyes. Andy can't. It could be worse, though- he doesn't have \"lazy eye,\" a muscle that is over-strong and pulls the eye visibly out of alignment. No surgery needed, yay. The other good news is that this is now fixable with vision therapy. Another yay. Except we don't know if insurance will help with the cost yet. Boo.  Dr. T also said that although this therapy will help with his focus and thus with some of the hyperactivity, she thought him \"very active\" and so it would probably not make it entirely go away. No surprise there, either. She then went on to note what a well-behaved child Andy is. Squirmy, yes. But when he was asked to sit up, he did it. When asked to do things by me or by the doctor, he did them. He was a little angel.

I read a blog entry about a child denied a life-saving kidney transplant- from a family donor- because she is \"mentally retarded\" and \"brain damaged.\"  That is a nightmare I have all too often: that Joey might be denied medical care because someone deems him to have \"low quality of life\" because he is autistic. It is a very real and near fear. After all, we have to fight- often fight hard- for people to respect his right to an education. We had insurance that denied his right to certain therapies (fortunately, JoeyAndyDad got a new job with new insurance!). In other words, we fight every day because there are people that consider Joey to be less than human, a waste of resources, a drain on the \"system.\" Because he has a disability, there really are people in this world who consider him of less worth than... well, themselves.  I spent the afternoon in Joey's class today. It is always an experience that blends hope, amazement, pride, joy, love, and depression in measures, and comes out as something that makes me think hard about what life means, and its amazing value. I am not at liberty to divulge the variety of issues and the range of stories behind the lives of Joey's classmates, but I can tell you that each and every one of them is an incredible human being, doing things that are nothing short of miraculous. And many of the stories are, at the same time, desperately heartbreaking. And some are all the more heartbreaking because there are people who think these kids are, basically, junk to be tossed away. That anyone could look at any of these children and not see how utterly amazing they are in the face of their challenges and because of their amazing talents is just... mind-boggling. And incredibly sad. It even makes me angry to know what some of these kids go through every day, because there are people in this world who think they have no value.  That someone might deny any one of these children the right to live is something we should all actively, aggressively, and positively fight, every day, every minute. Such denial is a shameful manifestation of evil in this world. It is up to us to fight it with everything we have.  We live in a country that recognizes everyone's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Nothing in the Bill of Rights says we have to take an IQ test to have those rights.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wolfhirschhorn.org/2012/01/amelia/brick-walls/"], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/01/nightmares.html", "title": "\nNightmares\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 02, 2013", "body": "\n Potato chips are \nDuck food. Food for ducks. Duck FOOD.  \nThey will make YOU sick! \n \nProcessing is something Joey often does \"loud and proud.\" He repeats phrases and words, over and over again, rolling them over in mind and mouth and ear. He watches how you react to them. He giggles if he thinks they are funny. If you say something mean to him, or in a tone he doesn't like, I will hear it for weeks- exactly as you said it.  \n \nThis is advanced echolalia.  \n \nOften when new caretakers and therapists meet Joey, they ask why he is not diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. I believe this question is rooted in a basic ignorance of autism, and of Asperger's Syndrome. As is not just \"an autistic who speaks.\" Not all kids with \"classic\" autism are non-verbal. Being verbal doesn't immediately relegate you to the title \"Pervasive Developmental Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified\" (PDD-NOS). These labels aren't about functioning or not functioning. They are often connected to how and why these kids learn about communication and its uses, what ways they try to socialize and communicate, and yes, how successful they are in various ways of coping with the world around them. The blurring between labels is why the new DSM is going to umbrella various terms under \"autism spectrum\" instead of keeping them as separate diagnoses.  \n \nThe hallmark of Asperger's Syndrome is the development of language that is recognizable as \"in the normal range\" by neurotypical benchmarks. Joey does not have this. Yes, he speaks. We have worked very hard to help him learn to communicate in a world dominated by people who are not autistic. He has become pretty decent at using the tool to communicate. But his speech is not \"normal.\" His ways of considering the world around him and processing it are all his own. And often, it is rooted in a connection between words, phrases, and emotions, which he can then piece together into recognizable language when needful. Whereas Temple Grandin talks about \"thinking in pictures\", I think Joey on many levels \"thinks in phrases.\" When he is presented with a communication opportunity, he spins through words and phrases he's heard before, how they were used, what labels to put into them. He picks the ones he thinks he will be useful, stitches them together, and out they come.  \n \nEvery time Joey speaks, he takes a risk. Will these be the words I needed to respond? Is this was they were expecting?  \n \nIt makes answering questions a horrible, awesome, overwhelming task. First, you have to process the question itself. What are these words saying? Do we have similar words we can process and are \"on file\"? What kind of response is expected? Do we have similar situations we can use to help? Then we have to process out an answer- which may be unique in context and wording. We have only a few familiar words in the question to attach meaning, and to find in our \"files\" matching expected and appropriate responses. It doesn't matter if he understands what he just read, or saw, or heard. The question is a separate processing task, unrelated, isolated, and with so much going in that it exponentially increases the risk and energy to respond.  \n \nSpeaking requires a great deal of energy. You can imagine what a test might do to Joey. How can you evaluate someone's understanding of concepts when it is all they can do to process the evaluation tool itself?  \n \nYet Joey knows what is expected. So he keeping playing with the words, the phrases, bouncing them about his mind, his mouth, his ear. He keeps trying, and trying, and trying.  \n \nAnd then we wonder why he's so anxious and frustrated all the time.

I've been thinking about what we've seen, what progress we've made, what regression we've seen, and why we have been both successful and... not so much.  \n \nMost of all, I've been thinking about Joey's stress.  \n \nI think most people understand that too much stress breaks down anybody's ability to function, including learning. If we don't address the stress, anything else we do will fall apart. That's the first and foremost reason for almost everything I can think about for Joey's IEP: a setting that reduces stress.

He's delighted. He can now process out all the words he can digest, whenever he feels like it.  \n \"Vain. Say, 'vain.' To think well of oneself. Or to be useless. Mommy, say, 'vain.'\" \nOne of the good things about the program is that it is not spelling-only; it actually pushes kids to improve their vocabulary, to broaden their use and understanding of language.

He now has whole sentences to echo, not just the word itself.  \n \n \"Slay. To kill violently. Slay means 'to kill.' You slayed me, Mommy!\" \n Interestingly, he is also not always right. He's having trouble with phrases such as \"in vain\"- which seems to him oddly unrelated to the word \"vain.\" Separating the two is very difficult for him.

I think World Autism Day is a great idea. When I started this blog  oh-so-long-ago , it was mostly because I didn't want other parents to feel as lost, confused, and afraid as we did when we discovered that all those quirks Joey had meant he was having trouble navigating the world. We had just learned one of many important lessons in our lives: that autism and disability aren't scary. Joey is who he is, and we love him no matter what labels are used to describe him. In other words, there might be reason to get prepared, to be concerned, to think and research and collaborate... but there was nothing to fear.  Far too many parents are left to make decisions in the face of the fear of the unknown. They are handed a diagnosis, smacked with the idea that their child has more challenges before him or her than those parents might have expected, and no information for how to deal with the news, or to help their child.  We are also on the brink of another challenge: discussing with Joey what autism is, and what it means. Although we don't hide Joey's autism- not even from him- that doesn't necessarily means he understands it. At the end of our IEP meeting today (how's THAT for celebrating World Autism Day?) we were already started to discuss strategies for middle school. We have a year to prepare. Getting Joey to understand himself so he can be better prepared to self-advocate and help us help him is part of that important transition process to the world of middle school (a world that presents special challenges to everyone, autistic or otherwise).  One of the ways we prepare is to read about our friends who have older children, who are themselves going through these transitions and changes, and sharing parenting experiences with other parents. We coming into a moment where it may be useful for Joey to form his own understanding of himself and the part autism plays in who he is, possibly through connecting with other autistic people. We don't know how much of his self-identity will include autism, if any; but sharing experiences with others who have an inkling of how you think makes a huge difference- a lesson I remember from my own middle school and high school years.  So we are glad today to join in the celebration of our friends, our family, all those who understand or want to understand Joey and how he experiences the world. Without autism, Joey would not be Joey.

So honestly, when we had a dentist appointment on Monday that required me to pick him up from school, I wasn't surprised to hear he had a bad day. He had been anxious about the appointment when I put him on the bus. Specials (art) had been shaky. He bolted at lunch when there was some confusion about his lunch money account and was initially denied milk. Not just a run-to-safety bolt, a blind-panic bolt, made worse by folks who don't yet understand you have to block him and distract him with a person he trusts while you block the door, rather than chasing him (and scaring him more).  He was clearly anxious as I got him to the car and went to get Andy; repeating comfort phrases and air-writing.  To make things even worse, we are not in our proper car; my van is being worked on, so we are in the small car. The good thing about the small car is that the back doors have child locks. The bad thing is that the windows do not.  On our way to the dentist, Joey insisted on putting his hands out the window. This may seem harmless, but it is very dangerous, and we were coming to a point in the ride where he could have gotten hurt- so I asked him to roll up his window.  Silly me.  The world instantly stopped turning, swirled through space, and crashed on Route 1. Screaming ensued. I tried to reach back and roll the window up myself, to have my hand slammed against the crank by his knee. Ouch. I had to pull over to try, as the light turned green, and was greeted with more screaming and now he was hitting my arm while slamming my hand with his knee. I got the window up. He instantly rolled it back down. We had three rounds of this. Explaining the danger? Useless. Offering token reward? Useless. Raising my voice? Oh, totally wrong. Total meltdown. But the window was now up, and he was still in his seatbelt, so I got the car back in drive and made it on time for our dentist appointment.  Joey stomped in before me, and announced to all and sundry that his mother did not respect him anymore, and he hated her. Also, that his mother should stop hitting him, because it was mean. I sat down with Andy and managed not to cry.  Then, out popped Joey's favorite hygienist. It is a huge credit to the staff at our dentist office that everyone was being just as sweet as could be, and taking the whole situation very lightly. They are kind of used to Joey. But there was positive giggling when this lady popped out with a cheerful, \"Joey Guyton! It's your turn!\" and it was like a switch had been flipped.  Joey grinned. He stopped yelling and stomping. He said, \"Hello! How are you? I am fine! I am happy to see you!\" and went on back to get his teeth cleaned as if it were a much-anticipated treat, calm and smiley as you please. He emerged half an hour later with a big smile and very clean teeth, as if nothing had ever been amiss. Some days, there is nothing to fear but fear itself.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/03/onoff-switch-anxietys-funny-ways.html", "title": "\nOn/Off Switch: Anxiety's Funny Ways\n"},

But I especially needed to run outside and cover my electric lawn mower with a tarp, because, hello! It is spring! It rains! And it started to. (Good news- I did manage to cut my grass a few days ago. I just failed to put the lawn mower back into the shed, because a bunch of crap I had shoved in the shed to protect from the snow that never arrived fell over as I pulled the mower out. And you know what a pain that is.) So I dashed outside to save my mower, since I have already killed one, and being the distractible give-a-mouse-a-cookie type, I noticed the sandbox I bought last year has completely deteriorated (what do you mean, composite is supposed to last forty years? It didn't make it six months!), and the new one (ok, its a wood vegetable bed, sue me) is still in the car. The plot where it belongs is scattered with the remnants of plastic box, plastic sand toys that got left out, sand, and lots of weeds. So I decided those weeds should go before I put efforts into cleaning the plastic shards up and putting up the new box, even though it was raining. Lightly.  So I reach down, grab a good handful of weeds, and pull.

{"date": "Saturday, March 10, 2012", "body": "\nSo in the swirl of life, special needs, IEPs, and spring springing boing boing boing, we are discovering that among Andy's issues, the child can't see. His eyes do not converge to focus. We'll get to see what it looks like Monday (there is some confusion about whether it is THIS Monday or NEXT Monday, but it's coming), but in the meantime, its been explained to us that he basically can't see anything in a strip about 12 inches wide, six inches to either side of the middle. You know, where you would look to do things like read. Or write. Or, well, anything in front of you. He can't focus there.  We have no idea how he has trained himself to cope with this issue, but he has. After all, it is the way he has always seen, and people expected him to be able to read and write. So he learned to do it. As far as we can figure, he uses a lot of peripheral vision and approximating based on the blurry mess that is in front of him. No wonder he gets so frustrated with reading an writing, though! Apparently, he has gotten through so well because he is a clever little fellow.  The answer will be vision therapy, which will basically reprogram his brain and his eyes so that they work together and converge properly. After that, he will need to be completely retaught to read and write. The good news is that his frustration level will go down, so we should see some alleviation of attention deficits- then he can channel all his awesome energy levels into relearning these skills, and getting back to speed at school.  We now have his IEP in place. It was a little odd putting together the powerpoint, because it looked eerily like the one we made for kindergarden, when we were told all these issues did not require an IEP. Same issues. Just two years later, with a new label- \"dysgraphia.\" You know, if they had listened to me two years ago, and looked into this properly, we wouldn't be needing services now. But that's now water escaped under the bridge, I can't take it back. Here we begin.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2012/03/life-with-andy.html", "title": "\nLife With Andy\n"}
